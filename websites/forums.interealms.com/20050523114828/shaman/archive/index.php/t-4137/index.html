I know there are a million of these threads and I know you guys get tired of answering them but you are the most imformed group of people about this class and your imput would be much appeciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your level and race will help people give you specific advice.<br />
<br />
You look like a pretty well balanced pre-velious quest armour shaman to me. Boots and maybe cloak are the slots that stick out for being a bit too far on the side of wis if you're determined to loose some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely a fine set of gear choices.  :)<br />
<br />
If you think you're a little wisdom-heavy, here are the substitutions I'd make:<br />
<br />
Replace the coldain boots with JB (nice profit here, too)<br />
Replace the acrylia cloak an Ancient Seahorse cloak (ac 20, +25 hp, around 3k)<br />
<br />
You don't have your waist spot listed- but keep your eyes open for the chitinous belt (nice stats, 13 AC, +4 wis I think)<br />
<br />
Shoulder spot isn't listed... but if you've lizardscale, replace it with at least a tattered mantle.  Chokidai spaulders are the next upgrade, then (if you can wear them) imbued granite OR the Obulus death shroud.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dunno about your budget, so I'll make some suggestions based on an assumption that you have moderate resources.<br />
<br />
Others will really disagree with me on this, but imho the only regen worth wearing is a fungi.  I'd sell the ikky bp &amp; get a barbed ringmail for the extra HP / AC.<br />
<br />
I'd swap those boots for jaundiced bone at a minimum.  Velious quest boots are good, Barbed Dragonscale boots have nice ac &amp; hp, Tribal Warboots have some wis and other stats, moderate ac (12) a little HP and a bunch of resists. <br />
<br />
The next real upgrade to your various JB pieces is Thurg/Kael/SS quest armors depending on your alliances and the capability of your guild / friends.<br />
<br />
For the neck I'd say your collar is ok, but you might want to look for a clattering bone necklace (drops in the grey or in the bazaar for a couple kpp).<br />
<br />
The cloak could be replaced by just about anything with more AC - if you want to maintain your wis, look for a dragonwing cloak (best one you can afford). A hiero cloak is an awesome choice for HP, mana, moderate AC and +4 to all stats.  Lodi shield is also good if you have the budget for it or the ability to try to camp the turtle.<br />
<br />
For the leg slot, I'd look into dragonleg breeches (again, get the best quality you can afford).  If you have the ability to get them, gladiator chain legs and kromriff military legs are both decent until you can get your hands on better.  Barbed ringmail are good, but fairly uncommon and somewhat expensive.<br />
<br />
Those rings are fine, but you might want to swap a shadel bandit ring in if you get an opportunity - not worth buying or going out of your way for it though, imho.<br />
<br />
Shoulder options are include elder wolf hide (10ac wis + hp), ODS (wis + ac + mana efficiency), dragonwing mantle (ac, mana &amp; HP)(reinforced or better), death watcher's shroud (nice AC, sta, wis hp, mana &amp; resists).  IGS are good if you can wear them, but personally I'd probably still go for one of the other ones that I listed.<br />
  <br />
A really good upgrade for your face slot is a death mask of the elysians, otherwise the spider eyes are good for quite a while.<br />
<br />
For bracers, the most obvious upgrade is a JBB.  If you want wis/ac combo a dragonhorn bracer is good (yet again, get the best you can afford).  The wisdom and or stamina bracers from Umbral Plains are also very nice, but are pricey.  Otherwise, I'd look towards velious quest armor for these slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DSX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi, Thanks for all the replys<br />
I updated my Waist and shoulder slot. It was late when I was inputing and must have just looked over them.</div></div><hr />
