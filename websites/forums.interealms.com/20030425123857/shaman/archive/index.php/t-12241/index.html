<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spirithunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to the Vegas Fan Faire this past weekend and during the panel discussion I brought up alchemy.  First I thanked them for removing the negative effects from the potions, then asked if they would/were considering making potions right clickable like armors and weapons, so that they would show what the potion does exactly.  Their answer was yes, it is being worked on and that it won't show the exact stat, ie:  +10 to str, +10 to sta.  But it would show what stats or effect it has and the duration of the potion.  I believe this will aid us considerably in selling the potions that are not commonly known to the rest of the players.<br />
