<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tannin Steelblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dearest Guild members and friends of the game, <br />
<br />
<br />
Today Tannin Steelblade, born May 9th 1999, has been laid to rest in his home town of quenos.  The Lord Protector Lewz Hopeblade granted his long time friend his final request to be laid to rest in the home where he came from. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so i stink as a writer but what i have to say here comes from all honesty and love.  As many of you really smart folk may have seen i have not been around in quite sometime.   Game politics? nope,, the drama,, nay   Human warriors not being voted the best looking warriors.. well maybe.. gah naa..   I have come to the point that everquest has offered me all that i wanted it to.  Since the release of the planes of power i got to thinking .. ok when will it be enough.  I sit in a chair and play something i love meanwhile i never see my family, smoke way to much, and get bigger and bigger ..  i digress.  Each of those issues can not be blamed on everquest but i feel there is more to life now that i am getting older.  Hopefully marriage and children... ok scrap the kids but traveling back to the places i have been before would be great and spending more time with family is always good.  Ok i am mumbling.<br />
<br />
To Rizz   I just want to thank you for giving me the pleasure of being a part of the most fun loving guild on the server.  Being able to tackle somewhat big critters while still maintaining a democratic leadership is no easy feat.  I have always respected the way to lead and was damn proud to follow you.  ( oh and btw.. yes those girs up there were doing lap dances)<br />
<br />
To Lewz,   whom some of ya might have known as Gandahar before the evil euro maffia scared him into hideing and made him change his name.   Thank you for always giving me hope that an everyday joe can get the really Phat lewtz if ya hang out in the market long enough :)   But mostly for the great conversations we had about life, guitars, women, and smashing your head through a coffee table .. i still dont know how ya lived through that one.  Salute my friend keep the tradition alive for me  BUD.<br />
<br />
And to Tari   Without a doubt the kindest and most loving of anyone i have ever met in this game.  The only thing greater than your playing ability is the the size of her heart.  This girl has gave me a ear to talk to i cant count the times about all my woes and conserns and problems.  I have gave it serious thought tari and this is the best move for me in my life.  Please watch out over the others like you did with me.. hell you may end up accheving world peace the way your going.. i am gunna miss you hon no matter what illusion ya take.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are so many good memories of my years with KoE and before that i can bring up, people i met and spent time with and cybered with,, i wont tell anyone wulf.   Please dont think any less of me if i left you out of my closing remarks.. shoot a name at me and i will come up with something good i swear.  Well .. then there is Hammerstalker.. ya still owe me for the superbowl game buddy :)   I sent you that hooked on phonics number by number edition so ya learn what 3 points means hehe.. no hard feelings man.  I know i might not share all peoples opinions but you and Toke and Aranuil were always good in my book.. you cats take care ok.<br />
<br />
Klydon, Zelf, Jlove, Blumgan, Knarlz,, and the old Elite crew  Bem, Mawa , Coatie, X box,  the list goes on and on.. thank you for making the adventure the most pleasureable it could be.  I have set out to do the things i wanted to do.  And being part of Keepers was the most fun.<br />
<br />
I have never been very good at this sorta thing.. but know now that this time is here .. it is final   Tannins body was laid to rest at around 9:30 CST at the gates of quenos.  In short i am leaving the body to rot.  I have given Lewz my RBB to give back to the guild so you can use it wisely.  the rest of my gear is on him for all to see.  So if you have time and would like to maybe pay a final respect or 2   he is there .. deep down I really hope he leaves the world being thought of fondly.  I tried to be a good player.  Damn it Lewz i am starting to cry again.  This is so friggin hard.  Ya know what my favorite part of everquest was?  It was that moment ya logged in and the full screen came up.  It was my love opening up for me to an almost endless amount of possibilities.  That moment .. that second  you feel imortal to a certan extent.  I am gunna miss that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will leave ya some info incase any of you want to ever contact me and fill me in on what cool new things are happening.. <br />
<br />
Tannin@spacestar.net<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to miss you guys.. more so than ya think.  Tannin will never be played by another rest asured of that .. well my tannin anyway.. well at least that name opened up for someone heh.. Which reminds me   If anyone wants Blisto .. Email me   i am sure a 56 druid in pretty damn good gear is usefull to someone.  Let me know<br />
<br />
Join swords forever guys, it was truely an honor serving together.  Keep shooting for the stars and tearing them a new black hole.   Good bye my family <br />
<br />
Love always<br />

We have had some great times - and those will never be forgotten.<br />
<br />
Walk the walk, and talk the talk my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jason, somehow the lands of Norrath will be diminished greatly with your leaving the game. I have many fond memories of hunting with you when you made your return to EQ after the accident.<br />
You will be missed my friend. <br />
GL with all your future endeavours (canadian spelling) and stay in touch.<br />
<br />
Your friend Jeff</div></div><hr />

Good luck in life, Jason, and I hope to talk to you again in the future.</div></div><hr />

And may you be in heaven half an hour, <br />
Before the devil knows your dead.&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lewz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tannin.. you made this game alot more fun for me over the years..<br />
My favorite moments of it is back when we where in The Elite Force and doing our 6 man raids :) (Im still pissed off at ya for winning that hammerhead helm in Kedge.. I was supposed to have the best gear bastage!!) and all the arguments we used to have in guild chat wich always ended with Rone getting pissed because we where using really bad language :D. I must say that Norrath has become a much duller place now that you are not around anymore and you will be sorely missed... <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for all the years of fun and game and i hope you have a great RL.<br />
<br />
Oh and one last thing...<br />
<br />
BUD BUD BUD :)<br />
<br />
You will be hearing from me....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Coatlicue Tlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What a sad, sad day for all of us in Norrath.  I almost don't know what to say *gasp*...<br />
<br />
You have been missed, and you will be missed.  I have known you since almost my first days in EQ... and I have always looked up to you and respected you incredibly -- still do, hon.  Part of my reasoning for chosing to be a part of KoE was because of you, Bemidian, Razma, FU (all the old elite crew) coming here.  Never a mean word or attitude has ever come from you, and you always treated your fellow guildmates and players with the utmost respect.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the smiles, the laughs, and the wonderful times in EQ.  Meeting you after 2 years was the icing on the cake, and it will be something I will cherish always.<br />
<br />
Take care of yourself, and keep in touch.  Grasp those moments in life and seize the day!  <br />
<br />
*HUGS* to you, and always know that we love you so much!!<br />
<br />
/salute<br />

much love,<br />

This day will come to us all.  I sincerely wish you well in your journey outside of Norrath, and may life bring you success and happiness in all your endeavors.<br />

If you find your way back to EQ, after getting back to doing the things you want to do as I did, your friends will always be here for you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow. I remember when Tannin got that helm. Mercy that really takes me back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll always remember the fun the Warriors of the guild used to have on our late night raids.  Those bring back many memories :)<br />
<br />
I hope you find RL as fun and exciting as I have bro, take care.</div></div><hr />

It is always sad to see someone you have know for so long in EQ leave.  You will be missed!  I know we will all move on someday but it still saddens me to say goodbye to someone. <br />
Good luck in your RL I wish you the best.<br />

<br />
Welcome back to the real world hehe,I had some great times with you all over Norrath.I really hope and somehow know you will enjoy the freetime that appears when you leave EQ.<br />
<br />
Im glad I was there to meet and play with a truly honorable person as you were.1 of my fondest memories was being summoned by the Queen and living for about 15 secs fighting her solo which helped keep her from healing,(the next person summoned when I died managed to kill her before he died) and you got your epic.That was a honor to be there for you after all you did for everyone.<br />
<br />
You will be missed bro, have fun in RL).<br />
