<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sinrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Topic says it all.  Last night I was in Miragul on an assassination mission.  Things didn't go very well.  Two members couldn't get into the dungeon, so they figured it was because they hadn't gotten the stone yet and went back to their hometowns to get them.  Doh!  :mad: So we started the adventure with just 4 people and me as only person who can heal at all (300hp heals downright suck at 43).  We were doing well with just the 4 of us til we got to some casters.  Each caster was doing enough damage to us that we needed some downtime after a couple to ragain mana.  Then we pop open a chest that encumbers and poisons everyone.  Nasty NASTY poison that took 2 counteract poisons to cure.  I only got it off on me and the warrior.  The SK and ENC died (Enc died mostly cuz I accidentally targeted his pet with the F4 key instead of him for healing  :mad: )  <br />
<br />
Once they got back, we plodded on some more.  The two who failed to get in got back and figured out how to get in the dungeon, but one had to leave almost immediatley for RL matters.  Anyway, all this led us to be about 10 mobs away from the target when time expired.  Me and the ENC convinced everyone to stay and finish for the lesser reward.  The Overchief we had to kill easily had 4 times the hp of all the other mobs in the dungeon and ended up being a close fight cuz he added when we were killing 2 other mobs (thank goodness for mez).  Guess what the lesser reward was?  1 ONE frickin point for the guy who had the killshot! Nothing for anyone else.  How crappy is that?<br />
<br />
Guess this is more of a rant, but shouldn't everyone get at least something as the lesser reward?  I'm not saying it should be 20 or 30 points, but why not at least 5 or 10 for everyone involved?  I /feedbacked it and encourage anyone else who's had the same experience to do the same.  <br />
<br />
/rant off I guess  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know what the full reward would have been for such a mission, but I got a lesser reward in an all 65s group last night, which was 13 points, where a successful mission would have been 51 points. That's around 1/4. That didn't seem too bad then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also - don't open the chests until after you finish the adventure.  It appears that the great majority will hurt you, slowing you down.  go back and open them after time has run or your adventure is finished.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sinrin,<br />
<br />
I agree completely.  I came here to post a similar rant.  To keep it short, myself, 51 shaman, and a well rounded group of mid 50's (levels ranged from 51-56) went on a collection adventure where we had to get 24 invasion plans.  Well, like many pick-up groups, we got a slow start as a couple of members were doing this for the first time and we needed a few pulls to get into a grove.  30 min into it, we were doing well but knew we had to pick up the pace.<br />
<br />
1 hour into it we only had about 14 of 24 items.  We again picked up the pace but time expired (initial 90 min) as we got drop 20.  So we decide we can complete easily by getting another 2 drops in the extended 30 min period.  Which we do, and get a whopping 4pts apiece!<br />
<br />
Granted, if we had to do over we could have finished within the 90 minutes had we gotten a faster start.  However, our average group level was around 53-54, we did not have any deaths and must have cleared the majority of the zone.<br />
<br />
Although we were happy to get a partial &quot;win&quot;, the low exp, lousy loot (only got one item of note, an augmentation piece with +5 int which the Enchanter looted) and 18pp each once we divided the spoils.  This was after 1:45 of intense fighting, most of the time at low mana and hp.<br />
<br />
Was it worth it, honestly, no.  It was fun, but I can have fun in a pick up group in KC, Dulak, or even DoT and get much better exp and loot.  I would really like to hear other's experiences with the point rewards.  It may become evident that doing the extended session is not worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Please post your experience with point rewards for both fully successful and partially successful adventures.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Baz4 is correct. Avoid chests until you finish. The only ones that you can be fairly sure of opening without messing up the adventure are the ones bouncing around. Those are filled with lesser creatures, light blues as opposed to the dark blue regular mobs that have been in every dungeon so far.<br />
<br />
EDIT: BAH! Spelling errors!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah, that's the first thing you learn, don't open chests until after you complete the mission.  You don't have time to be cursed or poisoned or drunk, you need to do the mission.  <br />
<br />
I'd say it does suck sometimes with relying on everyone in the group to be 1) present, 2) able to play their character, and 3) not a complete dip****.<br />
<br />
I've only done two missions so far tho, so not a really big expert.  I did em both in MM, one hard setting, one normal.  Passed both easily.  Normal one was silly easy, I main healed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lesser reward is still greater than no reward. We really search for things to complain about don't we? If the loot is better elsewhere go there, if the xp is better somewhere else go there, if your group members have RL things and you don't like it don't group with them again.<br />
<br />
The negative comments coming out of this expansion now are really beginning to make me laugh. It is really amusing that people are getting pickup groups together and then complaining about it. It is like the rest of the game has shut down and this is all there is.<br />
<br />
I failed in a mission last night by a mob or two. We screwed up on a pull and got 5 causing a wipe. We then realized we had bound all over the place and in our haste to complete once we got back there we almost wiped again. Finally we ran out of time just short of the lesser reward and got booted out.<br />
<br />
So what? We had fun, we had an awesome face mask drop, we learned a lot, and we will go back just to make sure we complete that adventure.<br />
<br />
It isn't hard to screen prospective group members and gain assurance that they have 2.5 hours free. Of course some things come up and people have to leave but there are not that many things that arise out of the blue. Just tell people when you get together that you expect the entire group to remain until the timer expires. If they can't commit then respectfully ask them not to participate.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed the pre-release moaners still crying that Shaman are just not needed in this expansion..... could that be that slowers are almost as important as crowd controllers (enchanters rock in this expansion) and with mana being key the shaman canni ability is really shining. Who knows.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sinrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lesser reward is still greater than no reward. We really search for things to complain about don't we? <br />
<br />
Not to deflate this argument at all, but did you read the lesser reward we got?  I had no problem failing the mission, I had a lot of fun working a dungeon with 4 people when it was created for 6 and all the other stuff.  Exp wasn't even that bad... I think I got 2 yellow of 43 while inside.  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to find things to complain about, but it just seemed bugged or something that only 1 person got 1 point for the lesser reward.  That basically means the rest of us could have just gone and ****ed around for that last half hour and gotten the same reward.  It just doesn't seem right to me.<br />
<br />
Sinrin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You didn't deflate the argument at all. You still got xp from killing things and 1 person got 1 point for a failed mission. The rest of you got nothing. You failed the mission, so why should you get anything? The parameters were &quot;assassinate mob x within 90 minutes from zoning in&quot;. So, you did it in 120 minutes and for that the killshot gained 1 point. That is 1 point that didn't need to be granted.<br />
<br />
Is it less of a reward? Yes<br />
Is it more than nothing? Yes<br />
<br />
Is there anything at all that you can complain about being unfair? NO<br />
<br />
If you don't like the lesser reward in future I would suggest you simply zone out the next time you see the flashing &quot;failed&quot; appear. The only issue there is that you will then have to look around the expansion for something else to come here and complain about.<br />
<br />
EDIT: to add comment:<br />
<br />
Sinrin, I do not directly mean to flame you here, I just don't think that the complaint is justified. I speak from the experience of having a 50/50 win/loss ratio. While I wish I had gained points from the losses I still don't feel that I was owed any. I do expect to get them from wins and I will continue to try and win. Any lesser reward will simply be a bonus as far as I am concerned. 1 point does appear to be a very small amount, I just can't get myself upset about it in the slightest........ perhaps if it happens to me I will feel different, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sinrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have you let the 90 min expire yet Karshak?  It clearly says in the failure statement that the mission can be finished for a lesser reward.  Therefore the parameters are &quot;finish the mission in 120 mins for any reward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, it still is a reward, and yes, it is more than nothing.  Maybe I'm wrong to think that only getting 1 point for the whole group is outta whack.  I just think at least everyone should've gotten the 1 point so everyone gets some kind of reward.<br />
<br />
I think I'll be a bigger man than you and not post anything about your last comment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what would you get for doing that mission normally?  On my level 34, I only got 3 APs for a WIN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, we didn't let it expire, it just kind of did it on its own. We then missed the 30 min extension which sucked. <br />
<br />
But I didn't cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not a complaint, not crying, just questioning the logic of the reward system.  1 point for the group, when a 90 min win would have probably been around 60-75 pts for the group (my estimate) seems to be off, way off.<br />
<br />
If a partial or extended win is 1/4 the points for a normal win, then Sinrin's group would have gotten 4 pts total, or less than 1 a piece for a complete win, that makes no sense to me.<br />
<br />
I got 4 last night on an extended duration win.  If that means I would have gotten 16 for winning within 90 min, then I still question the point system.  A group averaging lvl 65 gets 51 pts for a success in normal mode.  My group averaged lvl 53, granted I expect less of a reward, but 16 pts is only 31%, yet our level average is 82% of the level 65 groups.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I know things in EQ are not linear, however, I would hope that everyone would want a fair and logical point distribution system, for all levels of play.<br />
<br />
My main purpose for the post is to get additional info on what folks have been rewarded so I can better understand how the system works.  That way I can decide whether to do the 30 min extension, when the opportunity presents itself, or whether I'm better off playing in another zone.<br />
<br />
Not whining or crying, trying to get knowledgeable so I can make informed decisions and not be totally ignorant.<br />
<br />
Thanks All,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ahh.  what I love is that I actually get a chance to push myself in a normal group type setting and see what's the max dmg I can do versus the time that it takes to get that mana back.  I've done 5 total adventures and have seen some different outlooks from both of them.  I did one yesterday before our raids, and I was with a cleric guildee and four other members of a guild, and only one of them was level 65.  Being in time gear, it was different being with them cause mana was always an issue with them and we even had to stop for a few min once to get some back.  Overall the adventure to collect whatever took about 80 min.  Some of that time, I spent pulling mobs and soloing them while the rest of the group was medding.  After we finished raiding that night, I went out in a guild group, and we did another collection mission and managed to clear the entire area in about 40 min, collecting all reports and only had one mob that was still up when we TLd out (was our tanks pet)<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point is that this was just fun.  It didn't matter to us how long it took to finish, we were just having fun.  In my guild group, I spent most of the fight around 80m, scouted ahead and pulled up to three mobs at once.  With the other group, I was pushing myself as far as I could, and spent most of the time around 35m, never at full health, but always having at least 1 mob on me up to 3.  But, I had a good time in both of them, and that's what this is about.<br />
<br />
If you want exp, then go to Bot or wherever you exp.  If you want loot, then not every adventure will have named (remember.. the collection missions won't ever have any named.. or at least they haven't from what I've seen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1 point for succeeding in the extended time limit? That's just insulting;<br />
like tipping your bartender a penny. I certainly hope this is just a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;If&quot; only 1 point was awarded it is certainly low, however I think it would be good if they just dropped the whole extended time period anyway.<br />
<br />
Then folks could move on to the next complaint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pinepath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The amount of points you get drops very fast, as you drop down in levels from L65.  If you get 1/4 of the reward, it's possible that the guy that got one point would have gotten 4 from success, and everyone else was low enough the reward rounded down to zero.<br />
<br />
They should probably make it a minimum of 1 pt for consolation success for anyone who gets more than 1 pt in the first place for normal success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With a lvl 20 avg group ( took the Rogue out for a spin ), we rushed through the Wind Bridge to try and extract Initiate Helenas.  With just an sk, a rogue, a shaman, and a cleric, we made it all the way down to her...having fought up to four mobs at once, disarming traps, and taking a dead end.  As we start to lead her back, we looked at our timer...<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE FAILED THE ADVENTURE!!<br />
<br />
..So, since we have her in tow, might as well finish, since all that must be done is to take her back to the entrance.  We do so fairly quickly...another four minutes tops.  And our reward?<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
That's right....we were all confused.  I came back later and /petitioned it thinking something was wrong.  A GM contacted me shortly there after ( which is a first for me ) and explained that at lvl 20, we would have only received 1pt for a WIN...and with the current formula, a &quot;lesser reward&quot; was less than 1, and as such, not given.<br />
<br />
My advice...<br />
<br />
For a fun time, decent xp at low lvl and some pp, do an adventure.<br />
<br />
For AP, wait until at least lvl 40 before trying to take LDoN on.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend of mine, somewhere between 34-41 (I didn't ask specifics), got a grand total of 2 points, for a success!  Even I was going &quot;What?!&quot; when, at 65, I get 51, at ~37 ... she got a whopping 2 ... TWO.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it should be 1 point per level. So a level 40 would get 40 points, a 65 would get 65 points ... not a level 65 getting 51 points and a mid-high 30s/low 40s getting a whopping 2.  Talk about losing incentive if you get a whole 2 points for succeeding at that low a level.<br />
<br />
Even if it involved raising the merchant cost some to make up for it, so be it, but 2 whole points for a mid-30s adventure almost seemed like a waste of time.  Fun or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed...even the GM I spoke with said they will eventually need to re-work the point system.<br />
<br />
Now let's just hope &quot;eventually&quot; is within the next few months, and I'll be a happy cursing shaman. :D</div></div><hr />
