Thumbs-up to Nvidia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah I wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh well, this is a $3000 computer, based on an inferior chipset, with a couple of $2500 monitors.  If they claim a retail price of $16,000 that paintjob must be worth $8,000. Or maybe the hours of gaming tutorial is priced at $1,000 an hour consulting rates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">* Special NVIDIA® GeForce™ FX 5950 graphics processing unit running at 510MHz/1GHz core clock frequencies <br />
<br />
* Special, highly-overclockable AMD Athlon® 64 FX 51 processor <br />
<br />
* Four Hitachi 7K2 250GB hard drives for a total of one terabyte of storage capacity <br />
<br />
First off... the video card..<br />
<br />
Normal FX5950 has... (~$450)<br />
+ 475MHz core clock <br />
+ 475MHz memory clock <br />
<br />
This FX5950 (non-purchasible version) has...<br />
+ dual 510MHz core clock<br />
+ 1020Mhz memory clock<br />
<br />
since first one is 8x stream.. FX5950 must be 16x stream... making it the fastest graphic card for i686...  well worth over $3000 alone since the graphic card bit worse than this, Quadro FX3000G is $3000.<br />
<br />
Second the HD.<br />
Hitachi 250GB is $291.00 per...<br />
so 4 in RAID = $1164<br />
<br />
Third the CPU.<br />
Normal AMD Athlon® 64 FX 51 1MB cache is ~$750<br />
but this isnt 1MB L2 cache version...  making the CPU double/quadruple its value...<br />
<br />
those three alone would put the computer at well over $6000.<br />
then i'm guessing the Motherboard is ~$500.  Memory (probably the best of the best in 4GB size) ~$500.<br />
<br />
well in all I think NVIDIA offered the most since the video card is insane..<br />
1GHz mem clock?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">but anywho.. only rich professional graphic designers would invest in that computer i bet.<br />
<br />
1TB RAID HD + card better than FX3000G...  /drool<br />
<br />
it makes my FX 1000 (~$800) look like P.O.S.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U n I have something in common :)<br />
<br />
My cousin and I went to Shin-Sang-Do? elementary with one of em i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fubah,<br />
<br />
the regular fxFX5950 is clocked at 475/950.  All this is a  normal card overclocked by 7 %.  Hardly worth $3000.  Also, even the regular Athlon FX is not clock locked, so that is nothing special at all.  Add a refrigerated cooling system for $250 and you can go whereever you like (I'm actually rather disappointed that this seems to be a &quot;conventional&quot; system).<br />
But, the point remains valid in any case that the &quot;intangebles&quot; like paint and tutoring seem to be way overpriced.  And that is not even talking about the little performance issue with Nvida's 64 bit chipset when compared to the VIA set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it's not overclocked..  It's default, and it uses SAMSUNG RAM.  Also, It's not 256MB Soyo either.<br />
I work for NVIDIA :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">normal is <br />
+ 475MHz core clock <br />
+ 475MHz memory clock with dual band = 475x2<br />
<br />
the other is 1120Mhz with single band with underclock due to maximum possible out of that architecture being 1015Mhz...  (not 1020Mhz)<br />
<br />
*EDIT* err.. nm.  it's dual band not single band.  my email was told it was single.   But it's still Quadro FX3000g RAMs... which alone makes it &gt;$3000 in retail value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">oh.. so basically it's FX5950 with FX3000g RAMs.. <br />
nothing too special actually.. just that there is only 1 of these.. err... probably 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">reguardless of how much it is really worth the important thing is that the money is going to a worth charity.. and the pc is so frigging cool, and it will maintain some value as a collector item because it is a one off piece that is signed by both the presidents of AMD and Nvidia....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've gone up against team 3d, think i was team hosers at a small WGC competition.  When they were done they went and ate and local argentinian buffet steak restaurant on their sponser's money.  About 50$/person there.  Seemed normal for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">your support through this auction will help feed 210,000 people this holiday season.<br />
<br />
'nuff said.<br />
<br />
Also, let's not forget, this is deductable as a charitable donation on your taxes.<br />
<br />
So let's see:<br />
<br />
-It's for all intents and purposes, a cutting edge box<br />
-It's a collector's item, and therfore intrinsically valuable and resalable<br />
-The winner gets to feel good about feeding a quarter of a million people<br />
-The winner gets half of the money back at tax time<br />
<br />
Where's the problem?</div></div><hr />

but will you be able to run through the bazaar with all models and names on and clipplane wide open?  Wonder why they never made that the ultimate benchmark test:  The brandnew quadruple opteron finally brakes the ultimate barrier: 10 fps in the bazaar ;)</div></div><hr />
