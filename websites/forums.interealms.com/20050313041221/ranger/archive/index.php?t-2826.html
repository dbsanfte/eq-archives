Now parsed logs have shown the bow of huntsman 20 30 to outdmg my light velium 30 40.  Now I was wondering, just how do you think the old wind saber 13 22 would do nowasays with endless quiver??<br />

Do you have a link to the logs?  I'm kind of interested since I just acquired a 30/37 double recurve and it seems to out-perform my huntsman by a lot.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dravack</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friend did the logs with endless quiver and AM3 and trueshot.  was like 21k vs18k i think??  More shots, more chance to hit i suppose, also more shots going out during TS as well.<br />
And he used 10dmg +4 arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinvaras</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your friend should repeat his test at the minimum of 10 times with each bow on the same mob for a more accurate test. I use a Warbow of Rallos Zek and have found no other bow that will outdamage it. With AM3 and Endless Quiver, my dps has increased significantly over my last toy, Bow of the Silver Fang. Sounds like your friend had a run of bad luck on his test. Mathematically, the bow with the better ratio should always do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with 10 dmg arrows both of those bows are the exact same ratio, plus the bow of the huntsman has proc so that's extra damage so it does do more damage, with 10 dmg arrow with the windsaber it has a better ratio than both of them so it would be better than both, though with the proc on the bow of the huntsman it may be close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I think people keep forgetting that the arrows add to the damage of the bow heh (excluding the elemental part). Which changes things a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinvaras</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the best of my knowledge the elemental bane damage hasn't been fixed yet. <br />
<br />
Thought using 10dmg arrows equals the bow, the proc of the Huntsman even with 255 dex, would almost certainly not account for a 3k difference in two minutes. That would mean that the bow proc'd roughly 30 times during his use of the disc. I'm not buying into that. <br />
<br />
The damage done by most low damage procs is so slight, it's never worth mentioning. I'm willing to bet that maybe 1k more damage could be done with the Huntsman's proc, which could be done in one or two lucky shots with the Velium bow. At that point it's just splitting hairs. <br />
<br />
The point we all seem to agree on though is that the lower your ratio, after you add for the dmg bonus of the arrows used, will determine the most damage done generally. The thing to consider here is that during Trueshot it's better to have a high damage bow because of the dmg multiplier. You may hit faster with an uzi but your damage is low so it's like hitting the High Priest with your epic swords. You finish with a low dps. So instead you whip out the 2hs or in this case, something like the WBoRZ and open up a can of whup ass on his high ac hide.<br />
<br />
In all fairness, archery pretty much sucks against him anyhow, but the basic idea is if two rangers with equal equipment open up TS on each other, one with an uzi and the other with a high dmg bow, the uzi will get wasted. Why? Because he's dead in 3 or 4 shots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drewno</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the discrepency is the damage addition to bows....<br />
a 20/30 bow becomes 34/30 with luclin arrows, adding 70% more damage.<br />
a 30/40 bow becomes 44/40 with luclin arrows, adding roughly 50% to damage.<br />
a 10/20 bow would become 24/20 with same arrows, adding 140% to damage.<br />
This does not account for Damage bonus, but you should get the general idea here.</div></div><hr />

I cant wait for them to fix elemental archery damage though, it's getting annoying :(</div></div><hr />

Because non crits are capped at 1000 damage, the AoW bow misses out on alot more damage than the Primal Bow would be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there is NO Damage cap... I don't know where people get that from. I hit for 1232 max with Rallos bow + 10 damage arrows using TS disc for normal hits.<br />
<br />
And yes, Primal bow out damages Rallos bow. Not only is 33/35 better than 43/45 before the arrow is added due to being almost identical ratios but way the hell faster, 43/35 is way better than 53/45 after the arrow damage is added.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect sir!  I routinely hit for 1072 w/o critting</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still 3 points away from AM3, so I'll have to experience it for myself soon.<br />
<br />
The only reason I want a AoW bow is for the 100hp in range slot when I am not using a bow.<br />
<br />
Doomshade dropped a bow for us the other day, and seeing as both rangers there had primal bows, we both passed to a warrior. It is lame that a bow that looks so damn cool is not better than the twigs that many of us run around with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinvaras</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Sean, the dmg to delay ratio is slightly better on the AoW bow without the arrow bonus and since the ratio includes the delay, there is no additional benefit from the speed. As we find higher damage arrows to play with the gap widens in favor of Primal, but either way, the damage difference is anything but remarkable. <br />
<br />
Since the Warders are gone and nobody cares about ST anymore, set your sights on the WBoRZ or wait to see what Vex Thal has for us. God knows the Ssra Longbow isn't worth the time from an archery stand.<br />
<br />
35 / 33 = 1.06<br />
45 / 43 = 1.04<br />
<br />
35 / 43 = 0.81<br />
45 / 53 = 0.849<br />
<br />
As for damage caps... who comes up with these lame rumors? With TS, AM3, and Endless with 10dmg arrows, I'm hitting for over 2k now. Without TS I've had some shots land for 1200's without them being crits.<br />
<br />
We should petition to have all the bows that drop from level 60 plus mobs to have a new graphic. Nothing makes a Ranger look more like a newb than running around with something that looks like a hunting bow. Personally I think if we're the Archery Masters then we should look the part.</div></div><hr />
