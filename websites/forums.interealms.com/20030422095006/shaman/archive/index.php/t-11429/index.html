<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Or both?  I just hit lvl 44 and up until now, I've been doing just fine.  I might be a bit odd here, but I took a group of mid 40's into Karnor's last night and we did the dog tower.  Honestly, it was a piece of cake, much to my suprise, but the dogs were all over me for a few seconds after I dropped a slow.  <br />
<br />
The first thing that immediately came to mind was that I really needed to consider upgrading.  I managed to get my wisdom up to 155 (Troll) after many lvls of working at it, but knowing what I know now, my AC definitely NEEDS serious improvement (sitting at only 780 w/ shield equipped and Tuna).<br />
<br />
Below is my gear, I'm hoping that some of you are/were in my position and can provide some useful advice.  I'm a shammie, I'll do whatever it takes to get it ;)<br />
<br />
Forest Loop (2)<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask<br />
Metal Linked Crown<br />
Chrysoberyl Talisman (from lguk)<br />
6ac 65hp ring (2)<br />
Giant Scalemail Sleeves<br />
Acrylia Reinforced Cloak<br />
Ry'Gorr Bracer and Sentry Bracer<br />
Totemic Guants<br />
Chokidai Hide Spaulders<br />
Ikky regen BP<br />
Flayed Turmoilskin Belt (i'm pretty sure that's the name)<br />
Ry'Gorr Leggings<br />
Coldain Skin Boots<br />
Sarnak Shield<br />
some sort of 8/19 1hb that I got off of a tribal dude in DSP<br />
and my slimey spear in range :)<br />
<br />
I usually run around w/ Stamina and Tuna up, putting my HPs at roughly 1410 and my Ac at roughly 780, but i don't think its looking too pretty.  Am I mistaken or am I just being paranoid?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have you been root/rot'ing or have you been tanking mobs?  (ie...what's your defense skill at?...is it maxed?)<br />
<br />
Getting your defense skill up will make a BIG difference in your ac.  It looks like your gear is better than mine is at level 36 but your ac is about the same as what I remember my ac to be (I'm pretty sure I'm about 770 or so, but that might be with self AC buff up and agility up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">See, that's the thing that really gets me abou this whole AC thing.  I've pretty much soloed my entire career (only stopping to group for at least 1.5 lvls between each lvl of spell upgrades).  What have I found throughout all of this?  Even at lvl 44, if you want to be efficient in obtaining XP then you need to have the pet up and you need to be tanking at the same time.  Coincidentally, my offense, piercing and 1hb each are nearly maxed for the lvl, but I believe that my defense is still only about 165 or so.  As much as I tank, I have no idea how this is still possible.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is a way to easily raise Defense?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're fighting mobs that don't pose a HUGE threat of killing you, slap a regen on yourself and use either a lower level slow, or no slow at all.  Didn't take me long to get my defense maxed out at around lvl 42 or 43 that way.<br />
<br />
btw...you mentioned that you keep 'tuna up all the time, but as far as I know, that's just an HP buff.  Try buffing yourself with Guardian too.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The nail has been hit onthe head - MAX YOUR DEFENSE! It is AC for free. At your level, tanking for your pet in FV will get you raises on Drolvargs, and probaly later on Forest Giants and Arbor Giants.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what your budget is but here are some relatively cheap upgrades to look out for:<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Elder Wolf Hide (you could camp it yourself with 2 or 3 friends)<br />
Waist: Chitinous belt<br />
Hands: Leaf scale gloves - these rot all the time in Plane of Nitemare, and sell for peanuts in the Bazaar<br />
Range: Ceremonial Smudging Stick (you could probably solo that, but its a long camp). Seal of Thoridain (from 3rd Coldain Shawl quest - v easy), Goranga Idol<br />
Primary: Thunder runed war spear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trade the...<br />
forest loops for black sapphire electrum earrings (2 ac 35 hp 25 mana)<br />
wyvern mask for death mask of elysians or crystal spider eyes<br />
acrylia cloak for ancient seahorse hide cloak or giant scalemail<br />
rygorr legs for brown chitin leggins<br />
primary for rune etched icewurm fang<br />
chrysoberl talisman for black sapphire velium neck (65hp 65 mana)<br />
<br />
that's my take on easy upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I too carried around Giantscale mail sleeves for what seemed an eternity.  Look for some Crystal Chitin arms if you have the plat, as well as the things listed above.</div></div><hr />
