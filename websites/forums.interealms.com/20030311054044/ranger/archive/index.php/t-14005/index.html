<br />
With SoV I can use a 31% haste item and get max haste. Saw a Vinecutter cheap, thought I might use that over my Ornate Sword of the General/Swifty combo. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lohocla Rofevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on 2 things, how good your wepons are, and what you are killing. I use Ornate/Swifty as well and find it works great, but if you get a 2h that is overwelmingly awesome, 50/40 or something like that, then yes, it will kick ass and you should find some SCHW and use that. But the Mob also matters. With ac, as i understand, bonus is added after dmg is reduced according to ac, so the faster weapons, with a more constant bonus, and having a miss that doesn't matter as much as missing witha long delay 2h, works a bit better. Vs. low ac shiz, 2h all the way. : -)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FarseekerTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's results of a sample parse of PoV, razorfiend subduers.  These guys are nice and yellow - red con.<br />

primal spear (MH)<br />
swifty (SH)<br />
shissar + avatar proc<br />
~ 1500 atk<br />

primal ax<br />

Yes, I know, my dual wield piercing caps at 240.  This hurts my duel wield some.  However, not having 41 percent item (non-weapon) haste hurts my 2hs, so it's pretty even.   Also note I am lvl 61, need to update my sig, but am lazy atm.  No real AA to speak of, except CF1.<br />
<br />
If I bother to factor in call of fire/sky/etc, dual wield comes out ahead a little, but then, is it really worth it against stuff that will shred you on enrages and ripostes?  I use 2hs alot when I group in PoV, go figure.</div></div><hr />
