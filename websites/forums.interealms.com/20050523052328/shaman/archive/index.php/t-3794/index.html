<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the return of slows, roots and debuffs to affliction focus I cant justify using the coldain bracer situationally, I need to make room by removing my JBB if possible. I intend on leaving the scale mesh vambraces on the other wrist and my Kael sleeves on arms (of course). Trying to make up the lost damage from JBB would melee and the icewurm fang even come close with haste, full buffs including VoB? Was gonna pick one up to experiment, but impressions are sometimes decieving so want some hard numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">far from it....it's fast and fun, but average hit is maybe 15-20 or something, and the proc is only a 81dd, doesn't go off spectacularly much.<br />
<br />
i highly recommend you use JBB instead of the scale mesh vambs, the difference in stats will affect your soloing ability by maybe 0.1%....think about it. it just doesn't matter, JBB damage is very powerful, stats in one slot are not.<br />
<br />
but if you must, i'd use a good 2hb - granite face grinder, hammer of spiritcalling, velium brawl stick, facesmasher or whatever you can get.</div></div><hr />
