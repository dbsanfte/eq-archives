<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure somewhere on the boards here theres something posted about the bi-weekly, now monthly updates on class top 10 list at the sony boards. Was surfing the sk boards and found this post to be rather unique. Unique in the fact that some from SOE actually responded, but in the manner of their response is whats actually rather shocking. Add to that the fact that the Sk's are on par w/the Shammy's about wanting something done for thier class.<br />

IMO, the lists were a HUGE mistake for Sony.  They have turned into a big headache for the guys in the dev offices because the items listed by most classes are the things that SOE really doesnt want to be fixed, and now they have to answer to them every month.  Its no wonder to me that nothing on the lists ever change.  Anytime someone complains about an item there the devs can just point to the lists and say &quot;We're thinking about it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I dont really see how they have become a headache for the developers. It's very possible that they look at the lists and actually do see them as tools for day to day chugging along on programs, but more likely, its<br />
more a placebo, keeping us hoping that something will be done. Very little on any class list has been really addressed, few little bites here and there used to keep us thinking that the big issues will be fixed at some point.<br />
TBH I dont even look at the shaman class issue list anymore, the basics of it havent changed since that big stroke job of a correspondant gathering, and likely never will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">howdy folks, <br />
  I play a SK, and retired my shaman months ago, However, l can not speak for the hole Shadkowknight class when l say that, SK really are in good shape after omens. The spells we got were good upgrades and mostly usefull. There are still a few out there that would love a &quot;defensive disc&quot; for us and the paladins. Thats a never going to happen for shadowknight or paladins in my opinion. What {frodllin} is saying to me is that sony just need to pull the list from the boards. Its was a good when it started but yet again by SOE, poorly impented.  Just my  2 cents <br />
<br />
Have fun and be safe, <br />
Tickmunki</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry to thread jack, but I thoguht that I would share my thoughts on that &quot;defense knight&quot; according to me.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the knights get a minor version of defensive as well.  My version would be in line with the class and no where as usefull as the Warrior one.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights would get a Lifetap Shield, returning a certain percentage of the incoming melee damage directly to the Shadow Knight.  This would effectively reduce the NPC's DPS and at the same time keep in the spirit of the Shadow Knight, lifetapping to reduce overall damage and at the same time, helping to keep agro.<br />
<br />
Paladins would get a Stun Shield, very briefly stunning the oponent, even unstunable targets to effectively reduce the incoming NPC's DPS while keeping true to the spirit of Paladins.  This not only helps to control the damage taken strickly to the Paladin but also helps them to keep agro.<br />
<br />
On the Class Boards Issues, I would like to see the dev's be honest about something they have no intentions whatsoever in fixing so that i can get mad about it, them move on.  Dangling a carrot works for horses, not Gamers.... at least not me.</div></div><hr />

He's also one of the biggest idiots out there when dealing with other classes.</div></div><hr />

As far as i remember 'Currently being evaluated' means they are not completely opposed to changes in that topic, but still looking into ways, how to do it exactly. The detailed explanation can be found on SOEs site however.<br />
<br />
If they really do not want to do something in the suggested points, a 'no changes planned' with a short explanation why would suffice - atleast for the reasonable part of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Whoever is ultimately responsible for customer relations at SOE is doing a horrible job in my opinion. A large part of the job is not, if you do something about issues or not (though that is the expectation of players normally :D), but how you interact and communicate with the customers.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you are more optimistic than I am.  When I look at the shaman list I see quite a few that could have been implemented MONTHS AGO if someone had taken a few hours to bother to sit down and do it.  Like the /TGB shrink out of group.  Give it a pop up box.  If you have to, they could copy the wizard Teleport spell, remove the port component and put in the shrink component.  THeres one you can drop of the list.<br />
<br />
How much discussion do you need about increasing the duration of FA?  If they even talk about it once every 2 weeks they have had MORE than enough time to cover all the pros and cons of a 15 or 25 minute FA.  If its not gonna happen than someone at SOE needs to grow a pair and say &quot;Screw you guys, but you arent getting a longer FA&quot; and drop it from the list.  The same is true of Healing issues.  The healing rations have stayed the same since PoP, so its obvious that SOE is wedded to its love of keeping the shaman lacking in healing efficency and power.  Say so, and get it off the list.<br />
<br />
To me, these lists are nothing more than dangling the carrot.  If things get so bad that SOE notices a drop in people paying for the game (instead of paying for but not playing; SOE could give a rats ass  about low log in populations as long as people still pay while they play WoW) then they will break one out and actually DO something about it.  But untill then it was a great way to shut people up about some issues, because when there is a list out people believe that there is actual work done about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thorzion makes a good point.  Does anyone have a &quot;Currently Being Evaluated&quot; item, that was actually evaluated and implemented?  I'm sure there must be one, but without diging, I dont recall one.  At best, we get &quot;Implementing that change is turning out to be more difficult than we anticipated.&quot;</div></div><hr />
