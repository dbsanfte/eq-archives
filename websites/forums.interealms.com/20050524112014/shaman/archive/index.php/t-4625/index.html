<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's my Magelo account: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=349011. My stamina is really 108 and I have 840 HP unbuffed, not 837. I have HP gear in the bag, but I solo a lot and got tired of using all my mana killing one mob, so I decided to buy WIS gear. I run to about half to maybe 1 bub of mana gone when I solo. I was wondering if I should get rid of some of my WIS gear and just use the HP gear in my bag, or maybe get some more HP or WIS gear. I don't have very much to spend, only about 1k. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try the link again without the period in it.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to why you're wearing the no AC no hitpoint no wis +7 cha bracer?  <br />
<br />
I don't know what to tell you, your gear is 100 times better than mine was at level 34 (when I was in full banded and wearing a silver ruby veil).  <br />
<br />
Maybe swap both the wrists out for something with a bit more AC, sentry bracers, maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First and foremost- get yourself to the bazaar.  There are tons of great deals on the kind of gear you're after.  Be patient, and don't overpay!  Squeezing every plat is important when you don't have much- and the bazaar is the perfect tool for squeeezing your money into the best gear possible.<br />
<br />
Let me go slot by slot and see if we can't find some low-cost upgrades (note, these are just suggestions- if you see something come up in a bazaar search that look good- grab it!)  <br />
<br />
Ears: Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (cheap- under 100 pp, maybe much less if you provide the ivories- and a great combination of AC and WIS.)<br />
<br />
Neck:  Don't change a thing.  BA medallion is great- 10% less mana for all 44 and under spells is huge.  I didn't take mine off until I got my Crystalline Torque (with the same effect.)<br />
<br />
Face:  Sell the bone mask and get an arctic wyvern mask.  Similar stats, and you should make a nice chunk of change on the deal.  Alternatively, swap out the bone mask for an enshrouded veil (great stats, and 25% less mana to summon your pet.)<br />
<br />
Head:  Ry'gorr is your cheap upgrade (50 pp), JB your next upgrade (couple hundred).  <br />
<br />
Fingers:  Fine.  If you think you're wisdom heavy, swap out the WIS ring for another AC/HP ring.<br />
<br />
Wrist:  Get a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB) (with the CBB you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast. Again, this should just cost a few hundred PP.)  If you solo / DoT a lot, this one item will really help (25% mana reduction is awesome.)<br />
<br />
Arms:  JB arms are your next upgrade.  A couple hundred PP and a huge AC upgrade for you.  I'd skip ry'gorr or totemic- they don't offer that large an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Hands:  Okay, this is going to sound totally stupid.  I'd sell the JB gloves, buy Ry'gorr gloves, and use the difference for other upgrades.  You'll make some plat on the deal, and the difference won't be huge (most minor JB pieces are AC 18, the gloves are only AC 14... and Ry'gorr is AC 12 with a couple minor stats.)<br />
<br />
Shoulder: Tattered mantle (100 pp or so, maybe less- should be an even swap for the lizardscale, and you'll gain nice AC and HP) <br />
<br />
Chest:  Another &quot;boy this is going to sound stupid&quot; suggestion.  I'd sell BOTH the BS tunic and the Ry'gorr tunic, and grab a Giant Woven Vest (AC 18, +10 STR, +20 HP) - the giant woven is cheaper than either the BS or the Ry'gorr- you should make some good money on this one.  Your next upgrade from there is probably a Tree Weave- but only if you can find it cheap.<br />
<br />
Back:  You're fine- that's a nice back item.  If you need cash, though, this would be a great way to raise it.  You can get a cloak with better AC super-cheap (ice bear, lizardscale, totemic, giant scalemail, etc.)<br />
<br />
Waist:  Again, fine... but a good money-raising spot if you need it.  A spider fur belt (100-200 pp) is a great belt for the price. A straw belt is a great super-cheap alternative (like 10 pp, an outstanding deal for the AC.) <br />
<br />
Legs:  Oh my- these need to go.  Sell 'em, and keep your eyes out for deals on totemic, ry'gorr, or trakanasaur.  Don't pay more than 100 pp.<br />
<br />
Your main and range weapon are great, and I love that you've got the goranga idol to swap in for AC/HP.  You're cool here- no changes.<br />
<br />
As far as shields go, I say pick one.  Personally I'd sell the WIS shield and wield the Clay Guardian (in fact, I did until I upgraded to a Sarnak Battle shield in the mid 40s... which I used until I got my Stetched Fungushide Shield two nights ago- yoo-hoo!)<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wear the stuff in your bag over the stuff you have currently on. Learn to use doggie, he is free damage and recovers faster after a fight.<br />
