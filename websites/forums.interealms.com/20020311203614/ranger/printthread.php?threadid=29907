<p><b> Stonebrunt quest help</b></p>

<p>So there is a quest given by the kittie people in Stonebrunt.   Not sure what the reward is, but the components are: 2 tiger skins, 2 panda claws, 2 asp poison sacks, bamboo shoot and kejekan palm fruit.  I have 2 questions<br />
<br />
1) can't seem to find bamboo shoots, closest I can find is bamboo bo wakizashi or something, dropped by the kobolds.  This what they mean?  If not, then where can I get the bamboo<br />
<br />
2) the palm fruit, I am convinced, does not exist.  if it does, can someone please tell me how to aquire it?  I've seen no ground spawns in the jungle (and I have been looking for 2 days), forage returns nothing unusual, and nothing I have killed yet drops it.  <br />
<br />
Any clues?<br />
<br />

<p><b> *evil grin*</b></p>

<p>Knowing Verant, you've got to Forage the fruit, and it's Lore/No Drop, along with some of the other parts... but the other parts are only found on mobs that are green to a lvl 19, (the level at which forage hits 100, allowing forage of rares), so nobody can do the quest due to trivial loot code.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could be wrong.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Bamboo shoots are plants.  They'll either be groundspawns or foraged items.<br />
<br />
Same with Palm fruit.<br />

<p>I've been in that zone for 4 days now - nothing unusual has been foraged yet, no ground spawns, and, from what I hear in-zone, these 2 items are not in the game yet.  I'll post a follow-up here when something turns up.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Hey Vayvo, sorry I beat ya to this one.<br />
<br />
Bamboo shoots are a Forage, they look like roots.<br />
<br />
Kejekan Palm Fruits are also a Forage, they look like Fruit/Berries.<br />
<br />
Result is this:<img src="http://prae.freeyellow.com/images/wofs.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
Managed to do it twice last night, and I got a spare Kejekan Palm fruit for you in my pack you can have big guy. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Spirit Strike is an 81DD Cold based spell.<br />
<br />
It even nailed Wyverns in Cobalt Scar, so high CR creatures get hit with it too.  Of course, it did get resisted once, but I expect that.  At least with this, you can get partial resists, unlike the Yak.<br />
<br />
These swords are not Lore btw, and the proc isn't that much of a taunt, at least it wasn't for me.  I'm taking it up to Fear tonight with me, let you know how it works. <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I've gotten two of the things myself... can't really see my ranger using them, but they could work nicely for my bard.  The current thought over at Allakhazams is that they start to proc at level 20.  I'll post after I get a chance to try them out on my 23 bard... I expect they'll proc.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Would anyone Mind posting the pieces needed for this quest?<br />
<br />
I'm in a small and low level guild and were putting together an outting to help out our lower level guys aka 15-25 toons.  I was thinking that doing this quest fwith some of them might be a fun idea for us all.<br />
<br />
However I really need to no the pieces that aren't available in Stoneburnt so I can make sure to pick them up before our guild event.<br />
<br />
As well my foraging is at 130 is that high enough to forage these items.<br />
<br />
Side note I foraged my first piece of Epic stuff yesterday <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  I can say I've started my epics lol<br />

<p>My group worked on this last night. Our group was a ranger (hiya), wizard, and cleric. We were all level 32 at the time. Here's how we did it:<br />
<br />
From the zone in, follow the wall to your right until you reach the cliff overlooking the water. Against the wall are a couple of boulders. This was a safe spot to med and heal between fights. Along the cliff face and in the water are all maner of beasts, including the tigers and pandas you need for the quest. My group waited at the boulder while I ran out a bit and pulled what we needed. Our group of 3 was able to get everything but the asp sacs in a couple of hours. Getting the panda claws was the toughest part.<br />
<br />
When we were done, I hunted cistern asps in Oasis near the North Ro border. The first two I killed dropped the Asp Poison Sacs needed. It was late, so I camped. Next time I play I will complete the quest.<br />
<br />
This was a long was to say that a half-group of level 32 players was able to get almost everything in a couple of hours. I was even able to forage a fruit and bamboo for each of my group-mates.<br />
<br />
The new question for me is: Do I swap the new wakizashi in and put my SSoM in the bank? (Either would be in my secondary hand).<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>The claws do drop off all Pandas but are a rare drop. I got one of mine off a Cub and one off an Elder. The Elders hit very hard and have better Magic Resist than the other types, especially to Snare and Panic Animal. They resist Yak procs as well!<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>The Claws are such a rare drop that there are people offering 100pp per claw now! However offering to trade a pair of Asp Sacs and the two foraged items for a claw is still a good trade IMO.<br />

<p>EQprices has always been whacked. 4500 no way.<br />
<br />
I'd pay around 5-600 for this thing if I had to, but since I don't...<img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
I ended up having to buy the claws from players since that TLC is in effect, I got them for 20pp each back then, guess word about this sword has driven demand for the claws up.  Dammit, I hate creating inflation.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, screw paying the 100pp, go get 'em yourself if you can.  Let the greedy gits clog their bags up with claws they can't sell.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> trivial loot code</b></p>

<p>Does the trivial loot code apply for the claws and skins? I thought VI pathed it to where quest items could be looted or for that matter I heard non-unique mobs were not on the TLC. Is this true?<br />
<br />
Bottom line, can a 51 loot these items?</p>
<hr>
<i>Posted by Skaw Falk'venn on 09-20-2001 04:07 PM:</i>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>As far as I know none of these components are on the trivial loot code. Certainly at 39/40 I never got a trivial message off one of these mobs even if it was green. I have had claws off a green panda and a skin off a green tiger.<br />
<br />
I also know that the Heretic Heads for the haste sash are NOT on trivial code - other items dropped by the Heretics are, I have seen the "trivial" message but still got the head. I believe this was one quest that was changed in the last patch.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>The tiger skins are not magic, lore, or no drop and therefore not subject to TLC anyway.  As for pandas, the elder pandas should still be blue to you at 51, so you should have no problems with the TLC anyway.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Unfortunately, everything but the Titan animals and some of the Kejekans are very much green at 51. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Tried killing a few pandas and got that "This encounter was trivial for you" crap, so we figured that meant there was a claw on the body.  It's the only magic item I can figure panda's having.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, however, I was able to get the Spirit stones, so I guess the TLC has some of the items on it and some not on it.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> TLC and such</b></p>

<p>The quest part of the trivial loot code was recently added, and in my mind it only half works.<br />
<br />
For things that are only used in quests - heretic heads, for instance - they mostly will drop for you. However, this isn't fully implemented (e.g. the head of Rognarok won't drop for me, though it should).<br />
<br />
For things that are both usable and quest items (panda claws, Ancient Snake Fang), they won't drop. This is probably as intended and won't change.<br />
<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, tiger skins will drop for you, but panda claws won't (from non-xp giving pandas).<br />

<p>All but positive thaAsp is just a snake, Adders are snakes, a snake's posion can't be TOO different than t the Adders DO drop asp posion sacs... (most are still red, some yellow at 19 )<br />
<br />

<p>Err, the adders don't drop the right sacs. They drop "snake venom sacs" or some such thing. These will NOT work for the quest.  You need to go to Nro and keel cistern asps (drop "asp poison sac" almost everytime). Do yerself a favour and get a stack, then you can be nice and give a pair to someone in need.<br />
I've done this quest three times so far, they run 600 to 1kpp on Xev.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>
