<br />
Journeyman Boots do not make you immune to being rooted.  They're a lesser, toned down, movement increasing item.  Regardless of class, they are essential to PVP on Rallos-Zek.  Without them, and sow dispelled, you're done for.<br />
<br />
Kick doesn't interrupt casting, it has no stun effect ever for rangers (unlike warriors at higher levels).  With fast weapons, a level 20'ish caster should never continue casting anyway.<br />
<br />
This guide is geared towards fighting magicians... and one of the most useful things to know about a magician is that MAGICIANS NEVER GET A ROOT/SNARE SPELL.<br />
<br />
Their pet can root, just root it then snare it... snare the magician and beat the snot out of him, very easy to do.  Once a magician gets epic, things are a bit nastier as their pets are basically Gods with great magic resists :/</div></div><hr />
