<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, being a person with scattered free time on his hand grouping is pretty tought to do unless I can get a friend to duo with for a short time. Pop exp is pretty good, loot bites though. My old favorite place dulak is turning light blue now(seems like they nerfed thegem drop too :( ).I tried tog mines, but exp seemed like crap. I am always interested in finding nice new safe soloing spots. I checked out sanctus seru and I really like this place gaurds drop from min so far 12pp to max so for 17pp maybe 18, with an average of 15pp. Good exp for solo. It's been pretty empty and it's a big city lots of places to kill I am sure. Everyone I've met in the zone has been pretty friendly they've tossed me a few buffs helped me finish off a mob. Mobs hit fairly fast, and a few summon such as a optio of the hand I tried to kill while at 50% mana. I just thought I'd pass the word along. I heard faction hits affect Katta, but who cares.. few quest there, nothing I really want. Anyone else ever try?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am also interested in where a good safe spot would be to get out and buff up pet, and then either pull ot or move out from. I'm a 59 shammy atm with Canni V if that makes a difference at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunted the entrance area of Seru a couple of times in the low 60s...There is one wanderer that is much tougher than the other guards - pretty sure its the Optio. Rest of the zone guards are a bit easier. <br />
<br />
Several posts reference a long hallway up on the wall...don't bother, mobs are easy to single pull but you won't be able to kill them fast enough to prevent wanderers from adding.<br />
<br />
btw - Seru and Katta are on opposing factions.  Kill in one to raise in the other ( &lt;--  Oversimplification)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any idea if by killing in Sanctus I could become non-Kos enough in Katta to do the EB neck item turn in?<br />
<br />
I have never done any Katta killing and I am a level 59 Iksar shaman.<br />
<br />
I had banked 3 shissar organs from leveling up from way back when. I then realized it was Iksar monks with sneak that could do the quest andnot having sneak I was stuck unable to do the quest.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to find a place to solo and a chance at finally getting a EB item aswell.</div></div><hr />

Yes, all it will take is time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm I wonder if you could use a human illusion pot to be non kos to katta? or have a chanter cast illusion on you.<br />
I use to hug the wall go in a corner and pull from various places.. most mobs are pretty easy. It was pretty safe ocationally a wandering mob would agro.. but pretty rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Used my druid to harmony the EB neck turnin guy for a couple people a few months ago.  Invis in, have friend harmony quest mob, hand in one organ from as far away as you can, have friend invis you, stick the other organs in the window, then hit trade.<br />
<br />
Can't say if it still works or not, but it saved a lot of wasted time factioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">grab a bard and have him lull the mob and play invis song. Charm shoulda work too</div></div><hr />
