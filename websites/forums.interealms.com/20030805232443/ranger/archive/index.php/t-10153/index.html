<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a level 41 Ranger I am interested in hunting Tigerraptors in Wakening Lands both for the Iceforged Shackles quest and for the Tigerraptor cloak. My biggest worry is getting through Kael. I tried today and realized that if my camo goes out mid zone, I can't recast and I am stranded. Plus I don't know the zone. I'd like to try to do this without asking for help from my guild, so I am asking for advice from you guys. Should I:<br />
<br />
1. Wait till 49 for Superior Camo?<br />
2. Balls it out and make a suicide rush through Kael ( I am KOS)?<br />
3. Try to get a port to Skyshrine and come in from the other side.<br />
4. Beg invis from someone in GD?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your counsel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if you can run through Skyshrine ok, you might as well just buy a port to wakening lands and save yourself some aggravation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really, with SoW up u can outrun them all, but make sure you know the exact way first. But Just getting a port in Wakening is alot less hassle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Presently I am in Wakening Lands. The Tigerraptors are great, and all you have to do is zone to Skyshrine if there are any problems. Also saw my first dragon in game, although, of course, I kept my distance. Zone is kinda scary, and that's fun. Just not sure how I will get out afterwards. Have to find a kindly druid in zone I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Traxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm currently 41 and have made the run through Kael several times with no problem. I just refresh sow and camo wait about 30 seconds before zoning in, and run for it.  I've noticed that when camo drops prematurely its usually within the first 30 seconds of casting.  Of course I could just be superstitious.  Either way, I've completed the trip through six times, camo only dropped once, the first time.  Luckily there was a guild raiding that day so the path behind was clear for me to run back out.<br />
<br />
The prices tigeraptor hides fetch in the bazaar make the journey well worth it.  As for the iceforged shackles, the raptor guts are fairly common, but the strong branch from the flying monkeys is murder.  Those things are severely underconned. Be CAREFUL. CR's in the Wakening Land suck.  Millions of trees everywhere, and if you dont /loc just before you bite it, you'll definately need a bone rod.<br />
<br />
As for the porting Idea, the dragon circle is where Whoushi lives,  KoS level 60 dragon.  I had a druid friend port there once. He died instantly at level 40.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sykkwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The keys were removed several patches ago, but that was the way it used to work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Woushi is hardly ever around, hes dead usually within 30mins of popping. Traxx u musta been lucky cause i killed about 35-50 Raptors before i got some guts, and alot of friends had to put up with that drop rate.On the plus side took me 3 Holgresh's for the stick :). Noone mentioned, but in WL there are Corrupted mob types steer clear, i know for a fact that they are hard, nuked me for 1500 one day omw to SS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldnt wait till 49 to hunt the raptors they go mostly Lt Blue at 48 except for the Tigasouraus' and Rapticor of course. As far as corpse runs well I havent tested this theory but I used to zone into Skyshrine to med and heal and forage drake eggs and I noticed a naked monk standing there asking for a port for a CR in ooc. I asked how come she was naked in SS and was told you can bind there as it's a city zone (DOH) if this is true (I never looked it up when I was hunting there but luckily never died) then it would hunting in WL alot easier. Just zone into SS and bind right there even if your KOS to Sentry enots you are no where near them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's great to know I can bind in Skyshrine. I will take advantage of that...Now if I could just use the bank there, I could make Wakening Lands a semi-permanent home. I am filling up with lots of good stuff, and need to put it somewhere. Only problem is, I am KOS to sentries at entrance, so I assume that is zone-wide.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Running through Kael isn't all that hard, unless camo drops on you.<br />
<br />
I suggest you run to Thurgadin, and then make a thurg gate potion, so you can get out of WL easier in the future.<br />
<br />
IMO, once you can solo in CC there is no reason to not have a TGP on your person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">never had a problem running through kael .... once i wanted to go too fast and lost camo at half travel , i just stopped after a giant and before i meet next one, and recast. I agree that is dangerous, but as camo have a semi random duration ( 30 sec or 5 min or max duration ) , if u cast camo and wait 30 secs before engage , u should be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The ONLY dangers of the Kael run are 1) getting lost/not knowing the way and loose camo/or bump into a see invis giant or 2) Knowing the way but loosing camo and training someone else.<br />
<br />
Buy 1 or 2 cloudy potions from a merchant at the thurgadin bank, then drink them if you loose invis inside Kael.<br />
<br />
Bind at SS zone-in, CRs will be fine then. Forage the drake eggs there. Pull raptors from the ledge that is located to the left after you zone out of SS. You should get good xp from raptors and should get the guts in no time.<br />
<br />
If you decide to try the holgresh solo, pick the wanderers outside the caves. I can't say enough about the importance of resist gear when you fight those. They suck at melee so you don't need AC, but you need to be able to resist some 500dmg nukes.<br />
<br />
I had a lot of fun when I did it, I am sure you will have fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Made the Kael run solo yesterday with no problems. I suspect it is easier going from WL to EW than the other way around. At least I didn't get lost! Last night I went on a Kael raid with my guild, so that is helping faction. Checked last night at Thurg and I am now at amiable. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the holgresh. I am planning on hitting them Monday with a 42 druid friend who also has a 55 cleric to rez if things get nasty :).<br />
<br />
Lots of good info here. Thanks<br />

<br />
The Sup Camo on the helm has a slower cast time, but doesn't seem to fizzle nearly as much as the spell itself does.  Lately, I've had a devil of a time with fizzles on Sup Camo -- not sure if something changed recently or not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&gt;I've had a devil of a time with fizzles on Sup Camo <br />
<br />
<br />
might be your divination skill who is really low ... i was wondering miself why i could not cast a singel sup camo and realized that my divination where near 100 heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hehe...your prob right!  I just sold my Tolan's Helm which I used since my mid-40s for Sup Camo....so I never had to use the Sup Camo spell!  Guess I need to buy another helm...LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">or train your divination skill it should not be useless :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, I used Div skill for Camo for 30+ levels with very little trouble...but Sup Camo just seems to be a different beast...<br />
<br />
Guess I could cast Glimpse over and over and over and over...<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ya I am amazed at how high our Div and Conj skill has to be to cast swarm and sup camo compared to a druids. I still get several fizzles alot on Sup camo with a 175 (Or higher now not sure) div skill, while my alt druid was casting sup camo with a div skill well below 50 as I remember it and getting like maybe 1 fizzle, and Swarm lol I needed well over a 100 conjuration to cast that.<br />
<br />
Guess those spells for us are just that much harder ***shrug***<br />

The biggest part is knowing where you are going and making the right turns. I got a few hits on the way and must have had a huge train by the time I got to WL zone, but I made it! What fun!<br />
