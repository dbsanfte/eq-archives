<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finding this a very impressive game but having no urge to level up. Got like 5 level 10 characters on Beta now. Anyone else finding the same? By the way not criticizing WoW as I do think its going to be massive, but at the same time there is something lacking for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did find myself playing multiple characters to see the differences, but I was enjoying it the whole time.  Maybe it's not your cup of tea, or your expectations were inflated?  <br />
<br />
I definitely had no urge to level grind, but again - I was doing quests back to back, and didn't really realize I was leveling at the time.  It was kind of like a nice bonus, which is - if I remember right - what the devs had in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have 1 character at level 41 (Shaman, naturally!) and 2 characters at level 24.  The two characters at level 24 have gained all their experience strictly through quests.  Whenever I reach a point in one area where the quests either run out or build to too high of a level, I go to another area and pick up the new quests!  No complaints here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a mage at L30 and now a warrior at L10 (got account restored, woot) but I'm not going out of my way to play the mage anymore due to the upcoming open beta (and hopefully retail soon to follow).  Even if I could use my closed beta char in open beta I prolly won't as I want to be able to play with my crew from the get go.<br />
<br />
I basically just created the warrior to see how melee are.  In short: insanely powerful, at least compared to the nerfed to oblivion mages.  Playing a warrior feels like playing a monk with epic, tstaff, SCHW and fungi during Velious and then rolling into Velk's.  Nasty.</div></div><hr />
