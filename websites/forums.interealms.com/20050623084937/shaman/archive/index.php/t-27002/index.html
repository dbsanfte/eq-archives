<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">5. An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana.<br />
<br />
Since this was scribed there have been some good changes to the canny line of spells . However no changes at all to the canny AA .<br />
Do you feel this issue should be altered ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd like to see a &quot;hastened cannibalization&quot; AA.... plenty of times I've clicked my hotkey to see I'm still a minute away from being able to do it.<br />
<br />
or a general improvement AA...ways to make the conversion more efficient, or a larger bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd like to see a &quot;hastened cannibalization&quot; AA.... plenty of times I've clicked my hotkey to see I'm still a minute away from being able to do it.  <br />
<br />
That would rock even if it was only like a 3 rank, 10% per rank upgrade.<br />
<br />
Or could go with a bigger canni AA that requires the first as a pre-req.  1100 mana isn't all that much 5 expansions later.  I'd like to see it remain on the list.<br />
<br />
When I first got the canni AA, I max buffed to like 4500HP, maybe 4K mana if that?  1100 mana was huge.  Now, with so many shaman over 10k hp and 8K mana, we're due an upgrade imo.  Doesn't have to be double or anything but something along the lines of a 50% increase in mana and hp.  3k hp for 1700 mana would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like to see a &quot;hastened cannibalization&quot; AA.... plenty of times I've clicked my hotkey to see I'm still a minute away from being able to do it.<br />
<br />
that is an excellent idea.  I would gladly put aa's into that.  Would be a priority for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, hastened Canni 5 would be great, though I've been living in 3-minute increments for so long I'm not sure I could get used to it. :p I would also like to see a slight upgrade (as suggested by GrishMT) to Canni 5 that requires the original as a prerequisite. Any AA giving me a better or faster Canni would immediately be a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uhh, since when has mana regen become a priority issue for shamans?  I didn't notice there was a problem myself =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its simply about improvement, we've seen alot of change lately, and there are still more things that could be worked on.<br />
<br />
I think a faster, or larger modification to our cannibalize AA is warranted, our heals are now larger, and some of our spells require more mana.<br />
<br />
some would argue that &quot;Spiritual Channeling&quot; is our canni upgrade...but its only once an hour or so, and doesn't help continual mana regen. a new canni I think would be a better option...&quot;Channeling&quot; is more of an emergency/mass mana burn to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Darn it, I voted wrong hehe.  Wanted to vote &quot;remove it&quot;.  I feel our mana regen is fine, and I like the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think it should be removed, because this is one of the areas i feel has already been handled properly. shamans have consistantly gained larger conversions, and they are much less of a hassle than they used to be. on top of that, our cannibilization AA is still one of the most powerful alt skills in the game. <br />
<br />
would i like to have bigger, better conversions? well, yeah, i guess so. it would definately make my character more powerful. its just not in the spirit of the list, in my opinion, which is supposed to be used for improving weak or broken aspects of different classes. our conversions definately aren't weak or broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Uhh, since when has mana regen become a priority issue for shamans?<br />
<br />
It's been on the list for quite some time, lol. I don't have mana regen problems either (except on Msha's, the damn things). <br />
<br />
In some ways, I agree with Eeyon. I don't think our Canni 5 or canni spells are broken, and I think Canni 5 remains a very powerful ability. I love Pained Memory. However, I also agree with XeroOmega in that the issue is on the list simply in the interest of scaling Canni 5 up to meet mana costs of new spells. Does that make it worth being on the list, in the spirit of fixing broken or weak aspects of the game? I don't know, but I like it there.<br />
<br />
I do think the issue on the Top 10 list should be re-written to specifically address the Canni 5 AA, with the suggestions listed above (hastened AA, or a bigger bite with the original as pre-requisite).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well, look at it this way. what aspect of the shaman class functions better in today's game than our mana conversions?<br />
<br />
debuffs? no<br />
heals? no<br />
buffs? no<br />
damage over time? no<br />
direct damage? no<br />
<br />
not that those other aspects are neccessarily broken, or even bad, but i don't really see how anyone could make the argument that our mana conversions aren't the best thing we have going right now in terms of functioning well in current content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">again, this isn't about fixing anything, this is about general improvement of abilities.<br />
<br />
the &quot;Top Ten List&quot; is just a suggestion list of what we'd like to see most. it isn't a definite thing. I for one, think cannibalize is very nice, but I think it can be improved.<br />
<br />
the AA line has really been untouched by SOE since its introduction.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see hastened Canni5 over hastened rabidity, wouldn't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, yes. i'd rather have hastened can 5 than hastened rabidity, but my only real issue with that is that hastened rabidity is worthless, not that can 5 isn't good enough. i'd be perfectly happy if hastened rabidity was replaced with hastened spirit call too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kuokfung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like the idea of a hastened canni 5 AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, who wouldn't? i really just don't understand the connection between the suck factor of hastened rabidity and our mana conversions. they could replace that skill with anything that's useful at all, and i think most people would be happy. in fact, they'd have probably been better off just omitting it from the list in the first place.<br />
<br />
if i logged on one day to find that hastened rabidity had turned into an alt skill that gave me that ability summon a jetpack which i could use to fly around at super high speeds with, leaving a huge particle trail across the sky, i would be happy. that's not really a very compelling reason to implement something into the game though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol....well, the hastened rabidity remark was a point to say we have good ideas on bad AAs. why can't we have the same for one of our most used?<br />
<br />
Cannibalize will always be useful, but its been reduced in the kind of edge it gave because of mudflation.<br />
<br />
people have higher HP and Mana pools, spells cost more, and one of our class defining abilities is the ability to instantly sacrifice HP for massive amounts of mana. essentially: the AA is becoming weaker because of content.<br />
<br />
it just needs a little attention. the AA needs another level. it simply doesn't give the edge it used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i would agree with you guys if it were anything other than alternate abilities. if we were talking about a spell line that had lost its punch, it would be different. as it is, its an activated alternate ability that is used in addition to one of our spell lines that has improved vastly.<br />
<br />
even if this was a priority to me, i still wouldn't rate the chances of an upgrade much above 0, whether it was on the list or not. can5/spirit call/radiant cure/virulent paralysis is currently the best short timer, activated alternate ability lineup in the game as far as i know. not only that, but other classes that originally had the best activated abilities have also seen those abilities lose effectiveness as the game moved on. dire charm, mana burn, etc.<br />
<br />
shaman's may not have recieved an upgrade to can5, but you also have to consider the fact that not all of our alt skills are simply continuations of older skills. we have recieved new utilities like call of the wild and spiritual channeling.<br />
<br />
all in all, i just don't see it happening, so why bother? its far more likely to get an upgrade in an area that is weak than in an area where we already dominate all other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">why shouldn't AA's be looked at?<br />
<br />
it doesn't necessarily have to be broken for it to be improved. everything is free range in the top 10 list.<br />
<br />
looking through the other class boards on SOE right now, many are asking for changes to the abilities you listed yourself. Manaburn being #1 in the wizard forums.<br />
<br />
and no, there is importance to new skills, but the old skills do need to be kept up to date. you can't simply throw out old skills and not use them. Call of the Wild and Spiritual Channeling are really only situational, where Canni5 is likely to be fired off consistently throughout a day.<br />
<br />
and why bother? indeed. the top 10 list is a list of things we'd LIKE to see. I don't expect much change out of the issues addressed, but it is one of the ways you DO have a voice. if I seem to recall, many of our issues have recently been addressed in the re-envisionment process. what reason should you not wish for an improvement to one of our most used AAs?<br />
<br />
nothing is guaranteed. but then, if you think its pointless, why bother posting about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i don't think anyone has thrown out can 5 and stopped using it, or at least i haven't. i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree though.<br />
<br />
i didn't say aa's shouldn't be looked at. i just don't think there's any chance that particular upgrade would happen, given the potency of both our mana conversion spell line and our short timer alternate abilities. there are plenty of alt skill possibilities i would support that seem a lot more realistic to me. <br />
<br />
i think it would be a good idea to have either inate shrink, which would work like inate camoflauge, or the ability to stay shrunk after zoning, like the enchanter illusion ability. <br />
<br />
shrink is an ability that hasn't seen an upgrade (other than tiny terror) since level 19. it would be nice for it to be more useful to me than AoN, and i could be an ogre for the first time in years.<br />
<br />
i would also rate a skill like that as a much more useful improvement than MGB shrink, which would require a confirmation message to even go live. in my opinion, anyone that goes to raids without a way to shrink themselves is just a crappy player. that's an issue that can be adressed by guild leaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I play a high level cleric and a high level shaman.  Cleric has about 500 aa and clickie mana regen and 20 ft.  Even with c6, mana regen is a BIG issue for him.<br />
<br />
With my shaman, I always have mana.  Mana regen is NOT an issue.<br />
<br />
Thats why I think asking for this to get &quot;improved&quot; is misguided, honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">also, if there is really that much of a demand for improvement in mana conversions, an inate version of our spell line, on the same timer, that cast instantly would be more realistic. you'd gain some convenience without getting a bigger or faster conversion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">......<br />
<br />
clerics are vastly different from shaman. which do you play, a cleric or a shaman?<br />
<br />
if you're doing alot of different things in a group, you'll find that you can empty your mana bar quite quickly, even with canni.<br />
<br />
and I think the spell line is fine. I'm not worried about the spell. the AA is what has been ignored, not the spell line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">why would it matter which was improved? the entire premise is that shaman's should be able to convert more hit points to mana, and both the spell and the ability do exactly that. if the end result is the same ammount of hit points converted to mana, then i really don't see what difference it would make.<br />
<br />
also, the addition of the spell as an inate ability makes at least a little bit of sense. the spell itself costs no mana, and the desription sounds nothing like a spell. <br />
<br />
if it were a hotkey ability, functioning on the same timer as the spells, you would still gain mana by virtue of speed, as you wouldn't have to wait for a gem refresh to cast it, even if it were not instant. not only that, but you would also gain a spell gem.<br />
<br />
i don't think its a good idea, but i think its probably more realistic than getting an even better super big mana conversion skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">......<br />

My shaman is my main and has been since he was born in 2000.  I'm not complaining about cleric mana regen, I'm just trying to illustrate the fact that we are head and shoulders above any other class (with the *possible* exception of the necro) in terms of mana regen.  After spiritual channeling and the new OOW canni's came out, I just don't think we need ANY improvement at the moment, I really don't.  I hit canni V and pained memory every time they pop if I am not already FM.  If I'm in a pinch for mana, which happens but rarely, I mash spiritual channeling and have unlimited mana, and when its done I have full regular mana (if u keep cannying while SC is up).  And it refreshes in 30 minutes...that's pretty damn fast imo.<br />
<br />
I think having this issue on our list diminishes the seriousness of the list as a whole.  If soe see's us whining about something like mana regen which we have tons of, I think they will be more likely to ignore our other legitimate class issues.  Our being too greedy is gonna make them think we're just spoiled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think it should be changed to the specific suggestion of replacing Hastened Rabidity AA with Hastened Cannibalization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hastened Canni sounds like an excellent sollution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lickity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In our former state, yes, Canni V was more than sufficent to handle slows, nukes, dots and rebuffing when needed.  However, with the new heal upgrades, we should be able to heal and slow for our groups without being a burden.  I am not poorly geared, but I know I could not keep up healing in RSS, or probably even MPG Main Healing/slowing/panther my group.  Groups will have no reason to have a shaman healing if we aren't able to do our other abilities as well.<br />
<br />
Another idea on Canni AA. Leave Canni V the way it is, and have an AA to reduce the recast/ increase the ratio on the Pained Memory/GoD Ancient Canni line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The thing is Cannibilization didnt have a way to scale as we increased our mana-pools and such, like many other AA that work off percentages (SCRM, SCM, etc). When I first hit 60 and got that AA, it was actually somewhat strategic to use it effectivley. Took a big chunk of my HPs, so it wasnt a &quot;mid-big-fight&quot; usable thing, even with Quies. I had a macro to use it, heal myself, and warn my group that I was using it and didnt just get nuked for half my HPs or something.<br />
<br />
Now, I just pop it, like regular canni. Takes less than a bub of my health, and barely gives me a bub of mana back. Sure, its great, but its not the &quot;. . . and a bag of chips&quot; it used to be.<br />
<br />
Channeling is the new, improved Canni. It scales, regardless of hps and mana totals. If anything, I would MUCH rather see &quot;Hastened Channeling&quot; than &quot;Hastening canibilization&quot;, but I honestly think SOE semi-regrets Channeling, and will NEVER create a way to shorten the re-cast, which, in many ways, is a good thing, because otherwise there will be more and more situations where they purposely balance spells around it (which is basically what borked Panther, the whole &quot;Channel-Panther the Raid&quot; concept).<br />
<br />
Personally, for the record, I voted &quot;remove from list, mana regen isnt an issue&quot;. Without Panther or another big mana-intensive ability, I am not finding it hard to keep my mana over 60% non-stop, even if I Malos, DOT, Rain, Heal non-stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I voted for an improved Canni AA. The reason is simple. Whenever spells are upgraded, the increase in mana is proportional to the increase in its effect. <br />
The ratio for heal spells for the different priest classes for instance, will be constant. We will always pay X mana for Y point of healing and be a set percentage less efficient at doing so than Druids and Clerics, but at the same time, new mana regen buffs, higher FT cap, mana regen click buffs enter the game and reduce the relative mana regen advantage classes like Necromancers and Shamans have over othr classes.<br />
<br />
Before FT was introduced, the standing mana regen of a caster was 21(25 with self buffs) and the Shaman was regening about 110-131(canni dance). A Shaman was basically regening mana at a rate of ~524% of a caster. With the introduction of FT items, a FT 15 capped Shaman would &quot;only&quot; regen mana 365% faster than a caster.<br />
<br />
These are theoretical figures btw and only valid during downtime, as Shaman mana regen has always been of active nature and susceptible to different circumstances.<br />
<br />
Every expansion, Shamans and Necromancers lose some of their advantage and a hastened Canni AA would be a welcome upgrade for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm just trying to illustrate the fact that we are head and shoulders above any other class (with the *possible* exception of the necro) in terms of mana regen.<br />
<br />
If SoE can't dazzle you with brilliance they baffle you with bull****.<br />
<br />
It's true we have great mana regen.  However, all of our spells cost more mana than any class with similiar abilities.  You're comparing us to a cleric, well the cleric can still heal far more than we can before they run oom.  <br />
<br />
Casting a spam heal twice costs more mana than the canni AA gives you.  Comparing us to clerics in mana regen when their heals cost way less mana to cast isn't really accurate now is it?  <br />
<br />
I've seen this for years where people talk about how great our mana regen is and it is great no doubt but many fail to realize at what cost.  Try keeping up with a druid on healing, chain spam and see who runs oom faster.  Well of course, you have to stop to canni to outheal them.  You'll go through way more mana than they do.  You'll have more pauses in your heals with more chance of a death to whoever you're healing.<br />
<br />
It all depends what you're doing.  If you're playing a slower in an exp group and devote most of the rest of your time to dps, yeah, you'll probably never have any mana problems.  If you're a spam healer on a tough mob in Tacvi, you'll use all your mana and be canni'ing at the end of the fight to try to land one more heal.<br />
<br />
Speeding up the reuse or raising the amount of hp/mana the AA does is overdue.  It's been over 2 and a half years.  If you read through the top 10 list, many of the things on it are not real important.  This is far better than most of those.  <br />
<br />
I guess an upgraded SoW is really better than an upgraded canni though eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If SoE can't dazzle you with brilliance they baffle you with bull****.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I've spent plenty of time spamming in Tacvi, and I think it's perfectly acceptable that mana is an issue there.  You think we should be floating in mana during a Tacvi fight?  You think we should be able to nonstop spam heal someone for 5 minutes?  That's a ridiculous reason why we need better mana regen, thanks.<br />
<br />
We got spiritual channeling, pained memory, ancient canni, more mana clickies, better HoT's etc.  We have 8k heals now, and I believe they made the heals take less mana.  We have the opportunity to up our FT 33% w/ OOW aas.  All of this ramped up our mana regen for newer content...<br />
<br />
I raid every night and oftentimes I'm the solo shaman in a raid or one of two.  I do everything I need to for a raid and can keep a group alive and do dps as well and spam a MT.  I think this issue may be with the shaman, not the canni.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">We have 8k heals now, and I believe they made the heals take less mana.<br />
<br />
The heals take more mana. They heal for more, but they take more mana. Yoppa's Mending was recently increased from 558 to 691 mana, and it was increased to heal 2468 HP as opposed to 1785. Even Wilslik's Mending saw a mana cost increase and a heal increase. Focused with Kanleku's arms and max healing AA's, perhaps we can crit for 8k ... but I think to say &quot;we have 8k heals now&quot; is inaccurate. <br />
<br />
As Blazz and Giac said, Cannibalization was not given the ability to scale up with our mana pools nor the mana cost of our spells. For that reason, I think it ought to remain on the list. In what form? I don't know. I like the idea of a larger Cannibalization, but to be honest, the idea of a hastened Cannibalization is just as nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">...more mana clickies, better HoT's etc. We have 8k heals now, and I believe they made the heals take less mana.

<br />
<br />
<br />
If you understood what I posted above, you'd realize that what you are saying here is an argument for an upgrade to Canni, not against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You're missing the point ribeye.  I didn't say we had a mana regen problem.  What I said is it isn't as good as it looks because almost every spell we have costs more mana than the same spell another class has and as they get bigger and better the disparity is more and more.  1100 mana every 3 min is fine but if we use more than 1100 mana over what another class uses in those 3 minutes casting the same spells, it's smoke and mirrors.  It wasn't that way when it came out.<br />
<br />
Giac said it best above.<br />

<br />
We've lost effectiveness of mana regen in relation to the other classes.  We have to stop casting debuffs/heals/dps in order to even make it work.  The AA is never going to be useless as is but it also should be built upon.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean it's our top issue but it is an issue.  You have the right to your opinion though I think it's short-sighted.</div></div><hr />

However, I still think in absolute terms we have plenty of mana regen for what we do.  But that's my opinion of course.  If I could canni faster, I sure wouldn't complain, but I don't feel the need to complain as things are, either ;)<br />
<br />
edit*  If you hadn't noticed, SOE's class reinvisioning strategy in my opinion is focussed on making classes more similar in ability, not more different.  There are more viable slowers, healers, tanks, etc.  So it would make sense from Sony's perspective to make mana regen more similar across classes as well, whether we like it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">you know you guys that run at 60% at your lowest point  are not doing all that you can ... yea if im LAZY im usually 60% or better but I find that if i bust my hump I can drain that mana pool quickly.<br />
<br />
I thing that Canni should be changed to something like drain 50% life and give 60% of that number to mana. that would make it scale indefinaetly. <br />
<br />
Yea i realize that that is a little more efficient than it previously was but most other classes dont have to spend some the mana they gained to heal them selves... I know necros do but theirs is smaller bites and constantly and usually is offset by getting a regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">One way to address the issue of scaling would be to link a new AA canni spell to the shaman's total hp at the time. Something along the lines of 10 levels, each level converting 5% health. They could also add a second aa to reduce the recast time by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% (recast AA would apply to canni5 as well). Costs could be 3AA per level, or 45 for the complete set. The spell would not be linked to canni5, and would have a base recast time of 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Something like that would allow for progressive expansion of the ability, for those who felt they needed it. Those who don't would be free to focus on other AA abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">well, scaling by percentage won't work. first and foremost reason is that it is exploitable. namely by people who carry alternate gear pieces and people with LARGE disparities between HP/Mana.<br />
<br />
even at the percentage amounts you've listed, it would start out weaker than our canni spell.<br />
<br />
just saying that specific values are needed. a hastened cannibalize is just one way, there could also be an improved cannibalize that ups the amount you bite, or improves the conversion rate. both would work towards the same end. I'm more of a fan of hastened cannibalization as it directly affects an ability I wish I could use &lt;i&gt;more often&lt;/i&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The only way to balance this is through a faster reuse, simply because upping the amount of Canni V is immenesely more powerful even if the total mana regen over time was the same.<br />
<br />
Having 1066 instant mana every minute(through hastened Canni) and having say 3198 mana available every 3 minutes means that your mana regen over time is identical, but there is no question which is more powerful if you just think at extreme situations like regaining mana after a rezz.<br />
<br />
I think that asking for a faster reuse is definitely sensible, but asking for a bigger Canni would be too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Why do we want faster canni???<br />
<br />
If you noobs really played EQ at the high end, you will find with Max FT (Including AA upgrade) + Mana clicky buff you can pick up easy in MPG trials + lvl 68 canna + Canna 5 you will have endless mana<br />
<br />
This is also excluding Druid buff, Enchanter crack, Bst crack,Mana song when you are grouped or on raid.<br />
<br />
Also most importantly we hace SC AA that is endless mana for 5 min<br />
<br />
Get a big mana pool and stop bitching. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If you'd read the thread before you crafted your rude rant, you'd know why some of us are mulling over the idea of a hastened Cannibalization AA. It's pretty clear, and several have said it. Some have said a larger Canni bite would be nice as well. Giac said it may be overpowering, and to an extent I agree. Hastened Cannibalization may well get us somewhere, and I think it would be a reasonable request. It'd sure as hell beat Hastened Rabidity for usefulness.<br />
<br />
Get a big mana pool and stop bitching.<br />
<br />
Try not to be such a rude little twit when you make posts.<br />
It might get you farther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Kazgal is indifferent to this issue becuase he can't find use for more mana, obviously.  Nothing more he can do as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I agree with Giac that a more powerful canni would be consided a bit overpowering, especially looking from the outside.  Hastened Canni would be a very nice feature.  Prob would work like the hastend curing, 10% or so for each of 3 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I would rather see a increased cannibalization than lowered reuse.<br />
<br />
Fully buffed, Canni5 barely makes a dent in my hps or mana pool.  It's still worth casting, yes, but not nearly as strong as it used to be.   If oom, Canni5 doesn't even guarantee enough mana for one Talisman of Wunshi.  <br />
<br />
Also,  everyone is so trained on the current timer that a &quot;hastened&quot; version would be much less desirable than simply cannibalizing for a larger amount (double?).  <br />
<br />
I want a cannibalization that actually makes spiritual serenity worth casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Kazgal, even in high end play, you can run out of mana. if you're actively playing your character, and not just autofollowing your raid or group around, clicking malos and slow. hell, if all I was going to do was malos and slow, I'd NEVER run out of mana, but then, I wouldn't need to canni or sit, either.<br />
<br />
#1, high end or not, spells cost more now.<br />
<br />
#2, SC is SITUATIONAL. 5 minutes of infinite mana is great, when you need to BURN your mana/hp down in a emergency situation. but 5 minutes out of an hour means nothing for over all mana regen.<br />
<br />
again, let me state, that this is NOT a broken ability. this is an ability that has been watered down through mudflation. I'd like to see it improved before it gets left behind. this is not about our Canni spell. the spell is currently slightly stronger than 1/3 of canni 5.<br />
<br />
its just my opinion, but hastened cannibalize just seems to be the best avenue.<br />
<br />
(now...what to call it... &quot;Mustard&quot; or &quot;Catsup&quot;?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">hastened canni is a great idea, no canni 5 isnt broke atm, but it is loosing its effectiveness nowdays with 2500 mana spells to cast, and 1500 mana champ to upkeep, and pather...well you know.  hell we also need hastened MGB, like other classes got who only have 2 spells to buff....</div></div><hr />
