<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't use any UI mods.. just 3 windows, and all the normal stuff.. and after patch my windows keep getting moved around everytime I zone..<br />
<br />
<br />
here's what they are like:<br />
my buffs window is stretched across the top of my screen.. I have my 3 chat windows on the bottom.. 2 of them I have it so you cant see the line that you type on, cause I use them for melee/spells...    <br />
<br />
now when I zone.. the buff window is pushed way to the left, so only about 1/4 of it shows.. and both windows that I have the typing line hidden with are pushed up so I'm forced to see the typing area.. which gets makes them get in the way of my target, and group windows :\<br />
<br />
anyone else having a problem like this? Or know how to fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My ui broke, that's all I had time to see this morning.<br />
<br />
I hate having to redo ui's after every single damn patch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, my custom UI is all screwed up after today's patch, and what annoys me even more is that they included no patch message that even tells what UI files they changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there was a in game GM message, says to correct it type /loadskin and choose default, not your custom one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen that /loadskin default message numerous times and I frankly don't want to have to use their stupid defaut UI after every patch.  I thought the whole point of the feature was that we would be able to customize our UI's without having them be broken after every patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The UI I use works ok, and I think it will at least function no matter what SoE does to the default UI/ I use Draks from eqinterface.com. It's a fairly major change from the default. Basically the entire UI is re-written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually I am having the same problems as you have Rokkeb.  My hot keys bar and my buff bar seems to move a bit after I zone.  Not only that, i have died three times tonight for various reasons, and the item that is in my last inventory slot always disappears (first two times it was my sow boots, last time a rod).  It will stay on my corpse, so I end up having to just click out of it, then just click back in it and it's there...but still freaked me out the first time that it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you keep your UI windows away from the edge of the viewable area they won't get moved when you zone. From what I've heard if any of your windows touch the edge of the screen the game thinks they are offscreen and moves them for you. I moved all my windows closer the the center by 5 pixels or so and they haven't moved since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Noticed this last night on a Hole raid.... my Pet window was completely GONE.  I would turn it on and off, it just was not there..couldn't find it anywhere.  Looked under all my other windows, etc.  I happened after I zoned in.  I even tried going into the UI file and changing the location manually, but it still won't show...  <br />
<br />
I use the Drak mix as well for my UI, and til now it was worked great... but not having my pet window there is a real pain.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I'm seriously hoping I don' thave to load up the default UI again &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zardson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since last patch, i don't have the compas windows anymore.<br />
I don t know what is the cause. I use loadskin default to restore to original setting, in hope to get it back, but no luck<br />
<br />
The strange thing is on my other characters, the compas is there.<br />
If anybody has a idea how to solve this problem, let me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Basically what happened is that any window on the left side of the screen got a position value of negative one as it was explained to me. So every time you zone or die, it yanks it over even further. The fix was mentioned above, move all your windows a little way away from the left side of the screen. Seemed to work for me. As far as reovering your lost windows, I don't know if that's possible until they patch. I know you if you switch to default UI you should be able to find it but it may be lost permanently in your custom UI. If there's a way to edit the location of it in a file that may work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I lost my inventory window after it moved a bit left each time I opened and closed it. Tried everything to get it back (load default, editted eqclient) Then after trying to open and close it a bunch it suddenly appeared on the right and started moving left again.<br />
<br />
I would try opening closing the lost windows around 30 times.<br />
<br />
Then I had to make sure no windows were touching the edge like others mentioned above to stop it from recurring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have the same problem with my windows  that I keep on the left (spell bar and hotkeys) moving partially off screen when I zone.  I haven't tried moving them a bit further away from the edge.  I will try that tonight when I get home.  I did /bug it by the way.<br />
Thanks for the info on the work-around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Has anyone tried hand-editing the file?<br />
<br />
UI_charactername_##.ini, where ## is the server number and 'charactername' is your character name.<br />
<br />
There should be a line XPos1024x768=? in there, or whatever your resolution is.  If it's negative, change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, btw, I got around the problem by changing resolutions.  I now run in 1152xwhatever resolution, one higher than my old 1024x768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lost my lootbox after a while of playing last night. (default ui)<br />
<br />
/loadskin default <br />
<br />
got it back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From what I've heard editing the ini files will not help because the client is failing to read the UI after the initial log in, hence the windows keep jumping around to positions other than the one saved in your ini file. The only fix I've been able to find is the one I posted above. Keep your windows about 5 pixels away from the edge and they won't move.</div></div><hr />
