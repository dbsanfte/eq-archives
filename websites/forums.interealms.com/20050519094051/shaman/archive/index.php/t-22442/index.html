A %T is so slow it's gonna grow up to live in a VAN down by the RIVER! <br />

Plus having the words show up as a hotlink has massive advantages in a raid situation: you really get your message across.<br />
<br />
Insert the appropriate raid channel / group channel before we start, then use the following macros on my hotbbuttons:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I generally dont call slows.  Im a shaman; its what I do and people kind of expect it.<br />
<br />
That said, there are a few times when I call slows:<br />
<br />
 When I am using Tigirs and its very possible that I will have up to 4 mobs beating on me.  Usually a heads up for the cleric (if there is one) or backup healer(if Im MH) to start a heal<br />
 I call slow after a resist and then a stick.  Only places I get a lot of resisted slows are Takish Hiz LDoN's, East wing BoT and Hates Fury.  Go figure...<br />
 If Im in a pick up group with people Ive never met before.  I'll usually call slows for the first 8 or so pulls, then stop and follow the rules listed above.  Just to let them know I'm getting the job done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of these slow messages are really nice though...and I love Murtak's INC spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have 2:<br />
<br />
My normal slow message is:   /3 %t has been slowed.<br />
<br />
Rarely used in groups, and on raids I send it to the Shaman channel (again infrequently).<br />
<br />
My other slow uses Gangaskan's method in /rsay.  I only use it on the boss mobs, and if another shaman calls the slow in shaman chat without announcing it /rsay on the boss mob I'll hit it.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
PS I dont use a canni message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">slowing -=[ %t ]=- ...LOADING PLEASE WAIT...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I rarely call slows, but when i do, i manually type /g %t has been slowed.  I cut out the 'has been' if I really need to, but that's not really an issue, as I type 180 cwpm and it all happens real fast.  I find the only situations I usually call slows in these days are if we happen to get more than 2 mobs on a pull in an LDoN for some reason, so I can call as I progress through different mobs, and if I get more than one resist... just to make sure they don't think I'm asleep on the job :)<br />
<br />
On raids, however, I do have a macro and I have included level of the slow ever since I raided when PoP first came out and I was not yet max, and the text flowed out into the shaman raid channel.  The macro itself is very bland and informative, as would be expected on a raid.<br />
<br />
On a separate note, I also type /say before everything I say, and /g before every group message... don't know why, but I always have, and always will... I think it was from back in Beta 4 when I kept mixing up autotell to group and say and just started typing everything out manually.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've even held full conversations while running away from a train full speed, and also had some hilarious mistells with fast-firing R key for reply.  I always hit enter before I catch them.<br />
<br />
Long macro'd texts bug me when people use them constantly... I've even run into a few shaman with text macros for canni IV, ugh, one of them stopped when I asked, the other I actually had to put on ignore.  Also ran into a druid who had a text macro for heal that he'd mash while waiting for puller to come into range on LDoN (guess he wanted to top him off BEFORE the fight... he was kinda nutty...) spamtastic...  too bad on an LDoN you're stuck with 'em till the end.<br />
<br />
As for the poll, there's no spot to fill in &quot;I have no slow message,&quot; so I didn't put in a vote :(</div></div><hr />

While playing my ranger the shaman in the group hit canni 5.&quot;Canni&quot; was his message before casting it.<br />
<br />
Soon as his health went down cleric whacked a supernal elixir or whatever on him proceeded by the shaman running around in circles saying<br />
<br />

I used to have 5 or 6 different &quot;cute&quot; ones, but I dont use them anymore. <br />
<br />
About the only thing that changes about my slow message is what channels it goes into. We have recently moved all de-buff messages on raids to their own channel, and I dont auto-join that channel, heh, so I have to change it each raid if I dont join the channels in the right order.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of naming the spell used in your message now. I think I will make that as a suggestion for my guild. We have a few who have the new slow, and it gets confusing on raids to see your slow overwritten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have a macro that says (/rs or /g) %t has been slowed and my resist message is simply %t resisted slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hail,<br />
<br />
Hotkey is setup something like this:<br />
/3 *** %t SLOWED 75% ***<br />
/gsay slowed %t.<br />
<br />
The channel # in the first line changes according to whether the raidleader (I do alot of pickup raids) wants slows announced in /rsay, the healer channel (for bosses), or the shaman channel.  On trash I rarely announce it at all anymore.  The only thing announcing on trash does (besides spam the raid) is show everyone I'm awake. :p  I use the triple asterisks to separate my announcement from others.<br />
<br />
In groups I generally only announce it when there multiples incoming so the rest of the group can prioritize targets for cc/OT'ing &amp; the healers will know who needs their attention most.  I use the same hotkey and just put up with the &quot;you are not in that channel&quot; spam.<br />
<br />
If I get multiple resists I'll often announce when slow finally lands in group as well.  Pickup groups I'll usually announce the first few until I determine whether the main healer has a clue or not.  If he does I'll drop my announcement, if he doesn't I'll keep it up while looking for a replacement for myself. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">In groups or clearing trash mobs on a raid, normally I don't bother.

&quot;%T resisting slow... but resistance is futile it'll die soon anyway&quot;<br />

I tanked an LDON with my Warrior the other day. I noticed directly when a mob was slow or not. Maybe thats because i think like a shaman and pay attention to animation rythm...</div></div><hr />

That way it's easy to pick out messages in the middle of a fight. Too many people try to come up with cutesy lines for their spell announcements or they add in tons of *'s, &gt;&lt;'s, or the like. Makes it hard to pick out what's actually going on in the middle of a fight.<br />

If CHC member know for sure that the target is slowed, they can adjust their workload accordingly, and how the heck are they going to notice it if you do not announce it? Yeah, as a shaman I can look at the mob as it fights and tell whether it's slowed or not, but that's because I am a shaman and have extensive experience with slow, can't expect CHC members have the same experience. Not to mention that their job is not to look how the mob fights, but how the HP's move. As for the message, I try to keep it simple enough to not create too much spam, but also make it clear enough that it WILL BE seen, so it's like: <br />
<br />
.................... %t .................... is SLOWED!<br />

Not the most original one, I agree, but at least its still informative, easy to notice and delivers the message :)<br />
<br />
For Canni 5, I at first didn't announce it, but in the end I had to create the message, because as soon as I hit it, healers went into panic and started to spam &quot;CH on Banadan, don't die on me!&quot; and yadda yadda.. No matter how many times I told them that I am perfectly OK and that it's just Canni 5. Bleh. So I made the hotkey finally, which just simply tells &quot;Don't panic! It's intentional! Just Canni 5..&quot; At least it stopped the healers from jumping out of their trousers every time I use Canni 5.</div></div><hr />

No capital letters, no random punctuation, but the eeeeerrrrry and eeeeeepy grab attention well enough without making it hard to find the  capitals and random punctuation that might be more important.  And people sometimes find it amusing.  If a group is plowing through stuff without any semblance of difficulty, I'll sometimes stop using it except on nameds.  Unless I'm bored to tears, as happens in some ldons, and want the extra half second's worth of stuff to do.<br />

<br />

plus a copy of the same in the shaman channel for use with the few mobs where it's worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
No canni message.  If they can't figure it out from my health abruptly dropping to one point and stopping, and seeing no critters on me, then we have bigger problems.
