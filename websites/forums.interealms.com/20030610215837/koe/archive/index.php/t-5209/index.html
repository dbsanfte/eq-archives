<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone wanna move to the Iowa City area? :)  This house at realtor.com MLS#: 20020035 is a great house and it is selling for a lot cheaper than most of the houses in the area. Iowa is a great place :).<br />
<br />
I just had friends move to New Jersey and they have been trying to sell their house in Iowa and they haven't had much luck. If you know anyone that would want to move there please let me know, it is a nice house and it has lots of room, storage, and and in a very nice neighborhood. I tried to get Cane to buy it but he wanted to be able shoot pheasants off the front porch and unfortunately there isn't a lot of pheasants but there are golfers nearby.</div></div><hr />

My friends have five children and they outgrew it but the upstairs bedrooms are very big as well as roomy closets. I got to housesit for them for 2 weeks. I loved it, especially the jacuzzi tub. :)</div></div><hr />

Actually I was looking to move to Iowa 2 years ago because some of my best friends moved because of jobs with Rockwell... but they are moving back to Wichita in about 3 weeks, so I'm gonna stick around for the moment :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
p.s. I'd take the shotgun... handguns look so small and dinky... :p</div></div><hr />
