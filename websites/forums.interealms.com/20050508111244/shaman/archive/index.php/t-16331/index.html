Gives some augmentations / spells and how many points they cost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First time that I have heard that points are tied to the camps at which you start the adventures.  Not completely tied, but apparently the maximum that you can spend (one a single purchase) in one camp is based on points earned there.  <br />
<br />
So to buy a 510 point item you would have to do at least 10 adventures in that camp.<br />
<br />
Also - you cannot see the entire inventory and drool over the big ticket items before deciding how to spend/hoard yer points.  Will have to get that info from web sites.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden this does not look like just a place to go when you have only a couple of hours to play.  It is a place you will have to grind to get that copy of Greater Remove Curse or of Bane.   <br />
<br />
Those who can and do play a lot (notice I avoided the word &quot;uber&quot;) will be able to upgrade their gear and get the spells - quickly.  I will get them too - eventually.  This is actually more fair than most expansions.  No requirement to be in a large raiding guild, so I will have the opportunities.  I am just surprised.<br />
<br />
LoY proved that  agood idea could be ruined by keeping effects too weak (charms, before opening Tier 2 and 3 based on levels).<br />
<br />
LDoN seems to antivipate, and make better stuff available, if you put in the time.  Wait?  Did that mean time sink?  where have I heard that before?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Points you earn can be spent anywhere. So if you did not spend those 510 points, and then went and did 10 more adventures in Mistmoore, you would have a total of 1020 points. You could spend all 1020 of those points at either the butherblock or south ro camps, but you would not be able to buy any one item that cost more than 510 points from either one. If you saved your points, and then you then did two adventures in Miragul's, you would have 1122 points unspent, but would not be able to buy anything more expensive than 102 points at the everfrost camp. You could buy 11 100 point items if you wanted there, but nothing that cost more.     I hate to throw in with the naysayer crowd, but the above system sounds both lame and hard to understand.  Why would you only have one pool of points if you couldn't spend them wherever points are accepted?<br />
<br />
It's kind of like having a Visa with a 1000 dollar limit, but only being able to spend 250 at Target, 400 at Nordstrom, 300 at Walmart, and 50 at Sears.  Why wouldn't you just get a $250.00 target card, etc?<br />
<br />
Should be interesting to see how it plays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do not quote me but I beleive they mentioned something about Faction with the merchant by performing tasks for the associated guild.<br />
<br />
Thus, under that theory, your &quot;faction&quot; would allow you to see the merchants inventory and you can spend your &quot;pool&quot; anywhere.<br />
<br />
So they give you 1 faction point for every adventure point with the merchants associated with the adventure.<br />
<br />
With 510 Type_A points and 510 Type_B points you would be able to buy anything up to 510 points off Type_A merchants and Type_B merchants using your total pool of 1020 adventure points.<br />
<br />
Thus you could buy 2 - 510 pt items from Type_A merchant or Type_B merchant.<br />
<br />
In the end it means you have to build up good faction with each merchant to access the complete list of what they have to offer but you can spend your &quot;adventure points&quot; on whatever you can see in any available list.<br />

<br />
Jahvah, I think what the statement is saying is that, using your analogy, you still have a $1000 Visa limit, but at Target, you can only buy items costing upto $250, so you could get, for example, 4 items costing $250 each (not just the one for $250 you seem to indicate). If you chose to go to Walmart, you'd only be able to buy items which cost upto $300, but any combination of items costing $300 or less each, totaling upto your &quot;credit&quot; amount ($1000). The more you adventure in a particular theme, the more costly items you can buy. That's what the statements I've read thus far seem to indicate. But haven't been yet so can't confirm... Anyone able to do this for us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The interesting thing is about the faction is that you do not lose it when you spend your points; i.e, if I earn 500 pts at Miraguls, I have locked in forever a spending authority of at least 500 at Miraguls, even after those points have been spent.  This creates an incentive to get your spending authority high at each camp, since it is a permanent faction boost for your character.<br />
<br />
This is a bit discouraging when you are saving up for your first big purchase, because you have zero spending authority at other camps.  But if you take the long view of saving up for and buying many items over the next few months, you should be able to get some high faction in all of the camps, just by spreading around the locations where you earn your points.<br />
<br />
I predict folks will talk about their faction numbers, just like they do now about how many AA's they have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also, if you stay at one camp long enough to get alot of points, you will get to know the dungeons very well indeed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The XP is &quot;reasonable&quot;.  It was definitely not as good as BoT, HoH, or Tactics but it was not what I would consider unacceptable, given that decent items were dropping and adventure points were also awarded.  I would rate the experience somewhere in the PoV-range at level 65, but all things considered thats not bad.  I completed an AA point tonight (plus about half of another) in two adventures (one of which we failed on and one of which we succeeded on).  That's acceptable to me.</div></div><hr />

Back on the topic..FT 2 augment? Nice! Anger 1-2-3? SWEET! Slap that unresistable 300hate proc on any weapon(enough to make even a warrior that's been retired almost a year drool!).<br />
<br />
I'm rather anxious to see the 1k+ items from miraguls given the FT augment. And where are the HP augments? I see mana...</div></div><hr />

Press ALT-V...in game it brings up the current leaderboard...you can see how you rank compared to the whole server...wins vs losses...total adventures done...pretty cool if you like to compete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/ooc 65 CLASS X LFG, number 3 in Miragul!<br />
<br />
<br />
  And instantly the cautious person who NEVER takes a group that isn't ideal and is therefore unable to cope without Virt, C5 and otherwise perfect conditions looks like he is a better player than the ones who were out there exploring and losing on the first day cause they didn't know yet.   Or the ones who were frequently forced to leave adventures to go to a raid.<br />
<br />
  I truth though, such a person who only does ideal groups probably doesn't know anything about how to handle the hard situations that arise in odd formed groups, like pulling 5 mobs with 1 tank and no enchie.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I really hope that people don't start thinking that the leaderboards equate to capability.   But they sure started thinking that with AA points :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The leaderboard will be a fun toy to look at, but I can hardly see it turning into something meaningful.

I'm with ya. According to Allakhazam, my Cleric's Epic only has 1 type 1 slot...***? They could easily have used this as a way to let people make their Epic a weapon of choice again...but didn't. (Assuming Allakhazam is correct, of course)<br />
<br />
Before anyone says anything, yes...out of all the Epics, Clerics still have an awesome reward. I am certainly not saying he needs a better rez or additional effect...but better stats or damage would be nice.<br />
<br />
For some of the other classes...it would be a great boon to be able to boost their Epics up beyond the amount allowed to other 'normal' weapons. It wouldn't have 'cost' SOE anything, and would have helped curb the complaints people have that Epics have fallen behind in the times.<br />
<br />
Mmmmm..I'd love to toss a minor lifetap and a FT III on my Water Sprinkler. Maybe a damage proc similar to my RIF and a Regen III or FT III on a Shaman epic?</div></div><hr />

That will fit onto our epic.  Our epic stats - Slot 1, Type 4.  So, it will take any augment, that is type 4 (not slot 4).  Same goes with the EB items, Ultravision items, Regen Items, etc.   The type numbers are what your matching, not the slot :)   Anyways, disregard this if old news :)<br />

/thread hijack on<br />
As has been stated numerous times here and on nearly every other EQ board, weapon delay has zero to do with how often a proc goes off.  A 20 delay weapon will swing more times in a given time period than a 50 delay weapon yet they will both have the same number of procs as the proc works on a percentage over time, not a percentage per swing.<br />

And yes, I want a lifetap proc for my Windblade that will stack with the sk's buff lifetap proc. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just to play devil's advocate here a little bit, you've gotta watch what you read about augments on other boards.  Lots of people still don't realize that a lot of these items have class and equipment slot restrictions.  <br />
<br />
For instance, that Vampyre's Kiss augment *just might* be secondary only  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hehe, i must of confused some people.   I just used that vampire's kiss as an example (for the difference between slot and type is all).... I wouldnt put it on anything I own, or even buy it, was just trying to explain the difference between the two (slot and type).  Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
Every Slot, on a piece of gear, has a *type* next to it.  So not only do you have to make sure it's a Slot 1 augment,  you have to make sure they type matches too (in some cases).  So that Vampire's kiss, is Type 4 (not slot 4), so will go in ANY slot, but only those that take Type 4 (which I would safely bet is only for weapons).  Am I making better sense yet? :)<br />

<br />
This is vague enough to the point of being grossly inaccurate. There are other factors which affect proc rate, namely wielder dex, and the innate &quot;procability&quot; of the weapon. Look at the Blade of War, or those hand of the god cleric hammers which proc every other swing. If the augments are designed to not proc very often, then they aren't going to proc very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Arriana,<br />
What he's refering to is how with Dex and Using an item with the same proc rate (same purchast enhancement on both a fast and slow weapon) you will get the same number of procs per minute.<br />
<br />
Quick example....<br />
SK 1 has a windblade (50/44) and casts his life tap proc on himself.<br />
3 minute fight the proc went off 6 times.<br />
<br />
SK 1 Upgrades to a Hammer of crushing waves (19/20) and casts his life tap proc on himself.<br />
3 minute fight the proc went off 6 times. <br />
<br />
*shrug* keep the Str/Attack/Dex/weapon skill level at the same for both fights and these procs go off the same number of times per fight.<br />
