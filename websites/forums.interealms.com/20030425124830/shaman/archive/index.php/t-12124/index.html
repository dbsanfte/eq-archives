<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent a great deal of time and money on my first account, getting all my tradeskills to 190+ for the shawl quests.  It was fun for a while, but by time I finished, I hated them.<br />
<br />
Now, with the 8th shawl in game (not now, as in the shawl is new, but now, as in now that I'm playing again with a new account and there was no 8th shawl when I quit), is it worth the hassle of having to skill everything back up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if its better than what your wearing its worth it<br />
<br />
only 2 tradeskills that are real time sinks are smihting and tailoring, with bazaar in effect you can buy most of the subcombines you need</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really only you can answer your worth question. And yes really the only hard skills are tailoring and smithing, but with enough plat they can be made much easier albiet still horridly boring to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I guess my question is, is it worth putting the time/money into it compared to items that could be purchased in the bazaar for nearly the same ammount (i.e. ODS, or planar drops).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You already got all tradeskills, having the 8th shoudnt be really hard. Buy the pelts, and go exp in WL for the gems ;)<br />
<br />
If your guild is able to reach tier 3+ planes, i would say no. If your guild can kill cursed / emperor un ssra, i would say no. Otherwise yes<br />
<br />
FT 3 + best duration focus for buffs in game are worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't have any tradeskills now.  That was on my old account, so I'd have to start over from scratch.  I guess I'll just try to break it up and do a little at a time, so I don't burn myself out on it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think there is any droppable loot that you can buy in Bazaar that comes close to the uberness of the 8th shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am working on the 6th, but the 8th is not truly that far away because both smithing 185 and tailoring 160 are in reasonable shape.<br />
<br />
If you don't like doing trade skills, then I would just forget about doing the shawl quests.  It may be a great item for that slot but only if you get the 8th and it has a horible time / reward ratio compared to other things you could do to improve your charachter.<br />
<br />
I love working on trade skills so the shawl quests are fantastic and a great way of giving additional meaning to a part of the game I already find entertaining.  Lots of poeple in my guild just think I am crazy / stupid but this is a game and about having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
Yes, the 8th shawl is worth it.<br />
70% buff extension (with 50% coming from SCR3 &amp; SCRM) means:<br />
SLTW lasts 27.2 minutes.<br />
Blessing of Replenishment lasts 34 minutes and change.<br />
Focus of Sould lasts 2 hours and 14 minutes!<br />
Endurance of Boar lasts over 2 hours!<br />
Torpor extended by 70%!!!<br />
<br />
That's worth it to me irrespective of the inherent stats (which excepting AC, are decent) on the shawl.<br />
<br />
You know what you are in store for.  HOURS &amp; hours of mindless clicking.<br />
But you can do baking, brewing, pottery, and jewelcraft in a single night for each.  Smithing &amp; Tailoring are the only ones that are difficult, and even those can be powerskilled w/ funds.  There are ways to MQ certain aspects of the quest as well, though I don't advise that personally.<br />
<br />
There are many alternative shoulder slot items that have better stats, but few with the outstanding benefits of 20% buff extension on all your spells *plus* the bonus of FT3.<br />
<br />
Good luck whatever you choose,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe torpor is exempt from the shawl's effect because it has a duration limitation on it. Search the boards, its been debated many times. I can check tonite for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shawl only affects buffs with a duration of 48s or greater.  Torpor has a duration of 24s and thus is unaffected by the shawl... would be nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you don't like doing trade skills, then I would just forget about doing the shawl quests. <br />
<br />
I did love tradeskills, but I burnt myself out on them.  At least for a while.  I GM'd pottery and got every other skill up to 190+ with Necosi; and on Dooke, I GM'd smithing and was working on getting the rest of his skills caught up.<br />
<br />
I think I've decided, though, that the FT alone would be worth the effort.  The focus is a nice bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dyrk,<br />
<br />
Congrats on the path you have chosen.<br />
<br />
I personly think the 8th shawl is one of the gratest possible personal eq goals to acheive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
You are right.  No shawl twinkle/glow/whatever on Torpor.  Dunno why I thought it did. :p  I didn't actually test Torpor by taking the shawl off &amp; on &amp; measuring HP healed each time btw.  I'll do that sometime just to verify beyond a shadow of a doubt.  The lack of shawl activation was proof enough for me.<br />
<br />
/em eats humble pie.  :eek: <br />
8th Shawl is still AWESOME. :D<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It really depends.<br />
It is definitely not a simple task. Especially when you starting out from scratch. Even the easy trade skills take an investment of time and some money to get them up to the level you want them at to do the shawls threw the 8th.<br />
<br />
But for alot of people the shawl is equal to or better than anything else they could every get for that slot. Ft3, 20% buff extension, nice stats and hps/mana. Pretty hard to match peice unless your at least in Vt if not tier 3 in PoP.<br />
<br />
As far as tayloring and smithing goes since you probably worked with them. Smithing has gotten harder since the trivals where changed and banded now trivials out at 115 instead of 175.<br />
Tayloring on the other hand has gotten easier with the ribbons from LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Has anyone confirmed that SCRM + 8th shawl = 70% longer buffs?<br />
<br />
Last time I saw a thread on it some people said yes and some said no buff extension caps at 50%....<br />
<br />
I have an 8th shawl but now my guild is in VT I might consider upgrading when I get SCRM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">theres no god danm 50% cap on buff extention  .. cant belive people start/belive these stupid rumors ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thank you Ceno :)<br />
<br />
That was exactly the type of reply I was hoping for.<br />
<br />
Now I don't have to worry about putting a new shoulder item in my wish lists....... well maybe!<br />
I was thinking of trying to get the VT item that extends Torpor.<br />
<br />
Edit: Holy Shi.t man you got 335 AA's! Jebus!</div></div><hr />
