<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have my epic and an extra tear.  I knew about the faction hit for the final turn-in, so I went to do Woe/Envy to top it off.  I was Indifferent to these guys!?!<br />
<br />
Does that mean I have to do the whole quest again to MQ this tear?<br />
<br />
Also, a guildie told me they changed it so that the tear turn-in is no good if you already have your epic.  Is that true?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">TS factions is TOTALLY reset when you do Rak turnin. MQ is still possible but for each MQ you must farm TS faction until it is max ally by repeating some part of the quest over and over or going through it completely again.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about this but the recipient of the MQ might also have to faction farm to max TS faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally got my epic the other day, and my TS faction wasn't reset until I did the final turnin to the spirit sentinel in EJ and actually received my spear of fate.  I was ally when I handed the tear to Rak, and i was ally before I handed the scale to the spirit sentinel.<br />
<br />
So, for the MQ to work, you will have to get to ally to do the turnin to Rak, and your friend will have to get to ally to do the final turnin in EJ to receive their epic.  Not certain  if max ally is required, but if you're gonna take the time to raise faction, might as well max it to avoid any problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pf yeah whatever it gets reset somewhere at the end. the point is he has completed it and has his spear so the faction is at ground 0</div></div><hr />
