<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have my lvl 51 shammy and my lvl 52 monk which has the tranquil staff.  Thus far, between my shamans slow and her pet, and the monks nice DPS with haste items, I have have the greatest of success in leveling with my 2 boxing dream team.  As long as my shammy could get off slows to all mobs i have taken on as much as 4 mobs in KC at 1 time. and both my pet and my monk live with 1/4 of mana left.  I tend to get people like tanks wanting to join me in KC, then i tend to be a healer, with great success..   I have never had 1 wipe out in KC doing this method, however i have had to zone 3 times.  (this is pulling to the zone area most of the time, i have taken tower and rcy as well.)<br />
<br />
Now i have noticed that my exp is moving much slower.  My main computer has all expasions.  My second computer has up to POP, however the velious,Luclin, &amp; PoP  expansions are the same disk as my first computer, hince i cant regester them.  I have been in velious with both computers.  I plan to make a no name lvl 1 and TP a char to PoK to see if i can reach that area without getting stuck.   <br />
<br />
Any ideas as to where i can go for my monk and shammy, hopefuly a area with added % of exp to help boost my exp yield per kill.</div></div><hr />

Veksar is for lovers.   :D <br />
<br />
Dulak can be fun as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nurga might be alright as well, although I haven't been there since the revamp to confirm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get LoY for both comp if you didnt already and go to gulf of gunthak. start farming the boats. (any boat that you can solo, about 8 boats ? goes weak boats to strong boats right to left i think) good loot and ok exp have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree on Dulak as the place to go for you. I went from around 48 to around 56 there + I got 8 AA points. It was easy exp + I got over 50K.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could try the zoneline in Chardok, burning woods at the giant fort, skyfire mobs will get you some spell drops. Sebilis is always fun. Could try CoM as well, but I haven't been there since the revamp. Howling stones might be fun for you too. Some good Kunark era suggestions for you.</div></div><hr />
