<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just turned 58 and was wondering, what is the best use for Tigirs? I remember reading it's one of those &quot;limeted to four mobs&quot; spells, it that correct? And what kind of a resist rate can I expect?<br />
Those bug traps in DN sound like a prime candidate for that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best thing about this spell is that it draws very little agro. Can also use it as an OH **** spell if your puller pulls a few too many, being able to stick slow on 4 mobs quick can make or break the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When to use tigirs is one of those questions you honestly don't have to ask.  You'll KNOW when hehe.  When you have 8 giants laying the smackdown on your group use it.  When you are in Seb and you're surrounded by froggies layin the smack down on you use it etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because it's not a spell you're going to keep memmed all the time, it's hard to use in emergency situations like that. You can use it when you know you're group is going to be pulling multiple mobs, and killing them fast. I've used mine in an AE group in Fungus Grove, and also in the trials in Plane of Justice, that's it. If your puller is getting a lot of adds, you could mem it, cast it first and then individually slow everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep its pretty handy for PoJ trials.<br />
<br />
Also handy for when a non-monk is pulling and brings a few friends back.<br />
<br />
However.... don't cast it &quot;just for a laugh&quot; on a bunch of hard-hitting mobs as if you get more than 1 resist you are toast.<br />
<br />
Typically the below scene can happen sometimes...<br />
<br />
&quot;You begin casting Tirgir's insects&quot;<br />
&quot;&lt;X&gt; Resisted&quot;<br />
&quot;&lt;X&gt; Yawns&quot;<br />
&quot;&lt;X&gt; Resisted&quot;<br />
&quot;&lt;X&gt; Resisted&quot;<br />
<br />
That gives you the &quot;uh-oh&quot; feeling as you prepare to have your ass handed to you.<br />
<br />
Get ready to root or recast Tirgir's fast, alternatively ask for a heal early and then recast Tirgir's to help save the healer long enough for you to heal them....<br />
At 60+ Pre-torporing before casting Tirgir's can help in tough spots (like PoJ trials).<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to being a higher level soon and getting even less resists.<br />
<br />
On trials (or elsewhere), if you've maxed evocation, let rip an AE rain just after the AE slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tigir's is basically and AoE rain spell limited to a maximum of 4 mobs.  Resist rates vary depending on the mobs MR.  I never bother trying to Malo/Malosini any mobs I am going to Tigir's.  Basically, if I have it loaded I cast it first followed up with a Tugur's if needed.  It is very situational.  I've used in Juggs, PoJ trials, powerleveling some friends for an afternoon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the bests uses I have found for it, is on King runs in chardok. Where you have a bunch of mele around 4-6 mobs. I just target the MT and cast it on him so that it gets the mobs around him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah I used Tigirs properly for the first time over the weekend ... we were heading down to the Chardok royals and pulling 2-4 mobs at a time on the way down there.<br />
<br />
Even though the enchanters were good, and stuff was being mezzed quite quickly, having the whole bunch 50% slowed from the start really helps if mez is resisted. And plus it just looks way cool to announce to the raid channel &quot;%t and his little friends are slowed!&quot;<br />
<br />
After hitting the bunch with tigirs, I would then run round and individually turgurs the mobs one by one ... and by the time they were dead I'd canni'd back enough mana for the next bunch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In some zones while raiding, my guild rushes insanely about trying to do as much as possible in as short a time.  In PoF they will pull 4-12 mobs at once, last night in PoN they pulled 10 assorted hobgoblins in one pull, in chardok heading to the royals, a pull of 6-10 isn't uncommon.  In these situations, we depend muchly on the chanters, but AE slow helps HUGE.  I got 8 Hobs slowed by about the 3rd tugur's message giving the raid time and mana to organise and deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ugsomecur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">omg how embarrassing...<br />
<br />
I really don't do much research on the mechanics of EQ, and normally I seem to bumble along pretty well.  I'm old and slow in RL and don't have much time that I can spend on it, and if I do have free time I'd rather dive right in and play.<br />
<br />
But after reading this thread I realized that Tigir's is not a simple upgrade to Turgur's, as I had assumed.  I've been a level 58 for about a month now, and immediately memmed Tigir's in place of Turgur's and have used it exclusively ever since.  Had no freaking clue it was area effect slow, although now I realize that all those resist messages I saw were not game bugs nor my warrior partner's Wavecrasher proccing.  Geesh, and all the beatings I took!  <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
/em packs his bags and heads off to the Retirement Home for Senile Old Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OK on Tigir's, I rarely use this spell.  Here is why:<br />
1. Hunting the big mobs I find they resist it more often.<br />
2. The slow is only 50 percent.<br />
3. Enchanter normally has most mobs mezzed and i just star assisting off the enchanter for slows.<br />
<br />
Now where it would be useful would be like Guk and maidens eye on the aliens, maybe even the caves in Umbral plains.  Usually when I do my aoe work I like to have them in a narrow spot.  But that is what I have found works best for me.  Oh and just wait until 61, cloud of grummus spell rocks (40 percent disease slow) rather than Plague of insects at (25 percent).  This is an extreme diference when slowing those disease based slow only mobs in ToV.<br />
<br />
I think we did pretty well, as far as a class goes with the introduction of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I found Tigirs invaluable in the 10th ring war yesterday. what aggro i did get was easily taken off me and i helped EVERYONE greatly. made me feel very useful untill the last wave where it was getting resisted.<br />
<br />
BTW , data rate 9.0 is god</div></div><hr />
