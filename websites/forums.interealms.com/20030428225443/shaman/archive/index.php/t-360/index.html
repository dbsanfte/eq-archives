<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This poor guy had &quot;issues&quot; before he ever logged on for the first time.  His mom needs to grab some sack and look in the mirror.<br />

Insofar as being &quot;sexually anorexic&quot; - speaking on behalf of the heterosexual male community -<br />
<br />
There isn't a man alive on this planet who thinks:  You know, I'm getting too much sex. Darn it ! <br />
<br />
You could be shot, bleeding, and if a hottie walks by you'd think: 'Man, if I wasn't sitting here with a bullet in my leg - I'd do her. Wonder if I can bandage this thing up?'<br />
<br />
Now we may be physically incapable at that moment of making the beast with the two backs, but I'll be darned if I ever thought I was getting too much.<br />
<br />
Oh jotd: <br />
<br />
Q: What do single and married men both think about the other guy?<br />
<br />
A: That he's getting more than they are.<br />
<br />
Sucks that that guy had problems leading him to suicide, but blaming EQ is not the answer. Nor is a lawsuit seeking money.</div></div><hr />
