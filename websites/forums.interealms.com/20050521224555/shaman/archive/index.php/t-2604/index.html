<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if anyone knows some stats of the new smithed armors for large folks? EQtrader has only the bracer and boots.<br />
<br />
Im surprised there isnt much interest in getting these armor for shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's little interest because the cultured plate is better than Planes gear, but cultured chain isn't. It's those magic numbers that follow the letters AC that get the most attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The chain stuff isnt all that great. I was kinda disappointed when i looked at the stats. The plate on the other hand is freaking incredible, my SK is wearing some of the smithed stuff over Skyshrine armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While the smithed cultural plate armour is near or on par with the Kael/SS-Armour, most of the chain armour lacks a bit. But there are some chain-items worth having a look at:<br />
<br />
Crimson Darksplint Bracelet (OGR, SHM, Rallos Zek):<br />
AC 12, WIS 5, HP 30, Mana 30, All resists 5<br />
<br />
Compare it to the Kael-Armour:<br />
<br />
Spirit Callers Bracer<br />
AC 17 AC, 3 STA, 4 WIS, 15 Mana, Effect Ultrvision<br />
<br />
Yes, you lose 5 AC, but gain Mana, HPs, and resists.<br />
<br />
I smithed the bracelet yesterday, and happily replaced my Spirit Callers Bracer with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now look at the smithed Chain belt:<br />
AC 15, WIS 5, HP 40, Mana 40<br />
<br />
Compare it to the girdle of reflection:<br />
AC 12 AC, WIS 6, HP 35<br />
<br />
Some items are worth a look i would say. Now if only the designers would add 2 or 3 AC to the boots, arms or helmet they really would be marketable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought there wasnt any ogre shaman chain armour hmm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies, peeps. The bracelet does interest me somewhat, the lack of AC can be overcome in other slots and the resists are always good. Atm, Im drolling at the belt. <br />
<br />
Just a couple more questions if I may:<br />
Any ideas on BP stats?<br />
Would Innoruuk/Cazic thule armor be a lot different stats wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was not able to collect the Blue Diamonds needed to smith every possible Crimson Darksplint Armour piece but you can be pretty sure that the stats will be nearly equal to the Artficers Ringmail (Barbarian cultural chain armour). For reference I list the known stats of them:<br />
<br />
Tunic - 30ac, 5sta, 10wis, 40hp, 40m<br />
Leggings - 22ac, 10str, 5wis, 40hp, 40m<br />
Cloak - stats unknown<br />
Coif - 17ac, 5wis, 30hp, 30m<br />
Mantle - stats unknown<br />
Belt - 15ac, 5wis, 40hp, 40m <br />
Sleeves - 16ac, 5wis, 30hp, 30m<br />
Gloves - 12ac, 5dex, 5wis, 25hp, 25m<br />
Veil - 10ac, 5wis, 30hp, 30m<br />
Collar - 11ac, 5wis, 5agi, 25hp, 25m<br />
Boots - 16ac, 5dex, 30hp, 30m<br />
Bracer - 12ac, 5wis, 30hp, 30m, 5 save vs all<br />
<br />
I have no idea if there is Fulvous (Cazic) or Blackened (Innoruuk) Darksplint armour implemented; as soon as i get my hands on more BDs i will give it a try with making a bracer for each of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was the trivials changed on this do I stand a chance at making any with 184 still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i realise that what i am going to add is slightly off the thread, but ill say it anyway!<br />
<br />
thers a type of armour around now that can mbe traded&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
engraved royal velium full plate, wich i am told CAN be worn by chain classes<br />
<br />
I think this is related to the shawl quests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All Fulvous (Cazic), Blackened (Inny) and Crimson (Rallos) Darksplint are implemented. <br />
<br />
Yesterday i managed to craft a Blackened Darkscale Cloak:<br />
<br />
14 ac, 10 wis, 5 agi, 40 hp, 40 mana, 3.0 wt<br />
<br />
Not bad imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can trolls make ogre cultural armour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trolls cant craft cultural armour. Ogres cultural armour can be worn by Ogres and Trolls. The Trolls &quot;cultural&quot; smithing ability is to be able to upgrade certain old weapons (like Enamelled Black Mace) into something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Could any of you outline briefly what is needed to make this chain armor?  Oh and what the recipe difference is for the Tribunal stuff?  I'm interested in getting my smithing up to par to make this stuff, but I will need a bit of advice on what the trivials are (do you need GM?) and recipes . .<br />
even a link to a site with such info would be nice.  <br />
<br />
Also, is this sort of armor need to be made in a Cultural forge?  Or can anyone with enough smithing and the right materials give it a go?  <br />
<br />
I'm kinda drooling over the belt and cloak atm.  That cloak is better than Heiro IMHO.  Slightly better, but better since the hp difference isn't extreme.  Those bracers look nice too.  I'd wear em standard gear with the hp advantage over most other ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_barbarian.htm<br />
<br />
Look at the bottom of the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The new stuff that high level smiths can make is indeed worth smithing, but be warned, they reciently lowered the trivial levels of fine plate and ornate chain substantialy and right now the options for leveling up smithing higher than 200 are all really, really big PITA's involving huge money and/or time sinks quite similar to the old tailoring. Check out eqtraders.com and their message boards for the latest info as it's discovered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll ask these for the sake of certain fashion freak individual.<br />
<br />
What's the colour?<br />
How does it look?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tribunal stuff looks like dark grey banded.  The same color and look as the Iksar Ceremonial Chestplate.  <br />
<br />
I think the smithed chain is pretty nice.  Decent HP on every piece.<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Draelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wasn't real thrilled with the looks of the Tribunal stuff, but I'm mostly getting the nonvisible pieces anyway.   I have a bracer and have ordered the waist and neck items.   Unfortunately there is only one person on my server who can make it right now and he is limited by the amount of BDs available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my smithing up to 201 before the June patch that lowered smithing trivials. Since I could no longer skill up on fine steel, I had to look into new options.<br />
<br />
Couldn't work on old cultural armor cuz I'm a troll.<br />
<br />
There's Shadowscream, which involves getting special no-drop Vah Shir mallet and anvil. The first stage takes much farming, the rest isn't so bad, and I get to make nifty DS toys along the way. After finally getting what I needed to smith Shadowscream, I found out I can't store up on smithing items and have a big long smithing session, because one of the components is NO RENT. So, I have to spend half an evening farming the NO RENTs so I can smith the other half.<br />
<br />
Last night, after farming the NO RENTs, I put everything together for a smithing session. I put all the components in the forge, but by mistake hit DONE instead of COMBINE which closed the forge. When I opened it back up, the NO DROPS were gone....including the MALLET AND THE ANVIL! I petitioned, but it never got answered, so I'm having to do the lengthy noob quests all over again to get the mallet and anvil back.<br />
<br />
The other option is smithing Acrylia. MO FARMING MO FARMING MO FARMING! I have to farm the Acrylia, which is actually a common enough drop, if I'm not in competition with tailors. I also have to farm the components to make the temper, which is rare stuff that drops in Tenebrous with its wonderful complement of just-barely-green aggros. On top of that, I have to give an enchanter a poison vial and an emerald to make clear mana. CHA-CHING! <br />
<br />
Between the May and June patches, I went up 30 pts in smithing. 3 weeks after the June patch, I've gone up a total of 1 point in smithing. My 202 skill is nowhere near the level it needs to be to reliably do cultural smithing.<br />
<br />
TAKE MY ADVICE...DON'T EVER TAKE UP TRADESKILLING!</div></div><hr />
