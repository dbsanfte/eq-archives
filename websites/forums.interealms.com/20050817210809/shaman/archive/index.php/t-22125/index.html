<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is your prefered zone when you are in group or solo ?<br />
<br />
My prefered one is Kod Taz by far. I am having alot of fun there and it is also very rewarding (xp/loot). The zone is huge, alot of different spots to go xp, many nameds with place holders, no stupid graveyard. Some risk, if you do something stupid, you will probably die.<br />
<br />
best experience there was after a patch : on server up, our group headed to KT and killed the 4 nameds that were up and all other the zone.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I found a named up and we went to kill it and xp a bit with our uber dps group (war, pali, cleric, shaman, shaman, shaman) and it was alot of fun too. I finally got Daluda's mending.<br />
<br />
I got all my spells there as well as most of my AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends on the lvl, but currently at 65 i am loving LDoN to a great extent.  I like the fact that i can log in and be in a grp in less then 2 min headed to an adventure, and be logged off in less then 2 hours.  But then again im a casual hehe.<br />
<br />
When i was younger i loved going dungeon crawling (Dalnir/Kaesora/Nurga/SolB/Chardok...you get the idea)<br />

Just my 2cp...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My favorite zone is probably still Crypt of Nadox even if I don't adventure there much anymore since I dinged 65.  The mobs have a lot of HPs (our DoT's actually work), they don't hit for much, all are easily slowed, and drop gems and 6/8 plat.  The names aslo drop nice gear for 55-65 lvl toons and aren't farmed that much so the prices are still relatively high for the effort involved.</div></div><hr />
