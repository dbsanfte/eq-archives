<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm fairly certain that one of the reasons that alchemy is so expensive is that there is a fear that they will be used for twinking.<br />
<br />
I'll admit, I've done just a little bit of that myself.  All my alternate characters are well stocked with sow potions.  Interestingly, from levels 1-10, sow lasts a very short time due to the character's level.<br />
<br />
I lost my fungi tunic in an unfortunate accident with my monk (I'm still steamed about it, and VI decided I couldn't get it back).  So I made some lesser rejuvination potions for my new ranger while he was &lt; level 10.  At 370pp per 10 stack, they were pretty expensive, and the regen was disappointing.  Greater rejuv would have been better (4x the effect), but the cost at 1160pp per 10 stack was prohibative.  So I just bought him an iksar chestplate for 3k.<br />
<br />
Here's the bottom line.  Alchemy is a very poor way to give twinks abilities beyond their levels due to the high cost, short duration of the effects, and the necessity to constantly replenish the supply.  So VI's strategy here works.  I seriously doubt that this would change if costs on high level potions declined by 50% or more.<br />
<br />
Is there a better way to prevent twinking using alchemy other than exorbitant costs?<br />
<br />
Yes, and its already being used.  The two damage shield potions have effects that are level based.  Druids are very good at PL low level characters because they can cast high damage DS spells (25hp) on them.  You cannot do this with DS potions because their effects are level based.  Low level characters get almost no effect from a DS potion.  Example:  Kiva's Skin of flame on a lvl 10 character yields a damage total of 6.<br />
<br />
So why not make effects of potions that shouldn't be in the hands of new characters level based?  Cut the costs of potions that can reasonably be used by characters of the appropriate levels, but make the effects neglible for low level characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Excellent idea IMHO, and as you point out it's already used for SoW potions too.<br />
<br />
However, will anything ever be done to alchemy? Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A friend had me make the first damage shield potion for a younger character in their 20's.  She said that it was very apparent that she was able to solo easier than without the damage shield, even if it wasn't maxxed out.</div></div><hr />
