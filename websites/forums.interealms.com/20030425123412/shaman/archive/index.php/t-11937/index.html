<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read Gwan is not slowable and is very highly MR. Suggestions for taking him and the fairy princess on Island One? How are they against disease and poison? Do they cripple? <br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about Gwan, but the fairy princess is very easy - dropped her with 4 peeps (level 56 - 60), and I did get slow to stick on her ok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">never been able to land a slow of any type on Gwan myself, but bring 3 groups of 55ish people and he should go down with no problem. Resitant all the way around...as are most of the remaining monk epic mobs.<br />
<br />
The fairies on the island below will be fairly MR for your level but should still be slowable without tash, might have to try a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slowed princess at 58 with no probs, Gwan 100% MR. We killed Gwan with a 58 shm 59 mnk 57 mnk and 55 cleric, hes a joke really. This was pre monk nerf so you may want to bring a plate class to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took Gwan trio with me (61 at the time), 65 necro and 62 wizzie.  Wizzie lures landed, Necro and myself were unable to land anything as I remember.<br />

Pets meleed, I just played cleric after I realised my spells were bouncing, encounter was trivial.</div></div><hr />
