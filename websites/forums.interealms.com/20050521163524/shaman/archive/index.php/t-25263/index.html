<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Logged in today to have 12 aa's refunded. Since I only had SCS and hastened curing I'd assume those 12 came from hastened curing and it's now 3/6/9 instead of 5/10/15.<br />
<br />
Secondary forte is 9<br />
<br />
pet affinity is 12<br />
<br />
Criticial affliction and fury of magic mastery are both 3 for the first level. Guessing 3/6/9.<br />
<br />
Advanced spirit call is 5 for the second level.<br />
<br />
Call of the ancients is 5 for the first level.<br />
<br />
Thats what I saw when I logged in. Spent my 12 aa's refunded on spiritual channeling =). Anyone else got any info to help build the new costs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my opinion Pet Affinity should be far lower than that, at least for shaman. It's not like out pet is the game breaker like a necro or mage though it should work for them with far less aa as well. It seems that was one of those abilities that they &quot;forgot&quot; something in the coding and decided to make us work for it instead of just giving implimenting it in the first place. I am pleased to hear that CA went down a bit. These AAs are rough to get when pushing for 70 :). I am pleased that they dropped Pet Affinity though, 20aa was a bit excessive for that.</div></div><hr />

I would bet Convalescence (regen) has dropped to 3+3.</div></div><hr />

According to the devs at the Fall '03 Fan Faire (Scott Hartsman in particular, I believe), it was something about the way spells and pets were coded, it wasn't possible to make group buffs hit pets.  So when the code was adjusted to allow this, I was VERY disappointed to see it turn up as an AA rather than a fix, and an expensive AA at that.  12 is better than 20 but is still a bit much.</div></div><hr />

Ah, that explains it. I thought maybe I got a secret 5 AAs for dinging 70 today. Heh.</div></div><hr />
