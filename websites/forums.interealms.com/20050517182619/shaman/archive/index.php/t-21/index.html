<br />
They die pretty quick but, at least, let the real tank rebuild aggro :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I &lt;3 rangers, they die for me alll the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">actually sunmoon the other dya i fought a guild ranger...level 60, great gear, comparable to mine, but he had archery master 3 i think it was.  he popped trueshot and i was dead within oh, 15 seconds.  tried numerous times without trueshot, the best i could do was getting him to 80%.  rangers are mean as heck in PvP.  then i dueled a 60 necro and owned :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Very few classes scare me in PvP and rangers are one of them.  Rangers, SKs, and Paladins...wow guess hybrids are good at something (I just laugh at beastlords and root their pet :p ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dueled a 60 ranger w/ my 55 bard the other day.  Not sure if it was *exactly* fair as the ranger had both epics.  Anyway, he got me down to 1/2 bub of health in about 3 ticks.  The guy was amazing.  Not to mention part of his tactic involved clicking his damn jboots repeatedly and spinning around me.  Hahah it really put me to shame.  I was too awed to feel shamed tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick favorable terrain where they can't get LoS, or just press yourself against a wall/firepot or any world texture, or hide behind a tree, they all interfere with Archery. <br />
<br />
Fighting a ranger in a wide, open area is like fighting a monk in a 3x3 room -- you are asking to die.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Ranger = 1/Shaman, and vice versa. :p</div></div><hr />
