<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Newtonio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been hanging around on 45 for 3 months now, waiting for my bro's shammy to catch up. As soon as he hits 44 (nice new buffs) we are going to try to hit 50 together. Any ideas on best place for us to do so? Jagged Pine sounds favourite so far... <br />
<br />
Also, for the inevitable downtime when we can't group, any ideas on places to pass the time solo? <br />
<br />
My equipment is fairly OK - Tolans stuff, Treeweave, Spider Fur Belt, SCHW, Wurmy and CentiSS; no plans to upgrade for a while yet (and no more money anyway....) <br />
<br />
All replies eagerly anticipated!<br />
<br />
(I had already posted this in the Zone Information section but I think it really should have come here to start with - apologies for double posting!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nocture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definetaly one of the ruins in DL....then as you get more xp and get around 48-50 go into KC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a cleric and trio the entrance mobs to the hole.     Once you guys have that under control, add a druid, ench, and rogue and go crawl.  Best damned xp in the game at that level.  Your entire group will be 55 in a few weeks if you manage to stick together and play 3-4 hours a night together.<br />
<br />
*If*  you get sick of the hole ( I never did ), my 2nd  favorite dungeon is HS - Start with North wing and start crawling.  some of the best fun in the game.  Chardok is also a great dungeon to crawl. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most important thing I can pass on to you  is to find 4 other people that play the same hours you do, and form a normal nightly group. <br />
<br />
However if you strictly want to Duo , Hole Entrance mobs, HS Entrance mobs (you have a gate potion right?).  Chardok zone-in/out mobs, as you get closer to 50 Akheva can be a blast also.<br />
<br />
I never really soloe'd so can't help you much there.</div></div><hr />
