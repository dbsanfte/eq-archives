<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiyrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a bit of testing in the last few weeks because i was interested in how archery works and wanted to be able to predict what kinds of hits i can get with a certain bow and arrow  setup. Ok this is what i discovered and found interesting:<br />
<br />
.)Maximum hit<br />
For how much you can hit with archery mainly depends on your level or better your damage table. Anyway, it's quite simple, maximum normal hit is:<br />
(bowdmg+arrowdmg)*modifier<br />
The modifier is 2.85 from level 60 to 62, 2.9 through 63 and 64, and finally 2.95 at level 65.<br />
I am not sure about lower levels but from my experience it is hard to hit this cap before regardless because you don't have high enough atk/dex during everyday archery use for pulling and kiting. On raids and in exp groups when you have the good buffs archery is pretty useless without Trueshot and the discipline skews the results. So you kinda &quot;softcap&quot; before you hit this hard level cap.<br />
<br />
.)Minimum hit<br />
There is no minimum damage for archery!<br />
I have heard people claim we have a bonus of 1 point therefore hitting for a minimum of 2. I have found this not to be true, however they are not completly wrong.<br />
It seems to depend on your bow+arrows setup, with either Primal Bow using 11+4 damage arrows and WBoRZ i have not been able to find a hit for less than 2 basehit. However using 1 damage arrows with a Primal Bow i was able to score quite a few 1s and using a Hunting Bow (yeah the vendor bought 5 dmg one hehe) i was seeing a whole lot.<br />
My conclusion is it has probably the same reason as the 2 damage minimum hits with high damage offhanders people are reporting. Not a direct damage bonus as there is for the  mainhand but rather an effect caused by the way the damage is calculated. Even though i don't know much about the algorithims Everquest uses, i just accept it is this way. :)<br />
<br />
.)Order of bonuses<br />
Damage calculation for an archery hit seems to be done in this order:<br />
1.) Compute what the hit was for using whatever obscure algorithms. Round to nearest integer.<br />
2.) Apply Archery Mastery modifier. Round again.<br />
3.) Apply double damage bonus for unrooted, nonmoving targets.<br />
4.) Apply critical hit modifier if you scored one. More on that later.<br />
<br />
Reasoning:<br />
The value must be rounded after the inital damage computation because else we could see uneven hits with AM3 (plain 2.0 modifier = double) which don't exist, they are all even numbers (multiples of 2). <br />
Also double damage hits are always even numbers so the value must have been an integer before it was doubled else we could get uneven numbers. This just does not happen however, so it's rounded before. <br />
AM modifier must be applied before double damage because else there could be uneven double damage hits with AM1(1.3 modifier) and AM2(1.6 modifier), which i have never seen personally.<br />
Not sure where Trueshot modifier is applied but it's before doubledamage.<br />
Critical modifier has to be applied last because it is possible to get uneven AM3/double damage critical hits.<br />
<br />
.)Critical hits<br />
This brings me to my next point, critical hits. I already started a thread about it a while ago but it was off the frontpage in general pretty quickly. Anyway, my point back then was that a single modifier could not produce all the criticals we see, not mathematically possible if it is a straight factor. You can use search if anyone really cares heh.<br />
Now we, or I at least, always thought the critical hit modifier is around 1.72 but as i found out it actually is exactly 1.7, yes this alone does not work out but the simple solution is 8 dmg is added in the end. So it's:<br />
(hitdamage*1.7)+8<br />
So easy and it took me so long to find out. :\<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing i found out is about the minimum critical hit.<br />
At first didn't even know there was one but thinking about it i had not seen a critical below 83 for ages. So i looked a bit into it and found out it depends on your combined bow + arrow damage once again, it is:<br />
(bowdmg+arrowdmg)*1.7+8<br />
This was what brought me to the 8 that is added to crits actually.<br />
It always applies no matter if double damage, AM or trueshot was involved, minimum critical hit is always this value. I also think it applies to all levels, at lower levels this will be the only critical hit value you will see actually.<br />
Another thing to note is elemental damage is figured into the minimum crit, however as it can be resisted you don't get the absolute minimum crit if you use it for your calculation. <br />
What it explains though is why the most common low critical hits with a Primal Bow and 11+4 arrows are 83(full resist) and 90(all elemental damage went through), additionally you can  see all possible hits between, that is 85, 86 and 88 if elemental damage is partially resisted.<br />
<br />
Well, that's all so far, just wanted to share. If this was all common knowledge screw you all for not telling me, heh. :P<br />
And i know my english is terrible no need to tell me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your minimum damage of 2 seems to be 1 for archery damage, 1 for elemental damage. The +8 is interesting though, I wonder where that figure comes from. Any chance it could be a simple multiple of the elemental +4 modifier? Tried with a different arrow, or on a known high FR mob like a fire giant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiyrwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The bows i tested with were Primal, WBoRZ, Shissar Bow (20/35) and Hunting Bow(5/crappy delay). Arrows 1 dmg vendor bought, 3 dmg tolan's summoned and 11+4 Blessed Mithril ones, basically everything i could get quickly and easily hehe.<br />
While i can not 100% outrule that the 2 damage is caused by the elemental damage on the arrow i thought about it and tested it with WBoRZ and could not get a lower hit, however it could have been a streak of bad/good luck so lets say i am 80% sure at the moment. :)<br />
Not sure either where the 8 damage comes from but i am 100% sure this time it's not from the elemental damage because i tested it with all bows additionally to studying logs up to 1 year back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The minimum damage should be the damage of the arrow.<br />
<br />
It's just silly to shoot something with say a 30 damage bow, an 11 +4 damage arrow and hit for 2 points.<br />
<br />
What did I just graze him?<br />
<br />
Oh must have missed that blade of grass..... *eye roll*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">minimum damage for archery with disc is ((base damage  X double damage on non rooted mobs ) X +AM3 modifer) X trueshot modifer = min damage<br />
<br />
or ((1 x 2) x 2) x 2 = 8<br />
<br />
without disc it's (base damage X double damage on non rooted mobs) X + AM3 modifier = min damage<br />
<br />
or (1 x 2) x 2 = 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good math sasandra :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aha, so if he was plinking rooted mobs he'd get 1 x 2 (am3) and should never hit below that.<br />
<br />
that's really pretty simple.</div></div><hr />
