<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I know this sounds like a silly noob question, probably because i am a silly noob....hehehe. Can Shaman pets be controlled with the same commands as a Necro's pet or are they pretty much like a Chanters pet, that is uncontrollable.<br />

/pet attack<br />
/pet back off<br />
/pet follow me<br />
/pet report health<br />

are the only ones that I have bound. I just type /pet guard here when I need it.</div></div><hr />

Essential if your soloing and pulling, else the dog tends to aggro and runs back to your pull spot with friends in tow, how cute :)</div></div><hr />

Definitely find safe places (away from wandering mobs) to park your pet. Then you go find mobs and pull to the pet. The pet is considerably lower-level than you and will aggro things that may not necessarily attack you. Mobs that are green to you may not be green to your pet. This can cause problems, park the pet (/pet guard here) and pull to him. Also, try to position things as you pull to where the pet is parked so that you are attacking the mob from the front and the pet is attacking the mob from behind. This isn't always possible, but it is ideal, as the pet will take less damage (from ripostes, etc) and will do more damage (damage bonus when hitting a mob from behind). Tank for the pet. Doggie can dish it out, but can't take much damage. Also, just for future reference, when you hit level 44, go to EC and buy Summon Companion from Rushka in the EC tunnel, back by the shady swashbuckler guys. It will allow you to summon your pet from one part of a zone to some other location (your location) within that zone. I love this spell. It allows me to zone into where I am gonna hunt, summon pet, med/canni the mana back to full and park pet. Then I run to my desired hunting spot, summon companion (tell him to /pet guard me or he'll run back to where you parked him) and get to some serious hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, if you take damage from the mob on the way in, make sure to beat on the /pet back off key as you come in so the pet doesn't run out and engage it before you're done pulling it.<br />
<br />
It helps to have SOW up on the pet so it can run out of range before it takes another hit.<br />

Why do we have to cast Spirit of Wolf on a Wolf Spirit, anyway?</div></div><hr />

Because Verant programmers can't program thier way out of a wet paper bag. I personally think that they found them in the bottom of a moldy, 30 year old CrackerJack box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The dog will come running if you take or cause damage to the mob. I allways try puling with a debuff or slow at range and run like crazy back to the dog. About the programers, haven't ya heard, Verant bought a million monkies and put them in front of a million computers and one of them came up with EQ before Hamlet was completed. :) /auction WTB rolled up newspaper of dicipline, paying uber, PST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally i am tired of seeing my dog..after killing a mob...just take off down a friggin tunnel or something...i have noticed that this happens a lot in Chardok...makes having a pet not even worth it<br />
<br />
Like last night..duoing zone out...spawns timed real nice...doing perfect..decide to pull out woofer and speed things up...pull mob to zone out from tunnel..beat em down..then the friggin dog just starts sprinting down the dam zone out tunnel and aggros half of chardok<br />
<br />
kk i am done now...must find coffee</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have my /pet back off key on my regular soloing hotkey page, and I use it when the mob gets down to 20% or when i suspect that there might be more mobs on the hate list.  Mob will typically still be whacking on me..so getting the pet to re-target is no problem.  I will hit that hotkey AGAIN just before the mob dies...rooting it and letting any dot's mop up just to make sure the pet trots back to his parking spot and sits like a good doggie.<br />
<br />
Having a pet is a big responsibility..particularly a dumb one.<br />
