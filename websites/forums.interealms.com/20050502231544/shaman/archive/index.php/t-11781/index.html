<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my friend (one of those full group hydras) and I (65 Rogue/52 Sham) have been trying to prepare ahead for Jeda hitting 60 and, as such, have been looking for all those rare high end spells. We have done juggs enough to get Tigirs and Bane. We recently did Prot/Jumpy twice (yay for pacification) and got 2x Pox of Bertox and 1x VoTB. Given these are not Torpor/malo (our real goals), but that seems like a hefty shaman pull from these two mobs. Just wondering if these two are known to drop a disproportionately high ammount of shammy spells or if we are just lucky :) Thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">imho, you got lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lucky.  It is well known that the purpose of Jumpy and the Protector is to drop the ultra rare mage spell, Mala, and other ultra rare beastlord spells.<br />
<br />
That goes along with the whole purpose of Trakanon is to drop Kunark Beastlord BPs.</div></div><hr />
