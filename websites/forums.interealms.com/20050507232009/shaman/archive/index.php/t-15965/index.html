<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Strategy for 65 bard/65 shaman, all credit goes to xev.Meowskaia. She's a smartypants :) This strategy should involve some sort of Teamspeak or being next to each other or in the other room because the bard often gets blinded and you need to yell, &quot;charm broke, recharm!&quot; <br />
<br />
- Both get ally <br />
- Both get shrunken goblin earring, eighth coldain ring, regal band of bathezid rings, or whatever clickies you can find, although only the shaman really needs hp buffs <br />
- Buff up both shaman and bard, make sure junk buffs are first and Virtue is last (may not be necessary but it's very helpful) <br />
- Get to locked royal door <br />
- Pacify outside mobs <br />
- Use Eye of Zomm through door to pacify inside mobs <br />
- Charm outside Judicator, attack mob inside locked door with it <br />
- Once Judicator is hurt enough, break charm <br />
- Get summoned inside <br />
- Mez both mobs <br />
- Have shaman heal bard 3 times then sit down <br />
- Let mez break on judicator, shaman gets summoned inside <br />
- Charm one and mez the other, both camp and log in again <br />
- Go down the pit into Overking Bathezid's room <br />
- Just to be safe, pacify all the wanderers in the hall and all the mobs in the room, and the guards <br />
- Quiescence Bard, bard starts with slow and shaman starts with malos <br />
- Harmony of sound and try to turgur until it sticks (pause a long time if it resists so you don't get beat up a lot-- the bard can handle it) <br />
- Have bard tank and beat up Overking. If he's in the corner, feel free to Spirit Call. <br />
- Have bard repacify every now and then. Have shaman reslow every now and then. <br />
- Use your clickies a lot to preserve your hp buffs (the overking's aoe dispels) so that you can canni safely. <br />
- Can keep bard alive easily with quiescence and occassional tnarg's. <br />
- Can swap in an ornate sceptre and velium strike which will help <br />
- Once the King is at around 60% hp, judicators will start healing <br />
- Have bard charm judicator and attack with it, will help with dps so that you will outdamage the heals <br />
- Bard will often get blinded, and aoe fire will disenchant the charm a lot, so need to call out to bard to recharm or whatever <br />
- Kill Overking <br />
- Bard can then recharm (or break charm) and fade, shaman won't have agro because judicator was just charmed <br />
- Loot singed scroll <br />
- Gate <br />
<br />
It was exhilerating to say the least :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that's pretty cool.. need good skill to pull that off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can use placebo debuffs on Judicator before you charm it in order to place the charm icon far down the bufflist. This will prevent it from being dispelled. Once the debuffs get dispelled just keep up lvl1str/dex buffs and use bracer of hidden as fodder buffs on the charmed Judicator to keep charm safe.<br />
<br />
Funny how old content, that used to be a full raid force nightmare often resulting in cr's, can turn into a duo challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Duo is definitely an interesting effort, especially sneaking down there.  We usually do it with war/rog/cle/enc/shm, and kill both king and queen and are back out in about 20-30 minutes.  Definitely not the nightmare Chardok raids used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You guys available to whack the Prince? My guild-less Enchanter needs that piece for Epic.<br />
<br />
I am serious.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi Faern/Mystyqe :)  I was the guy trying to buy a JBBP from you a few days ago. hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after reading your request, Meow and I tried getting at the Prince, and it seems surprisingly harder than the Overking, because he chaincasts a 1 second spinning levitate stun 100 dmg dd that's unresistable-- and as such, it is really hard to pull him to the zoneout.  It's probably possible, but we need to summon more guts to try him some other time maybe.  Perhaps if we fought him right at the throne it wouldn't be too hard.  Dunno.  Maybe we'll try that some other time.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that we'd wanna get summoned inside after pacification, then send dogdog, initiating with malos then turgur, then while I'm busy spinning around Meow could start meleeing and getting agro-- by then I can resume my healing job.  Who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been away for a week or so. As a 63 Enchanter I can bring some serious whup-ass to the table. Either a Boltraned or DC pet, chain stunning, and or CC'ing.<br />
<br />
Will shoot you a tell in game. (BTW I know Meow - she helped my Monk with his Coldain Ring series)</div></div><hr />
