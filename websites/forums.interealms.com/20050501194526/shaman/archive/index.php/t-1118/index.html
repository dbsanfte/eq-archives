<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While exping today I think i found a little bug, nothin to significant but an annoyance for sure. I saw my regen buff icon blinking so I decided to re-cast it, I guess it wore off at the exact same time as the new one took effect, and both disappeared :( Im just wondering if anyone else has had this happen or is it just me? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This one has been in existance for a long time.  If a buff (any buff) hits as the other fades, you can get this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrm, first time I've seen it... thanks for the feedback :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If regen starts blinking I start casting a new one right away.  To hesitiate would mean running into this bug, which does not occur often.  <br />
<br />
Normally I self-cancel the blinking buff then cast a new one.  Hate wasting mana.<br />
<br />
Edit: This bug has been around since day one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does anyone still get the bug where the buffs don't blink before they drop? I haven't been on in awhile but the last time I played about 2 months ago this still existed. Zoning or logging usually cured the problem for a bit.</div></div><hr />
