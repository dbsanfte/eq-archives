If you want to do tradeskills, this is your one stop shop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup yup..Eq traders if your place to go..As for trade skills Id do Alchamy if you can afford it..lots of loot to be made there...lots and lots..he he.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">forget about jewelry, its a chanter only trade skill that they forgot to make chanter only, as in you can make the stuff a chanter can unless a chanter helps you make it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The question is if tradeskills are worth it. If youre doing them because you like tradeskills, its one thing. But you want to make a quick source of income, look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Other than that, i concur with the other posters. www.eqtraders.com is the shiznit.<br />
<br />
If you simply want to upgrade your armor you should spend your time killing monsters for cash and loot you can sell to vendors (bronze weapons and finesteel weapons for instance).<br />
<br />
With a small base of cash you should be able to get some decent gear from the bazaar. Look for mainly HP and WIS gear in the beginning. Later on you will want to focus on HP/Mana first and STA and AC later. WIS becomes less and less important as you progress.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For 500pp you can *easily* outfit a character with gear that will last into the mid 30's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason that JC (Jewelcraft) is not condusive for the non-Enchanter is because you lose more money selling back non-Enchanted baubles you made rather than the enchanted baubles.<br />
<br />
Now you could try and find a nice Enchanter to enchant bars for you, but most will charge you for the process.  JC is &quot;nice&quot; but if your goal is to be 250 in all - it's a long road to ho.<br />
<br />
There are some new quests (again at www.eqtraders.com) that get all Tskills to 64 or so - FREE. (Or very very cheap iinm). Look into those.<br />
<br />
As much fun as you have hitting &quot;combine&quot; IMO you will have more fun duoing with your Shaman and Monk. That means you need to level your Shaman some.  Check out the hunting areas on this site and also www.monkly-business.com<br />
<br />
MOST importantly - have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I read a quote a while back that seems fitting for this thread.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to defeat the Sleeper is get him to take up tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Larieal37, my advice to you is to get your full set of newbie armour, your newbie weapon and any other easy gear quests at your starting city then just level. My newbie armour lasted me fine into the 30s and even 40s. It is a lot better than the stuff that you can feasibly make and any drops you'll find at your level. Gear can make a difference, yes, but don't feel put off because the guy next to you is wearing uber breastplate and weilding mega-warhammer. The most important thing you need money for is your spells. Without your spells, you cannot operate effectively. Gear can make you operate better but it will not stop you operating. Only when you can afford all your spells should you be looking to spend money on tradeskills or buying gear in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Larieal37</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hey guys, thx so much for ur help, and the links will help me also. But hey, that doesnt mean stop posting, by all means, plz post some tips for me here if u have any! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When you get Cannibalize. Learn to do the canni-dance.<br />
<br />
If you do not know what that is, search the forums for it, or post here if you want a description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My only real suggestion is to always remember that, being a shaman, you have the power to operate on your own when you so desire.<br />
<br />
That means you need to learn how to solo.  Soloing isn't that hard, really, but learning how to do it when you're level 20 means you'll be a master at it when you finally ding 65.  Your tactics while soloing will change as you gain access to new spells and new abilities and challenge mobs that have new and different aspects and capabilities, but the ancient tenets of &quot;root rot&quot; and &quot;tank IN TEH FACE&quot; never really change.<br />
<br />
Gear can make you a more efficient shaman, it can make you a tougher shaman to kill, it can make you a shaman with a deeper mana pool, but it can't make you a BETTER shaman.  Only skill and practice can really do that.  I've seen shamans wearing little better than newbie armor and swinging Fine Steel hammers play circles around people who twink out their new shaman in 100k worth of gear they bought out of the bazaar, because they knew the class and knew how to exploit its strengths and minimize its weakenesses, where the uber-geared twink shaman has to rely on his gear to survive and really learns NOTHING about how to be a good shaman.  Gear can never take the place of good old fashioned skill.<br />
<br />
That being said, remember that your spells always--ALWAYS--come first.  You can't be a proper shaman unless you have all your spells.  Get your spells and practice with them, come to understand how they work and how you can use them.  Even spells that seem to have little value like Vision and Flash of Light (the most underestimated spell in the game!!!!) can have great value when used correctly and wisely.<br />
<br />
Oh, and never be afraid to ask questions.  That's a good way to learn...by sampling the experience of people who have already been there.  They can help you avoid the potholes they encountered as they came up.  ;)</div></div><hr />
