<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya :)<br />
<br />
I only have one computer atm, and can't really get another one just for EQ. However, I'd really like to play two characters simultaneously on the one I have. I've tried EQwindow, but for some reason it didn't work on my computer, just kicked me back to desktop right before the character select screen.<br />
<br />
So, is it possible to run two instances of normal EQ in windowed mode at the same time? I've heard it's darn slow, do you have any experience or hints on what to do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easiest way is to just make a copy of your eq-folder, and make a shortcut to that eqgame.exe<br />
<br />
Fire up eq like normally, then alt-tab out and start your 2nd eq.<br />
<br />
Then just reduce graphics/resolution down until its playable.<br />
<br />
After that, alt-tab like mad :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to do it, but was cumbersome enough to set up a 2nd pc instead. Guess your milage will vary from what class you play, and whatg hardware you have.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have a fast enough computer with a good video card you can do it without EQW.   I run in 1600x1200 (make sure to set it at 16 bit color, this is probably why EQW is crashing for you) and have no problems other than slow load up times to start.<br />
<br />
I have a 1.5 P4 with 512 Ram, and a GeForce 3 64M.   Just load up the first EQ, alt-enter to get to window mode, then run another instance of EQ.  If your first instance of EQ shows a black screen then Alt-Enter to go back to full screen mode, then Alt-Enter again to get back to windowed mode and your video will return.<br />
<br />
I have no problems running like this except if I try to zone both characters at the same time, then it just takes me a few minutes to zone.  If I zone them one at a time they zone fairly fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried EQwindows once on the same comp and my shaman died in Paladual at lvl 65, so I decided I should try something different. I ordered a new computer and tried doing it on 2 seperate computers. This also didn't work very well so I tried using one computer again with the new one. My new one is 2200 AMD processor with 512 mb of Ram and a Radeon 8500LE 128mb and it runs perfectly fine. Someitmes in places like the bazaar or PoK it gets a bit laggy, but other then that it runs smooth.<br />
<br />
I have tried the Sony version of EQwindows and I can't seem to get it to work, but if you go here www.eqwindows.com and download the program there, I have found it to work much better. Another thing to remember is you need 2 accounts or it won't work=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taarne, I have a 768 megs of RAM, a GeForce 2 card with 64 megs of RAM on it, and a 1ghz AMD processor (can't remember if it's an Athalon or the other one) in the computer I currently use to play EQ.  Using EQW, and having only a single copy of EQ installed on my computer, I can run not one, not two, but as many as three accounts at once.  Normally I only play one or two at a time: my main account with my 58 shaman, and sometimes I bring in my retired friend's 61 druid for extra exp.  However, when I die I then have to bring in my friend's 65 cleric to rez the other two.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the only problems I experience when using just two are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Whichever one is not active runs slower.  The reason for this is that whichever EQ is in the background runs slower, and so can't process keeping track of where the character is properly.  If someone else is watching the background character run (I live in a house with lots of computers in the same room, so I can see this kind of thing), he'll appear to teleport backwards along the path he was running about once a tick (6 secs).  So he'll run forward two steps, teleport back one, and that's why the background character is slower.  This is annoying because it can be hard to keep the two characters together, so if I need to navigate through difficult areas I have to run one character through at a time.<br />
<br />
2)  If I run other things in addition to EQ (winamp, internet explorer, word, outlook, etc.) I get random freezes, which happen more frequently depending on how many things I have going and how long its been since I last reset the computer.  Basically, at random intervals, one of the EQ windows will lock-up, and I won't be able to see anything except the last frame (like when you  zone) or control anything.  Usually its prompted by some sort of lag-generating activity, such as casting a spell, using something that would generate a particle effect, etc.  When this happens the screen will remain frozen for anywhere from 5 seconds to one minute.  I can switch to the other character while its going on, but can't get back to controlling the first one until the screen unfreezes.  As I said, this just takes time, though certain things (alt-tabbing, minimizing windows, etc.)  can help speed it up.  Its kinda stressful when it happens mid-fight, but since I usually keep my characters grouped, and they can see each other's health in the group bar, its not too stressful.<br />
<br />
When I try running three characters, I get the same problems, only #2 happens more frequently.  Other than this however, everything works fine, and if I really want to I can eliminate 99% of the #2 problems by just restarting and only running the 2 EQ windows and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Now to address your situation specifically.  I don't know what your computer's stats are, but if you want to run two or more instances of EQ on it you will need lots of memory and processing power.  To get memory, throw as much raw RAM in as you can fit, using DDR ram if your comp supports it, and get a video card with lots of RAM.  For processing power, just get a processor with a bigger number of mhz (and which chip it is matters, but that's sort of a religious debate so I'll stay out of it), and a more powerful graphics card.<br />
<br />
As for your crashing problem, I'd give 100:1 odds that your problem is with your color depth, as Jaradis already suggested.  You can either fix this yourself, by changing the color properties in control panels&lt;display&lt;settings&lt;colors or by changing the line &quot;BitsPerPixel=&quot; in the file eqclient.ini in your everquest directory.  However, Jaradis was incorrect in saying they had to be 16 bit.  You can have 16 or 32 bit color depth, but the important thing is that you have to have both windows and everquest both set to the same thing.<br />
<br />
Or if you are lazy like me, you can just let eqw do it for you, by checking the option &quot;Fix eqclient.ini&quot; when you run EQW.  This option was only somewhat recently added, so if you haven't tried EQW in awhile it might not have been there.<br />
<br />
As Tenjhai already said, you can get EQW from www.eqwindows.com, or if that doesn't work http://eqw.eqhackers.com<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Edited to add P.S.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I just noticed some news over at the EQW site, about a problem that might be the same as yours:<br />
http://www.eqwindows.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=853<br />
<br />
If you have already tried using the fix eqclient.ini thing and that didn't work, check out this link and it might help.  It seems to be a bug isolated to this particular version (2.32) of EQW, so in theory it should get fixed the next time SOE does something else to break EQW, and EQW gets updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I couldn't get it to work with the builtin EQwindows program, but use EQW from www.eqwindows.com.  This works fine, and I don't notice to much slow down.  I would suggest giving it a try if you can't get normal Eqwindows to work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its not surprising at all that JSD coded EQW in his spare time, alone, and for free - and did a much better job than Sony.  I would highly advise against running two instances of EQ with Sony's &quot;window&quot; version - use EQW 2.32.  There are a few FAQs over on the eqwindows.com site's forums - click the link and read through them, and you should be ready to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's all in the ram. Get 512mb min and you can box 2 decently. Keep luclin models turned off, keep your resolution decent, put texture quality to low and disable sound. The eq sound engine is a ram and resource hog. You don't need two everquest directories at all. It's all in the ram, processor speed doesn't really change things if you're low on ram.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have been using 2 acounts for a long time now on one computer. I run it @ high resolution with 32 bit desktop and I have never had any problems. I have over 700mb ram and a Gf4 Ti 4200 128mb. The loading times are horrid though when you are running 2 acounts but the FPS is very playable. Although I have never been on a raid with 2 characters Im imagening it would not be pretty since its bad enuf with just 1 acount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As per the EQlive site, you can turn your sound 100 percent off by putting a nosound.txt empty file in your EQ directory, and selecting sounds OFF on your options screen.<br />
<br />
This will require you to fire up the account twice before the sound will be 100 percent off.<br />
<br />
Once I got the sound off on my second account, the performance on both accounts skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
I use my 2nd account mostly as a trader and to haunt the bazaar for research parts and rarities.  I'd dual-box, but I don't have LoY and PoP on the second account..making it difficult to get around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks a lot for the replies :) I'll see if I can get EQwindows running properly, and if that doesn't work, I'll just go twice the normal EQ -way ;)<br />
<br />
I've been playing since a few months after the release (so, around 4 years now) and have never owned a second account.. So, it might be fun, being able to powerlevel a char to &quot;duo&quot; with, or just for fun, or.. *giggles insanely* Must try this.<br />
<br />
Thanks *Bows* =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">they just broke EQW again today, hopefully EQW's developer will release a new one. if not i'm going to be really annoyed. eqw uses way less memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tried running two accounts on my computer last night with most sound, model, and graphics stuff enabled. Works fine (except for a couple of inconveniences described below) as long as you are in game in both accounts (ie. not in char selection). Most lag (like in Bazaar) can be alleviated by turning the clipping plane down. My specs<br />
<br />
Athlon XP 1.3ghz<br />
756 meg ram<br />
GForce 3, 64 meg video ram<br />
Windows XP home<br />
<br />
The inconveniences I have occur when switching account windows. The first is that the only way I can switch accounts is to alt-shift-R and minimize the active one then selecting the other minimized one. When the new active window displays it is totally black. I can fix this by hitting alt-enter and going to non-windows mode, but in order to switch back to the other account I have to hit alt-enter to get it back to windows mode. The screen goes totally black between each switch (which by the way happens when I am only running one account also).<br />
<br />
Are these things normal or are there work arounds or things that I can do to fix this? My guess is that some of this would be fixed by deselecting most options.<br />
<br />
I would hate to turn sound off. Just a personal preference.</div></div><hr />
