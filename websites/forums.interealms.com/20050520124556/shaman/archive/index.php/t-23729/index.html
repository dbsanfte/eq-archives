<br />
seems that alchemy may now be one of the most saught after trades in the game, along with poison making, yeah cause rogues needed a boost, and jewel craft, cause well who wanted that before ;).  check out eqtraders for the details on trades skill augs and how big a role alchemy playes in them....<br />
<br />
disclaimer, still waiting to see how good and obtainable they are but this is interesting.</div></div><hr />

Get Dropped Augument<br />
Do a combine with it using JC (current trivials in the 350 range)<br />
get better augument<br />
Do a combine with it using Alchemy/Toxicology (no clue on trivials)<br />
get better augument with Focus Effect<br />
<br />
It doenst look like we can focus a non-cut stone (JC is a must for Focus effected stones)</div></div><hr />
