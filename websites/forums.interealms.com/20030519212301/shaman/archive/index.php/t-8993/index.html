I'm level 57, just ditched my Hammer of Spiritcalling and bought an Orb of the Infinite Void, and am looking for a piercer to hold until I get my epic.  (am in a friendly guild not quite ready for most epic fights yet)<br />
<br />
All Allakhazam's tells me is that this drops in Plane of Justice.  Can anyone tell me what critter in justice drops this?  I am guessing perhaps something in the trials, but just can't find the info.  I've not been able to find one for sale, either, so I'm stuck with a Sharpened Mandible Spear for the moment.  Not a bad spear, has 35hps and some resists, but I'd prefer this if I can get my hands on one.</div></div><hr />
