<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like a pair of GEBs myself and I am sure that there are others that would like some too.   I would like to start a cycle in the Lord Djarn camp until everyone who wants a pair has some.  Maybe keep a full group in there, and as each person gets a pair they can switch out with another KoE member and see how long it goes.<br />
I don't really have any exact details yet because I was basically just wondering if anyone else was interested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a pair for the cleric but the druid Kirena has wanted a pair since her beginning (which was way before Meia was thought of hehe) So I would love to camp this with my druid to get her a pair if at all possible.<br />
<br />
But also it all depends on the day/time. I can not do it Friday nights so if that is the only time you can do it then I will wish all of you good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't need the GEBS but I haven't had the pleasure of that camp before.  Give me a tell in game and I'd love to come help with the initial break at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's the deal.<br />
I appreciate your offer Moebeus, I think your contributions would be key to the success of the break, especially if it's only 3 or 4 people who want to camp him.  But, I think we really need an enchanter who wants to camp him with us to stay, because the only challenge in that camp is crowd control.  If we had no means to apply it, I don't think it would be very successful.<br />
Therefore, I don't think we should even try without an enchanter who will stay (not to harp on you moebeus, I realize you already have the boots).  So far only me and Mei are interested in camping the Lord for some GEBs.  Anyone else?<br />
<br />
I want to camp this guy next Saturday, probably fairly early (noon est?).  I am hoping that I can commit several hours to this.  I will also post an official announcement that we are going after this camp as the time draws near.<br />
Is anyone else interested?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Need an enchanter...<br />
<br />
Did I actually hear that you need an enchanter?<br />
<br />
That's unfortunate, because I can't bring a good enchanter, but what I can do is bring you an excellent enchantress.<br />
<br />
If you're willing to settle for an excellent enchantress who is not a guildie, but is a friend, then I'll try my darndest to be there.<br />

/ooc My computer broke so I have to ask my roomate for computer use.  If I can get a time to be in lavastorm, I should be able to get permission.<br />
<br />
I'll keep checking the board and check times as soon as I can.<br />
