<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Potion:  Absor's Revenge<br />
Effect:  1000hp, 200ac, 50sta, 50agi, 15wis, regen 15hp/tick, regen 7mana/tick<br />
Duration: 2.75 hours<br />
<br />
Components:  Hoodad stems, Hoodad leaves, Essence of hoodad<br />
<br />
Hoodad stems are a rare, no drop, no rent item foraged in Stonebrunt Mountains<br />
<br />
Hoodad leaves are a stackable lore item bought from Ancient Hoodad for 513pp (with cha of about 150).  Ancient Hoodad is a triggered spawn in the basement of Ssra temple.  He is triggered by telling the Avatar of War: &quot;Gimmah j00 phat hoodad lewtz.&quot;  He despawns 30 minutes after he is spawned.<br />
<br />
Essence of hoodad is a lore, no drop, ultra-rare drop off of the Enraged Hoodad in Vex Thal.<br />
<br />
Enraged Hoodad<br />
Level: 80<br />

HP (approx): 1,000K<br />
Magic Attack: AoE cast every tick that interupts all spells not cast from a clickable item.<br />
Melee Attack: Death touch each tick on the highest pc on the hate list.  Iksars are immune to this attack.<br />
Immunities:  Immune to melee damage and all spell damage except for cold.<br />
Damage cap: Maximum damage per PC attack of 263 hp.  If an attack exceeds this cap it is resisted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pardon me while I don't feel the least bit sorry for anyone who's studying for a final exam.  If you don't realise how good you have it in college, you will as soon as you graduate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
college is the heyday of partying. Then you officially join the rat race. The stories go from what I did last weekend to, Back in college we used to ....<br />
<br />
It doesn't happen overnight, but day you will wake realize how much things change.  It's not all bad either. If I had kept partying like in college I would have no liver left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Meanwhile there are those of us who don't/didn't spend all of college partying....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wish somebody had kicked me in the nuts really hard way back then and woken me up :) I'm now going to school at nights and working a 40 hour job.  Had the time of my life when I was being a jack ass in college not studying, dropped out and now look back and wonder what I was thinking :) I hate school as much as the next guy, but I hate the idea of not having a degree even more..<br />
<br />
Quick OT.  One of my moment's of truth was one day while I was working at Home Depot in the break room.  One of the night managers who was a real jack ass that nobody liked came in and asked a guy how his school was going. The guy replied. &quot;Eh it's ok, Don't know how long I'm going to stick it out&quot;.  The managers face turned from a smile into a very stern look and said &quot;Stay in school, don't end up like me&quot;  For some reason it hit me pretty strongly.  And don't get false notions about the word &quot;manager&quot;.  Guy had been there for 5 years, was an assistant manager making 35ksalaried and working 12 hour days 6 days a week. Mostly overnights.<br />
<br />
So I'll say to any of those that ever had a notion about dropping out of school &quot;Don't be a dumb ass like me, Stick it out!&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">School is cool :)<br />
<br />
I got out in 4 but I still had a pretty good time.  <br />
<br />
When you are a freshman every Friday you sit in the cafeteria talking about the parties your gonna go to.  <br />
<br />
By the time your a Senior the friends that made it to Senior year with you spend the same time in the cafeteria talking about how many shifts they managed to pickup that weekend.<br />
<br />
Just part of the college experience I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and then there's poor suckers like me who finished their engineering degree, but decided to torture themselves a bit more by going BACK to college at nights WHILE working a 50+ hour a week job.<br />
<br />
Feel bad for me - i have finals and a job<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Then there's those of us with degrees who are working, but not using those degrees.  At least the pay is high, even if the location sux currently.  <br />
Blue collar work is alright if you have a marketable skill.  It's not just college that can make you money.  If you learn a trade skill you can live comfortably with plenty of money and regular work week.  It all takes work and study tho, no matter what you choose.<br />
<br />
Also you don't end up with a computer degree and no job in a recession for a year bleh.  With student loans, god that would have to suck . . . i'm sure I'm preaching to the choir on this forum tho.</div></div><hr />

You don't get to be 47 years old with a mostly &quot;sittin down&quot; job without knowing how to take care of those enraged hoodads, besides the cream and wipes come in handy for when the boss comes by.</div></div><hr />
