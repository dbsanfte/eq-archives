<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have invested some AA into spell reinforcement and noticed that Torpor does not last as long as it did before (And I have it maxed out at 50%) I wrote a bug against it but if ya have a chance and it happens for you please write a bug when you log in.... Like they say, the squeeky wheel get the oil...</div></div><hr />

That's probly the best analogy I've EVER heard as to why we should report bugs =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have one point into SCR and Torpor lasts for 5 tics for me.  Or at least I always get that extra bump tic at the end.  I didn't use to get 1500 hps from each Torpor, but now that I have that one point of SCR I get that extra tic every time.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its kind of interesting actually, &quot;the squeeky wheel gets the grease&quot; is a western saying.  The asian equivilant is &quot;the nail that stands up gets hammered down&quot;.  This has no point at all, just something that popped into my head.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol Landragoran, <br />
 how could you tell?  if you have only level 1 Spell reinforcement its only 5% increase in duration.<br />
<br />
Acoording ot Casters... Torpor takes roughly 24 seconds or 4 ticks. Depending on your computer, I found that sometimes it rounds up to the next tic. At level one you would have 5% increase in duration which is  24 * .05 = 1.2 seconds.... Unless you had a good stop watch, I would be surprised you will notice the difference. Now at Spell reinformement mastery which has 50% total increase, it would be very easy to notice a change (which has increased to 36 seconds). So I am not really suprised that you don't see any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have 12 points used in that skill .. still saveing 8 up for the the class skill <br />
<br />
i get 1800 every time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HAR TAKK.  You sound like a newbie quoting castersrealm and all.<br />
<br />
There is no substitute for reality.<br />
<br />
I heard that one point in SC Reinforcment gave an extra tick in torpor too.  Since I had 2 points lying around, I put it in it.  Guess what?  It DOES give you an extra tick of torpor.  It acts a little strange though.  Torpor seems to act around the same amount of time but seems to do a double tick at the end of torpor for 600.<br />
<br />
Quote castersrealm all you want, but there is no substitute for reality.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't have taken this tone except you deemed it necessary to LOL Landragoran when he obviously has put the point into SC Reinforcment and knew how it behaved while you can only quote castersrealm for evidence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually if you want to know how it behaves, you need to keep track.  From what I can see one point of SC R, gives you pseudo extra 300 hp and you need to max out SCR and get the class ability to get the next tick.<br />
<br />
Is it bugged?  Sure seems like it.<br />
<br />
One explaination could be this:<br />
<br />
I have Quick Buff maxed.  With mage focus ring, torpor should be casting at 2.1 seconds.  Yet it seems to keep casting at 3 seconds.  Someone mentioned that it is always rounded up even though it was only .1 seconds.  Maybe the same rules apply to torpor, even though SC R 1 gives you a slight bit extra it is rounded up to next tick of heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Like you said casters only gives the raw facts and  the way AA supposed to work. Also you know that the ticks always the best way to measure the interval of time the spell is being used. Since you did spend 2 AA pts into it, take a watch and see how long it last from the time you see the icon appear on your screen to the time it disappears. It can't get any more &quot;realistic&quot; than that. I can't disprove your claims because I am not at level 1. But you can easily support your claims with simple empirical data. I would be suprised but pleasantly so if tugor which supposedly lasts 4 ticks (24 seconds) lasts 5 ticks (30 seconds). Of course please do not count the time it takes to cast it...heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Coryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Noticed that the 8th shawl buff duration effect is specifically coded to exclude buffs with durations under 48 seconds, ie torpor and celestial elixer.<br />
<br />
As for timing buff durations, the correct time would be by ticks.... and you'd start the first time your HP bumped up while the buff icon is up, and continue in 6 second intervals till the icon leaves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i wouldnt know i still cant get torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lepra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree torpor acts funky with SCR =\<br />
<br />
I got SCR3 last night, most of the times it seems to give 1500hp but it gave 1200hp too on occasions.. teoretically it shouldn't even be able to give 1200hp.. oh well /shrug</div></div><hr />
