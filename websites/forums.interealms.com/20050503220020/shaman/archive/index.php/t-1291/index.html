<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got invited on a Reaver raid this weekend and they've offered to help on my next Epic step.  I'm still stuck waiting on the stupid Spec Courier, but I assume since I don't have to talk to him we can go ahead and kill him, I loot the books and just hold them until after I get the last page and turn the pages/combined book in first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes that's fine, Ghiosk drops the books every time and you can keep them until you need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back when I was 49 I joined a CoM raid and my friend encouraged me to loot stuff,  I didn't know anything about our epic at the time.  We killed Ghiosk and I looted his books ...they sat in my bank for 3 levels until I pursued my epic.  Was really helpfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also if you go on any future raids it wouldnt be a bad idea to keep turning in books to build up faction.<br />
<br />
I just got my Epic last night and even though I did each step I turned in 4 other sets of books to be on the safe side since know other shaman needed them at the time, doesnt hurt you know?<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
