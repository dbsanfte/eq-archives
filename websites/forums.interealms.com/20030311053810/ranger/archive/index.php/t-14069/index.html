<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I know that if you complete any one of the trials in PoJustice you can get Flagged to enter Plane of Storms and Plane of Valor<br />
<br />
But is there a list any where of the requirements to enter the other planes. And is there any order that you should get flagged in. For instance I saw that if you kill one creature you get Flagged to go deeper in but if you did not get flagged to go into the lair you appareantly can not go back and get that flag because the NPC veiw you differantly than if you had not killed the creature. <br />
<br />
Any help pointing me in the right direction would be nice thanks in advance. PS I did try the search and couldn't find what I was looking for.</div></div><hr />

What is the nae of the dragon in PoI to get deeper into PoI please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">long name for the dragon in PoI, but you have to hand some stuff into the gnome there and protect him as he walks to the dragon.  He gets there and turns the dragon on, pretty easy kill and he drops some nice stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tegwedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could you link what is needed to do this, looking to take my guild on a small raid and do this but have not found any good links for triggering this event or alot of others.<br />

<br />
You can also get access to HoH by doing the Box of Souls quest (presumably patch fixed it).<br />
<br />
From PoS you can get into Bastion of Thunder either by raid-level boss killing, or single group mini-boss killing &amp; questing their heads &amp; other trinkets they drop.<br />

Most of the spoilers for all of this is available on SH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since Manaetic Behemoth is a very different fight and only a few guilds have done him, well perhaps more than few but still, people are holding in with the info.<br />
<br />
It will come out in the open soon enough.<br />
<br />
PS. Most people that try that encounter havent even managed to trigger him and make him targetable. And even if you do, the fight itself aint a walk in the park, he has nasty damage output.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Oh, and I wouldnt consider Drunder (Plane of Tactics) to be a tier 2 zone, even if its from a tier 1 zone you get access. This place is alot harder than the other &quot;normal&quot; places like PoV/HoH etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i believe &quot;Dar&quot; is some kind of dragonic title :<br />
Phara Dar is the leader of Ring of Scale, no other VP dragon has a &quot;dar&quot; mark.<br />
but what about Harla Dar then ? afaik this one doesnt have a specific roleplay status, maybe then &quot;dar&quot; is a mark of elderness or something.<br />
but kelorek dar is a bit ridiculous, cant be an elder dwagon<br />
<br />
dunno<br />
*shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Dar&quot; is the name of a particular dragon brood, kinda like a family name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kuluvien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dar is the surname of all the Second Brood dragons.  You will see it with the name (e.g. Kelorek'Dar, Jaled'Dar, etc) in all cases, except for Nagafen and Vox, who have had their Dar surnames stripped because of their little experiment to create another prismatic dragon a la Kerafyrm.  And no, Kerafyrm is not the child of Nagafen and Vox;  Kerafyrm's parents' names have been erased from history by Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mortok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you wanna gimp the PoI encounter then just run into the &quot;Dragon&quot; area when a guild has killed it and the gnome will be standing there.  All you need to do is hail him and he will spat out some text... that is your flag to get into the &quot;factory&quot; which has the trials.<br />
<br />
I did it this way.  I am not in a guild so getting this part would have been tough otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aerin Dar is a dragon in Plane of Valor, not Halls of Honor.<br />
<br />
There is a key quest which involves 3ish drops off of 3 different kind of PoV zone mobs.  Only one person in the raid needs to have a key to AD's lair (which is in the back of the wasteland part of PoV).  <br />
<br />
AD hits for 1100ish, think is not slowable (may be wrong here), and has a couple different kinds of AEs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Synernian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Coula little things I know on this. To trigger the PoI dragon you need to turn in 3 pieces to the gone. These pieces are Sillicorrosive grease, an intact power cell, and a copper node. *Correct me if im wrong but those are the 3 pieces I have been told by many people* Also, the AD *nicknamed the crystal dragon on our server* key requires the hearts of an aracnid, a razorfiend *sp*, a planar larve and a piece of cystalline golem *dont think that is the exact name of it. Mines in the bank and i forgot* This quest needs to be done before you go to kill the dragon if you want your own personal key as someone said erlier. Hope that helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Azador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually...<br />
<br />
To start the gnome quest that results in the PoI dragon you need (all No Drop):<br />
<br />
- Bundle of Superconductive Wires<br />
- Copper Node<br />
- Intact Power Cell<br />
<br />
And for the Crystal Dragon in PoV you need:<br />
<br />
- 3 hearts from different PoV mobs<br />
- 3 x &quot;A Piece of the Crystaline Globe&quot; from different PoV mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Synernian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Az is right. Got my 2 quests in PoI mixed up. Superconductive wires not grease. And yes AD dragon is 3 pieces of the globe *thats the name, knew it had a crstalline in it =0P* Was trying to type and listen to people yell at me at the same time. Thanks for the correction and sorry bout the mix up.<br />

<br />
Only 3 trials in HoH.  Dragon, Protecting the Women, and the one with 13 to 15 MOBs (believe they're all RED CON) train one.</div></div><hr />
