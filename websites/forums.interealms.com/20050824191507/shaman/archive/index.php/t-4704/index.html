<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What improvements were made to shields?  Anyone know the details?  Rich Waters mentions it just after talking about adding Bash for Clerics...<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition. It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents. This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds great to me, since he mentioned it in reference to clerics it should mean all shield bearers will benefit not just a Tank only change.<br />
<br />
I did a search and had not seen it brought up.  Please forgive me if this is old hat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would love bash as an Iksar shaman. You dont know how many times I wished for bash in pvp. Then I could stun the person using a cure potion against my dots. MUHAHAHA Almost made me want to reroll as a large race. Well, almost.  :p <br />
<br />
If they gave bash to the smaller shamans I bet there would be a big uproar with the big guys. Who knows. I can always dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really wouldn't even care if iksar shammies got bash... so long as they upgrade the barbarians to have more than a 1/100000 chance of slam being worth clicking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play a big race shaman and I could care less if the smaller shamans get bash.  I would be happy if it was trainable so I could work it up or something though.  I usually am just in bear form for the extra regen and dogdog usually does my bashing for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shields are set to give a +block and damage mitigation boost on test.  naturally an additional defensive skill (especially one as good as block) is quite a major thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Large Race Shaman Bash tops out at level 1 skill, all you ever do is 1 point of damage and the stun doesn't occur all that often.<br />
<br />
If they gave us a bashing skill of 30 or 40, it may actually be useful as well as actually doing some damage...  say 1-10 HP instead of just 1.<br />
<br />
Then again.. they could just give all priest classes a bash of 1... which would really do nothing at all.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the stun aspect of bashing or slamming things.  I just love smacking something upside the head and having it stand there even more stupidly than before.<br />
<br />
Now If I could only find a husband that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bash is being bandied about in other threads.  I was hoping to discuss Shield Improvements in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If they gave bash to the smaller shamans I bet there would be a big uproar with the big guys.<br />
<br />
Nonsense, you guys are still shamans.  Pitifully weak and puny shamans, but still shamans. :)  We save our disdain for other classes.<br />
<br />
Now, if this was the Ranger's Glade, and they started talking about giving Halfing rangers some extra abilities, I'm sure the flames would be felt all the way over here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm, I like the additions . . . so Block would be a automatic skill one gains from equipping a shield?  Set at a certain skill level of course, this is a very nice skill.  My monkie blocks MANY many attacks with his high block skill.  Additional damage mitigation would mean a chance of a solid hit that lands to be reduced in damage.  Instead of that dragon slicing your head off for 900 damage it strikes a glancing blow that deals a mere 350.  This works on many levels and would be a very welcome change.  <br />
<br />
Think we would even see warriors in MA defensive mode equipping shields?  I think so.  As it stands for some fights (AoW) it's better for the warrior to use a slower 2HS to avoid some of the high riposte damage.  Everyone else has the mob's back so riposte is not an issue.  At least until the mob enrages.  <br />
<br />
At the very least I'd be pleased to see a drop in the number of dual book-wielding priests out there.  With the multitude of fantastic shields to be worn by priests, it offends me to see a book in that slot.  I saw a crystal chitin shield in bazaar going for 2k last night.  19 ac 9 wis if i remember properly.  A godly shield if one looks only two years back, an excellent choice if one only looks pre-luclin.  <br />
I wear a shield of wurms and am hoping the block/mitigation will be enhanced by a greater AC on the shield.  That 40 ac should really kick in nicely if that is so.  :D<br />
<br />
All I know is that we are close to winning vs. the AoW, could be any day now, and any of the proposed changes would easily push us over the top.  It's an exciting time for my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe it would get all of those shields out of the back slot and back into the secondary slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm wondering if they'll make lower end shields have less +block/damage mitigation and higher level ones have more +block/damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
My current shield already has a +4% dodge skill mod on it. Anything else to help us mitigate damage benefits us all.<br />

Or you could just have your MT backed into a corner and all the melee attacking on the AoW's backside. Backside = no riposte. This way you still have your high dps of the 2 1h slashers. Just don't let the MT die (or have a good tank switch) or AoW will instantly turn on the other melee and then they will be taking riposte damage.<br />

Sorry you didn't pick up on that.  <br />
That particular fight makes it almost mandatory that the MA use a 2HS to avoid more riposte damage.  There's no real worry about people stealing aggro if they maintain MAX proximity to the AOW's backside.  If the dam rogues sneak up and start knifing him in the heels it's gonna turn and kill them and do a lot of riposte damage.</div></div><hr />

We've never had our mt use a 2hder on him and we can usually keep him up the entire fight now. It is pretty funny watching people drop when he turns right at enrage tho =)</div></div><hr />

I use slam as an everyday thing in soloing, even if i dont solo everyday.  I am quite proud of this ability, because it worth it very often for me.</div></div><hr />

You'll notice none of the other sub-100 str races get bash either. So you'd already have it if you weren't such a damn sissy! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're talking about Slam, which is a racial ability.  No race gets bash.  Paladins, warriors, SKs get bash, which is trainable.  Just wanted to clarify, because I'm an anal retentive poopyhead.  :D</div></div><hr />

Thanks Howjan, glad to know that it's at least a little effective. Anything that helps us avoid damage is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just since I saw people mentioning AoW on this thread, I think that a Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky should be a weapon in every high end warriors pack. Once you gain aggro you can switch to Gaudralek, and the ratio along with the nice proc can keep aggro easily as long as everyone is staying at their max distance and the MT doesn't go moving out of melee range. And I can verify, since I had to jump in and MT AoW earlier today on my warrior (while I was healing clerics on my shaman hehe) that you take a lot less damage using a nice 2hs in a fight like that.  We can finally usually keep one tank up the whole fight as well nowadays even when dual wielding, but if they use a nice 2hs, it makes it easy to keep them up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I ditched my bash.. well actually its slam..<br />
hotkey after lvl 5 and it started sucking to much ass to bother with :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Maybe it's just me, but I thought the main purpose behind Slam for Barbs was to interrupt casters? That's why it only does the 1hp dmg? I use it all the time when mana is good. Stand behind mobs the CH or Gate and slam then everytime they start to cast. It succeeds about 8 out of ten times... I can't see how anyone would say this is a wasted ability...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The shamans who don't use slam against casters are the same shaman who don't know how to cannidance effectively.  (Like stand up the whole time chain casting for example.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">well origanaly Iksars where supposed to get a racial ability to do a tail rake, and only the monks could train it up. this was taken out becouse of the necros ( what thay said ) and now we have a limb that is almost uterly useless to us just hanging there. we would all eventaly learn how to us it in some way ( a wepon, a way that we could be more stable or something ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Lan, you will never see a warrior MT anything with a shield equipped.<br />
<br />
In order to tank you need aggro, warrior aggro is determined by damage done/procs mostly(taunt= the suck, it flat doesn't work 90% of the time). Taking away 1/3 of their damage/procs is 1/3 less aggro generated by a class that already has the hardest time generating it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I put &quot;marks&quot; around it!!! :p<br />
<br />
I find slam only ever works from behind It's awful nice when that runner breaks root early and it just happens to work and you get a stun. Saves pulling a train or CR or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">+dodge items are useless to us anyway, since they dont push us over the class cap of 75.<br />
<br />
Now honestly, I really hope this changes for PoP, it would be really nice to worry about more than 2 stats (hp/ac). Then you could choose whether to worry about ability items or hp/ac gear.<br />
<br />
That would be a great bone since it doesn't look like the stat caps (+/-125) are going to change at all for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">When Kunark was coming out and evern after its release, hell even to this day, I believe that Iksars are considered to be a large race... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Nice how some people don't bother to read before making comments.<br />
<br />
Valka:  It's not +dodge, it's +block.  <br />
<br />
Jharrassk: The AoW is one fight where it's mostly about whoever is underneath the mob's feet as to who gets the aggro.  He's the most prox aggro fight I've ever seen.  Literally I could do nothing the entire fight to him and if i step under his legs I am gonna get aggro NOW and get smooshed.  Just gotta keep your MA positioned correctly and keep the other melees at max prox . . . and not using crazy taunt weapons (*cough* rangers)  and you can keep aggro on one MA the whole fight.   Unless you do tank switches, and then it's gonnna be tuff any way you look at it.  A shield with build in dmg mitigation combined with a fast 1hs with a huge taunt proc might be worth trying out.  <br />
<br />
I'm lookin forward to all of the changes on test.  Should make the game more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Case in point on why it's frustrating at times to make comments on changes.  There was no effect on the OoIV as of the time of this post.</div></div><hr />
