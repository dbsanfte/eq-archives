<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyxil Shadowscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to get a straight answer from anyone about this, but there doesn't seem to be any...<br />
<br />
I've had trouble since I recently came back to EQ with my disciplines.  If I use one and zone, the timer resets to like 2 hours for all of them.  Now this doesn't happen on my shaman  :p  but for my monk, SK and rogue it's extremely annoying.<br />
<br />
I filled out a tech support ticket ingame and it told me to reset my bios clock or call tech support.  Well, after messing around in CMOS/BIOS I tried changing the time but that didn't do anything.  So, I called tech support.  After explaining the problem, the guy said &quot;Ok, sounds like you need to reset your BIOS clock.&quot;  I asked how to do it.  He told me he couldn't help me because it was against company policy and he could possibly screw something up.  He recommended I call up Gateway, who I bought my computer from.... problem is that was my warranties and free tech support expired years ago.  Checked their website, but it didn't help any.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem?  If so, how did you fix it?  I don't know much about messing with my computer BIOS settings, but I'm obviously missing something here.  Any help would be appreciated.  I guess if I can't figure it out I'll try and call tech support, just figured I'd ask here first since EQ is the only thing giving me trouble.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
