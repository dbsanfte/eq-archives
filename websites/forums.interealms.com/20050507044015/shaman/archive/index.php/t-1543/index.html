<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone confirm or deny the 8th shawl stats yet ? <br />
<br />
i've read its:<br />
<br />
8AC, +8 STA, +8 CHA, +8 WIS, +8 INT, +8 all saves, +50 HP, +50 mana <br />
Effect: Zephyr of Brell (2 mana/tick, increases buff durations by 15%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't confirm it, but if it is, I'm definetely going to go back to working on these... it has hp/mana, decent AC (compared to what I have now anyway), 8 to all saves, and the equivalent to FT2/focus item too.<br />
<br />
Seems like this would definetely be worth it (especially since I enjoy working tradeskills :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if that 15% stacks with the AA skill it will be a fantastic item.  another 15% duration on our torpors would make this well worth doing the quest, whatever the last step is.  not to mention fair stats and a couple mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Didn't I read that heal over time buffs were not effected by duration enhancers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stats confirmed was compleated by someone on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&lt;i&gt;another 15% duration on our torpors would make this well worth doing the quest&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Would it?  I'm pretty sure the percentages are added up, and then applied, so you'd have 30 (arch) + 20 (class) + 15 (shawl) for 65% with the shawl, and 50% without.<br />
<br />
24 seconds * .50 = 12.0 seconds extra = 2 ticks<br />
24 seconds * .65 = 15.6 seconds extra = 2 ticks still<br />
<br />
Now, where it would actually help is if you had SCMx2 (15%).  The additional 15% from the shawl would bump you over the amount needed to get one extra tick from Torpor.  After you get SCMx3 and beyond, the shawl's effect won't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Would you shamans wear this over IGS?  <br />
<br />
20 AC 10 to all resists<br />
<br />
thats a good hunk of AC to be losing   imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not all shaman race can wear a IGS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, seems like a very nice upgrade. Hmm, if AA indeed did stack with the shawl, what about the mage focus items? Doesn't one of the summoned items increase buff durations as well? If so, would that stack with AA/shawl?<br />
<br />
As for IGS or shawl, no question for me, Shawl all the way. The hps/mana/resists/sta/mana regen and now longer buffs make up for the lost AC.</div></div><hr />

We got this for our GM last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I had a 7th or 8th shawl.. something I put massive amounts of time into.. I'd be wearing that over almost anything. You think anyone with the 7th shawl would keep it in the bank since they have an IGS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't trade my IGS for shawl 7, but I definitely would for shawl 8.<br />
<br />
12 AC and 2 to all resists for 70 hitpoints (adding in the sta) 50 mana, FT II and some kinda nifty buff duration (buffs on yourself or buffs cast on other people?) hell yeah.<br />
<br />
Of course, there is no way in hell I'm ever going to work on the shawl quest, so the point is moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doesn't one of the summoned items increase buff durations as well? If so, would that stack with AA/shawl? <br />
<br />
Themage focus item for buff durations is a shawl/shoulder piece too. So you can't use them both.<br />
<br />
Since coldain hate me, and I have zero interest in raising my trade skills to do this, it's Strength of Elements all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The 8th shawl is worth wearing IMO for a shaman. The hps mana and effect with good resists makes it a pretty good item IMO. Little light on the ac but it's not fatal to have one low ac peice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree Gloriana<br />
<br />
S8 &gt; IGS<br />
<br />
Also mez think FT items are underrated.  An FT III items would have da same impact as a Cerimonial Iksar Regen Cheatpalte on mana recovery.  Mez know lots of folks that give up a big chunk of ac to have the iksar bp racked. <br />
<br />
6 hp &gt; 3 mana<br />
<br />
Mez would still rather have the hp den the mana because of flexability.  Obviosly if yoo get smacked den yoo get the full benifit of da hp regen and dat is better den da 3 mana yoo can make out of it.<br />
<br />
Mez got a nag with FT20 or so *giggle*   Mez almost never canni now I just pull with slow, blast wid da jbb,  and then find ways to use more mana like healing myself *gasp* to reduce down time.<br />
<br />
Mez plan on finding whatever FT items mez can get... da nag will go to da glue factory when she get smaked wid da nurf hammer.</div></div><hr />

Very well said.  :)<br />

<br />
shawl quest sux, too long too expensive too boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ac is overrated. hp &gt; all.  i dropped my igs for a new shoulder item from ssra, and will start getting dorf faction for the shawl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Whats kind of ironic, after looking at the posted screen again. <br />
It's all/all and fairly decent weight.<br />
<br />
Your going to see melee classes wearing this now for the HP's/resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Definitely worth having, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Already working on my tradeskills again, now that I know how much better than the 7th shawl it is... the 7th shawl just wasn't as good as my chokidai spaulders but this will ROCK.<br />
<br />
Granted it's a LOT of work, but I do enjoy tradeskills and this is perfect for me, don't need to have a raid to get it, I can get it at my own pace.<br />
<br />
Got tailoring up to 83 last night, gonna go for 115 tonight if I can get lion skins. Then I can get the 5th shawl and start on the 6th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nerum:<br />
<br />
When yoo hunting for dem HQ lion skins for da quiver,   save all da other quality skins for leather backing.  Leather backing is da major slow up when yoo start working yoo smithing past banded.<br />
<br />
Aslo,  try  stunbrunt mnts, it is great for hunting quality pells...  no runied pelts drop in stonbrunt.<br />
<br />
Arc: To a large extent yoo be right that the shawl quests ( i.e. trade skills ) be a time sink, but sux and boring is a personal perspective.  Mez find that people dat get easily bored are normaly not very fun to be around ;).<br />

ok, I will check there... my fiance is leveling up a monk so she can group with me (she has a 52 cleric but monk + shaman &gt; cleric + shaman) and is at level 15 right now... I will look up stonebrunt mountains on allakhazam, but do you know if this would be in the proper range to rage on lions while she kills lvl 20ish mobs (I'm 54 and PLing her at the same time)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's important to stress that HP's are more important than AC after you reach the AC cap.  With each expansion, it becomes easier to reach that cap with fewer armor slots.  If you're still at 900 AC, it's stupid to swap out IGS for this shawl.  If you're at 1200 AC, then it's probably not a bad move.  It's all relative to the rest of your gear.  You can't just look at one slot and decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, I didn't know which slot the mage focus item (increased buff duration) went in, thanks for the info. One other thing, is regen or heal over time spells affected at all by the AA/shawl/Focus items? Just wanted a confirmation on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know this for sure, but I have heard they are not affected by this. It WOULD be nice if regrowth lasted longer though, wouldn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">probably easier to &quot;just&quot; find Yael up and kill him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Uggok, if you ever hear me talking about doing the shawl quest please come over and pull my fingernails out with pliers... so I can remember the joy that is tradeskills.  Seriously... /shudder.<br />
<br />
It's a nice item but I really dont think it is worth it to me to ever invest that much time doing a dozen tradeskills.  Though maybe I can help my cleric friend with it and then she will give me her death watchers shroud.. la la.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I read that theres a max of +50% duration you can have... If this is true than the shawl's duration thingis uselss if you have both AA skills that add duration.<br />
<br />
However, i could be wrong. Clarification from anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">From the May 8th Patch message:<br />
<br />
- The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction<br />
<br />
No mention of a buff duration cap there.<br />
