<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone!<br />
<br />
      Already this summer I am getting a bit bored...  So I am hoping to do some quests... I am hoping that someone knows of a quest that a level 29 shaman can preform. <br />
<br />
      I am hoping that I could make a bit of money with this and I don't want to be kille don sight in towns... <br />
<br />
      If someone can help me, please do!<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure whether you could kill the Fools in RM, though.  They were soloable at 34 with a dog, I think they were dblu.  I don't recall any longer =(<br />
<br />
Best bet is to head to allakhazam's and browse through the quest list for your favorite zones.</div></div><hr />

Oil and Water....<br />
<br />
At your level, I can't think of *any* quests that result in an item that other people will pay you for.  <br />
<br />
Your best bet is to get up to Luclin and explore, see if you can find some loot that is relativly rare.  Hollowshade Moor is excellent for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...most of the Totemic quests are solo-able by level 29.<br />
<br />
No, you will not make any money, but you will get to travela round a fair bit and see some sights. I think the Totemic quests are a &quot;rites of passage&quot; thing for a shaman, and you should do them anyway, even though Totemic armor has been superceded by better and shinier things.</div></div><hr />
