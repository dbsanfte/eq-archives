<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some feel there may be a problem with the 4th corrupted mob on our Epic 2.0 quest . I am attempting to gather community feedback regarding this . I personaly am nowhere near &quot;Epic 2.0 level&quot; so I am asking for feedback from you guys .<br />
<br />
Has anyone gotten this 4th corrupted mob ? <br />
How many people feel he may be possibly bugged in some way ?<br />
<br />
Once I gather a concensus that there is in fact a problem of some sort I will submit the problem through the proper channels .<br />

Thank you in advance for your feedback on this Issue !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few people, myself included, have been looking for this mob for about a month now.  I don't know for certain that it is broken but nobody has been able to find the mob despite checking numerous places.  The mob we are looking for goes with this description: <br />
Another is an scurrying creature that is not bound to our realm. <br />
The epic 2.0 thread at http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23946&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=4 has some more info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clarification of that line might help in the search.  Since the NPC saying it is a spirit, does he mean the spirit world, a place in Discord, his grandmother's attic?<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a monster with stubby legs who exists! Find him!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's kind of what it means to me now. <br />
<br />
Have them rephrase that sentence to yield a little more of a clue and I'm sure someone will find it.</div></div><hr />

unless some shaman is holding back info, it seems like no one have found the 4th mob yet.<br />
<br />
the way i see it there are 4 possibilities:<br />
<br />
1. initially we thought bloated girplan was bugged because it's not always up or triggered like the other 2 mobs. however it's a &quot;regular&quot; named with a PH. so maybe this mob needs to be spawned by clearing its PHs. now if this mob is in some far deep end of HS or an instanced zone, maybe we just have never clear the PHs enough to spawn it yet<br />
<br />
2. in anguish where people haven't been explored deep yet<br />
<br />
3. in somewhere not in oow (it doesnt fit the NPC quest text but you know sony ;)<br />
<br />
4. its bugged<br />
<br />
personally i think its #4. can you ask the dev's to make sure it's REALLY REALLY working?</div></div><hr />
