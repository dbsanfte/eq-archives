<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took an extended break to check out SWG (mini review = gets dull fast).  The other day I was surfing my server's messageboard, Saryrn Tavern (which is such a pack of idiots that I'm tempted to pretend I play on another and read theirs instead).  I see a paladin claim he could solo Gorenaire.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, Gore has 32K HP's, is unslowable, unstunable, and AE's a slow plus hefty DD.  Plus she's going to CH'ing herself.  I've heard of duoing, but has any class solo'd a Kunark dragon?  Not counting the trick bards could pull with NPC alignment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I see a paladin claim he could solo Gorenaire.<br />
<br />
Umm I'd need to see text with SS's before I bought that one. <br />
<br />
Now a Shaman MIGHT be able to beat Talendor because of the Fears which in a sense work against T-dor. DOT, DOT, get feared, come back DOT, DOT. Course I'm still hoping that Mira Sorvino is gonna knock on my door tonight so hey I * COULD * be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a big to-do a couple months back about a paladin soloing Gorenaire.  I'm not sure I have the exact facts correct, I'm sure someone can verify, but it was my understanding this was done on a test server for the beta for Ldon, so the paladin basically was able to /testbuff himself to 65 with full AAs and take his pick of all the Time gear he wanted.  Beyond that I haven't heard anything specifically about people being able to solo Kunark dragons, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did.<br />
<br />
edit: gonna see if i can find the post i saw on this, i believe it was on PoN, complete with logs.<br />
<br />
edit: nope, wasn't PoN, but I found it anyways, here's the link:<br />

<br />
I have heard about a sk soloing traky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Soloing Trak? One trip to shrooms and it's over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doesn't Trak summon you back if you sit or something like that?  I've not had the pleasure of tanking Trak, so I don't know for sure, but thought I read that a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you sit as soon as Trak banishes you, he will summon you back.  Not sure if you'll get a train of shrooms 30 seconds later or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An SK on our server solo'd Sev some time ago.  There was a big stink about it because Sev is on a rotation on the Rathe, this guy's guild was on the rotation, drama and server politics ensued, etc.  I believe Tal has been solod by a knight, but could be mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Knights have a Fearless AA, and with enough resists could prob resist all the other AoEs.  So it's just a matter of out-meleeing a rather mediocre DPS mob and being able to keep yourself healed.  I honestly think a very well equipped Paladin with a hefty amount of AAs could pull this off.  32,000 hps isn't an insane amount of hps these days.</div></div><hr />

I've done Ragefire before, he's really quite a pansy.  Dunno if I'd consider him a Kunark dragon though, considering he's from Antonica.<br />

<br />
No, resists don't recyle. <br />
<br />
Resists cap out at 500, and they never &quot;roll over&quot; or recycle or anything. I'm not entirely sure if they EVER did that, but if they did, it was fixed about 3 years ago, or more. It is amazing to me how long these rumors can live. <br />
<br />
I play a bard primarily, and I can guarantee you that higher resists = better. With Psalm of Veeshan I can easily get all resists over 300, or at or extremely close to 500 with other resist buffs and maximum song modifiers active. It makes you practically immune to all magic - except for uber raid targets who have humonguous negative resist modifiers on their effects. And you can resist even a lot of those. Against &quot;normal&quot; spells a high enough resist stat makes you practically immune.</div></div><hr />

Talendor is FFA on the Rathe.  The only Kunark dragons on rotations are Sev (due to the rarity of Green Scales) and Trak (regular Trak, trigger-Trak for bard epic is also FFA).  But I don't doubt that a shaman has solod him. :)</div></div><hr />

If you've got a damage spell that can hit a &quot;few&quot; hp, and a &quot;little&quot; mana, you can probably do it...  Basically once all your resists are above 200 unbuffed, go solo a guardian wurm without slow to check your survivability vs a dragon... if you've got mana left over to kill it from not just healing yourself, then you can probably take a kunark dragon (assuming it's one you have a spell to damage it with) with a little work.<br />
<br />
Hell Gore would only take approximately 6400 bursts of flame (even less with crits... and add in some melee to keep her regen down...)  next time I see Gore up I'll go try her and post the log whether I win or lose or something, depending on how bored I am.  She's usually duo'd by Rangers on my server as soon as they see her up though.<br />

LR5 + ID5 and reasonable gear and they fold for a knight.<br />
For a shaman it's much more complicated, all our damage spells but Velium strike are resisted with a &gt; 99% success rate.<br />
To get past this, you need one specific piece of gear, as well as the defense AAs. This rare item is the Staff of Eternal Flames (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24789). Qui + the occasional tnargs is enough to keep you alive while you melee her down. You can't go wrong with a pet either<br />

Sadly, this is about all you can do, unless you're in the mood for a DS + pet kill. We just do not have a way to really damage the guys. (this works for gore + sev, talendor might be immune to fire.</div></div><hr />
