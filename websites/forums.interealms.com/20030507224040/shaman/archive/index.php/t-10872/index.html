<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just thought id share a nice spot i have found (not a secret, just a guide!). Currently at LvL 51 and doing first 6 points of AA here.<br />
<br />
Zone into CoM, go across bridge, open gates, turn right.<br />
<br />
Summon dogdog and /pet guard here<br />
<br />
Buff Self with HoS, Agi, Sta, Chloro, Sow and Horse (if available).<br />
<br />
I have been using hasted dogdog, with HoS, Chloro and Sow (alpha of course).<br />
<br />
Im a dirty twink, so this only really applies to JBB owners (easily do-able without though).<br />
<br />
You will see the pyramid. 2 doors, 6 mobs on top of pyramid.<br />
<br />
Pull each mob with slow (very few resists).<br />
Set dogdog, and Jbb to death, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Once all 6 are dead, go into one of the doors. You should get aggroed by a mob (there are 3 inside on top level, 1 by each door, and 1 in middle).<br />
<br />
Slow, dogdog Jbb - etc. Repeat till all 3 are dead.<br />
<br />
Now go into the room, there is a lowered section with 3 mobs in, You may be able to get one solo, but be prepared to root split the mobs.  Slow, dogdog, Jbb.<br />
<br />
Always keep summon companion up, as dogdog has an annoying habit of jumping into the water for some reason.<br />
<br />
Once those 3 mobs are dead, there are 2 doors, 1 left and 1 right at the bottom of the room. <br />
<br />
Left door is empty (pick up high scale icon if you havent already). Right door has 2 mobs, 1 by door, and 1 further in.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get proximity agro on the 1 by the door, but be prepared to root the add.<br />
<br />
Once those 2 are dead, head outside and to the left side of the pyramid, and go through door, there will be a door in front of you. <br />
<br />
Go up the corridor to the top of the pyramid, and there are 2 - 4 mobs, (i think 3). Use proximity agro and be prepared to root.<br />
<br />
Run mobs back to dogdog, slow and Jbb (sound familiar?).<br />
<br />
Once those mobs are dead, the 6 on top of the pyramid should start re-popping. <br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
You also get the Army Behemoth spawn here for strange ochre clay for Canni II - if you havent got yet.<br />
<br />
Some mobs are light blue, but its not a bad spot. 15 or so mobs in total per cycle.<br />
<br />
With JBB Fungi and Horse, i rarely go below 80 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bazgul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have reached 51 here and plan to stay for another couple of levels.  It should be noted that the 3 mobs at the bottom of the temple and the 3 mobs at the very top are usually higher level than everything else.  For example, these six spawns are most often Phantoms, Fog Golems, and Greater Plaguebones.  This makes pulling these MOBs single impossible (for me anyway.)<br />
<br />
Overall CoM is a great place for the JBB equiped. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">found that to split them if there are undead and live use invisiblity to pull the undead as long as the undead do not hit you the live ones will not follow.  have use root and dot but you could root and summon pet. for spliting purposes.</div></div><hr />
