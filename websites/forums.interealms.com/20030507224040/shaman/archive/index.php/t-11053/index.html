<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone done PoG at 57+.  I do have epic and JBB but no horsey as of yet.  Tried this zone a while ago at about 54ish and did not put out enough damage.  Now with my epic and a KEi I am thinking that this may be more in the realm of possiblity. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's doable, but very slow and challenging.  Safest thing to do is roam along the west wall and pull whatever is closest.  I prefer to duo it though.  You'll kill a lot more mobs with a partner and walk away with much more pp in gems.<br />
<br />
Beastlord is a fun duo.  Mage is great though.  I lost count of how many times CotH saved us from my bad pulling the other day.<br />
<br />
2 things to beware of on the west wall though.  There is a roaming treant that goes counter-clockwise around the zone.  He has a DS and can gate, which is a major pain.  The other is the named horsie.  Dropped him with 4 people very easily, but I doubt it can be soloed, since it's unslowable.  Even with 4 people it was a 4 or 5 minute fight IIRC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could probably do it with epic at your level. I didn't try PoG till recently but with horse + KEI it's a breeze without epic. The easy mobs take 4 BoNs and 2-3 KMs on pet. Stick to gale wolves, spiritflux wolves, glade stalkers, steeds(black ones, whites are a bit tougher cause they heal) and sanguine kodiaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is the shaman planar armor a random drop ( I mean can it be dropped by all mobs ) ? or only on tougher mobs ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which horsie are we talking about? The only two I have ever seen agro us on the loot side were Farstride Unicorn and Galiel Swifthoof. Both of which I can land Turgur's on, Galiel generally needs Malx though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm referring to Swifthoof.  Guess you need Malo then.  4 Malosini's didn't land, and 3 Turgur's, so I gave up. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Well, I don't have Malo either. ;) <br />

Must have been bad luck. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Me 56 shaman and my box 53 monk just started PoG. OMG is it a rush. I have done everything almost on the west side. I stay away from the horses and trents. This is a great zone but really scary.  I think a 58 shaman could do it. Just gate if there is a add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you can definitely handle it even with adds..well, depends on your gear.<br />
<br />
I went back to PoG to solo at 58. I am an iksar so i can't use JBB. I didn't have my epic.<br />
pretty much tore the place up, just real long kills.<br />
actually took three at once at one time, it was real close though.<br />
problem for me was, keeping bane and ebolt up slow would usually wear off at around 5 percent..with epic you can likely avoid that though. <br />
<br />
good luck in PoG, it's a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I started doing PoG solo at 61 with new pet, Malo, horse, JBB but no Torpor, no epic, no Pox.<br />
<br />
Seems to work great to have the fully buffed pet tank;  with a muzzle and couple of summoned proc weapons (Blades of Walnan or Fists of Ixiblat) pet can hold agro even with BoN on the mob and JBB blasting, as long as I give pet about a 10% of mob health head start.  Seems like one KM on the pet and 3 BoN plus JBB is enough for any of the regular west side mobs.<br />
<br />
I found I was even able to handle one &quot;regular mob&quot; add, while fighting another, using paralyzing earth to root park.<br />
<br />
Payday seems to average 120pp+ per mob, mostly in jewelry items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">im a 61 shaman with fungi horse epic and JBB , no malo or torper.<br />
<br />
i solo all of west side with ease and can handle 1 add easily.<br />
i usually tank the mobs myself and make 2k+ an hour. AAexp is slow but hey im there for plat.<br />
<br />
galiel is slowable without malo, just high MR (all the horses have higher Mr). getting 61 helps alot vs them. i wouldnt try it though without a tank as galiel can do ove 500 damn a round and beat down any shaman healer.<br />
<br />
treant are killer though, even with virelent paralysis and 3pet Aa at 61(spirit something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bourijn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm thinking about giving this a shot just for something new and fun.  I'm a level 57 shaman with epic and horse, but no jbb.  I have decent (not great) equipment - just under 1k ac and 1900hp unbuffed.  <br />
<br />
I have 2 questions - has anyone done this at level 57 solo without it being incredibly difficult?<br />
<br />
And also, I read somewhere a long time ago about a whirlwind kinda thing at the zone in - is there any trick to entering PoG, or can I just walk in?<br />

Thanks in advance for your help,<br />

<br />
What about faction issues in PoG?  I'm an agnostic cat.  I've read that after 3-5 kills you totally bottom out Tunare faction.<br />
<br />
I do not have to do any druid/ranger quests....but I have read that there are random druid/ranger/tunare loving NPC's all around Norrath and Luclin that may randomly attack you in cities, etc...and at druid rings  where you used to be unmolested.  Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much of a problem this would be for me, since I'm based in Nexus/PoK/Shar Vahl (have spiritstone) and use PoK books for transport, not druid rings...but I'd like to confirm faction issues before I hose it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok all went to PoG last night at 58 and was able to solo very effectively with KEI /Aego and somewhat effectively without them.  Do have to say the time that I spent duoing with a necro was MUCH more efficient then by myself as there was downtime between fights (not too bad with Stoicism though).  Personnally I do not think I could have handle adds very easily and I know I could not have taken 3 at once.  Below is my toy list so you can compare : )<br />

<br />
While most of the time this is true, *sometimes* the whorl can in fact see through invis. If someone is with us who has not ruined their PoG factions yet I will ask them to zone into PoG invised and tell us what the whorl cons. If its anything other than indifferent, we know its going to be a fun run to the wall.<br />
<br />
This is why its generally a good idea to leave the whorl alone, as long as nobody kills the non-invis seeing whorl, a see-invis whorl won't pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think it may be the Farstride Unicorn pathing by the whorl and casting see invis on him, rather than whorl spawning in different versions.  But who knows?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I usually zone in invised and prepared to run straight ahead (south) with the see-invis whorl on my tail.  I immobilize him at south wall, gate to WL portal, then immediately zone back in before whorl gets back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I know this is an old post but I thought I'd throw in my experience.  I'm 59, gear is decent but nothing amazing.  I had kei and virtue, equipped dog, and had bound myself at the zone in stone.  Zoned in invis and had no trouble with the whorl, then continued to run to the &quot;safe&quot; wall.  The kills were not bad at all, seemed that they all fell fairly quickly.  The biggest troubles I had were the white horses (black ones weren't a problem)  They had a dd spell that kept knocking me back and it was able to cast a root on me.  At this point, they started to freak me out so I would gate and start the process over again.  It seemed like something dropped on pretty much all of them which made it worthwhile but xp wasn't all that terrific.  I actually died once due to pet not listening and root not sticking and I was the only one in the zone.  Right as I was about to eat my death, a raid was forming so I was able to get a rez from them.  It's a fun thing to do when I'm not in the mood to grind xp or get in a group.</div></div><hr />

If you have a necro/mage/sk/monk to duo with all the yard trash is very easy to kill.  I duo quite a bit with a 56 necro and we have few problems (only problems come from my pulling  : ).<br />
<br />
It is a nice place to pop in a solo for a bit when you have some time to kill.<br />
