<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off this aint a SoE bitch thread, im happy with all the improvement and improved attitude and service from SoE for whatever the reason of their motivation.<br />
<br />
But ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Spawn times on mobs need to seriously be looked at. Every time a patch comes up all the euro guilds have their choice of all the mobs and the guilds that make up the majority of my server get the scraps that get left over. The server is a est/pst  server and yet eruo guilds are running the loot table ? This makes no sense to me and im sure the euro servers have a simalar problem.<br />
<br />
I ask the reason for this, why is it so hard to change the spawn time s to a offset hour so that NO ONE can have a advantage due to the hours they are around. By offseting the spawn times it insures that even though when the servers come up from a patch the euros/offest time zone guilds, will have firstpick, they will not have first pick EVERY spawn after that, that NO ONE will be able to monopolize spawns and we can all share int he loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I /feedback this after every patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OLD problem.  They somewhat addressed once by adding the random +/- time to spawn timers, but alas they seem to have forgotten to keep that up on some mobs.  I believe the majority of boss mobs do have a +/- random factor built into their spawn times now though.  i.e.  one guild on tribunal killed Fennin around 2 or 3pm Saturday and my guild killed Xegony around the same time saturday.  respawn on both is 3 days, however Fennin trigger didn't respawn until 11pm Tuesday and as far as I know Xegony still wasn't up when I logged.<br />
<br />
If there are specific mobs that you KNOW are spawning at the exact same time each cycle, /feedback or /bug it for sure though.</div></div><hr />

A euro guild can go do Statue/AoW, move to Ssra and take out all the named that are up including emp and then retire to Vex Thal for the evening before a est/pst guild gets there members on.  It happens all the time on my server.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty sad if a VT-enabled guild is still taking down AoW....  Sounds like they rushed to get their keys faster than their equipment allowed.</div></div><hr />

PoP makes this even more of a problem since you have to get flags by killing EVERY boss up to the elemental planes (7th hammer excepted) in order to acces them, and again every elemental boss to access time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that were the case but i think it doesnt even always have to do with the gear aow and such can drop. I know of some guilds that kill them well....because they are up. I mean to them why only do vex when you can take out some targets before hand. <br />
<br />
Alot of times its just one big raid for them. The aow/emp/vex cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Figuring 4 of the 6 items on AoW are droppable and only 1 has become outdated (the bow), I dont see why not.  I know a AoW kill recently dropped 3 Blade of Carnages.  I dont know wbout your guild, but I think having 3 addition BoC weilding tanks is a benefit.<br />
<br />
There are 3 guilds in VT right now on Saryn (though one may have moved on to Elemental).  All 3 of them still did AoW.</div></div><hr />

Well then that leaves up every god in PoP for you...no?<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think every Boss, all the way back to Nagafen/Vox should have a +- 24hr added to their spawn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exactly, just cause a guild can get into VT doesnt mean a BoC or a ring of destruction wont be upgrades to some people, not to mention guilds like mine that have varying levels, to some people high end kael still drops nice loot. While the higher end raiders wont want it, AoW or whatever will go down by their hand for the younger ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My guild is in VT right now.  AoW is not one of our primary targets but if he is up and we have nothing better to kill, we will kill him.  Not every recruit that we get has full VT gear and cursed weapons.  Our new warriors need BoCs and such, and I myself could go for a ring of destruction.  Remember:  every single item on his loot table has 100HP, that's not too shabby.  He is also very easy and fast to clear because you don't have to clear a bunch of crap to get to him.</div></div><hr />

     That the problem . ubber have : elemental named+pop named+vt and (put tracker) kill luclin and velious named . Spawn time are too long and not enough random. medium guild have only some crumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As an Euro i fully agree with you on this Litgruv.<br />
<br />
SoE really should try and improve as much spawn cycles as possible. With their recently changed habit there is actually a bit hope, that they will do. Albeit spawns will never be completely fair, depending what time zone has most guilds on your specific server.<br />
<br />
As a sidenote, may i suggest, that at least SOME patches are put to different times? Minor patches can even be done semi-automatic, so no need for fix time schedules. Granted, that bigger patches need SoE staff in office, but smaller ones?<br />
<br />
In my view it would be ideal (not that it will be done probably ...):<br />
Let's say: US-customers are 70 percent of player base, Euros 20 and Asians like 10 percent.<br />
So patches should be: 70 percent out of US prime time, 20 percent out of Euro prime time and 10 percent out of Asian prime time.<br />
<br />
Don't want to start a flame at all, just saying ALL aspects of the game should be as fair as possible to ALL players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me say that is pure BS that you are saying.<br />
<br />
being the leader of the only euro raiding guild on your server, i assume that you mean we are killing AoW, clear ssra and VT after patches. All that with 40-50 characters in about 4 hours since we raid 4 hours a day.<br />
you are lying because it never happened. a bit more of crybaby thing ...<br />
<br />
we kill AoW of course when we can, but only if we don't have more important things to do. (and AoW is good for guildbank too)<br />
<br />
for PoP gods, for sure it sucks to not having random timer on them, it sucks for everybody, not only the poor US guilds ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any mob of significance ought to be in an instanced dungeon/zone.<br />
<br />
And no, the increased drop rates this might imply wouldn't break the game: I read the same nonsense over the old Ragefire bottleneck.  The only people who suffer will be the people who used to monopolise spawns, and now will find the ebaying value of these drops reduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmmm, As a euro myself and one on a server without a major Asian guild I really fail to understand this problem.<br />
<br />
Todays top mobs are not up on server up (god timer anyone), have a respawn time that makes them spawn in a different timezone then the timezone they last went down in and thus are not part of this problem.<br />
<br />
There is an issue to some degree with older expansion mobs but even those have random spawn timers.<br />
And besides that losing your play time every other week to a patch is getting old fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to make it worse as stated before the random timer is either not installed on the mob or the range is to small and the next cycle goes to the Euro Guilds again.<br />
<br />
Being a Pacific Time zone guild I know about this all to well. If the Euro's didn't kill it then the EST guilds will. I personally would rather raid encounter mobs 60+ all be placed on a +/- 0-24 hour. So a 3 day cycle could pop as soon as 2 days but as long as 4 days giving others the chance to race, if need be, to a target instead of knowing exactly when its going to pop.</div></div><hr />

100% agree Crusty, I fail to see how this situation is ANY different from uber guilds keeping content from casual guilds.  Its all a matter of time and when you can devote your time.  My casual guild doesnt get enough of a force to do anything major till around 830pm est and by then just about everything is killed by the ubers who log on at 5pm est.<br />
<br />
You love the race so much, set your clock for 3am and stop bitching.  Otherwise try and get suggestions like Crusty's implemented where we can all enjoy the challenge of what we can do, not determined by the amount of hours we can play or when we can log in because there really isnt a race if you arent on is there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My feedback would be an affirmative on the shift to the patches during USA hours.  I'm about to head overseas for about a year.  Considering I'm a casual gamer, and don't raid I'd just as soon be able to play when I log on instead of waiting a few hours for them to finish patching.</div></div><hr />

Wow, we really need to learn from this incredible euro guild, how do they make all of ssra as well as statue instantly spawn on server up?  I never remember them doing that for us...<br />
<br />
Oh wait thats right.<br />
<br />
They don't.<br />
<br />
The only thing we tend to clear on server up is the Aten chain, how your mystical euro guild finds the time and willpower to do the aow and ssra on top of that is beyond me.  Oh wait, they probably don't either.</div></div><hr />

We don't have the pick of the content for the most part, we have the pick of what spawns quickly, its luck.  Sometimes it plays in Euro favor, sometimes it doesnt.  /shrug it all balances out in the end.<br />
<br />
Bar a few remaining issues in the elementals, blocking isnt so easy these days.  UK is at a similar stage in progression to 2 US guilds, and omgs, we don't have any problems with either of them, infact we actually cooperate to the extent that we've frequently helped each other backflag etc.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem relating to blocking of content because at the stage I am at, we don't do that.  Sorry to disapoint, I'm not the evil cockblocking euro your looking for. =(<br />
<br />
(I will add, I've heard of issues in certain elemental planes with certain mini bosses required for progression being blocked but /shrug, I can't comment there as I'm yet to even zone in to them).<br />
<br />
In closing, let me guess, you had an unlucky (From your timezone) spawn in ssra and everything decent spawned early for once, it happens, deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I know your not the evil euro , maybe thats what cause you to be so displease, im sure you get alot of **** for being the euro guild and unjustly get blame on your server. Im not looking to blame anyone sebazy, im not ranting or pointing fingers. Im trying to bring like to a true problem on MY server. Fact is , most the euro guilds on my server are really nice people and dont set out to block us, they are just lucky enough to be there after a patch comes up and can pick what they want of MOST mobs. No not every mob on the server is right up on server up , but a very large percent of the mobs are or will pop shortly after. so if its a 2 hours patch or even a 1 hour patch or even if the server reset, then we can look to the euro guilds on my server running the spawns for a long time and the rest of us fighting for scraps.<br />
<br />
So im not looking to blame euro's, infact that was the point of the post. Its not their fault, its the fault of the spawn times. I dont want us to have a advantage cause we are what the server timezone is setup around or whatever, i want the spawns offset, say by 12 or 9 hours, something to make them always spwan different when killed so that no matter what happens whoever gets one kill, the other will get the next. This way we can share the mobs equaly.<br />
<br />
Ssra spawning early on server up i can handle once, a euro guild owning the spawn for a month or 2 is not cool, nor is it for my timezone guilds to own it for 2 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I feel pretty confident saying that they will never, ever fix this.  That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Patches actually don't have alot to do with AoW...I don't know about Cursed cycle and VT (think VT spawns on patch up though).<br />
<br />
AoW spawns randomly within 3 days of server up.  Crash the zone on a fugged up Vindi pull (/glare Cocodrilo), and you will see how pissed off your guild will be if your target was statue (who was up) but because the zone died because you accidentally caused a bug to take down the zone he (SoRZ) will not be up when zone repops...sucks.<br />
<br />
On the Nameless we generally had more of a porblem with the TW's monopolizing Ssra, training people and blowing the cursed cycle so that cursed would be up for them.<br />
<br />
To say the problem is only caused by Euro guilds is innacurate.  There is no real solution besides wider random timers and shorter respawns so for now don't blame the Euro's just /feedback what and why and do it in a respectful manner with no cursing (fastest way to get your note trashed if not completly ignored).<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised how many times a late patch mess up any chance of getting a raid that day, at least for euro players. Then again it's surprising how many times mob are still up the day after :)<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As a Euro, I love it.  get to kill mobs and get loot.  Of course sometimes I get home and get to try login and not get in until most of our raiding time is over.  <br />
<br />
As for a guild doing AoW, Ssra Cursed/HP/AL, Emperor and VT.  that's just too funny.  Ain't no way in a 4-5 hours a guild can do all of those.  <br />
<br />
And of course sometimes american players come along WAY before they are at their raid times and kill trigger mobs to prevent us from getting stuff.  /Cheer Jade Dragons of Xegony.  Mind you, we did get the best overall loot from the last fennin because of that.  <br />
<br />
And of course some american guilds are happy to sacrifice their honour and lie in order to get content.  /cheer Draco Invicticu and Claws of Veeshan.  The price of entering the Elemental Planes is your honour.  We zone into Tactics for RZtW, this 45man guild alliance runs to clear a few mobs, claims they are clearing to the triggers.  So we back off and leave the zone.  2 hours later they are actully forming groups at zone in with 80+ for real in order to try the RZtW script.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So, I'm a dirty Euro.  but at least my hands are clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heh, it still boils down to one thing:<br />
<br />
Euro/EST = content<br />
CST = some content<br />
PST = next-to-no content<br />
<br />
Slather me up and call me Sally, but the Elemental planes were just not designed for the 8+ guilds that roam around some servers.  Hard to say if SOE intended this kind of competition in order to keep loot sidelined to a single group or if they are just THAT clueless as to how broke the PoP endgame is.  <br />
<br />
A simple adjustment to the spawn timer on minibosses making them TRULY random by adding some variance would easily fix this problem.  The current randomizer is so NOT random that you can know within a couple of hours when mobs are due.  Even increasing the frequency of spawns would help some of the server crowding issues.<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY curious as to just how Time is supposed to work when all those Ele guilds eventually claw their way in and find out they can't use the zone they just fought for.  Maybe some LDoN-style instancing is in order instead of the whack-ass system they have atm. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Actually, a truly random timer would be the WRONG way to go.<br />
<br />
PST complain EST kill them<br />
EST complain Euro Kill them.<br />
so on so forth<br />
<br />
And claim that magically all mobs should be random.  If they were random then 1/4 Mobs would spawn during Asian Window, 1/4 Europe Window, 1/4 EST, 1/4 PST.  Fair Right?  HELL NO.<br />
<br />
Your assuming that the same number of players exist in each window.<br />
Which is totally not true.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to be fair, they would need to compare play windows and time of thier player base.  This would mean more mobs would spawn during EST/PST window as more player play in that window.<br />
<br />
So a completely random timer = bad.   A timer would need to be weighted so that the odds of a spawn increase during windows where the player base is larger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Bah, this is a sad little topic, totally pointless. Waste of forum space.<br />
<br />
I am from Euro guild and we yet have to manage to &quot;monopolize&quot; all them spawns as you scream here. Sure, we're not big or strong enough to do big things on planes, but we do fight some lower end mobs. No matter how effective we are, we still can't do all of them. We may get 1-3 of easier mobs (1-2 harder ones) and that's that, pleny of them still left up while we are out of time. If you still miss them, well, too bad and not our fault. Then what? The &quot;bad bad EST&quot; people are suddenly stepping on your toes? Imagine that, the're also 3 hours earlier on then PST ones are.<br />
<br />
Funny how you in your ignorance fail to see the simple thing - the patches go on during Euro GAME times. These 8-9 hours (and often more) patches occure at the time, when we would be usually ONLINE, but we can't now. For the most of the Europe, once these patches are done, there's very little time left to actually do anything &quot;serious&quot;. Most are working people or go to school/univesity and need some sleep before it. When you hit the bed at midnight and servers come up at 22:00, do the math and tell me, how much time we actually have LEFT to do anything?<br />

You also seem to miss some pretty obvious things. You know, from the approx 6 or more of &quot;uber&quot; guilds on my server (i.e. guilds which are already in PoTime or about to get there, have full elemental planes access (or almost full) and VT is just a supermarket for them) only one of them is Euro guild. And that Euro guild isn't even yet in PoTime, but is working to get there. Funny, if US guilds get shafted all the time, as you state, then how come that most of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds are all US ones? Mind that these US ones are already old guilds, while Euro one is pretty new (in that area anyway). If they were at such disadvantage as you state, they wouldn't be known as &quot;uber&quot; guilds, now already for YEARS.<br />
<br />
I suppose that you want to have these patches run during the Euro day and evening times, so that Euro people could not log on at all during the patch days? Nice of you. Or add some additional times for mob spawns, so that Euro guilds would still never get them? I wont even go into details of quite few US guilds on my server, who specifically kill many named or boss NPC's in various areas when they don't need them, just to prevent Euro guilds from killing those mobs, so that the next time they spawn they are well beyond Euro playing times. So yes, indeed, I will /feedback as you wished, but the opposite thing. What's next then? PST guilds starting to do the same thing to EST guilds?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Don't pretend that Euro guilds don't have a HUGE timezone advantage. They do. The only reason they don't dominate totally is that they have a MUCH smaller pool of players to pull from to build their guild. <br />
<br />
But it's not just patch day. And this gets to the heart of the reason it's hard to fix. It's every day. Euro guilds have about a 16-18 hour spawn window. American guilds have MAYBE an 8 hour spawn window (assuming they are large/strong enough to start raiding at 6 pm est and continue to 2 am est, due to lots of PST raiders also). In practice, the American guilds have less, and the Euro guilds more. <br />
<br />
Basically, anything that spawns after midnight EST, up until 4 or 5 pm EST, is in the European window, and American guilds only have a shot at things that the Euros leave up, or that spawn during the 5pm - midnight EST window. <br />
<br />
European guilds can pick from anything that spawns in a 16-18 hour window. American guilds get the pick of a 6-8 hour window. The only way to &quot;even it up&quot; is for a server to also have a big powerful Asian guild to take a third of the spawn window as well. No matter how SoE randomizes the spawns, it won't change the huge advantage European guilds have from getting first pick every day. The only thing they could do would be to start intentionally bunching spawns around 6 pm EST, and a whole lot of their customers would throw a fit over that one. <br />
<br />
Let's face it. The entire system with once-a-week spawning of highly contested mobs is mind-bogglingly stupid. They don't &quot;fix&quot; it because they can't. Suggest a REAL fix, that still has these contested mobs spawn once a week.  I don't think there is one.  It's a lousy idea that they've carried on WAY too long in the game system, because they didn't have a better one. Hopefully in future expansions, or in EQ2, they'll do something better. The raids in LDoN are one tiny step in the right direction, as no guild can prevent another one from getting a chance to do a raid. Of course, they have a vast host of problems of their own, but at least it's a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">One major thing to keep in mind...<br />
<br />
It's not just what a Euro Guild kills before EST or EST before PST...<br />
It's what the placement advantage is.<br />
<br />
What I mean:<br />
Guild A: Raid Force Capable 4 PM EST<br />
Guild B: Raid Force Capable 7 PM EST.<br />
<br />
Guild A kills the birds in POf, and say 2 or 3 minis.  Now Guild B has an equivlent force on.  However, the fact that Guild A is already there or starting preempts Guild B from getting half the spawns that are left.<br />
<br />
Vex Thall is worse than fire.  Guild A starts moving deeper into VT, Guild B is left with the twins maybe.  But its not like Guild B could suddenly get 1 of the 2 blobs even if they are both equal leveled forces at 8 pm<br />
<br />
The problem isnt just what Guild A can kill when Guild B isn't raiding.  <br />
Problem is that Guild A can dominate a zone by placement, long after the point where they have superior force.<br />
<br />
PS: in fire's case the random timer makes zone dominating worse.<br />
Because theres usually enough for the Dominate Guild to move in and have continual boss work.  By time 2nd guild is ready theres only 1 to 2 mobs up at a time.  Not worth zoning into fire, increasing lag, and trying to force a split on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Being a PST guild raid leader this really is something that has been seriously bugging me for a long long time. <br />
<br />
First of all its not just the euro guilds that have an advantage. Guilds that can kill old content with very small groups do too. The one time guild on our server kills AoW for greed almost everytime he spawns and takes out cursed for twink gear (also a favorite target of the top euro guild). Most nights by the time we have a raid force on (usually 6PM PST or so) we get to raid everyone else's left overs unless on the rare occasion that its just spawned. And like someone said, its not just whats been killed its what the other guilds with a few hours advantage are getting ready to kill too. Theres a lot more mid level (upper luclin, VT) guilds on Torv then in any other range, but we have to fight over content with not only each other, but every guild above us when they decide they need to equip their alt's alts or make some quick plat.<br />
<br />
Ever since they've put in the instancing technology I've been feedbacking to make ssra and VT instanced and spawnable like the LDoN raids by each guild once per week. <br />
<br />
Something seriously needs to be done because the number of people at this level is only going to continue to grow as even casual guilds can start killing some of this stuff now with a bit of work. Its really bad now,  but think in another year from now there could be twice as many guilds at the luclin bottleneck. They've given people the ability to get to level 65 easily, but have done nothing to add to the content either by increasing respawn rate, new mid level raid zones, or instancing to provide content for all of these new 65's that want to raid. While this is a problem more for guilds just getting into raiding its just going to get worse as more and more people pile up in line for the limited content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I really have sympathy for you, Darkpaw. I'm also on Torv, in one of those other clustered Luclin/VT guilds (NDR in my case). Fortunately we're primarily EST, and get going a couple hours before you do, at least for mobs that don't require maximum force. I'm not even sure which guild you are, but being a PST raid guild has to be hell.   The clustering of guilds in the high luclin/VT/low PoP area on Torv is horrible. I can only assume that it's similar on a lot of other servers. <br />
<br />
What's happening now is this:  L's 61-65 and the PoP AA's have trivialized all the content that was not designed with that level of PC capability in mind. This means that guilds which are not really &quot;uber&quot; guilds, and don't have fanatical players with huge consistent playtimes (and required raid amounts) can now do that content. So, guilds that simply would NEVER manage to kill Emp Ssra if everyone was L 60 and could only get an AA in 4-5 hours of exp'ing can now easily do it, because everyone is L 65 and most of them have 100+ AA points. All it takes is the willingness to recruit a big group of people, and the patience on their part to stick around long enough to get people keyed. And, Voila, there's another guild in VT.  Note that these are the same guilds compete for the few low-tier PoP mobs with decent loot (eg TZ, VZ, Behemoth, TT).<br />
<br />
The ceiling for casual guilds is now Emp, VT, and low tier PoP mobs. And people are clustering there like mad. It takes a LOT more to kill Bertoxx et al. and then RZ to get into the elemental planes. So guilds get to that level and sit there a long frickin time. And now there are just too damn many of them, and not enough to do. I'm starting to think VT is a total waste of time unless you're Euro, or willing to spend all your free time fighting with people over VT (and still not getting much for the effort). Unfortunately, at that level of the game, there's nowhere else to raid for the gear that'll get you into the elemental planes. <br />
<br />
The whole thing is really starting to put me off the EQ raid game again. It's a pity. I've only been back at it a couple months, and had been having fun. If we don't break through and starting getting Bert/MithMarr/Saryrn flags at least soon, I may end up fading out again.<br />
<br />
edit:  Some method of instancing old raid content so a guild could do it once a week would be phenomenal. They still seem to have their heads up their asses and are determined to keep anything good &quot;rare&quot; for some stupid reason, though. If each guild could spawn Emp/Vt/PoP gods once a week, that'd be phenomenal. It's not like each guild getting Emp once a week would REALLY mean everyone had all the emp loot. Just that If they did him every week for a YEAR everyone in the guild would have one or two pieces from him - if the guild membership didn't churn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">And to make it worse as stated before the random timer is either not installed on the mob or the range is to small and the next cycle goes to the Euro Guilds again.<br />
<br />
Being a Pacific Time zone guild I know about this all to well. If the Euro's didn't kill it then the EST guilds will. I personally would rather raid encounter mobs 60+ all be placed on a +/- 0-24 hour. So a 3 day cycle could pop as soon as 2 days but as long as 4 days giving others the chance to race, if need be, to a target instead of knowing exactly when its going to pop.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am personally sick of hearing all this whining about Euro guilds taking all the spawns.<br />
Being a Euro but not being in a Raiding Guild it doesnt really matter to me one way or the other but im still sick of hearing it.<br />
What does really annoy me is most of the solutions put forward to getting round this involve changing the spawn timers on the mobs.<br />
Ive yet to see anyone say well lets move the patch to peak time Eastern or whatever and ruin the Americans online time on patch day.<br />

Nope it doesnt affect me but as my post stated why does no one want to move patch time to peak US time to remedy this.<br />

which leads to <br />
2) It's never going to get fixed.  Yes it's currently very adventageous to be in a euro based guild, deal with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The good news is they can only kill key targets for so long before they'll have to spawn on your time eventually.  Dealing with time guilds still killing the elemental gods when they do pop on your timezone is something else all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">If they wan't to keep the status quo on timers and move patch time so that everything pops soon as I get off work, feel free!!  I'd volunteer for that anytime. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I have talked this over with many friends many times. <br />
<br />
The best solution we have come up with is <br />
<br />
      flag / key mobs no loot SPAWNABLE or on like half of current spawn or 6 hours which ever is less<br />
<br />
      Loot mobs Increase spawn rate a lot and decerease the drop rate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I like the idea of instanced boss mob fights. Just like ragefire, maybe have 2 triggers per mob that respawn 30 min after the fight is over. Guilds could actually plan to progress when they are able to. Euros, PSTers, everyone gets a shot.  I hated the race to mob__00, getting there and finding some other guild more set up, people actually calling out from work to be sure they could be siting on a spawn when servers come back up. its just crazy.<br />
I say I hated because I helped form an ultra small guild that gives less than a damn about the end game, life is good when you give up the race to be uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I think that at this point making the spawns stay as rare as they are is pointless.  Raid targets are supposed to be high end content, but limiting that content in such a way as to only be experiencable by a few people per day or per week is bad game design.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer to see instancing, but I'm not sure old content is capable to be instanced.<br />
<br />
If instancing is not an option, have the encounter mobs respawn like normal mobs with a one or two hour timer.  If all mobs in the encounter have spawned and are still alive and in the correct spot then spawn the boss.  Flag the raid characters so they can't participate again until a day or week later.  A similiar technology exists with Vox/Nagafen - if the character is over a certain level, they get booted out of the zone.  The same thing could happen to a character with an unexpired AOW tag, for example.<br />
<br />
This gives everyone that wants a shot at an encounter the opportunity to do so, but tags keep pharmers from repeatedly dipping from the well, so to speak.</div></div><hr />
