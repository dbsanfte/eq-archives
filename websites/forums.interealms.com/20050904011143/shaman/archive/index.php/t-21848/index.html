<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any suggestions for a 61 Shaman and a 61 Ranger to duo?  We've worked the zone line of The Deep a couple times and that's gone pretty well, but we'd like to have some more options for a change of scenery.  Right now we are looking mostly for xp, but some drops for cash would be kinda nice too.  We've done froggies in PoS with a necro friend, but he's not always available and the camp is probobly a bit dangerous for us to attempt on our own.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Exeley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nightstalkers in PoN perhaps? Options to tank em or aggro-kite (shaman dots, ranger shoots arrows) or root-rot as they don't summon. Not sure if ranger can harmony else you will get double pulls but you've snare and root so not too big a deal. They drop diamonds and blue diamonds fairly often so can make some nice cash from it and xp is quite reasonable.<br />
<br />
Maybe try velketors if you want a change of scene, start off at the bottom, work up if you are comfortable with it. Not the best xp ever but something to do whilst LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lots and lots of places you can visit:<br />
<br />
Droga - Poor xp for the trouble, but easy kills and decent drops.  At 61 you may stick close to ZI.  Near Nurga will be mobs that better fit your level.  Get to know this zone, though, since it will be a moneymaker for awhile.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia - About the same as Droga, but a little further out so likely less competition.<br />
<br />
The Deep - Almost no-one goes here so it's fairly safe. Not great drops, but the XP isn't bad. You would need to be proficient at handling 2 or more mobs for break-in. I'd recommend invising somewhere out of the way to avoid the occasional ZI train.<br />
<br />
The Hole - Things are lite blue at 65, but at 61 you may have a good time hunting down in the city.  Some of the named drop things here worth 5k in bazarr easy.  Need to gate out once you get into the courtyard.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - I think you are high enough level now to single the mushrooms. Extremely boring but not much to worry about.<br />
<br />
Madien's Eye - Should be able to find a nice corner to pull the roamers to. Never really camped here so no idea of the XP/ Drops.<br />
<br />
The Umbral Plains - Same as Madien's Eye but a bit higher level.<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins - Should be able to camp the entry hallway for decent xp.<br />
<br />
LoY - Many good spots in LoY. XP isn't bad and drops are decent. Out of the way so very little competition. Try any of the camps in Nadox, ZI at Hates, Nadox ZI at Torigan, luggald caves in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate - ZI mobs are easy. Also some nice places close to the ZI where you can hunt. The marsinger quests are well worth doing. CRs are a pain here though.<br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto - Stay away from the ZI/ZO and you can do well here. XP isn't great but the place is easy to get to now that PoM is in the GD. This is a bit rougher than most of the other places I mentioned since a lot of it is under water.<br />
<br />
Chardok - You could probably do the entry hallway / ZO area. ZO is a bit harder to break but easier since you can run to ZO when in trouble.<br />
<br />
Skyfire - Lots of wanderers here that should be in your range. I hunted the Chrono's for the essence of sunlight that sold very well. You will be debuffed while doing this.<br />
<br />
City of Mist - You might still get some xp from some of the mobs near the castle. Was decent XP and not too dangerous.<br />
<br />
Old Seb - Several camps here you should be able to do.  Heard that the jem drops were nerfed so may not be worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Veksar - Entrance gobbies are in your range and the faction for the non-Iksar is good. Be sure to do the weapon turn-in quest.  Resistant to the Poison/Disease dots so LDoN curses work best.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - Easy access now since it is in the GD. Do the halflings along the castle wall and the yard trash. Be sure to figure out where the ZO tree is in the courtyard before you agro anything. Lots of spell component drops here so get an idea of what you need and watch for it. You can help fill your spellbook as you get xp.<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation - ZI camps or factory possibly.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,<br />

<br />
Some Hole mobs partially mitigate slow IIRC. It's not too bad since they don't hit hard (&lt;200?), but at 61 your healing options are somewhat limited, especially if you get adds (and you will) that will interrupt your 10 sec mini-CH. As far as the gating thing goes, I believe you can now invis and run out of the castle, but I haven't done it with a melee character myself yet.<br />
<br />
Madien's Eye - Should be able to find a nice corner to pull the roamers to. Never really camped here so no idea of the XP/ Drops.<br />
<br />
The mobs there drop Acrylia blocks, which sell OK in the Bazaar, but it's not as good as named loot. Most mobs should be low dark blues and VERY duoable at 61. One time I had a 58-59 Ranger tank slowed mobs there and she rarely needed healing. The XP wasn't that good, though, so you may want to try to move to UP, one zone over. It has higher level mobs that give better XP and don't hit that much harder, although they have a fair number of HPs. Just watch out for the occasional See Invis mobs at the ME side zone-in, they HT for 700ish and Fear, not a good combo. Oh yes, and there are also traps in ME.<br />
<br />
LoY - Many good spots in LoY. XP isn't bad and drops are decent. Out of the way so very little competition.<br />
<br />
That may change once they put a PoP book there :)<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate - ZI mobs are easy. Also some nice places close to the ZI where you can hunt. The marsinger quests are well worth doing. CRs are a pain here though.<br />
<br />
You will need a Wizard to port you there and a gate potion for the Ranger to get out. On the plus side, the agro range is small and there are places where you can camp things fairly safely. I am not sure how well the Ranger will be able to tank even ZI mobs, they hit for a few hundred, IIRC. Also, make sure to learn as much as you can about the locals before you go there. Some can only be cast on when you are in melee range.<br />
<br />
Chardok - You could probably do the entry hallway / ZO area. ZO is a bit harder to break but easier since you can run to ZO when in trouble.<br />
<br />
ZI mobs should be turning LB at 61, but there is always a chance of a decent random drop in Chardok. You could probably get better XP deeper in, e.g. the levitation tunnel, but chances are that eventually you will get an add too many or a Snare resists too many and the Ranger will buy it. Getting a corpse summoner and a rezzer there can be a bit painful.<br />
<br />
Skyfire - Lots of wanderers here that should be in your range. I hunted the Chrono's for the essence of sunlight that sold very well. You will be debuffed while doing this.<br />
<br />
I hate debuffers and stuck to wyrms when I hunted there, but, admittedly, chromatics have better loot.<br />
<br />
City of Mist - You might still get some xp from some of the mobs near the castle. Was decent XP and not too dangerous.<br />
<br />
There will be a fair number of low dark blues and many light blues there. The XP should be noticeable but not that great at 61, IIRC.<br />
<br />
Old Seb - Several camps here you should be able to do.  Heard that the jem drops were nerfed so may not be worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Yes, it has been nerfed. If you decide to do Seb, watch out for casters (resists) and runners. A resisted Snare can result in a spectacular train there :)<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - Easy access now since it is in the GD. Do the halflings along the castle wall and the yard trash.<br />
<br />
Er, those mini-Zorros hit for 300-400, don't they? Good XP, but I doubt a 61 Ranger could tank them without sucking the Shaman's mana pool  dry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the xp is better than tier 1 pop, and the loot is exceptional. I'd say you could easily handle any camp thats easily single pulled, and i know this because when my ranger and shaman were this level this is where i xp'ed.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Madien's Eye - Should be able to find a nice corner to pull the roamers to. Never really camped here so no idea of the XP/ Drops.<br />
<br />
Xp is horrible here, all its used for mostly is people camping Vt shards.<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins - Should be able to camp the entry hallway for decent xp.<br />
<br />
Xp sucks here at this level, and I tryed it for a few hours. Loot isn't all that either except for the occasional acrylia drop.<br />
<br />
LoY - Many good spots in LoY. XP isn't bad and drops are decent. Out of the way so very little competition. Try any of the camps in Nadox, ZI at Hates, Nadox ZI at Torigan, luggald caves in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Can possibly dou the harder named boats in dulak, but might have a problem when the captian spawns. Can also dou for some of the loy spells in nadox if ya don't have them yet. <br />
<br />
Skyfire - Lots of wanderers here that should be in your range. I hunted the Chrono's for the essence of sunlight that sold very well. You will be debuffed while doing this.<br />
<br />
Might be able to take guardian wurms for spells witht he shammy tanking and ranger shooting. Just keep torpor up and keep casting cheal.<br />
<br />
City of Mist - You might still get some xp from some of the mobs near the castle. Was decent XP and not too dangerous.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly good xp back by the castle since the revamp, and the ranger can track and kill nameds. <br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - Easy access now since it is in the GD. Do the halflings along the castle wall and the yard trash. Be sure to figure out where the ZO tree is in the courtyard before you agro anything. Lots of spell component drops here so get an idea of what you need and watch for it. You can help fill your spellbook as you get xp.<br />
<br />
Yard trash here hits for 3-400 a pop, as do the asslings on the wall. Not sure if they root rot-able, if so then ya can do em. I'd wait to 62 at least to try these since they put out decent dps that a shammy will find hard outhealing at 61.<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation - ZI camps or factory possibly. <br />
<br />
I'd wait til 62 to try the golems in the factory, but ya should be able to take the tin soldiers. They can't be harmonyed but i think can be singled from maxx range. Regular poi mobs are ok at this level but watch for trains and the occasional unslowable mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do you have Magelos set up?  It would help to determine what the ranger can or cant tank.<br />
<br />
I duo'd with my ranger/shaman from 56 on and about 40AA.  I did a lot of PoJ (Basement rats, Goalers) and PoD CY.  I remember trying PoS frogs and remember having problems with them.  I think dillos at the pond in the desert area would be easier. Once I got some decent (droppable, pre-ornate) equipment, I was able do PoD CY groups with just the shaman healing a plate tank, which had a pretty good return on XP.<br />
<br />
They best piece of equipment that I bought while duoing was a Windblade.  Why?  When slowed, reposte damage from PoJ mobs accounted from 40% of total damage taken using duel weld.  A Windblade is nice and slow (so you take a lot less reposts), hits for a lot and will do more DPS then a duel weld combo at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gotta agree with redchief on the riposte thing, if ya can get an uber 2hander cheap go for it, I've found that its not that easy to bazaar equip 2 1 handers for a ranger at a decent price and got lucky and recieved a 45 35 2hs as an invite with a dkp guild, seems none of thier rangers wanted to waste the dkp and rather than having it rot they let me get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I suggest Veksar - not just entrance mobs, but basically as deep as you want to go. You will need plenty of IVU potions, but there are heaps of named deeper in with good bazaar loot in the 1k - 20k range.<br />
<br />
Basically, from 61, you can solo almost anything in Veksar. I did it with just melee / pet / Epic DoT (most mobs in Veksar have insane poison / disease resists, making most of our DoTs useless). If you have any of the LDoN dots, these will stick fine (Odium, Anathema, Bane), but you certainly don't need them.<br />
<br />
Veksar is slow soloing, but will be much faster as a duo. Some of the named are very hard to single pull, some are very easy.<br />
<br />
As a final note - Words of Agony drops moderately regularly in Veksar - DO NOT sell this to a vendor - it is still worth around 10k on most servers!<br />
<br />
Another suggestion, although certanly challenging, is perhaps SolC - the kobold side zone in should be a do-able duo option. Single pulling is tricky, but using your spirit of the howler pet, you can use the standard SK or BL pet-pulling technique to get singles (top tip - use spirit of shrew on pet). You might even be able to clear all the way to Spiritmaster Heili, although you will have to be on top of your game to take him, perhaps, but the rewards are woth the effort - he drops a 2hs which is something like 40/43 with great stats / resists or a 1hs which is 15/22 with good stats / resists, or, rarely, an very very good ring with a nice extended buff 4 focus. <br />
<br />
Caves in PoN is also an option - snare kiting is very viable - you can either let ranger keep aggro (not that hard with the right combo of very low level low mana ranger spells) while you stack dots and send pet, or you can just let ranger snare and play ping-pong with your dots and his bow, with whoever has aggro doing the running until the other person gets aggro back. I emphasise that snare is the key here - you cannot afford to get smacked up much at your level - you should probably pull with malo, and run past the ranger so he can snare - you really do need snare to stick first time, every time.</div></div><hr />
