As part of EverQuest's 6th Anniversary celebration, the game team is giving current EQ players (based on your total subscription length) one special Veteran Reward for every year that you've been an active EverQuest subscriber! This is very good news for six year vets! It means that you'll be getting six Veteran Rewards! <br />
<br />
Note: you'll find the Veteran Rewards tab in the game's AA user interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 year <br />
Lesson of the Devoted: A character will gain double-XP for 30-minutes every 24 hours. When this reward is in effect, the character will be surrounded by a special blue-white glow.  <br />
    <br />
2 year <br />
Infusion of the Faithful: This reward grants increased run speed for 15 minutes once every 24 hours.  <br />
    <br />
3 year <br />
Chaotic Jester: Once every 24 hours, a character can summon a Bristlebane puppet for 15 minutes. During that time, the puppet randomly casts various spells that provide benefits or minor penalties.  <br />
    <br />
4 year <br />
Expedient Recovery: Once a week, this &quot;Back to New&quot; reward summons all of a player's corpses back to him, and gives back all XP that was on the corpses. <br />
     <br />
5 year <br />
Steadfast Servant: Once every 24 hours, a creature is summoned that stays in the area for a half hour, buffing and healing player characters nearby.  <br />
    <br />
6 year <br />
Staunch Recovery: Once every three days, a character is healed back to full health, mana, and endurance. <br />
    <br />
7 year <br />
Intensity of the Resolute: Once every 24 hours, a character's melee attacks, damage spells and heals are increased for five minutes. When this reward is in effect, the character will be surrounded by a glow of energy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, it's got the curiosity piqued for sure.<br />
<br />
Are these passive abilities based on game timers, or do we have to &quot;turn them on&quot; through use of a hotkey or /alt activate code of some kind? Will we be able to use these at our discretion once the ability has &quot;refreshed&quot; or does it automatically refresh and go into effect whether you're in RSS or sitting on your arse tradeskilling?<br />
<br />
If these answers are posted somewhere, never mind me. I'm doped up pretty good on sinus pills ATM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rytan probably nerfed it.<br />
<br />
His next spell will be like his next job... it will be a one time permanent effect, self only.<br />
<br />
Every time your character opens its mouth between the hours of 9 and 5 it will emote &quot;Would you like fries with that?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think you stay subscribed for an additional year to get it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">was that a hoax ... the link is broken now<br />
Not a nerf, but he did adjust it to a 30 second duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">so is this time since account creation (oct 2001) or time since I last reactivated my account (about 30 minutes ago).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Rashere posted on the EQLive boards that it was total subscribed time... so for example, if you subscribed for a year before you quit, then you'd get the one year reward.  Or if you subscribed a year, then quit for a year, then subscribed another year, then quit, then the two year reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wot a gimmick.  if u have been playing for say 4 days in a week at an ave of 3 hours each day, if u died on monday or tue, then the corpses wil have no exp timer left on them.<br />
can only really work on a recent death.  they should make this refresh every 36  hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I hope this is a hoax.  This just seems really lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Gimmicks to keep the masses from raising pitchforks and torches is all it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If it is posted early... why does the cheap account renewal start on April 11 pretty dang close to that mark, so it sorta woulda made sense to post now so people know.  I guess it'll just go in with the patch so you can knee-jerk react to it and renew immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
  What I want to know for sure is if it is based off of /played time for creation, or time logged in.  I doubt if it is by time logged in as that would just BEG for people to leave themselves constantly logged in.<br />
<br />
  Also, can you get the later rewards as you pass the mark for them?  For instance, I am birthday on May 31.  When I pass that date will I get a new ability added in?   Really hope so since I'd love to get the year 7 eventually.<br />
<br />
<br />
  And of course, on that same note, if you renew your subscription for the next year's gift, and you DO get new rewards added each year, does that mean you are now always a year ahead, or does it mean that the next year you don't get a new one since you already bought it early (but a year from that you'd start getting new ones again).<br />
<br />
  Oh yeah, and on the rez thing, I'm not sure if that is a once a week free CS rez, or if it actually means that by leaving some summoned items on all of your old bodies you can reclaim the last 4% you didn't get from the friendly clerics (or the 10% the pally couldn't get you... if so it'd make pally rezzes quite a bit more common).<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, ask a couple of those questions if you get the chance in Gummit please Glor, and care to see any of the answers.<br />
<br />
  My picture of how it'll work is that they are AAs, with associated hotkeys and insanely long timers.  Cost of 0 AA each, but with a pre-req of /played time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'm assuming most of these will be triggered effects... <br />
<br />
Can't really see crapping out a pile of corpses once a week while running to a group...<br />
<br />
and the double exp doesn't do much good if you're in trade mode or waiting for a rez...hmm double exp on a rez... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Can they really give these options or will it simply increase the value of ebay-ed toons?</div></div><hr />
