I do have one question for this debate? Legolas is mentioned over and over. I never got the impression that he was a ranger - but then again - I DID get the impression that woodelves and their various kin throughout the LOTR series were FAR FAR superior in their ability to fletch/boyer and used archery almost exclusively. Not that it's all that important but it seems that in my opinion wood elves would be superior fletchers and boyers. Been wondering why we never had cultural from the start myself.<br />
<br />
This isn't to say it's not fair to them half elf heretics and halfings or the clumbsy humans, just that the actual ability to fletch these items from a RPG mentality makes sense.<br />
<br />
Odds are there are going to be some changes/adjustments to this based off the inability to use these new arrows already. Maybe they will fix it so they can be used by all bow welding classes.<br />
<br />
Finally feel vindicated in spending all my money as a young fer'dal running around the faydark to get to grand master fletcher:D</div></div><hr />

Requiring the items to be smithed by wood elfs, but could be fletched by non-wood elves wouldn't be as bad as it looks. Wood elf blacksmiths are becoming more common, especially with some of the Luclin things that require blacksmithing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, from a RPG standpoint, Crydee's definition makes more sense. Half elves are half human, half elf. Depending on thier starting home, should determine what thier cultural skills should be, not that definition that they are a half-breed, and have no culture. If you were raised with humans, you should be included in human cultural skills. If you were raised with elves, then elf cultural. Or am I jaded?<br />
<br />
BTW- this is an observation, not a complaint. I will now retract to my cubicle.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I even consider it an issue is because Verant *DID* state that there would be ranger-only fletching in addition to wood elf only fletching. So far there is no sign of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just kidding.<br />
<br />
It could of been worse.. imagine the outcry if it had been Halfling cultured fletching. :)<br />
<br />
If these items are in my ablitity to fletch, then any ranger on Seventh hammer is welcome to look me up (If you intend to use these yourself that is). I would be glad to help a fellow ranger make these at cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And from a RP perspective yes and no on WoodElfs being better Fletchers.  It would make sense if it was Wood-Elf Ranger Only. (Maybe Warriors)  However Rangers from an RP perspective live off the world around them and use bows.  They make them and they make the arrows.  You can't tell me that it makes more sense from a RP perspective for a wood-Elf Bard to be able to Fletch better than a Half-Elf, Human or Halfling Ranger.  (I cringe typing that last one still)<br />
<br />
And Crydee is right when Wood-Elf Cultural Fletching was brought up long ago Verant said there would be Ranger only fletching too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True Ranger=Human.  Read Tolkien. <br />
<br />
who died and made tolkien the leading authority on all things fantasy ?! So he wrote the first couple of fantasy novels, SO FREAKING WHAT ?! The genre has evolved and developed waaaay past what Tolkien did. So please stop refering to his work as some divine law that every fantasy creation *has* to adhere to. <br />
<br />
I for one found his books boring beyong belief. I'm an avid reader, Hemingway, Vonnegut,  Hamsun, Goethe, Feichtwanger, Remark and etc are among my favorite authors (I realise I probably got most of the names spelled wrong, it's because I read them mostly in Russian, and I'm not familiar with the exact spelling of the their names). None of them bored me with their books. So the arguement that I'm just an uneducated youngster that fails to appreciate the &quot;classic&quot; style of writing doesn't fly. <br />
<br />
DragonLance Chornicles is a much more lively and absorbing piece of fantasy literature then Tolkien's stuff.</div></div><hr />

Legolas was more of an Archer then anything.  As a matter of fact, off the top of my head, I dont remember Legolas using anything other then his bow in combat. <br />
<br />
He had a pair of short swords he wore on his back in the top of his pack.  more like large knives in the book, they looked a lot like SSoM or SSoY in the movie.<br />
<br />
But, he always used his bow until he was out of arrows, then reverted to the swords until he had time to forrage more arrows.  never saw any reference to him fletching, but he did pick up all the used arrows and, well, it did mention him fixing broken arrows, so maybe he did fletch a bit.<br />
<br />
Of course EQ != LoTR, and the books aren't gospel.  it's fantasy, make it up as you go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I can't help but believe that there are fletching recipes out there for other race/diety combos that just haven't been discovered yet.  I'm hoping this is the case for the sake of all rangers because it would be crazy for Verant to implement something like this thinking people would be &quot;happy about the changes with the latest patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd say relax and try not to let it bother you too much until everything has been fleshed out.  Chances are the items will all be sub-par when compared to dropped items anyway.<br />

<br />
They basically hid their culture in a secretive group named Rangers of the North, there to help protect the peoples of Middle Earth. Aragorn was their leader, being the King basically.<br />
<br />
Legolas was an Elven Warrior. And yes, Elves were expert bowmen and fletchers, and trackers and hunters. The Rangers were simply bad-ass mobile huntsmen.<br />
<br />
For gaming purposes a ranger class is simply a lightly armoured, highly mobile warrior class, more skilled in tracking, hunting (and hence bowmanship) than the plate wearing toe-to-toe meatshields.</div></div><hr />

I can see why some people wouldn't want to play rangers just to shoot a bow.  My first character wasn't a Ranger, he was a Wizard.  I got him to level 6, got his fletching to level 24 or so, and then made him a bow, got mad cause he couldn't use it (at that point i had figured that everyone could use everything), and then i deleted him right there.  <br />

If you read the EQ instruction booklet thingy it was that rangers and masters of the bow or something like that, and if you're not in full screne mode you can se the little floating bow on your left-hand side.<br />

Well here's my point -- EQ is its own fantisy game.  And the primary weapon of a Ranger is his bow.  Although if you actually try to do this is EQ you will fail horribly pre 55, maybe even pre 59.<br />

P.S. shouldn't archery be useful for every level of character? (besides pulling and trying to kite).  And shouldn't Half-Elves be able to make the cultural bows/arrows too?</div></div><hr />
