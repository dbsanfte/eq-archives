<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I recently joined a pretty large and powerful guild, and I participated in my first guild raid. My shaman is my only character, and I'm only about 4 months seasoned in Everquest, and havn't been guilded until now, which is why I've had so little Raid experience.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on to the point. We're trying to Epic an enchanter, and our target is shissar in PoF. The mob is up. We know that. Someone had initially reported that the mob was up, and when we zoned in later, we saw it on track. We organise groups and head in to the plane. Now nobody really knew what happened, but someone or something basically aggroed the whole zone. We're pretty sure that it was caused by someone or some group of people who weren't in our raid zoning in and going in the wrong direction. We all knew how big the aggro radius are on the mobs in the zone, yet we got about 40 mobs. Needless to say with only a 3 group raid ageraging in the mid/high 50's, we got wiped, just about everyone. So we scrounge up another 3 groups for a corpse run. Other people keep zoning in, drawing aggro, and the corpse run takes about 3 hours to complete because we were basically breaking the zone and rezzing all of our members at the same time, which was not at all our intent<br />
<br />
But about an hour before we were done rezzing, reorganizing, etc, about 5 members of another guild, all in their late 60's zone in. One of our leaders asks them nicely what they're doing here, and that we were there for shiss. One of them replies &quot;consider it a race.&quot;<br />
<br />
They leave just about 15 minutes later, and we hope that they hadn't killed him - although with the zone cleared thanks to us, killing the mob in that time would be no sweat. A Ranger does a track and he doesn't come up... we travel deeper into the zone and shissar isn't up at all. They had killed it, and without a doubt intentionally stole it from us.<br />
<br />
So what I'm wondering is if this is a common practice. Do guilds often &quot;snipe&quot; important mobs out from under other guilds, even if they've without a doubt clearly marked it as their own and have done 90% of the work required for it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and in case anyone is wondering, the theiving guild which I am referring to is &quot;Fusion&quot; on the Tunare server, and as far as I'm concerned the whole guild should be given no respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">fairly common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no its not common , thats a guild with very bad morals , atleast if it went down like you said. I know my guild wouldnt do that and most guilds i know hold them selves to a higher moral level. But there are some that dont give a crap ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The shissar is an odd one, it might not have been sniped.<br />
A few weeks back we lost the shissar because our puller died on the pull and the mobs (which were near the shissar) pathed back.<br />
The problem is the shissar was KoS to these mobs and we're pretty sure they killed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, happens all da time unfortunately.  Usually, most of da big guilds on any given server have &quot;interacted&quot; wif eachudda a few times while pursuing da same target(s) and formed a relationship or understanding for good or bad.<br />
<br />
Fer example, der be guilds on mah server (Ayonae Ro) who hate mah guild's guts and da feelin be mutual.  Udda guilds we got a good workin relationship wif.  So, wen one of ours sees a target up and OTM be called, we's all start mobilizin and da race is on.  If we sees anudda guild also obviously OTM to da same target and looks likely ta get der just slightly afore us, our response depends entirely on which guild it be.<br />
<br />
If it be a guild we got good politics wif, we'll move on ta next target (unless we tink dem canna take said target, but dat anudda story entirely).<br />
<br />
If it be a younger guild on da way up (mine be all 60-65), we either move on or wait at a respectful distance (i.e. lag-free distance) and let em hav a few goes (helpin wif wipeout CR if needed).  If dem canna do it afta a few goes we typically negotiate a joint raid and joint lootin rights.<br />
<br />
If it be a guild we got bad blood wif, we'll increase our pace and do woteva we can ta get to mob and buff afore em.  We do not, however, &quot;leapfrog&quot; (which is wot happened ta yu) or &quot;gimp&quot; (take wounded mob afta a wipeout).  Dat juz not in our guild charter.<br />
<br />
Anywayz, dis competition over mobs is part of da game design uddawise everythin wud be triggered.  Sum peeps luv da race, uddas hate it.  Personally, me enjoys da adrenalin and challenge of getting to mob amd buffing but sumtimes it can bring out da worst in peeps, and dat sux.<br />
<br />
Wot happened ta yu really sux tho.  As an old world plane, PoF is now damned easy ta break and clear wif a single AE groop in a short time.  Sum ubahs think dat coz dem can do dat, why shud dem giv yu low ta mid 50s da time of day.  Leapfroggin happens at all levels tho.  In dis case, coz it woz only five peeps, me wudna blame da guild as a whole (yet).  Contact da guild leadership and let em know wot happened and see wot response ya get.  Yu may be pleasantly surprised.  <br />
<br />
BTW, agro in PoF be nuts.  Der be so many wanderers up der and dem all transmit agro ta each udda so gettin whole zone agro be purty easy in PoF.  If yer puller agros sumpthin, make shur dem brings it back wifout losin it, or get em ta camp out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, it *is* very common.  Some guilds don't give a rodent's rump about who is in the way.  PNP (Play Nice Policy) applies only to others, not to them, and they will claim First Come, First Serve on whatever they can.<br />
<br />
That said, there are a number of truly wonderful people in the game.  Thankfully, I find more of them than of the former.<br />
<br />
One thing about the Shissar, he's just recently been changed so he should no longer be KOS to the other Fear mobs.  I believe this was announced in a patch message.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It isn't all that rare for a group of less moral folks to steal mobs that other people are working towards.  Due to the long and sporadic spawn times people all rush for stuff as soon as they know it's up, take it, and move on.  Not really much you can do about it<br />

Gotta admit I've never read more than a line or 2 of what he posts for that exact reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If someone is clearing to a major mob, our guild by default backs off and lets them have their shot.  If we have had a problem in the past, though, we'll do whatever we need to to take the mob we need/want.<br />
<br />
Perfect example - we were in the same boat as you, had cleared most of Fear and were working on the castle to get to the Shissar.  A few members of another guild zoned in, including a monk (and an enchanter).  This idiot monk runs past us into the castle - we warned him not to pull the Shissar because it was (at the time) KOS to the other Fear mobs and that we were clearing to it for our enchanter.  Shortly afterward, the Shissar disappeared from track.  This idiot monk had pulled it anyway and it had destroyed itself.<br />
<br />
So a few weeks later, the same guild was on a fear raid and the Shissar was up again.  We had no qualms about assembling, pulling the Shissar, and finishing our enchanter's epic, despite this other guild's protests.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when none of our enchanters needed the Shissar, we have helped enchanters from less powerful guilds get the Shissar when raiding Fear for other reasons.<br />
<br />
So one thing you might check into is what past relationships your guild has had with this other guild.  The most likely story is that they are jerks, plain and simple, but it's not the only possibility.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I had just the opposite reaction. After the first line the troll flavor of the post pulled me in.  Granted, the post took a little more effort to read, but I found hearing a troll’s narration in my head very entertaining.  I look forward to reading more like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siamese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hehe!  I like the troll speak.  Trying to RP a troll, you learn that actually it takes longer to type out troll-speak, than it does to correctly type out the words.  On a post that size, it would take me at least 4 times as long to type out, so I applaud the efforts.  Plus always good information under the troll-speak, so I always read  Ysgwyrthyr's posts.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, and to answer your question, it's not uncommon at all.  There are many guilds that are honorable, but just as many that would just as soon run you over with a train than allow you to get something that they want.  I wish it were not so, but it just seems to be the way it is.  Last night in DSP of all places, we had people KSing our groups mobs that were there fighting us.  Had a mage walk up and blast one of our mobs to death that we were currently fighting, and had two melee types at two different times walk up to us and do the same thing.  It seems that being inconsiderate is just some people's ways of having fun in a game, and I am afraid that sometimes these people all get together, form a guild, and leave their mark all over the server.  It doesn't happen all the time, but definitely get used to it.  It won't be an isolated incident.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Most of the guilds on my server MIGHT do this sort of thing.  They seem to be in three categories:<br />
<br />
1.  Super-uber guilds - the few guilds at the top of the pile who can basically stomp all over other people knowing there's no danger of effective retaliation.  These guys would do this everytime they wanted something.<br />
<br />
2.  Small guilds with desperately poor players.  Usually they have just one or two 61+ players, and a rabble.  They have to grab what they can when they can because they aren't capable of anything better.  These guilds don't usually last long.  They'd do the dirty every time they could.<br />
<br />
3. Most (or at least many) other guilds are generally comprised of decent people, but even they are let down by the conduct of a minority of players.  These players tend to drag down the standard of the guild, and precipitate most guild feuds, but aren't usually kicked out because they attendance is needed to bring their guild raids up to strength.  These guilds would do the dirty sometimes, depending on who (from their membership) you were up against.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It happens often but the worst is camps like Stormfeather and Lodizal who are basically the most ksed mobs in the game.</div></div><hr />

You just need to practive you troll.<br />
<br />
If you agroed the whole zone, then the shissar was probably KSd by the other MoBs in the zone.  <br />
<br />
There are all kinds of players in this game.  Some of the a-holes form guilds and do whatever it takes to get what they want, others be damed.<br />
<br />
You just gotta shake it off and move on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unfortunately on Tunare, sniping or leapfrogging to a desired mob is S.O.P. for quite a few of the guilds...and if they can't take it, then they train the other raidforce with whatever is handy over and over and over until you can. If they can't train 'em out then the next step is kill trigger mobs or quest npc's so they can't do it either. (or prior to the patch, train other mobs to the shissar or the shissar to the other fear mobs)<br />
<br />
You want quality entertainment, before PoP all you had to do was head to Kael or WW after patch day and watch Vindi and friends being trained over peoples raids and then over their cr and their next cr, or watch the parade of 3/4's of the dragons being run about into other groups raids to stop them from getting the kill. (Of course nowdays replace Kael and WW with BoT, Tactics, Ssra, etc...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been on Tunare for over 3 years now. Many of the high end guilds like Fusion are like that. Get used to it. To be blunt, if your guild can't get their act together, then this will happen every time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As for the attack on Yzzy, I gotta say let's compare &quot;born-on&quot; dating.  Yzzy was around and posting long before you, and people have enjoyed his posts for about 3 years now.  Be careful who you choose to criticize.  Yzzy has ALWAYS typed and roleplayed in trollspeek and those of us who know and love him have learned how to read his posts.  It's really no problem for me anymore, and the advice that he gives is often of the best quality.  I still remember some of his Odes like his song based on Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody to his JBB.  All about killing sargeant slate with his new bracer haha.  Was so funny!  <br />
When you guys come up with something as good then u can criticize Yzzy for being a troll.<br />
<br />
As for Fear.  The best suggestion I can give you is if a wipe has happened, make all FD classes (SK, necro, monk) stand up and DIE!  Stuff in Fear often does not lose aggro like normal and instead chains aggro around the zone.  FD classes need to stand up and friggen die if your second break is to be successful.  If Fear is clear of players when your break group or groups zone in, your break should be quite successful.  If there are monks and necros laying about, your odds of success are about 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Assuming that this is the whole story, keep in mind that you weren't screwed over by this guild, but only by 5 characters (which may be fewer characters, i.e. a couple players hydra-ing), going after the Shiss for an alt or something.  They might just be a couple of bad eggs in an otherwise decent guild -- almost every guild of significant size has em.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you know the name of their guild leader or one of their officers, it would be worth a shot to send them a /tell.  Most guild leaders _want_ to know when one of their members is acting like a jackass, and often will tell them to stop.<br />
<br />
__<br />
<br />
As for Yzzy, I have learned a lot from his posts over the years. He's been around a lot longer than I have, and (unlike most people including myself) tends to only post when he has something to say.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I don't think that Drinnar was &quot;attacking&quot; him.  I do think that Drinnar is missing out by not reading them (especially considering the outrageous signal-to-noise ratio around here these days)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">ah, welcome to the slipery slope of guid racing.  Nothing brings more contention than a rare spawn (be happy you missed the ragefire camp, r.i.p.).<br />
Most people respect a &quot;first in force&quot; approach, aka, if you have a raid force capable of doing it they allow you an uncontested shot.  You can never stop the absolute idiots who claim 'PnP' = first one to aggro, but those are rare.<br />
Now, you had a 50's raid on fear - a lot of people today would say that's not much of a force, and you already wiped on one attempt.  Now we're talking curtesy of high end players towards relative raid newbies, and the air gets thin fast if we talk a rare spawn.<br />
Another often disputed case is the use of CoH to get to a mob.  Guild A has 6 people in zone that have faught their way down to a mob to CoH their peeps in.  Guild B arrives with 4 groups and starts clearing the zone.  Guild A is getting their reinforcemnts in and assembles at desired mob.  Now who's leapfrogging whom?<br />
Or the always popular &quot;we are already buffing&quot; claim, when in reality you still need 10 more peeps to log, since you need 40 people to do what others do with 20.<br />
Be prepared to see a lot of ugly things, even when it not degrades to intentional training, killing of trigger mobs or other openly illegal tactics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WIth a FD'er (Yes that overpowered skill), if the FD'er got a mixed pull (1+ Amy's and Shissar) and then feigned the Amy would attack the Shissar.<br />

Insofar as getting leapfrogged. Welcome to the world of rare spawns. It happens, it happens a lot, it will happen to you. GM's are not there (ultra-rarely) and their 'ruling' is different from one encounter to the next and one GM to the next.<br />

To be honest, though, some of the trollenspakk posts are just hard to read, but Yzzy and a few others are gramatically very consistant.  I find it harder to talk to some of the cops I dispatch than I do to read Yzzy's posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It IS common.  Rare spawns, and Epics just make it worse.<br />
<br />
Now, I can analyze your situation 2 ways:<br />
<br />
1.  You were in process and the other group/guild leapfrogged you and took your kill.<br />
<br />
2. Your wiped.  You had first shot, and failed.  The other group/guild made their attempt and succeeded.<br />
<br />
Which it is depends a lot on perspective.  In the high end game, its pretty common for multiple guilds to want the same targets. How this plays out varies a lot from server to server.  <br />
<br />
On my server its common practice for the first raid to arrive in the zone in force to be given first shot -the others will either leave (if they feel the first raid has a good chance) or stay and wait for them to fail, then take thier own shot.  90% of the time this is worked out privately between the raidleaders.  Once in a while its a straight out race -whomever can pull the mob first gets it.  You will see monks from each raid pulling mobs franticly trying to clear a path to the target.  Any of these methods are within SOE's PNP.<br />

Just to get the facts straight:  You came in and wiped, which happens fairly often in PoF.  You gather your forces, do a corpse recovery while you clear the zone, and then the group comes in afterwards to kill the mob that they would not have been able to get to if you hadn't been there.  You NEVER pulled the shissar, but were on your way there... so you technically didn't fail on the raid, just the zone-in.  You were preparing, in force, and they skipped past you AND the content you cleared that they were meant to clear for the encounter.<br />
<br />
If this happened to me I would have contacted their guild leader or posted on their website (if possible).  If the guild is good as a whole, they will apologize for the actions of their members.  If they supported the endeavor, I would spread the word about their actions on server message boards.<br />
<br />
As for the trollspeak, I like roleplaying in game but when I come here I'm trying to absorb information.  I skip posts that are not readable for various reasons, such as people who write without caps, don't punctuate, or don't use paragraphs.  I don't want to have to &quot;learn&quot; how to read someone's post, since I'm here to learn/share information and opinions.  I'm not going to tell anyone to change their style because you have the freedom to choose how you represent your views... but acknowledge that I have the freedom to skip your post because I don't have time or energy to decipher it.   :)</div></div><hr />

I've been on Tunare for over 3 years now. Many of the high end guilds like Fusion are like that. Get used to it. To be blunt, if your guild can't get their act together, then this will happen every time.<br />
<br />
May I ask which guild you belong to Penny?  <br />
<br />
Part of it probably was our fault in the sense of the huge amount of time we took to get organised. The biggest problem was the Time of day (wasn't much past noon on a thursday) so our guild had less than 20 members on. We had to gather people from allied guilds to help break the zone, and of course the rescue party took just as long to scrounge up. The biggest timewaster however was probably the initial Raid organizer... we couldn't use the POP raid window because of a few non-PoP players, so organizing the groups would naturally take longer. However it took hours. I think our raid leader wasn't too experienced and nobody had the courage to knock him off the throne until the rescue party arrived (when someone else took his spot)<br />
<br />
And the guild I belong to is Order of Concord.<br />

As for Fear. The best suggestion I can give you is if a wipe has happened, make all FD classes (SK, necro, monk) stand up and DIE! Stuff in Fear often does not lose aggro like normal and instead chains aggro around the zone. FD classes need to stand up and friggen die if your second break is to be successful. If Fear is clear of players when your break group or groups zone in, your break should be quite successful. If there are monks and necros laying about, your odds of success are about 5%.<br />
<br />
We were aware of this, and had all FD'd classes /q out of the game. Clears the aggro and nobody dies. Win/win, right?<br />

<br />
One of our members supposedly did talk to an officer. He denied everything. The Mob isn't KoS anymore, we saw it on track, and it dissapeared after a player and his group who said &quot;consider it a race&quot; left the zone. I don't think there's very much room for speculation of what happened in this situation.</div></div><hr />

If you are soliciting judgemental comment -- I enjoy Yzzy's posts way more than yours, Drinnar.  He's helpful, cheerful, and colorful.  You tend to just be negative.<br />

I like his posting style, its not hard at all to read, and adds flavor.  Most people who attempt to post the way he does fails miserably, just raises my opinion of him even more.</div></div><hr />

Fusion has had many run ins like the one you have described. The hard truth of many of these matters is, that most mobs are a 'race' to get them, and that is SOE's best solution to the problem. These larger guilds will almost always use that to their advantage, and your disadvantage. Hopefully in the future, your organizational skills will improve so that you dont spend more than half your time trying to organize groups, and the other half on CR when the groups dont listen. (i always hate that about leading anything) I know recently on Tunare our guild took advantage of some sort of weird spawn cycle and got 3 ench epics in a row (less than a week). maybe you'll get lucky too, LOL.</div></div><hr />

i am a new reader here on the crucible , but i am an old shaman and i have other boards that i visit . troll speakin makes it difficult to get to the point clearly even though it does add flavor . its just a small point , it would make things much easier if post could be made in 2 parts , one explanation , two rp laugh ( i skip those rp posts at times like others .. ) .as of Drinnar i like his posts i find them sharper than a lot of people (negatve attitude ? err sorry always found him helpfull and clear. ) .<br />

<br />
Tanx fer da kind words peeps but dinna worry Drinnar, me didn't take it as an attack, juz as da observation and valid question it woz intended ta be.<br />
<br />
Regardin mah use of language, me bin speakin like dis since me woz born over three years ago.  Me dinna really see it as RPing in a game sense, ratha it be RPing in da RL sense.  Dat is, wen me possesses Pinky-me, mah thought processes manifest in him's mind wif mah voice and thence to da putah in mah letters.  Mebbe it be best if me lets Pinky-me handle dis one...<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;Ysgwyrthyr opens his mouth wide<br />
With a gush of foetid liquid, out crawls Pinky-me&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
I think what Yzzy's trying to say is that I use the roleplaying as a mechanism to get inside Yzzy's head.  When I am Yzzy, either in-game or on the boards, my brain switches modes and I start thinking in trollspeak.  As a result, also type in it.  I'm a fast typist anyway but, regardless, I can type trollspeak at the same speed as English.<br />
<br />
When Yzzy was born, back in August '99, there was no fast mode of travel so he &quot;grew up&quot; around lots of other trolls and ogres.  Few people back then chose trolls or ogres for stat or power-gamer reasons.  Most were more interested in the &quot;character&quot; of trolls and ogres so the butt-scratching, arse-boarding, and dumb-speak abounded.  When Yzzy expanded his horizons to include grouping with pinkys, the patois remained and was appreciated by most.  Since that time, I've only ever dropped out to plain English when I've been grouped with non-native English speakers (and damn it feels weird speaking English with Yzzy!).<br />
<br />
Yzzy discovered the boards a while back and has been trolling them ever since.  Now, one could argue that he should have handed the reins over to me on the boards.  I was signing off as Yzzy though and, for the most part, the posts were mainly in-game issues and questions related directly to Yzzy, not me.  There was a time early on when my choice of letting Yzzy speak for himself on the boards was waivering and I almost took control.  Then Eduin or Stusser, I can't recall which of the two now, called me a &quot;moron&quot;, &quot;idiot&quot; and a few other names for using trollspeak on the boards.  That sort of cemented it for me, I *had* to continue letting Yzzy speak after that. :D<br />
<br />
There are a couple of ironies here that tickle me.  Perhaps the most amusing to me is that I'm a published writer.  I write thousands of words a day, most of which are destined for public consumption.  Partly due to this, I'm a language nazi and it pains me whenever I read posts with horrible grammar, incorrect usage of homophones like &quot;your/you're&quot;, &quot;their/there&quot;, etc.  I never pull people up on it as I consider that churlish.  Hence, I impose my fascism on myself, not on others. ;)<br />
<br />
It is too late for me to take over from Yzzy as he's got a life of his own.  People would think I'd ebay'd if Yzzy started speaking English. ;)  Also, I see this board as a place where shaman come to exchange wisdom rather than a place where gamers come to talk about shaman.  It's a matter of perspective, sure, but it helps me organise my thoughts more easily.  If it were *me* at the helm, my posts would be all numbers, analytical reasoning, and other boring crud that removes enjoyment from the game.  So I let Yzzy take control and he forces me to think about what's important to him.  His goal in life is to have fun and escape from the sterile cage that is statistics.<br />
<br />
So, sorry Drinnar and others of similar mind, I'm not going to drop out of character any time soon.  You are, of course, perfectly at liberty to skip over Yzzy's posts.  He won't be offended, heh.<br />
<br />
That's enough from me.  I've got the foul breath of an anxious troll caressing the back of my neck.  I'd better hand back the &quot;putah&quot; before he gives me the pox.<br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;Ysgwyrthyr lifts Pinky-me out of the chair, opening his mouth wide<br />
Ysgwyrthyr shoves Pinky-me into his gaping maw, swallowing him as a snake swallows a pig&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Der ya go, straight frum da Pinky's mouth.  Any more questions, speak to me arse, he'll be cumin out in a cupla dayz. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Yeah its pretty much common policy on just about any contestable mob...they (More_Uber_Than_Thoug_Guild_001) will do just about anything from purposeful training of mobs to outright KSing. I have seen the boss mobs in Akheva pulled onto other guilds while they were gathering, I have seen trains of random drakes and dragons ganked onto people in WW, all so this so called fun game becomes a race.<br />
In my own experiences, I have been treated this way, told that my feelings and my time spent at a given camp didnt matter, that it was all about some fictional race crap, and that if I didnt like it I could blow it out my arse.<br />
One of the many reasons that I dont care for the high end game...I crave high end experiences, high end loot, but geez cant it be painless for other people too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">More respectable guilds concede FiF if you can clearly take down the mob you are after.  Unfortunately...not all guilds are respectable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Just as a side note, PoF, PoSky, and PoH on Brell are still under a reservation system, nominally for the no drop armor mobs.  Going up before/after a raid and clearing the plane is perfectly fine, as long as the armor dropping mobs are up when the raid arrives.<br />
<br />
It's a system held together only by consent of the players, and is the subject of continual, more or less endless debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">caveat emptor<br />
<br />
rule by force.<br />
<br />
This is the only law that most guilds understand.  <br />
Sometimes when there is mutual respect, you will have cooperation and some extent of mutual avoidance (&quot;oh, guildB is after Aerin'Dar atm, they can take em, we'll do Grummus instead&quot;)<br />
<br />
I've been on the down side of waaaay too much KSing.  The only thing you can do about it is get them back first and harder.  The way you do it is be persistent.  Once they have given up trying to protect you from getting one target . . . go after their next favorite one.  Sooner or later they get pushed and pushed and something has to give.  Usually it's their leadership.  Persistence is what EQ is all about.  That and at least SOME skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I have always heard the wraith of shissar despawns on his own. Although that may have been it agroing other mobs and then getting killed. <br />
The way our guildies used to camp wraith was stick a ranger or druid in fear and log in at safespot, (behind the fire) and do a scan. Then log out. You would have to be quick becuase wraith would depop for another 8-12 hours.<br />
Stick a tracker in and try again when wraith pops. this time go anon and move faster :).</div></div><hr />
