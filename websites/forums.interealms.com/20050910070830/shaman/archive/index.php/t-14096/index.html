<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Given the choice, for EQ purposes, would a gforce 4 4200Ti card be better or worse than a gforce fx 5200 card? on a budget here, and getting one in about 6 hours, so any advice would be welcome. PS. I have no idea what the difference is, just that the 5200 is slightly cheaper. Both have 128mb mem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The 4200 is a better card.  If you can spring it, get a 4600 :)  the FX chipset is crap, only the 5900 is worth buying and even that is as loud as a freight train, takes up 2 slots, 3x the price of a 4xxx series, and only offers marginally better performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Ti4200 is definitley the card with more bang for the buck.  However, the FX5200 was made to be DX9 compatible which a nice thing for many new games that are coming out which will require it.</div></div><hr />

That last design was really bizarre. I'm fairly certain the redisgned the fan and there is alot more heat sink and less fan now, so shouldn't be as noisy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Geforce 4 4600 runs just fine with directX9 and the latest Sony game. <br />
The noise of the FX5800 series is usually over rated, the fan is adaptive, and so far I haven't gotten it to kick in even at a 50 person raid without &quot;lag reduction&quot; measures.<br />
In the &quot;bang for the buck&quot; category nothing beats the g4 4200 right now.</div></div><hr />
