Been a while since I played - I had heard this was true now - is that right?  I don't want to carry around weapons etc for my pet if I don't need to.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's easy to see. hand him a dagger. if you see both stabs and bites, then he's dualwielding and you never need to give him rusties again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">great idea - thanks!</div></div><hr />

Assuming I have two weapons to give to my pet...but I'd prefer one weapon to be in his main and the other in his off-paw.  eg. a Hand of ixblat I want in his main for the procs while the 2nd weapon might be just some rusty or what not.  <br />
<br />
Do I give them to him both at the same time?  And if so, do I put the Hand of Ixblat in the first box?<br />
<br />
Does it matter if I give him the 2 weapons one at a time?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's basically ungovernable, Tronc.  Pets are supposed to have some code to intelligently choose their primary/secondary weapons, but I've never seen any evidence of it.</div></div><hr />

First weapon you give him goes in primary, if it's primary equippable. Yes he will equip both weapons whether you hand them over at the same time, or one at a time. If he has two weapons equipped already, handing him a third will do nothing.</div></div><hr />
