<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 30 today (whoo hoo!) but now I have a decision to make-<br />
<br />
Alteration?<br />
Conjuration?<br />
Evocation?<br />
Abjuration?<br />
Divination?<br />
<br />
I know the old wisdom says Alteration but I want to know 'has anything changed with all the new updates and spells?'<br />
<br />
Would you make the same decision now as you did then?<br />
<br />
I solo a lot so Conjuration looks good too but the new nerf to focus effects makes me think I may want to stick with Alteration so my slows don't fizzle as much since they're harder to cast without interrupts now.<br />
<br />
Think about it for a moment then give me the benefit of you're experience and wisdom.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">alteration in general is what shaman use the most.<br />
<br />
Heals , slows, canbalize , these are all alteration<br />
<br />
So i would suggest that personaly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alteration is slows, heals, most buffs and roots. I think you would regret not choosing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep definately Alteration... Buffs, Debuffs, Heals all generally run on Alteration - this is one thing that the old ways will never change on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL I did conjuration!! I feel like a chode now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Conjuration also because a spent a lot of time soloing back around those levels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alteration all the way. If you want to test which you use most, put a point in each and see which one hits 51 first in a normal day. I bet it's alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go Div all the way...  specialzations on true north are uber!<br />
<br />
Okay not really, alteration is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alteration for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Bahamute <br />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=711<br />
<br />
That quest will let you reset it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alteration.<br />
<br />
Besides with cann you will max it out faster than any other specialization anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dont forget that until you put a point in each none will go over 50.<br />
<br />
So just spam your chosen one until it get's over 50.<br />
<br />
You'll probably find that through your normal play that one will race ahead of the others. I found alt went up for me really quick as I spent a lot of my time buffing / healing rather than soloing then.<br />
<br />
EDIT - Forgot to add that I'd stick pick ALT now, even though I solo a lot, because when I go on raids or group up the group buffs are very mana intensive, and I spend quite a lot of time backup-healing.<br />
<br />
OH yes and our line of slows (prolly your main spell) are Alt based ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yup yup no contest. Heck, I'd do evocation before conjuration nowadays :) Less fizzles on my rains would be great. But alteration is the way to go for 99.9% of shaman. <br />
<br />
Just take a look at your spell lineup, think about which spells you cast the most often and in the most important situations, and see what specialisation they use. Look on castersrealm and look at the higher level ones too. Most likely you will conlude...<br />
<br />
alteration</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">don't fizzle as much <br />
IIRC, specialization only affects the amount of mana a spell takes.  It doesn't help fizzles nor change casting times.  <br />
<br />
Channeling is the skill for getting spells off while being beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would put a point in alteration and then forget obout it till alteration goes over 50 then go back and put a point in all the rest.</div></div><hr />

I would put a point in alteration and then forget obout it till alteration goes over 50 then go back and put a point in all the rest. <br />
<br />
It won't go over 50 until you put a point in each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just put a point in all of them and go about your business.  Unless you're doing something unusual, like summoning tons of food, alteration is going to win by a mile anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gate = Alteration :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">slows and heals .. <br />
<br />
end of story .. you won't cast anything as much .. not even clsoe<br />
<br />
alteration it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What convinced me to go alteration was someone pointing out that you slow every fight.  You dont dot ever fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, you convinced me.  How many times do you get a unanimous decision on these boards?<br />
<br />
Went to Shadeweaver's Thicket and spammed minor healing and canni between passing out free sows and heals.<br />
<br />
Alteration is 51 now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Instead of worrying about this, go beat up a dr00d.  You wont be any smarter, but you'll feel a WHOLE lot better    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks All for the replies I was wondering about this one my self</div></div><hr />
