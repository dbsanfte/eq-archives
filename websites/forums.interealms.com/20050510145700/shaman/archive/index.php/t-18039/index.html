<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Title says it all.  I wonder if its because so many of the people that post here are High Level/End players, that the zones don't offer them much, or is there something about the theme/set-up that bothers them?  I started there in my Mid 30's (Gunthak), and I still go to Dulak when I want to solo, Both the Dandolak and the Ocean Crasher (?) are still good exp.  Nadox offers good group exp.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Don't forget Stoic and Pureblood, illusion potions, charms, sham spell research, dyes and all that other cosmetic crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It offers little to the higher-level player outside of in-game maps and armor dye.  It adds a few mid-level zones that are inconvenient to get to without a porter, when there are similar zones that are easier to get to that are practically empty.  Frogloks are the most absurd choice for a player race, ever, and they completely uprooted an entire other player race to put them in, because they were too lazy to give frogs their own starting city.  LAME.<br />
<br />
All in all, an expansion that left me saying, &quot;I paid for this?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LoY was about 2/3 of what people wanted for an expansion. If you look at the track record of expansions, all of them except LoY and LDoN have added a buttload of new stuff in terms of zones, monsters, challenges, and most importantly spells. LoY just didn't add that much to the game, but it added a lot of stuff to make the game better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't say that they gave use alot of new spells, but I am Very Happy with the few we got (Stoicism being the big one).  I guess that people get lost easily in the warrens, but once you know it, it takes less than 30 seconds to run through (it takes me longer to get to Chardok),  the one thing I don't know about is Hate's Fury. Anyone have an idea about the Mobs there (level wise)?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My single biggest complaint with LoY is how long it takes to get there.  I prefer to be somewhat self sufficient, so unless I'm in a hurry I won't buy a port.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, it was an ok expansion.  Maps are great, bank space is great.  Everything else sort of fell flat in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
The zones aren't bad for hunting, but why in the 7 hells should I get a slow resist, as a level 65, on a green in Gunthak that my level 40 monk can solo?  The expansion just didn't offer much for 60+ other than some hunting spots, and even those pale in comparison to PoP experience so why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mobs have too many hps.<br />
The xp isn't nearly anywhere as good as a POP zone.<br />
Mob resists are so high that I have to lead with Malos on everything even at level 65.<br />
Why would I want to hunt here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">An utter waste of resources IMO.  Sure the mapping and dyes were kinda neat at first.  In hindsight I miss the days of actually being able to tell who had what on by the look of their gear though.  <br />
<br />
Dyes took that away and I don't think it's really a good thing.  <br />
<br />
In game maps are convenient but they're really OOC and dumbed things down more than necessary (Pre-LDON at least).  <br />
<br />
The few spells added weren't anything special, just filling in gaps that shouldn't have been there in the first place.<br />
<br />
When LoY came out the high level zones were crowded as all hell.  SoE releases an extension that added content for low-mid level characters that already had dozens of empty zones designed with them in mind.  <br />
<br />
LoY was more like a bunch of patches that SoE forgot to install then lumped them all together as one big download, only they charged you 20 bucks for this mega-patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to disagree.  I hunt in nadox a lot, solo.  I rarely use malX even on the named stuff.  Yeah, I get resists, but not as many as I get in LDoN and equivelant to anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the mobs do have a lot of HPs, but that's really not a big deal.  In Nadox, the trolls don't run away on low health and I love that.  They don't hit nearly as hard as PoP mobs so I tank most of the time which I find fun.  And, there are plenty of named mobs you can pick off solo if you are familiar with the zone, but some will death spawn which makes things even more fun.<br />
<br />
Folks on this board are mostly high level and were high level when LoY came out.  It offers very little to them.<br />
<br />
Oh, but if it had a PoK book at the lighthouse in Gunthak, that would be really nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">People don't hate LoY. In most cases, they just don't care about it. Apathy is different from hate. <br />
<br />
Look at the expansion trail before LoY: <br />
<br />
Kunark - 10 new levels, huge new adventure areas, outdoor and dungeon both. Two new cities. Tons of new loots, spells, etc... And it saved EQ from overcrowding hell. <br />
<br />
Velious - A new entire continent. Introduced competitive factions that PC's could ally with. Tons of new raid content. Uber loot such as had never been seen before. Tons of quests. Most people on many servers were not L 60 yet either, so still had lots of exp'ing to do. <br />
<br />
Luclin - Effectively, an entire new continent. A new player race and class. AA exp. Quite a few new spells. A lot of new raid content, with unbelievable, better-than ever loot (note the theme here). A lot of the zones weren't so hot, especially after they were &quot;tuned&quot; but some were quite good. <br />
<br />
PoP - 5 new levels! New AA skills. All high end content. Vast amounts of raid content for the uber crowd. Loot such as has never been dreamed of. <br />
<br />
LoY - a new player race. A few new zones for L 35-60 people. Nothing at all for high end players except expanded bank boxes, armor dyes, and the mapping feature. Even the two new spells are lower level, and often nearly useless for someone who is past that level (although for some classes they are quite useful).   LoY didn't expand the gameplay in any meaningful way. It made some nice tweaks that could have easily been free patches - except that they were saved for LoY so that all players would have a reason to buy it. <br />
<br />
All previous expansions provided new raid content with improved loot, and all of them except velious provided expanded levels or AA skills or both. LoY was aimed at the lower level people who didn't get much out of PoP, at least in the short term. So all the people who WEREN'T in that category didn't really care about it. And for the people who are in that category - it provides a few new exp zones with nothing in particular to recommend them over previous zones, but which are just hard enough to get to that it's hard to find a group there. Then you have all those tunnels in Gunthak that you have to run through invis to get anywhere, which is dangerous and discouraging for many classes, until they are of a level where they don't really want anything from LoY anyway. <br />
<br />
LDoN continues the trend of not expanding the high end of the game, and catering more to the exp group crowd than the raid crowd. There's nothing wrong with that, as the exp group/casual crowd really needed what LDoN provides, and there's a lot of those players. There is some raid content, and maybe it will someday be tweaked so that someone actually uses it. <br />
<br />
But it will be interesting if there's ANOTHER expansion that doesn't substantially outclass Planes of Power loot. Has mudflation finally hit the limit with Planes of Power? Or will they come out with even more ridiculous loot for the ubers to chase? And will you have to have farmed plane of time to be able to do that new content? I sure have gotten off on a tangent, haven't I? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Though it was far from perfect, LoY was a good expansion.  It added a lot fun stuff to the game; heck the extra bank space was enough of an improvement for me to buy it.  And it provided an interesting environment for hunting.  The experience isn’t bad and the loot is often very good.  I’ve spent a lot of time there with both my shaman and my beastlord.  In fact, some of the best times I’ve had with friends were spent in those zones.  <br />
<br />
The only real mistake I think Sony made was relocating the tolls.  I don’t have a troll character, but even I think what they did was ludicrous in the extreme.  I don’t have a problem with relocating the trolls.  The frog takeover, though comical to visualize, was an interesting storyline.  However, it was a story without an ending.  Sony should never have moved the trolls if they were simply going to dump them somewhere like an unwanted bag of garbage.  I thought it would have been interesting if, with the help of the newly discovered troll pirates, trolls had taken over Freeport.  The humans would still have a city for starting characters and the trolls would be a new force to be reckoned with.  At the very least they could have moved the trolls to the new expansion and added a port stone.  But as it is Sony took a good idea and totally messed it up.  <br />
<br />
So for my vote, LoY is a good expansion but Sony sucks as a storyteller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN may not offer expanded high level raid content like other expansions but it does give 65's and such something to do other than raid.  I'm not sure that everyone who reaches 65 is in a raiding guild and even if they are they many not always have the time to do a lengthy raid.  LDoN gives them a meaningful (depending on your perception) way to group up at 65 rather than just go solo/farm.</div></div><hr />

Best.  Description.  Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The bank space alone was worth buying the expansion.  Dulak is still a great place for people that are not at the extreme end to amke a decent haul of plat farming to upgrade and the spell quests were definetly worth it.  Stoicism was a nice mid range upgrade when i started over on Stromm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Sony advertise LoY as an expansion aimed at the Mid range character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Kunark was the last expansion I really liked (although Velious was close). My favorite thing about EQ from beta and release were the handcrafted, tuned dungeons. Kunark continued down that path with excellent dungeon content. <br />
<br />
SOE's current lame excuse for zone/dungeon designs pales in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Eh, I like it. Been havign fun exploring with a group of friends int he 40's/50's.

Try hunting in ct... nadox cures your group of bane of thule in one cast.  Plus, hey, a one groupable inny is fun :0<br />
<br />
I would love a book in the lighthouse, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Hates fury mobs are weak dps, high hp. No slows needed, and resist are low there. Not a lot of point going to solo there IMO, but a group can have some fun. I prefer Torgian or Nadox for 50's exploration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LoY offers many raid-level mobs for the 50-60 corwd, but is severly under-utilized in todays &quot;Instant Travel&quot; EQ enviroment. Nadox, Torgrins Mines and Hates Fury all have raid-mobs that a giuld of 50-60's can do. The loot they drop is far better than the Kunark raid mobs, as well. Overall, the LoY loot is pretty solid, actually. I made a good chunk of PP farming Nadox. <br />
<br />
If Gunthak had a PoP book, I think more people would come to realize that LoY is a decent half-expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I get a feeling that the mobs have too much HP for the exp they give you.

<br />
My gruop when we explored consisted of BL/Cleric/Monk/Pal. My friends and I havent dusted off the alt squad in a bit, but it was fun, and we certainly got more loot than we would have seen in PoN killing ravens or whatever at that level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on my perspective and the zones i spend my time in the gear in PoP is better, but maybe not for a mid 50ies player who cannot yet access let alone kill anyhing in those lucrative places.<br />
<br />
But based on perspective anyone can be wrong or right in any debate.<br />

I'm more of a #1 - bring on the zombie trolls.<br />

Four out of my five play characters have an Ykesha item or two on them, so it's not like the gear stinks - it's just that the better stuff is generally no drop.<br />
<br />
PS for Vigdis:  At least one of my Ykesha toys might be very handy on a PVP server.  Takes a group, and about three hours to trigger the event, but it's a common drop from the end mob - I've seen him drop two at once.<br />

Maybe I like it because I can use a lot of the stuff that drops there (or could at one point). Or maybe it is because I've bought a lot of nice stuff because of the drops there :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've had fun each time I went there. If I wanted to maximize my XP I'd probably go elsewhere, mostly because the occasional string of resists can add needless downtime. But, that isn't a concern for me right now. Going back to Dulak this weekend to try and find some more named mobs in the caves, looking forward to it too.</div></div><hr />

  Actually I spent some time in Hatesfury in my mid 50s and its MUCH better then Nadox.  First of all, you can actually get experience there.  Second its very cool looking.  Third alot of VERY NICE 50's gear drops there.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I like LoY a lot and at 65 I still solo there from time to time.  As a matter of fact I would have to say that LoY has been my favorite expansion in terms of content for a solo character.<br />
<br />
The UI and other game mechanics are questionable.  I really do not like the idea of body region dye and maps should have been tied to direction heading or a cartography skill and I hate Frogs, but as for the zones and game content I like LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I agree that its mostly an indifferent opinion on LoY.  It added little content wise.  I suppose some of the spells were useful like stoicism to lower level shamans and those who did not have torpor.<br />
<br />
The main problem is its not easy to get to.  Once your there its not really that easy to get around to the various zones.  Plus it can be a bit dangerous just getting to the camp without lots of fighting in and out and not having a evacer in the group makes it even more annoying to get out.  You cant go there and just get a pickup group, so the only people there are there for something, a quest or soloing.<br />
<br />
Nothing drops really thats any good.  The charm slot which seemed like it might be interesting at first, turned into nothing, as most of them were worthless and after adding the pok it essentially made every other charm in the game garbage.  Is there anyone who doesnt have that charm?  How boring that everyone has the exact same one.<br />
<br />
Overall by far the worst expansion and the most useless.  I would bet the only reason most people bought it was for the extra bank space.  When thats all you can say nice about an expansion, it obviously wasnt very memorable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went there the other day, and the XP i could have comparing to any old world dungeon was terrible (with my enc).<br />
<br />
I found the mobs have ridiculously high hp and pathing is terrible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Vander's Bane (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23620) <br />
<br />
 It's the only swarm weapon i can find that's SHM useable.  i still need a few of the quest items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Not much uberloot, and it isn't the firehose of xp that PoP is.  Plus, it doesn't seem to be very accessible, no PoK stone, no adventure camp, no tp into the actual expansion itself.  <br />
<br />
It's not that it's a bad zone really, it's just not as easy to get something good going in LoY as it is in a lot of other places.  It's too bad too, it's got some neat stuff.</div></div><hr />

Exp sucks, mobs have too many resists/hp's.</div></div><hr />

I guess people were right about that phenomena after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the named has nice loots but the one of the main named Broodmother drop stinks.  Think they have removed the nice ring called Lava something ring off it's loot table.  And only drops lame arse loots that most people don't need.<br />
<br />
Other Troll named drops Descent item but require a group+ to kill it, way back then i mean. <br />
<br />
Main complaint in this zone is the undead trolls, seems to have way to much of hps for it's level.  Only use I could see for the undead trolls are to train back and forth on the run to Hate of what ever other zone is called.  Or at least some of the troll mobs have little more hps compared to it's level compared to the exps getting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rest of the zone seems to be pretty well designed for loots and exps groups.<br />

I think Nadox alone earned me more than 100k pp from sales in the bazaar, so it has by far been the best of the Ykesha zones for me.<br />
<br />
There is also a way to spawn a version of Innoruuk in Nadox which as far as I know drops some pretty decent loots.</div></div><hr />

You know I agree it doesnt take that much effort to get there.  But the point is how easy is it to get to compared to almost everyplace else.  If you look at the zones that have people in them and are easy to get groups in they are the ones that require little zoning.<br />
<br />
I am also not all that nostalgic about begging druids or wizards for ports, running for 20 minutes to reach zone &quot;x&quot; while hopefully not getting lost, waiting for the nexus portal to activate, and waiting for the boat, then 20 minutes on the boat.  Why should I have to &quot;commute&quot; while playing a game?  Some people may appreciate the realism or the roleplay aspect of those things but I think most dont.  I used to spend probably 1/3 of my time at night I could have been exping just getting to out of the camp that I was at, or getting other people there.  Wasted time..travelling.  This was especially annoying when you didnt have all that much time to play to begin with.  If your on for 10 hours a day it probably doesnt matter as much.<br />
<br />
PoP and Ldon were steps in the right direction for taking the annoyance of travelling out, while LoY was a step backward.  I am not saying the poster of the quote above is desirious for things to return to old, the point I am making is how difficult is LoY to get to in regards to 99% of the other zones?  Alot really.</div></div><hr />
