<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Posatrocible</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know what these do?  <br />
<br />
<br />
 Heat Awareness<br />
 Cold Awareness<br />
 Magic Awareness<br />
 Poison Awareness<br />
 Disease Awareness<br />
 Beneficial Awareness<br />
 <br />
<br />
Are 1-3 increased dd?  4-5 extended afflictions?  6 extended enhancement?<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
There is prolly a simple answer that I'm overlooking... anyone found the benefit to these potions yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They save you 5% mana cost on the spells associated with each catagory. (fire DD's for heat awareness, poison dots/dd's for poison awareness, buffs for beneficial awareness)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">awfully pricy considering that an ODS saves 10% and is permanent.  I guess for that focus fight, one might like to have esentally 5% more mana  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It lasts 3 hours and 15 mins at 65 supposedly though. And it stacks with other focus effects supposedly. AT 3 hours and 15 mins I don't think it's too bad. I will probably use the ice ones in exp groups to help with my nuking. I don't have a mana pres 4 effect yet and even when I get one if they stack it's still good.<br />
Anyone know where the components are sold to make these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok so what is the diffrence between awareness 1-4?  4 having more of a % or lastes longer..and what % is 4<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lvl 1 for spells under lvl 24, 2 for spells under 44, 3 for spells under 60, and 4 for all spells. just like the focus effects on items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zeal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ODS saves between 1 to 10% randomly up to 60th spells(mana pre III). So maybe useful at 5%, it may be worth whiled /shrug.<br />

Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 5% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded) <br />
4:  Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only) <br />
 <br />
3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65<br />
<br />
I imagine most would only use this during raids but %5 on HoT, Direct heals, and buffs would not be too bad.<br />
If your patch healers have an extra 5% mana that would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
Problem is still the cost.<br />
Herbs cost too much and we have a crappy vendor sell back.<br />
We need to bug the crap out of them till they fix that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does anyone know where to get Aloe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vendor in Guthark sells aloe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">3 hour length at 65 or 15 mins?  which is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OK.<br />

So, we get 6 potions:<br />
<br />
poison awareness<br />
magic awareness<br />
heat awareness<br />
cold awareness<br />
disease awareness<br />
benefit awareness<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, they all seem to be mana preservation potions that save you 5 percent.<br />
<br />
Why are there 6 of them?  <br />
<br />
Does poison affect poison based spells only?  <br />
<br />
If I want to save mana while nuking, do I need to drink two potions (one for poison and one for cold)?<br />
<br />
What happened to the other focus effects?  Improved Damage, for example.  Spell haste?  <br />
<br />
I guess I am mostly wondering if I'm just not getting how this is supposed to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lucy says it effects &quot;Resist(Poison)&quot;, etc.  I assume that means any spells that a mob would resist against poison for are saved 5%.  So yes, if you are swapping b/t cold and poison nukes, you'd need to drink both.  Some questions are:<br />
<br />
Can you have 2 up at once?<br />
Do they stack with regular mana pres?<br />
Are there more we haven't found?  It's only been 2 days, there may well be those other ones, and noone has found them yet.</div></div><hr />
