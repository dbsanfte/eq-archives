<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well whats the biggest bitch we have on our BST brothers?<br />
<br />
We cant stack with each other. Well, i was just sitting here in my group with a BST thinking, it would be nice if we had a group canni that specificly was designed to work with their group HoT. They already denied us on the group canni idea on the grounds we would get a group heal to go with it. But if it was made to work with the BST i think that would be neat. If a bst wasnt there we could use it to a lesser degree with our regen spells, but it would help us finaly enhance the  minds of out group members ( like they claim we can in description ) without being overpowering and providing a reason for having a BST and a Shaman in the same group.<br />
<br />
Just thinking outloud while im in a LDoN,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haha I'm posting.  No actually I think this is one of Litgruv's better ideas . . or theories.  Class synergy would add a whole new dimension to EQ.  Sort of (1 + 1 = 4) sorta deal, where two non-essential classes in the same group could combine for a combo of severe power.  Rangers + bards, or necros + berserkers.  Maybe make a bardsong that triples ranger archery damage in addition to whatever else it does for the group.  Or make necro DoTs work for 4 times the normal damage per tic when a mob is axe-snared by a berserker.   <br />
This idea of Litgruv's should encompass more than just shamans and beastlords, but should include most or even all classes.  It should really encourage non-holy-trinity classes to get groups.  So for instance, there would never be a combo with warrior/cleric or enchanter/cleric.  However, cleric/shaman would increase shaman heals by double their usual amount.  And cleric/druid would increase druid newks by 1.5 x their normal figures.  <br />
After all, the game needs to be balanced for GROUPS right?  And yet keep solo balance about the same.  This idea could have a chance of doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rangers and druids stack as well as shaman and beastlords; so do necromancers and shadowknights.  And clerics and paladins.  A special ability between these sets is something I suggested a long time ago and got poo-poo'd (on the beastlord boards, when my main was a bst).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It seems like BST/SHM stacking goes a lot farther than the issue of Giving Shaman's Sharable Mana Regen.<br />
<br />
I don't think we'll ever get mana regen buffs and I don't want them personally, I'd much rather have percentage avoidance/strikethrough/max hit or endurance regen, as long as it is UNIQUE to us.<br />
<br />
I'm sure they don't want to add ANOTHER mana regen buff to the list of what you can stack on yourself now.<br />
<br />
Yeah, some say that I'm used to the idea that we get shafted and that's why I don't want certain improvements, but still, I could care less about how fast other people regen mana in my crappy pickup groups.  Most people I'm in a group with in pickup could care less about me, anyway.  Also, give us a stackable mana regen that works with BST, and they'll start asking to get our Omens % buffs again.<br />
<br />
And really, the problem as I see it, is not that we don't stack well with Beastlords (Since the majority of our spells overwrite or stack completely with theirs), but rather that we are completely replaceable with a BST since they bring a comparable slow to the table and so much more.<br />
<br />
Then you might say &quot;Giving us mana regen buffs would fix that and make is comparable again.&quot;  I'd have to disagree, they could still take BST over us since they'd have mana regen AND Paragon, and our mana regen buff would not top ENCs, so they can still replace us.  I really want something group-desirable for Shaman that Enchanters and Beastlords DO NOT HAVE, period.<br />
<br />
Also, I believe that giving us group canni would not help much.  I mean, yes it goes well with group HoT, but I really doubt they'd put in a spell that allows you to harm group members (Not counting AA's that even out HP's, since you cannot kill someone with this consistantly).  Think of how some stupid shaman could ruin it and sour a lot of people's view of them on groups.  And do you really think that a little extra mana regen will make them want to add a Shaman to a group that already has a BST?  They'd be better off BY FAR by getting a Druid for Pot9 or a Cleric for the heals and Virtue.  <br />
<br />
Also, the LAST thing I want to do is spam another canni.  Wouldn't it be great to have to spam group canni over and over?  And they'd have to make the ratio worse or give it a mana cost if it was a group spell, so we'd have to spam group canni AND single canni, using up another spell gem.  Also, group canni with a HoT would give every class shaman-level mana regen (to an extent), which would not work since it would overpower all the classes whose spell mana costs are not scaled up for balance.  And I know a lot of lazy bsts who would not be up to casting the HoT over and over constantly as we canni.  We Shamans alone have grown accustomed to instinctually pounding a key during any form of downtime, I wouldn't be looking forward to trying to train a Beastlord to always combo his HoT with me during EVERY FREE MOMENT.  He'd start complaining that he can't chat with friends and then while he's not cooperating, you lose your ability to cast non-AA canni if you don't also have your single canni spell up.<br />
<br />
It's a great concept, but I see too many problems arising from it.  This is why I believe adding endurance regen to Focus, as was mentioned here, or giving us unique % avoidance buffs, or perhaps a good stackable max mana increase buff if you REALLY want to enhance the mind like the manual says, would be a better path to take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it's a really interesting idea.  Would certainly give you a little more to think about when you're creating a group.  And it definitely should avoid strengthening the triangle of cleric/warrior/enchanter.  Couldn't see Sony implementing this, but I certainly could see it happening in WoW.  Sony just isn't willing to take this type of creative leap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, I can see SOE implementing this... and selling this back to us in the expansion after OOW.<br />
<br />
Sorry Litgruv, you didn't patent this idea, now someone is gonna steal it and make cash from it, and worse of all, force you to buy that expansion.<br />

<br />
For an idea of why it would suck, talk to a mage about why they asked for the mod rod nerf.</div></div><hr />
