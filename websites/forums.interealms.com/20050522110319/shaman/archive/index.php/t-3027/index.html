<br />
If you are going to restart however, NOW is the time to do it. Leveling is about to get alot harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/gasp<br />
<br />
That's Blasphemy ! <br />
<br />
Start over ? Are you kidding ? The reason most JBB wearing Shaman chose a race that can wear one is because they didn't have the guts to be an Iksar ! <br />
<br />
Muhahahaha ! :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stay with it, you've come so far to give up now, there aren't many of us out there, it's quite a honor to become a lvl 60 Iksar Oracle. It's quite a feat, as we don't have access to all the &quot;toys&quot; you Hairballs and Softskins have (JB armor especially).  <br />
<br />
That's just my 2cp though.</div></div><hr />
