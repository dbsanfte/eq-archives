<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 49 you can solo HHK.  You might want to duo the nobles there right now.  If you can ever not find it camped.  Other places are echo and jfp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tazmiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dam* Highkeep seems to be camped all the time! The exp in Echo carvens is not as good as exping in DL, and many times it's camped. :/<br />
<br />
I havent tried Jpf yet... so any idees here? i have read something about a carve??..<br />
<br />
For the past days i have been in Lguk (to get Raster), but exp'ing was not good eather.<br />
<br />
Need any advise i can get..!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kheldran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can someone enlighten us on some good hutning spots? I am in the same boat. I play a 46 Froglok Shaman and my bro plays a 46 Human Monk. We always fight together so we are always 1% exp away from each other. =)<br />
<br />
We have been in Tenebrous Mountains since level 42. We are a VERY good duo; we never fight at the zone, we march right into the middle of the zone where all the Wolves and Bats path around. We fight non-stop for hours gettings 2-4 adds almost every fight. We do perfectly there, but now the exp has slowed a bit (I know its good till 47-48 solo). <br />
<br />
We are looking for non-stop fighting of the same calibur. So far we have the following places to check out:<br />
<br />
CoM: Longer spawn time, but might not matter if we fight in the temple area (plus stables for my final epic drop there).<br />
<br />
JP Poachers: Shouldn't have a problem I assume, seems like we might get a couple levels here at most.<br />
<br />
Sol B: Heard bonus % is nice, not too sure about trains and such.<br />
<br />
Dulak: Again, heard good exp and my empty bottle. =)<br />
<br />
Anyone have any other ideas or can comment on the above? The monk hasn't really have a chance to learn single pulling, but I know he'll catch on quickly. Also, like a lot of other players, I'd rather stay away from DL unless someone proves the exp is super easy and super quick.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gnome guards in echo are great exp solo.  1% a pop and very safe.  1st right as you enter echo on the deep side.  2 guards there.  You have to root 1, target the other and sick scooby on him.  slow/dot/engage.  2nd guard may unroot before first is down but should be no problem to tank both for a few rounds.  Back off 2nd one so it turns on scooby, slow/dot/engage.  Moving up brings you to 2 more guards, then past them you can single pull 'harold the herald' with slow.  I run back down to where the 1st set spawns and med.  I dinged 49 in here the other day and at 49 I can finally single pull the guards with slow.  Stay away from the kings and the other npc's, they are casters and will only cause you problems.<br />
<br />
Shaman/monk -  I did COM with a necro and that's pretty much non stop action.  I think this would be a great place for you and your brother to explore.  Very quiet and there are 3 or 4 places you can set up, so you should never have problems finding a camp.  The stables on the left is good but can be tricky because of adds (also shaman epic piece drops in here ).  Good place for monk to work on his FD.  Main courtyard area is another spot, then temple area to the right.  4th spot I poked around was to the left and right of the castle entrance.  Slime and undead , be careful of adds.<br />
<br />
Back to Echo for the shaman/monk; may be the Taskmaster room.  If no one is camping outside that room, you'll have extra mobs to pull if you clear the TM room ( note - always leave 1 undead skelly up so that the thought horror doesn't spawn ).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
