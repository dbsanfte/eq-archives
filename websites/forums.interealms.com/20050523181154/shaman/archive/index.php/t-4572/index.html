<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's interesting how groups change over the course of an evening.<br />
Last night I was lucky enough to get into a Seb group. It started out as your standard group: couple of tanks, enchanter, shaman, cleric, mage.<br />
But the group broke up eventually and so I got into the next group that formed in Necro. This was interesting.<br />
<br />
2 mages, enchanter, bard, shaman and rogue.<br />
<br />
The group flat rocked! I was the healer and had my pet up just<br />
to add to the fun of sitting back and watching our pets rip up<br />
stuff. The enchanter and bard kept mana full and pet damage plus nukes plus rogue damage killed stuff fast. <br />
<br />
I rarely had to heal more than the pets and even when somone got into trouble, Superior Heal makes the health bar go up a lot faster on a mage than a tank.  :-)<br />
<br />
I really hated to go to bed but was replaced by a 57 shaman who I'm sure had just as much fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I also finally got to go into Sebilis last night for the first time after we kicked the evils out.  We started out as a full group with me, 2 tanks, a bard, a cleric and a rogue and were tearing up the scarabs.  A few hours in most everyone had to go, so it ended up being me, a bard and a druid...not the most damage oriented output group for sure, but we killed just as much as the full group.  Bard mez is amazing for adds, and on the one time bard had a bad pull and got 3, she mezzed 2, and me and the druid took down the remaining with me tanking, so the bard could help with the other 2.<br />
<br />
Those quirky groups are fun to find :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My last 3 Seb groups (I was 58 and had epic):<br />
<br />
- mage 60 (epic), mage 57 (epic), chanter 56, druid 60, necro 56 (epic). mage 60 left quite early. We camped disco.<br />
<br />
- druid 60, chanter 55, wiz 57, necro 56, druid 54. Zone in / jail was our camp.<br />
<br />
- ranger 60, rogue 58, druid 60, necro 57. At the beginning we were at chef. Later we moved to crypt / emp.<br />
<br />
Had a lot of fun in all groups and no one got killed ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, it goes on :-)<br />
<br />
My last Sebilis group:<br />
60 Warrior, 57 Bard, 60 Shaman (me)<br />
<br />
We just went in to see how far we could get. Since most camps were taken we went for Kitchen. Never thought we would make it, but it was easy (until the bard got too many resist on snarind a frog and it came back with 3 other frogs and 2 scarabs).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, sounds like you had good experiences in Seb.  On 7th, we have a lot of AoE groups there pulling half the mobs from regular camps and trampling the peeps there.  I've enjoyed Sebilis more than any zone I can name, cause it has such varried camps and it's easy to say &quot;this is where our camp stops and yours starts.&quot;  I can't name another zone where I still camp that I camped when I was 52, and that says a lot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is one of those situations where you shine as a shaman. With 'unusual' groups you usually get a much lower efficiency or a higher death rate, but add a shaman and it is just so much more smooth.<br />
<br />
Personally i love the unusual groups, primarily because it lets me utilize spells i normally do not use.<br />
<br />
-AE grouping with a bard and 3 clerics on undead mobs. Go tigirs!<br />
<br />
-all pet group, me and 5 mages... four of them epic! Course i was the puller.<br />
<br />
...and the most insane xp group ever... 4 rogues and a bard were wondering what their 6th member should be. You guessed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best group I have ever had in Seb was:<br />
<br />
2 Shaman, Necro, SK, Ranger and Bard<br />
<br />
We went thru disco like a hot knife thru butter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Me + 4 monks + 1 rogue  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love weird groups.  Its fun seeing how long it takes before a groove develops.<br />
<br />
This week in Chardok there was me (58 shamie), 55 rog, 54 chanter, 56 druid, 57 cleric, 57 necro.  I was puller and MA, slow aggro and JBB shots mixed with melee, not to mention rogue evade allowed the rogue to tank a little and transfer aggro back to me when they evaded for a BS.  This was fun although I had one bad pull I'd like to get back (a monk would have been able to split it, I can't), but aside from that it was cake.<br />
<br />
Last week I was in OS doing the Iksar with 2 bards, that was fun, almost no downtime, I healed, buffed and ToPed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">most fun group I been is Shaman(me), mage, rogue, rogue. the rogue ping pong tanking and I bring mob to park around them to make them busy :) . only bad thing is torpor's snare suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Really fun group is shm + 5 rog ;).  With rogs hasted there is almost no time for anything to live, the backstabs alone are huge damage and with auto attack on and evading, throw a slow and the mob is gone...root aggro and shm tanking is god :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Last time I was in Seb, I got on quite early and soloed down through bugs to crypt (bugs group was reforming), killed the lammy golem, then waited for the crypt group incoming from zone to let me in.<br />
<br />
I got in crypt,logged and returned 2 hours later to empty crypt, started to break it when I got a tell from uberguild monk friend to go kill Trak. Gated round to bubble, ran down to lower jail. 3 DPS heavy groups, me only shaman, so buffing took 2mins. <br />
<br />
Took about 20-25mins to clear to little room just before bridge to lair, when bardsong chain aggro dumped whole lair on us (prot, 6 juggs, Trak, jumpy stayed put for some reason). <br />
<br />
Our cleric and only enchanter dropped in ~10secs (I had just got prot malo and slowed), so I worked my way through and got all juggs slowed (torpor self, slow 2 juggs eating slow resists, no time to Malo, rinse/repeat heh) just as all the other healers were dead. <br />
<br />
All survivors camped out to clear Trak aggro (who was still stomping up and down outside), then we used essence emerald to rez back clicky cleric (necro saw the initial pull and FD). Reformed groups, buffed up and killed trak in 30secs or so, grats me on Trak tooth ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">shaman, bard, sk with 150aa, rogue, monk, wizard.<br />
<br />
all 60.<br />
<br />
I don't have torpor but it didn't matter.  I never had to heal the SK because he was critical lifetapping for 650 several times per fight.</div></div><hr />
