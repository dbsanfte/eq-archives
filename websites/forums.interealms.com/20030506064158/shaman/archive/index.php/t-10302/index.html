<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Spent last Saturday whacking GWs in SF with my warrior - after about 6 hours we were fighting a GW and had him at 20 percent health and he started to kick butt on my warrior.  I thought he had enraged (which they sometimes do) so I stopped attacking with warrior and backed off my dog, to no avail he killed the warrior very quickly and then turned his attention on me.  After reviewing the tapes I think I figured out what happened :).  I forgot to reslow him at half like I normally do and it cost me an hour of dragging corpse 200 miles, begging a res and then rebuffing.  So REMEMBER to reslow those long fights.  I am blaming the hours of monotony for my mistake.  Did get some nice spells for my troubles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Forgot to reslow THO twice last time we fought him =P  Luckily I got it back under control pretty quickly, but I was hoping noone would notice.  The last one almost caused a wipe, cles were getting LOM and trying to push the ch cycle as far as they could.  Plus I had that damn fizzle dot on me, took 8 casts to land it~</div></div><hr />
