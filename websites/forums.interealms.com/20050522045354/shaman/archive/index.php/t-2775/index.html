<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In DL today(i know, i know), grouped up and all, and another shammy is in the group...i inspect him, and he looked like that joke shammy profile, crunchy or whatever...<br />
<br />
i asked him what his stats were... 420AC, 800HP, at level 39<br />
<br />
i almost started to cry.  I tried to convince him that ac/hp is better, and pointed out that w/ that AC, he better never do a dungeon, where adds, and thus aggro are common(i raised my defense 20 pts in my last 3 levels in solb, just by normall playing).  He claimed root/dot was the most efficent way to solo, etc....<br />
<br />
I told him he couldnt take a hit, and he was promptly trippled for 103 each time, and ran around in circles until i rooted the mob..<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you say to people like that? who have no idea whats best, how can you convince them, so they are &quot;convinced&quot;.  BTW, he wasnt a noob, he has a 56 warrior =\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was he slowing?<br />
<br />
The funniest ones are the ones that don't cast slow. Makes my mind boggle.<br />
<br />
Game doesn't really make it easy on us Shaman either. Almost every melee I've ever grouped with goes into a mad panic if not ALL the mobs are trying to hit THEM. So you do your little slow, then move to the side. Sit/Stand and root it. Then 5 seconds later your Warrior flies in to &quot;save&quot; you thereby totally negating your ghetto handiwork. The funny wears off shortly after that.<br />
<br />
You don't NEEED AC to be a good Shaman. Enchanters can slow without AC. It just means your play style will be a little different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i say let them play as they play, as long as they are having fun, why try to force your playstyle onto them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let him do what he wants.  He will learn soon enough or die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah...I suggested he get more AC, or atleast build up his defense skill, but he didnt listen.<br />
<br />
Rag, WISvsAC/HP is an old topic, but idont wish to start that up...I just couldnt understand how he could follow that philosophy when throughout my daysplaying my shaman, the only thing that has saved me in dungeons and indoor zones is a decent AC...<br />
<br />
In anycase, he claimed the one time he did slow he lost half his health in about 3 seconds(cast slow on an add, then instantly sat, so it ran over to him and hit him a couple tmes) was due tome &quot;jinxing&quot; him, by telling him to make sure he never got aggro,ever :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He'll &quot; Learn &quot; because in a few levels he'll be headed to Seb, VL, KC.  There a Shaman is EXPECTED to slow.<br />
<br />
He'll run into someone like me (The Colonel Kilgore from Apocalypse Now)<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman you either slow or disband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir don't you think the Dogs / Spiders / Frogs are a little hairy to be slowing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;*** do you know about slowing NukesaLot - you're a G0dd4mn Wizard!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe you just reminded me of the Cav copters flying all over the river blaring the recording &quot;I will not hurt or harm you, I just want my board back. It is a good board, and I like it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love descriptive subject lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*Shrug* If he enjoys playing that way let him. Maybe he has reason to play with that setup, or just enjoys it. You didn't describe anything that says he wasn't doing his part in the group and messing things up.<br />
<br />
What's best for someone is pretty subjective.<br />
<br />
What works for you might not work for him.</div></div><hr />

He was mostly working the buffs....nothing we wanted was LFG, so the leader grabbed a 2nd shaman to do the works...Its kinda hard to not do your part that way..but if i wasnt there, and he WAS slowing/backup healing, he woulda gone down fast.   DL isnt exactly a caster challenging zone...on most mobs, you could have slow resisted like 5 times, then finally land it, and instantly sit, and the mob wont aggro.  Melees love OT/DL cause of this, jus go there and hit A, and then you dont gotta worry about anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He was probably wearing a lot of charisma gear and getting less resisted than you, though. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nothing wrong with playing the way that is fun for you.  So I really have no problem with pure WIS shamans (or pure anything shamans for that matter).<br />
<br />
That being said, there comes a point when your playstyle directly affects the enjoyment of your guildmates.<br />
A shaman (or any other class) that keeps dying in a group from either having no defensive capabilities or no mana is a hinderance and just slows everything down.  And that's no fun for anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lomotil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To anyone who says something like: 'This topic is so old..bla bla bla:'<br />
<br />
Chances are that this is a new player, and needs a little advice, and may also need to do a little research. Just because YOU may know all the ins and outs of playing a shaman doesn't mean that everyone does as well as you...so knock off the 'I'm so above this' post. Chances are also that this person doesn't know or care to research..they may be an idiot, they may be defensive when you offer suggestions, but it's worth a shot.<br />
<br />
If all you're going to do is post something like 'this sort of thread is so yesterday' please go to www.ubershamans.com and don't post replies/threads here about how you are so much better than everyone else. The other day a 48 shaman walked up to me and asked me a few questions I thought were pretty obvious in answer...but once I started talking to her, I realized she was simply a new player and had really gotten far for her level and language barrier (European). I gave her a couple of websites to visit, a few spells for future needs, and she is rocketing through levels. It doesn't hurt to 'stoop below your level' and lend a helping hand. <br />
<br />
Sheesh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lomotil, what surprised me the most was that this guy had a 50+ warrior, and wasnt new at all.  I suggested perhaps he get more AC, as that would help him alot while grouped or solo, but he said he wanted to go the wis path.  In anycase, im sure he will learn fast enough when he goes to a dungeon such as KC, and gets some aggro =\  <br />
<br />
Come to think about it, hes probably just another product of the kunark outdoor route, and its not like the mobs in OT/DL etc take much offense to slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">umm this topic is so old its starting to reek worse than domer's appartment at high noon.<br />
<br />
Well hell, we may as well close this board down.  I mean hell, this game is over 3 yrs old and all.  No sense in talking about anything because it's all been covered right?  Moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Moron.<br />
That's seriously not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That probably described me when I was a level 39 shaman, well maybe I had slightly better stats even then :D Truth be told though, I never really knew what slowing was till around level 45 when I started soloing with jbb.  I'd been in Paw a couple times, as well as Lguk, but I generally hated dungeons, so I usually stuck to grouping outdoors.  <br />
<br />
I remember healing, buffing, nuking, dotting, but never did I slow regularly during fights.  And people never complained about it - then again, we were all pretty new to the game, and I'm sure I'd get slapped nowadays.<br />
<br />
Luckily for me, I learned to slow when soloing, so when I graduated to KC, I didnt get bitched at too much, and in the meanwhile, got to buy some more ac gear to compensate for extra aggro :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">During a particularly long, boring camp of Ice Giants for their widdle toesies, I came upon a ShaDrood.<br />
<br />
Having nothing but courtesy towards those who have not cheesed me off (mmm... cheese...) I wished him the best of luck and proceeded to pick off my giants while he does his.<br />
<br />
I ask him if he's keeping the toes for alchemy, and if not, would he sell them to me.   He says they're not worth anything, and he just destroys them.   I tell him they're actually worth something to me, and I'd like to buy them.  He again says they're not worth anything, and he'll keep destroying them.  (note, I'd upped my offer; each set of IG piggies was now worth more to him than the FS.)<br />
<br />
Brainboy starts slamming into me shortly afterwards because after layering in my DOTs, I close into melee range and proceed to beat the giants.  <br />
It: &quot;Dood, u stupid&quot;  <br />
Me:  &quot;Stupid?  Why?  And I'm not a dude.&quot;<br />
/me points to her chest.<br />
Me:  &quot;This BP makes me look fat, but I'm still not a dude.&quot;<br />
It: &quot;U stupid cuz ur fighting&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;Why is working on weapon skills stupid?&quot;<br />
It:  &quot;U gonna get hurt.  I see u root, why u not root it again?&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;Why bother?  They die quickly enough.  Anyways, I re-root the dual wielders and let eBolt chew them up a bit more first.&quot;<br />
<br />
We compare Wis totals, etc.  While chatting, I let him explain his root-rotting tactics (the usual) and ask him why he doesn't Cann.  Mostly because when the giants break free, they hurt him.<br />
<br />
I root-rot a few while we're chatting (well, mostly while I'm drying to decipher d00dsp33k) just t'show that I'm willing to learn.  I humbly (well, as humble as I can be) suggest that he work on defense when he has a chance... cuz free AC is free AC.<br />
<br />
ShaDrood thinks I'm an idiot for suggesting it.  I tell him that root-rotting is a perfectly acceptable method of disposing of his foes, but he might have more fun trying the melee method on some light blues somewhere, but that Ice Giants aren't a good thing to start meleeing with unless you're battle-hardened already.<br />
<br />
ShaDrood proclaims that he IS &quot;batle hard&quot; and then proceeds to get pounded into a smear trying to melee.  I pull the giant off him, heal him to full, and keep the giant rooted while he MEDS.<br />
<br />
I don't make any more suggestions, though, cuz I'm &quot;stupid&quot; ya know.  In fact, I begin to bore of the constant &quot;ur stupid&quot; messages so I /ignore him.<br />
<br />
Did you know that /ignore will also squelch desperate /yells for help?<br />
<br />
Long-winded point being:  You can explain, you can show through example, and folks will still not get the hint.<br />
<br />
/em still wishes for a &quot;dolt&quot; list.</div></div><hr />
