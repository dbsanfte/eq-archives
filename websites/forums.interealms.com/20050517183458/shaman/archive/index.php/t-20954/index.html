<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Racs34</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been throwing around the idea of rerolling my 65bst in favor of a shaman. <br />
Why would I do this? Well I am tired of being a hybrid and only being second/third best at things. <br />
I want to be the BEST at something. Whether it be slow's, buffs or whatever.<br />
Since I do have fun playing my bst I figured the parent class of the bst would be the best fit. <br />
So why reroll? Well since I play on FV you can only have one Toon at a time. <br />
On the plus side I do have some decent gear that I can pass to my shammy spirit wrack cords, blessed coldain prayer shawl, fungi Staff.......<br />
Also if I sold off all my primary gear/sac down bst and sell emeralds I should be able to get about 1million pp. <br />
<br />
I tend to solo a lot and want to group more. I feel that being a shammy will make me more desireable to groups and still enable me to solo. <br />
<br />
So what I would like to know is how some of you shammys in the community feel about your class. <br />
<br />
What do you love about your shammy and what do you hate about it. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. <br />

<br />
I'd keep the beast.  You can fill in as either slower or dps, shaman healing is almost useless in GOD and while shaman can solo flashy mobs, the beast lord is better for farming.<br />
<br />
All my opinion of course.  My shaman is only 63, consider my opinion in light of my level/place in the game.<br />

<br />
I could be wrong though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd remain a BST. The effort and time you put in should mean something. I know alot of BST's that solo as well as are group friendly. It's not the class so much as how you go about things.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to group more, then group more. Simple as that really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Racs34</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another thing I was wondering about is how dependent are you on other classes buffs? <br />
As a bst I generally grab pet toys(magi), Virtue(cleric) and a kei if available. <br />
If I can't get one of the above buffs or toys it definatley slows down my exping and or my choice of zones to solo.<br />
<br />
I was hoping with Canni and self buffs that shammys are somewhat immune to this. <br />
<br />
I smell troll bait... <br />
<br />
Hehe no not trying to stir up any crap. <br />
I think part of my quandry is that I am getting a little burned out on EQ. It is my hope that a new toon would breath new life into EQ for me. <br />
<br />
If I played on another server then this would not be an issue at all. I would simple roll up a new toon transfer some gear thru shared bank slots and go to town. However due to FV's rule set that is not possible. <br />
<br />
Thanks again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So, start a Shaman on another server and see if you like it. If you do, then pass gear to   shared slot nuke, and trans, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I reccomend Stepping away from the game for a while. EQ will be here when you get back. <br />
<br />
That or play something completly different Like perhaps a cleric. Or a warrior or thief. They are all the best at what they do. <br />

<br />
considering what we think of our class.....hmmm. The shaman class is loads of fun soloing everywhere except for pop and gates. Most of us will tell you that our versatile soloing ability is a big reason many of us play the class. A beastlord will always contribute more in a raid setting yes, but then again they arent a viable healer or slower (read slowing class that can debuff MR). I enjoy the class immensely. I'd roll a beastlord myself but I just cant live without being able to heal, debuff, dot, root and vp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on the stage of the game.  There are really 2 stages:  for general purposes, call them endgame and pre-endgame, they generally line up with pre-elemental vs. hard LDON/elemental+/GoD.<br />
<br />
You'll be the BEST at a couple different things, and VERY GOOD at many others, until you approach endgame.  If you are not an endgame/raiding kind of person, by all means, play a shaman, they ROCK until this phase.<br />
<br />
Shaman will indeed allow you to solo, but be very desirable in groups as well.  <br />
<br />
Since you asked what I hate about it, here goes.<br />
<br />
The big issue shamans have is that as you approach endgame, most of the shaman's differentiators are declining, and the delta between what other classes can offer in those areas versus the delta between what shamans offer versus those other classes is out of balance.  Consider the following &quot;core&quot; EQ functions:<br />
<br />
tanking<br />
crowd control<br />
buffing<br />
debuffing<br />
utility<br />
healing<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
shamans were never intended as tanks, so mark this off.<br />
<br />
our CC is ghetto at best, and high maintenance.  Grab agro, take a beating, try to channel a root.  Shoot a VP every 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
buffing is a function with diminishing returns as your group/guild/raid progresses, gets better gear, and approaches/exceeds max stats unbuffed.  Most elemental level melees will approach this, at least for critical stats.<br />
<br />
debuffing is a thing of the past aside from slow.  If your first slow doesn't land, by the time you malos and re-slow (which you may as will, given the recast time on turgur's) the mob is at 50% or less.  Perhaps the new GoD slow mitigates this some.  Not even gonna bring up the whole mitigation thing, which only aggravates this.<br />
<br />
utility is something shamans have never been strong in - lev, eb, sow are all nice eye candy, but VoQ and SD are far more impactful.<br />
<br />
healing hasn't kept up with the times.  350/tick will suffice in normal LDON/BOT, but much beyond that, it won't keep anyone alive, its primary use becomes topping off DPS or casters that accidentally get agro or after a canniV.  Burst heal - pretty much a joke.  Druids get a MUCH better burst heal relative to the tanks' HP.<br />
<br />
DPS - now for the core of the problem.  The game has evolved to one of burst DPS being key, and shamans just don't have this ability.  Nukes are a joke, pets are a bigger joke, and our DOTS are too slow and the mob doesn't last long enough for them to be an efficient source of DPS.  Bane was a great start, but we really need an upgrade here to keep up with the Joneses.<br />
<br />
Obviously, our core function is to debuff (read: slow).  When you compare us to the other slowers, we're anywhere from slightly better to significantly better than each.  However, each has a SIGNIFICANT advantage in another area that outweighs our advantage, usually making them a clearly better choice as a group member.<br />
<br />
Compare the chanter:<br />
their slow is 70% to our 75%, but they can DC or charm some NASTY mobs.  Huge DPS.  They also bring a huge advantage in CC functionality.  VoQ anyone?  Nah, clerics don't like that.<br />
<br />
Compare the BL<br />
65% slow - a little weaker, but they have a massive DPS advantage.  SD never hurt either.  Tanking and off-tanking by pets brings a decent ghetto CC<br />
<br />
Even compare the bard<br />
52% slow - pretty big difference, but the ability to just about guaratee single pulls and increase the DPS of the party immensely with songs.  The mob dies exponentially faster with DPS songs, so the hit in slow effectiveness is effectively cancelled.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, I hate the fact that we haven't kept up with the times.  I don't mind that our utility sucks, it alwasy has.  Our CC is fading fast with how mobs hit nowadays, but I don't wanna see us a CC class anyway.  We either need to have a significant boost in healing or _burst_ DPS, or a moderate one in both, in order to be effective and desirable in groups.  Buffs that broke the stat caps would get us invited in a hurry as well.<br />
<br />
And if you do play shaman, screw fungi staff, go with a nice 1hb/p (winterstorm comes to mind) + shield and fungus covered tunic, lunar preferred, scale acceptable =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">only being second/third best at things.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a class that is the best at something, I would not recommend shamans.  While I enjoy my class, the only thing we are best at is slowing.  At this point in the game the advantage that we have over other slowing classes is fairly marginal.  <br />
<br />
Our buffs are quite comparable to teh ones you use on your beastlord.  We can buff similar amounts of hp and stats, but a beastlord can also buff mana regen and a larger amount of attack than a shaman can.<br />
<br />
Offensively, we are significantly below average in the ability to deal damage in most group and raid situations.<br />
<br />
We are the worst healer of the healing classes.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a class that is the best at what they do (as you said), I would suggest looking at a cleric or a warrior.  While those classes are somewhat one dimensional, they are the best at what they do.  Shaman can fill a larger number of roles than a cleric or a warrior, but we cannot fill any of them as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">innoruk troll. clicky snare necklace.I chose Ogre, but this little gem is DAMN near worth basing your decision upon solely.  Snare + shaman = game over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 hours tradeskilling with my shaman with the LFG tag up in PoK<br />
<br />
4 hours helping a guildie camp Drelzna boots with my BST. I put up an AFK message just so I wouldn't have to type &quot;Sorry, I HAVE a group!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, guildie goes LD just as Drelzna pops and doesn't come back, so now my BST has a pair of worse than sow click-boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you decide to switch to a shaman, don't delete your beastlord. Instead, get a second account and cancel your first one, and make the shaman on the second one.<br />
<br />
This way if you later change your mind and want to switch back, your beastlord will still be around for you to reactivate on your cancelled first account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol switching from beastlord to shaman right now? you on crack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with Gunderson, DONT delete the beastlord, use the bst to pl the shaman.  Chances are, you'll want to return, probably after pulling out hair in frustration.<br />
I got lots of nice shaman items for sale though, see my beastlord in the bazaar.....   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have both characters, and while I love playing my shaman, there are certain things that I like to play on my beastlord<br />
<br />
If you like to melee a bit, then keep the beastlord.  If you think that you want to do it cause you think that it'll be easier to get groups as a shaman.. well, I can tell you that it may be true, but no offense, but it prob has more to do with your playstyle.  As a top end shaman I really can't say that I have problems getting groups, but I can say that whenever my guild looks for people to do LDoN or GoD trials with, they always look for the beastlords first, cause their mana buffs plus dps own over what extra we provide with more healing and a little bit higher slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I wouldn't go shaman from BL, our class defining ability is slowing, and the BL 65 slow is close enough.</div></div><hr />
