Also, avoid the big talking rat.  Bastard calls for help &amp; the guards come running.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmtasu</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't figure this zone out. Rats never add for me, and gaurds never add for me. But if I attack a prisoner, everything adds. I find most people can attack gaurds and Rats without getting aggro, but then some people can't. (And these are people who are same level as me and have never killed anything that gives faction in the zone) <br />
<br />
Also once in a blue moon a gaurd will spawn, same name and level as all the other gaurds. (A second floor gaurd) that will aggro anyone killing rats or gaurds) <br />
<br />
I don't know if factions are just weird in this zone or its a bug. Usually when I kill I kill all the rats on the first floor behind the door that leads a bit deeper in, then kill the gaurds, then start working on lower level gaurds and rats. Gaurds won't even assist other gaurds, then that one gaurd pops, and assists. Makes no sence to me. But I ain't complaining, uber exp on these guys and very soloable.</div></div><hr />
