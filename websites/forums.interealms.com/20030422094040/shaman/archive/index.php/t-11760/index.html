<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This might be a dumb question but considering how goofy faction is, does anyone know if it is possible for a tribunal worshipping Barbarian shaman to get non KoS to Neriak, and if so how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes you can. you can get good faction with the king faction of neriak doing the red wine quest. that will not give you faction with most of neriak third gate. thats another quest kind of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">will this wreck my faction with good cities?  Not that it matters so much any more, but I like at least being able to go home to Halas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it might. you might want to check though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Halfling faction (I believe) is the only one opposite neriak, and I don't remember if that particular quest messed with it.  What I did (as an iksar, kos to both to start):<br />
kill halflings in nektulos.  Takes a while, but gets guard faction up.  Once nonkos to guards in nek (and some inside), go the library in 3rd gate and handin red wine in mass quantities to a scribe whose name I forget.  Eventually that'll get you nonkos to a lot of neriak. It's still a varied enough zone that there are guards/npc's all over on different factions, so I still don't feel safe just strolling down the street non-invis.  I think there are a few ogre/trolls on different factions as well that you can't fix.<br />
If you want to fix halflings up after that, there's one near the port in area that wants bandages.  Handin in a ton of those to go from max kos to nonkos.  I did this one when you could do the handin / invis trick (he's too low level to agro you even if kos), might require some more work now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info.., I am curious because that ring you get for turning in pirate heads looks kind of sweet.  Anyone know if doing the wine quest will let me do this quest as well?</div></div><hr />
