<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Squeeze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, I need some advice concerning my gear : here is  my magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=289718).<br />
Im not in an ubber, and Im 4th Shaman of the guild, so it might be hard to farm Velious armor. And Im completly broke (damn horse !), so I cannot spend more than 2k :(  (If U know anyway to farm cash at my lvl feel free to share :D )<br />
I badly need my SoF, I just had the iksar tear, but Im stuck with the whole Hole part : guildmates lack the time to go there for me because we're focusing on getting our cleric their rez stick first :/<br />
I might try the faction work trick to skip this part, but loosing my iksar tear would freak me out...<br />
<br />
Thx for any advice my shaman brothers !<br />

<br />
Any idea ? Anyone ?<br />

Any of the KD Thurg or SS armor quests would help your chest and legs.<br />
<br />
Your Epic<br />
<br />
Sarnark Battle Shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your gear ain't all that bad.  The Spear of Fate would be the biggest improvement for ya.<br />
<br />
SBS is cheap, and gives more ac and resists - better than the wis on that shield imho.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - not so hot.  even an Elder Wolf Hide from Hollowshade Moor would be an improvement - more ac and similar wis.  Esay camp - but it can be long.  I found the pack leader up my first rip in there, and got him after only two ph's the next time.  I do note that he appears on the &quot;longest camp&quot; post, so I suspect this is where I wasted what little luck I had.<br />
<br />
If your guild is raiding in Velious, try to be in position for the drops in HoT.  I rarely wear the little bit of Thurg quest armor I have over the JB stuff like you have.  The SS quest pieces are a lot better (from the HoT drops).<br />
<br />
legs need help, but that is a hard area to upgrade.  JB, Thurg, SS are quite a bit better, but only the JB is droppable, and is still expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trade the Crystal Spider eye in for pp and an Enshrouded veil.  Sell the JB arms and boots to a vendor and go buy some Tribal War boots and sleeves with hp/sta/wis on them.  JB armor is next to useless and not doing you any favors by hogging up slots that could give you ac/resists/mana.  Lose the shield to an unsuspecting druid and go buy a SBS and some beer with his pp. :) <br />
<br />
Definitely finish up your epic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would suggest that you just do the faction if you are that worried about getting your epic asap.  I know a few people that have done the faction bit for epic recently and I can confirm that it still works that way.  Easiest part of the faction is to kill the dudes in RM and turn the item in to the wandering spirit in WK.  Then get to Mistmore and run in, kill adviser, and run back out to kill Dire.  I did this a few times at 60, as well as helped a few people out doing this at the same lvl, and every time, we were able to get into and out of Mistmore castle in about 10 min tops.  Heck, the ranger himself got to the Adviser and back out in about 5 min while it took me a bit longer since dog dog has severe pathing problems in that area (should have seen the train once after he wandered off into the basement and upon death brought that whole area on top of me).<br />

Basically, for cheap nowadays you can get good equipment for really cheap prices.  Check around a bit and keep track of what's being sold and for how much, and then notice if there is a sudden price drop in something.  I'm seeing those player made Gallantry Rings now for sale for around 10k a piece sometimes, down from when they were about 30k when they were first introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, looking at your equipment once again, i notice that have a piece of SS armor..the Wolf callers helm.  If you manage to get back there and camp it a bit more, then I would suggest getting the boots to replace your JB boots.  I replaced mine with the thurg pieces, and then with SS boots when I got it.  It was really the only piece next to the legs and BP that I wanted or cared about.</div></div><hr />
