<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have crashed randomly to desktop about 6 times in the last 3 days. When I come back from crash I am losing a random inventory items :confused: Ive lost 3 items out of my bags and 2 pieces of equipment. One time i had a necklace from a bag appear where my shield was, and the shield was gone! Also a ranger spell which I never had in my inventory to begin with was in my ring slot. And yes the ring was gone. I cant get a responce from a GM. I have e-mailed a gm at the official site and Ive chatted live with a rep who said I'll have to talk to a gm. I enabled the old ui in case it had something to do with it. All these crashes have happend in the grey. I dont know or think that has anything to do with it but you never know. Im scared to play because I dont want to lose more items. any advice anyone? im open to anything at this point.<br />

After about 5 or 6 days of petitioning constantly, a gm messaged me, showed up invisible in os where I was hunting and handed me my stuff. I was happy to say the least!<br />
