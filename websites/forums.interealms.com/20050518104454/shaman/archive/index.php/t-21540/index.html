******************************************************<br />
<br />
ARRRRGH dear god.. my work gone. I always forget to save before hitting submit. Here we go again. I'm a 65 shaman, 230+ aa's, a gm of many tradeskills (damn you tailoring) and an officer in an elemental guild. These are the issues ruining (and I do mean ruining) my enjoyment of playing a shaman.<br />
ISSUE 1: FAST FIGHTS ARE TEH SUCK  True story - I asked why we were gimped in short fights. Its because we are so good at long fights. I asked where the long fights were in this expansion... dev said there were none, because no one liked them. So I asked if we'd get tuned for short fights... he said it would be unfair, due to our long fight advantage. *Ba-da ching* OHO! The humor may have been lost on him. it wasnt on us. Balance us to the new play style. We deal with more mobs per minute that die in shorter times. We have to debuff them so spend a lot of mana, and we are obsolete to deal with their DPS. We need some love.<br />
2.  Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
** I was in vegas this year. Rytlan admitted what we all know. HoT's are obsolete. Torpor for 300/tic was the ****e when mobs were hitting for like 200 and fully slowable. Trushar for 450 when mobs are unslowed and hitting for 1200+... well its still ****e, just the connotation fo the term has changed for the worse. HoT's are junk, I would like to see us returned to keeping people alive through a combination fo HoT's, slows and direct heals.<br />
3.  Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target heal, more on par with PoP mob damage<br />
<br />
When I began EQ 5 years ago, it was me, my warrior roommate, and any 4 random people. If I was smart and dilligent, and we didnt get too many adds, I could main heal a group. We'd have downtime while I cannid back. We'd be hosed if someone died. It owuld have been faster, and more efficient with a cleric, and the exp and loot better, btu it was DOABLE. The group didnt break up because the cleric had to take his kids to soccer practice. Flash forward to... Kunark... yup, could still main heal. Velious? Yup... Luclin? Yup... hmm... Why is this ability removed in GoD? You dont have enough clerics to go around... face it. Spread the love, return us to the abilityt o keep an exp group moving (at a slower pace, but still moving) in high end content. 5 people waiting on 1 class (out of HOW many?) to log on is no fun. there are 3 tanks.... all 3 can tank in GoD. Why can only 2 of the healers function as healers?<br />
4.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
<br />
** Chain casting, we will run oom faster than about any other class. Funny... with mobs inc every 30 seconds, moving through dungeons, and the high mana cost of malso and slow (applied to every tissue paper ultra dps monster) we blow through mana like a mental institution patient through tin foil hats. The devs have changed it so that we dont have time to use our ACTIVE mana regen abilities, but not alterd how much mana our spells use, or seemed to notice that we have to debuff more mobs per minute,. resulting in a much higher mana spent per minute.<br />
38.  reduce spell casting time to be more beneficial in the now faster battles<br />
** I can take naps in between these dinosaur spells. Give us a detrimental spell haste aa. Maybe not capped at 50, but an extra 25% or so would make me luv you long time.<br />
11.  Keep the poison/cold nukes, up damage <br />
** What can we say. Dots suck. Until you amke them deal half their damage in the first tick, they are less mana efficient given fight length than dd's. So up our dd's. Also, velium strikes cast time is waaaa out of line. Lower that. I am alomst positive we were the ONLY casting class to not get a nuke upgrade in GoD. Thanks... love you guys too :P<br />
ISSUE 2: THE KINGS OF BUFFS SUCK AT BUFFING Why is our hp buff the lowest of any priest class, and the most useless? No one needs stats. We have them maxed, and let me fill you you devs in on EQ's dirty little secret... they dont do jack squat. 100 pts of agility is a 3% reduction in damage... MAYBE. 100 dex is a laughable increase in procs and crist. You have made zonewide debuffs in GoD to let us pretend that stats matter... thats, I dunno, kind of sweet. Like asking the kid in a wheelchair to dance at prom. Unfortunately its rubbing salt in the wound (and reminding us we cant dance) to show how worthless these buffs are now. Give us something worth casting to buff. Let it impact the game as much as VoQ, 1000+ hp from a cleric, etc.<br />
15.  Group FA<br />
** I can already keep this one on my group. Just let me do it without gritting my teeth. The high annoyance factor is one reason why EQ is losing customers to games who dont TRY and tick their players off for no good reason.<br />
18.  A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists<br />
**Yep. This stuff is on armor. It should have been on shaman buffs all along. Fix it please.<br />
22.  Focus or FA augmented with the following:<br />
            a. 30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
            b. 30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
            c. 2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
            d. 20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)<br />
** 544 hp is all focus does, and possibly max our a casters dex. Focus should be a sweet melee buff. Its not. Make it so!<br />
ISSUE 3: OUR SPELLS ARE TOO EASILY RESISTED Look at the data for resists on spells per class, and you will see that ours have very few negative resist mods on them. Others ahve resist mods of -100 or more. Why? I'm assuming its because we have malos. Betabuff a shaman to 65. Go to any of the new fast kill zones. Pull a  mob, malos, slow it.. and see what else you have time to do before the next mob is in camp. We cast this mana hog a LOT. Its slow, its got a long recast. Its annoying as hell if there are multiple creatures around... and its needed to land our spells because we dont have resist mods on em. The true joke is that even WITH malos on a mob, our spells are still significantly mroe resistable than other classes. Fix this.<br />
 <br />
32. Allow shaman to cast a buff that gives everyone in their group a -40 to -100 resist modifier on their spells (basically make them harder to resist), can make one spell for each resistance type. Have it last an hour or so.<br />
** This may be a bit much. But its a good idea, and fun for the whole family. Make it an AA. Make it a totem, like that healing ward thing we got in Gates. Unlike that aa, make it GOOD. Area of effect, have it drain endurance so we cant keep it up all the time, and actually need to use some strategy. Make it one resist type, so shamans stack better on raids. <br />
40. improve Malos line – faster casting and refresh, perhaps an AE Malos<br />
Malos 1 second cast time, since its required for our spells to land. If the thing cast faster, the refresh timer wouldnt be as HUGE a deal I guess. AE malos would be totally sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your problem was that you did a cut and paste of a post by a Mod/Dev.  They do a lot of font coding to make their posts stand out that players are NOT allowed to do.  I'd wager 90/10 that you had a lot of **Fluffernutter** entries in the error string.  That's a non-coding ID they pop into most of the font mods for some insane reason.<br />
