<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daelen Mindreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well we had a pretty amazing night in the Crypt last night... Waran, Myself, Atokal, and at various times Falino and Falamil headed down to the Crypt last night with a couple of folks we picked up at the zone.<br />
<br />
We had the following drops:<br />
<br />
Tolan's Helm<br />
Deepwater Helm<br />
Blood Ember Vambraces<br />
Nathsar Greatsword<br />
Jarsath Battle Sword<br />
Obulous Mantle<br />
Obulous Death Shroud<br />
Box of Nil-Space<br />
Necro Spell: Levant<br />
Shaman Spell: Talisman of the Brute<br />
Necro Spell: Emissary of Thule<br />
Magician Spell: Manastorm<br />
<br />
And last but not least The Blood of Chottal popped and was carrying Breath of Harmony... Everything was randomed among the groups  Falino won the box of Nil-Space and Atokal won the Breath of Harmony( 10/18 1hs .8 wt Effect: Niv's Melody of Preservation One of the best Bard only weapons in game) and he was nice enough to let Boladorn have it :)<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks again Toker and I think we have an all nighter planned this evening :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow! You guys cleaned house.. Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like fun. I had my first trip there 2 days ago and it was a blast. I'll log on tonight and see if you have any room for your all nighter. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had a blast down there yesterday, guys.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it looks like the wife has plans for this evening, so I will be back in Seb for more tonight.  I also moved my somewhat equipment-starved warrior to Seb yesteday and put almost half a level on him last night, thanks to one of the best pick-up groups I have run with in a while ( Thanks for the invite, Traz ).<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I will be online around 6;30, 7 PM EST and looking for some Seb trouble to get into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>razma taz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sound like you had a great time in Sebilis.<br />
If you don't mind my asking.. who did the spell Emissary of Thule go to?  I would be interested in purchasing it if it is for sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daelen Mindreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Paladin that was with us wanted it for his necro.... Aslanhiro was his name if you want to try and talk him out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I'll be in Seb tonight but at Juggs.</div></div><hr />
