<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night after a few months of procrastination I get around to going after the Black Dire.<br />
<br />
I head on in to see if the little guy is up. He is not.  But a guild is getting ready to raid the castle so I know they will be killing the Advisor pretty soon.<br />
<br />
So after about 30 min I see if they have killed the Advisor.  They just did.  So I run out of the castle and look down in the valley to see if he is there. He is. Grreat. My group heads in. <br />
<br />
But by the time we get there which is about 5 min he has despawned.  After that, no Advisor and no BD.  The raiding guild killed several PH for the Advisor but he didn't spawn.  <br />
<br />
So the short of it is I wasted 3 hours to kill a bunch of YT.<br />
<br />
Question is,<br />
<br />
Did I do something wrong?  Is there a better way to get the Advisor to spawn? Seems unlikely since everything in the castle was dead. If the undead are out will the Advisor spawn?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the advisor is a 4 hour spawn (been a LONG time hoho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 hours on advisor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">um, so does black dire really despawn pretty quickly? cuz that would be kinda sucky. maybe he was ks'ed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I could be thinking about another spawn...BUT..iirc the BD has two &quot; live &quot; times.<br />
<br />
a) If he is a normal timesink spawn he is up indefinitely.<br />
<br />
b) If you insta-spawn him however, you have 30 minutes to whack him before he despawns.<br />
<br />
Again I could be thinking about another spawn, but I remember killing the advisor with my monk then thinking to myself I NEED to get to BD spawn site quickly when I did Faern's Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Advisor is (used to be) a 4 hour spawn. As for BD, if he poofed in 5 minutes that isn't normal. I've done him 5 or 6 times and he's always been up longer than that. 30 minutes is probably a reasonable guess.</div></div><hr />
