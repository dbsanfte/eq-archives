<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While in ME camping Divine Inspiration range item, kill the coterie camp just to right of zone in, rare drop, but i can confirm ethereal earring still drops - the 10 ac one (there is also a 20 ac one offa a named worm), has good wisdom and mana and resists as well.  The nice thing about this camp is although it's a rare drop, the camp can be soloed by a level 60 shaman, so you would only need a small group to keep the 3 coterie cleared - just fyi, took me about 30 clearings to get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had forgotten all about that...maybe I should try for one of those (or better yet the 20ac!) instead of lizard bone.  Could pick it up while camping my DI soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wear the gloves off the named worm.  I have spent a decent amount of time in the zone, and always ask any tracker to check for that worm, and only once have we seen it up.  Kills of it seem about as rare as kills of the Insanity Crawler in Akheva.<br />
<br />
If he DOES spawn for you, you can kill it with a single group easily, as it is slowable.  I bet you can solo it, but it would take hella long (and you would most likely be KS'd).  But if you can get a warrior to tank, a well equipped shaman and warrior duo can smack it down.  The trick is to see it.  Watch tracking for 'a thought stealer'.<br />
<br />
I made a tracker JUST to check for this thing, never once saw him.  Gave up after about a week of having my tracker bot logged on every night for ~3 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can bind sight into the shoe horn looking tunnel where i think he spawns, but haven't seen him pop.</div></div><hr />
