<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello again <br />
<br />
<br />
I have the 2nd innoruk necklace and i am thinkign about doing my 3rd one.<br />
<br />
But i found out snare lasts 36 seconds only :( how exactly is this useful? I mean when do u use such an item with such a short duration?<br />
<br />
<br />
Can somebody clear this up please? How does the necklace help soloing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks you very much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It helps to keep runners from getting away from you while soloing. When a mob gets low HP it takes off running. If you snare it, it cant run as fast or as far. yes, the snare is not the best snare out there, and it sure doesnt last long. But when you consider that shaman have no other snare available that is unlimited charges, then it is a very attractive option. When I am using it for soloing, i will usually get the snare on, then can get three bracer nukes in then renew snare to keep it going. Anyhow, it is worth doing the quest for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can nuke a snared mob and it wont break.<br />
thats invaluble imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm level 60 and still use it at times.  I swap out when there isn't a snarer in the group.<br />
<br />
I snare, JBB, JBB, re-Snare, JBB, JBB<br />
<br />
I have a horse too, so I'm actually gaining meditation rate Mana while doing this.  So its a very very good thing to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, it's worthwhile as long as you know it's a low level Darkness spell, level 4 for Necro I think and really is only good for keeping very low health runners in place. For instance  it will stop the spiders and birds in PoN at very low health if cast right before they run, I've done snare duty with it in a group, it is enough to keep them nearby but don't expect it to do much to run speed on healthy mobs or early runners. It's still better than nothing. It resists about 25% more than Turgers or thereabouts, I always get more resists on the necklace than Turgurs. It's 6 tick duration also means you need to apply it near the end of the fight and it has a long cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Snare necklace is still one of my favorite items.  I have always used it to stop runners when I am not grouped with a snarer.  I have found it to be even more valuable in PoP.  I don't solo a lot in PoP, but when I do I am often in pretty cramped quarters because the zones are so heavily camped.  Root-dotting in close quarters is easier when I toss a clinging darkness on a mob just before I refresh the dots on it (which often break root).  You don't need nearly as much space to safely reroot a snared mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the replies guys and gals<br />
<br />
but is it worth wearign it and losing the 65hp and 65mana the current necklace gives me?<br />
<br />
or should i swap them really fast when mob begins to run and swap back.<br />

<br />
Yes, consider it a tool, I have lots of tools at home, I don't use each one everyday but they are there if and when I need them besides that is actually a fun quest and worth doing even if you never used the darn thing.  The mana and hp neck is there when you need it and so is this necklace, all part of a Shaman toolkit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I keep mine conveniently in a swap bag. When a mob starts to run I pop it in and just alternate casting it with JBB (so im totally sure it won't fade with a resist).<br />
It's far from the world's best snare, but as others have said, its great for when its the only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best part about the snare necklace (IMO): it cancels SoW. So it doesn't really matter that it only lasts 36 seconds and takes 6 seconds to cast, it overwrites the single most annoying spell that mob shamans cast indoors.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is nice to stop runners or to kite with. But overwriting SoW &gt; all that schtuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Something else you can do if you are 60 and have the spell already is use topors on the mob for snaring...The snare part works without healing the mob.<br />

<br />
Wrong. Stopping runners in dungeons is the most important point for snare tactics. Dying is not an option, zoning is. And rebuffing, breaking spawns again, setting up camp is all annoying enough to log.<br />
<br />
I've had this necklace since before there were shrink potions, long before shrink was allowed in Neriak. I was the second shaman on my server to gain this item. They did not have anything like this when I created my Troll. I had just wanted good faction with the home base on old server, Tallon.<br />
<br />
I've seen people get this necklace and remain clueless about how to use it. Thinking it's cast time too useless, or snare time way too short. That's an inability to adapt.<br />
<br />
The key point to learning this device: snares don't overwrite, they refresh. Spam it within 30 secs. If it's snared before it runs, that makes resnaring it easier. In some cases, if you don't keep the mob snared, you won't get a chance to snare it on low health.</div></div><hr />
