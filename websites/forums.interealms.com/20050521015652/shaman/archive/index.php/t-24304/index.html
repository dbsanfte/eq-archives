<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">on Rallos,<br />
<br />
     I am a bit disappointed at the PvP abilities of most shamans on Rallos.  For a PvP server, it's amazing that some people are so effective at killing rats and bats till 65-- but against thinking, living opponents they tend to get chewed up.<br />
<br />
    I think this is due to the repetitive- almost mindless, strategies that shamans employ while xping.  Slow, buff, rinse and repeat.  Doesn't allow much room for improvisation.<br />
<br />
   So, even though this may hurt my own career to divulge some secrets, I can't stand to see my shaman brothers getting beat up constantly.<br />
<br />
  1. Shamans are not victims!  I get so sick of everyone complaining that shamans are broken.  Believe it or not-- to be good in pvp requires attitude more than gear.  /flame all you want but I've beaten countless ebayed twinks with just dirty tricks and a little initiative.  If you wanna win in PvP, think of yourself as the hunter and just go from there.  Fear = mistakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
  2.  Be anal about buffs.  I don't leave pok without 20 buffs up (yes count em -- the max).  Put your crappy buffs first and the good ones at the end.  If your going up against a druid or necro- click off your first 2 buff slots and you can pretty much negate anything they throw at you.<br />
<br />
 3.  Move around!  Shamans who stand and tank are shamans who get killed.  Levitate has won more spells for me than any other single spell.  If you have a problem getting dispelled-- see #2.<br />
<br />
 4.  Pumice-- your best friend.  Always carry lots of pumice stones.  Clickable cancel magic has so many uses-- I give it to all my pk friends for Christmas.<br />
<br />
 5.  Different strategies for different situations.  Remember, a player is not a mob.  He will respond to what you do and try to figure out a way to beat it-- the best PvPers can adjust their strategy infinately.  If someone starts to cast gate, don't start a new ebolt for example.  Slam that fool!<br />
<br />
   Yeah these are obvious-- but surprisingly most of my opponents havent figured em out yet.  I would list more but time is running out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tips against specific classes.<br />
<br />
   Casters:  No finger wiggler can heal himself.  No, not even necros!  When fighting a caster use one of two approaches-<br />
                1. If hes weak and scared.  Just run up and slam the crap out of him and throw in melee whacks and poison dots.  If you dont have slam--just gate and /tell him, apologizing for wasting his time.<br />
                 2. If he thinks he is going to pk you.  These are my favorite caster fights.  Stand out of casting range, talk smack in ooc and call him a coward.  Odds are if hes twinked he will be an idiot and chase you down-- just keep hitting your best dot or debuff until he steps into casting range. (Disease works best for this strategy, but poison makes for a quicker fight) When the spell gets off- turn and run like hell.  If you do it right, you will have one spell on him and he will be out of casting range to respond.  Just keep it up until he dies or gates.  The trick is to make the caster think he is winning because you are running scared.  Then when he gets to around 20% you gotta know when to turn around and finish him with a quick slam (to stop gate) and nuke.<br />
   Pure Melees:  Kite Kite Kite.  But the scared ones who try to run away-- just chase em down and dont be afraid to melee a little bit.  Nothing scares a melee more than being beat down by a caster while hes taking 200 a tick from dots.<br />
  SKs: Since the darkness nerf AND HT nerf, this class is nothing to be feared.  Just kite like hes a warrior with less HP.  If he has low MR use malo and go for root / PR strategy.  If hes twinked just stack the DR dots and let him rot.<br />
  Bards: I once made a bard because I figured they are unstoppable in PvP.  Yes, bards have some amazing advantages, but the key to beating bards is to outsmart them.  Don't try chasing him around in open ground! Thats like tanking an SK.  Go find a cave and /ooc and talk smack until the bard is dumb enough to come looking for you.  Remember that bards have different line of sight rules from casters.  Many times I have landed 2 dots on a bard from behind a wall when he didn't know I was there.  Also, if you wanna totally shut a bard down just keep dispelling him.  He will be so worried about refreshing his selos and resists that his offense will be nil.  And if he doesnt refresh selos or resists-- you can kill him with ease.<br />
<br />
   Hope it helps someone.  My PvP strategy is more aggressive than any of the shamans I have fought with or against.  I like to get into peoples face and melee and run around talking smack-- sometimes they get mad and usually this leads to mistakes.  Good luck and hope someone reads this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you do against people with all resists over 400 even when you have landed malos on them? Hell, even 300+ after malos make it damn hard to do much. What do you do against classes that can cure posion or disease faster than you can cast the DoTs (especially since they are probably using a clickie to cure so its not even costing any mana)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bozer, your strategys are fine... for a mid-50s pvper.. maybe up to 60. But once you hit 65 and run into the time geared players with 400+ resists, you won't get much with those strategys. Most classes will own you at 65+ level. Manadrains and lifetaps are bane to shaman. Our dps spells are too unreliable in pvp to be of any use. All we can really do is sit there, heal, and whack a few times with our hammers. Regardless, if the other class wants to kill us, they will probably be there a minimum of 30 minutes. Chances are, in that time, you will do no(or minimal) damage to your opponent.</div></div><hr />

i won all fights,and at the end they were 2 on me,our best ranger and best warrior from the guild.<br />
<br />
hehe they took a long time to kill me.<br />
<br />
other fights were pretty easy,once quiescence hitted me (7 ot 8 tics).<br />
i was able to land Q pretty easy on me.<br />
<br />
i was standing on the platform and din t move from there.<br />
the ranger went away and throwing arrows on me (he had am3 or something ) but never been able to outdamage my Q and heal.<br />
<br />
after about 10 min, i told him to come fight me there at the platform,if he was not a coward  :o <br />

<br />
endgame shaman pvp works like this.<br />
if opponent=less than vt gear you win<br />
if vt or greater you lose.<br />
<br />
thats the breaking point, after a recent post about how uber shaman are in pvp and how easily dots were landing I went and played my shaman again. the same results I have been seeing for years now. <br />
<br />
complete and total ownership of 3 bazaar + some raid geared peeps, <br />
complete and totaly owned by vt+ geared peeps (3)<br />
<br />
why?<br />
because my **** DONT ****IING LAND ON THE VT+ GEARED PEEPS.<br />
<br />
the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FinlokVZ I have a strat for beating a bard, 2 in fact.<br />
strat for ganking a bard 1: go to paineel, wait for bard to show up near the city entrance, cast decay, cast VP while facing the pit into the hole, pray for your 1% chance that it lands. (yes I have done this)<br />
strat for ganking a bard 2: wait for bard to try and train a boatloac of mobs that hit like freight trains on you, cast decay, cast vp while facing the train, pray for your 1% chance that it lands (yes I have done this, the bard was dead before he hit the ground)<br />
<br />
thats the only way I have ever defeated a bard that wasnt a complete retard. the only other kills I can recall were one when I had SoC loaded up, when he got down to 8% he ran, I cheeta'd and followed, when he stopped to heal I nuked his ass and it actually landed (thanks poison nukes)<br />
<br />
for some serious and fantastic satisfaction I cannot recomend VP/hole highly enough, the day they put in the gunthak stone I cried :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What do you do against people with all resists over 400 even when you have landed malos on them? Hell, even 300+ after malos make it damn hard to do much.<br />
<br />
  My information is PvP server specific.  I don't duel much so I don't have any idea how to fight a prepared opponent. (well, I have SOME idea)<br />
<br />
  On Rallos, there are some time geared players running around.  Yes, its easy to throw your hands into the air and surrender to their superior resists.  Hell, a time geared bard is pretty much impossible to kill unless he does soemthing stupid, or you land a lucky VP.<br />
<br />
  But the point of my post is NOT that shamans are unbeatable in PvP.  Rather, if you use you use your brain and out-think your opponent you can prevail in MOST fights.  I would say on my server about 99% of the players are NOT time geared.  So if you can beat 99% of the players, and gate from the remaining 1% you can have a pretty good pvp record.<br />
<br />
  And most twinks with high resists tend to do stupid stuff alot, in my experience.  They learn to rely on their gear too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I've killed alot of bards past 50, and in 5 years a bard has NEVER killed me in PvP.  Theres one bard that I had a hard time with and couldn't kill, but he could'nt do anything at all to me.  This is pre- ancient mez though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bozer, your strategys are fine... for a mid-50s pvper.. maybe up to 60.

<br />
  I'm honored.  Believe it or not, it was the screenshots of Einnod smashing people, on the darkenbane website, that encouraged me to level up Bozer. (Too bad you turned anti =p)<br />
<br />
  Right now my guild is pushing me to level to 65-- I don't want to do it because I think your right.  There is a huge dropoff in caster PvP at 65+ with resists and all.  Again, I am not claiming that shamans are unbeatable-- but rather that player smarts can have a HUGE impact on PvP success.  <br />
<br />
  Einnod, ever run into Poxxx? He's an old pk buddy and a 65 shaman.  He seems to do pretty good in PvP, in fact I don't know of him ever being pked-- and he's killed thousands over the years.  (under his pre-legends name)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, your attitude is &quot;killer&quot; Bozer.  I mean this in the best way possible, but people like you are why I don't play PvP servers -- I get ticked off too easy and make stupid mistakes heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">pvp = malos lands, opponent runs or opponent has the resists to bounce everything and all we have is staying alive (which isnt hard).  in other words, boring and unappealing for me when it used to be a hell of a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've been noticing spells land a LOT easier in PVP since the changes went live.  PKs (I'm an anti) have notoriously high resists because they are generally highly mobile so clueless tanks are the least of their worries, if you stay oor of melee you can win any fight with a melee.  After the patch, my spells have been landing quite nicely on everyone (I'm 64) and that's without Malos.  Remembering that most PK guilds are not peple who are time geared (except those that level up in Legends)  Anathema is a nice suprise to land on casters.  Slow has been landing pre malo just about every pet I come across, which makes fighting necros almost a joke now (DA for DoTs slow for pet = dead necro)  But the dirty pk (there's your name calling for you) is absolutely right.  Its largely a matter of attitude and suprise.  If I get slammed unexpectdly by a few melee and casters you better believe I hit gate, unprepared there's just nothing you can do against a few well played pks.  See the same group of PKs and jump them... well things can happen differently.  Personally... I think the game is horribely unbalanced for pvp and nearly nothing could make it right aside from completely changing the pvp code so that all spells and melee acted differently in pvp and pve.  But as for resists I'm not noticing too many problems, but then again I'm not going after AD or Wudan or any guilds like that heh</div></div><hr />

On my shaman, much more so than on my alts, when I loose a fight, I can usually identify a mistake that I made or atleast a different strategy that is worth trying on the oponent the next time we fight. It is when I loose to an equal or lesser opponent and can't see any possible way of beating them that I get fed up and log. Thats why I keep coming back to my shaman.<br />
<br />
A few tips-Instaclicks are good, keep trades to group only (Doh!), and disease slow lands on some mellees with obscene MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MokkafyrTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shamans are all but underpowered in PvP... No matter what gear the opponent has. Even before the PvP patch i was able to kill several time+ geared people 1 vs 1. I was in elemental/VT gear(I still am). Our HoT spells keep us alive for minimal mana cost so our survivability is very good. With the new PvP patch shamans got serious upgrades to our damage output in pvp. Dots land after malos even on time geared people. We might not be very effective at killing other healing classes, but who is?<br />
<br />
If anybody is interested I can post a more detailed strat for fighting as a shaman. Too lazy to do it if no one is gonna read it ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />

  BTW you had a few levels on me, bane of nife was ruining my day in our fight hehe.  About the only time I can remember I had to gate from a one on one in the last few months.</div></div><hr />

Please post everything you got-- I eat it up.  Not enough pvp discussion going on anymore!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm honored that you made Bozer because of me. However, I must say that back in those days, pvp was a lot more balanced than it is now. I was able to get some kills pretty easily because my dots actually landed. After Luclin came out, I wasn't db anymore, but I still was able to kill my opponents if they were stupid enough to hang around. Now that pop is out, there's no chance. I have always enjoyed pvp, and will always be a pvper at heart. However, PKing is not the same as PVPing, in my eyes. My most enjoyable times in EQ was during darkenbane when I was fighting 1v1.<br />
<br />
Right now my guild is pushing me to level to 65-- I don't want to do it because I think your right.  There is a huge dropoff in caster PvP at 65+ with resists and all.  Again, I am not claiming that shamans are unbeatable-- but rather that player smarts can have a HUGE impact on PvP success.<br />
You're right here. If you want to pk, level to 60, get some AAs, and stay there. That's your strongest point, with Torpor, malo, and canni 5 AA. People won't hang around at 60 and won't have the gear to beat you unless they are a bard.<br />
<br />
Einnod, ever run into Poxxx? He's an old pk buddy and a 65 shaman.  He seems to do pretty good in PvP, in fact I don't know of him ever being pked-- and he's killed thousands over the years.  (under his pre-legends name)<br />
<br />
I have run into Poxxx many times, even beaten him a few times on my bard. I can't say he's a good pvper, as I've never fought him, and I try not to judge people before I've fought them. I also don't know his pre-legends name, so I can't say how many he has or hasn't killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">the only way to &quot;Fix&quot; pvp would be to create a new pvp server, the following ruleset is my opinion of the best. its only an opinion but I have played on Rallos, Tallon, and Sullon.<br />
<br />
new server, old world, kunark, velious, loy expansions ONLY. No safe zones, very very few zones with key requirements, no broken resists on gear, no goddamned ****ing brokenly easy to get massivly overpowering aa's that turn the biggest moron you have ever met into an effective pk.<br />
<br />
3 teams, teams are all/all, when you roll up your first toon you pick a team, all toons are on that team. ( I prefer the one toon per account rule but thats not the most popular veiw) all/all teams fixes the issues that the soe clowns created when they made SZ a pvp/roleplay server with the good/evil/noot set up.<br />
Teams are hard coded ala SZ.<br />
while the bazaar would be nice I will live with out it. <br />
<br />
believe it or not the pvp player base was destroyed by soe more than any other single factor. no eq isnt the best pvp game out there, neither is counterstrike but people still play that 8000 yearold piece of crap game.<br />
the pvp crowd plays the game to kill players, I know the folks at soe find this impossible to understand but the pvp crowd doesnt NEED the carrot on the end of the stick. we arent interested in spending 4000 rl hours getting our st/emp/vt/vp/cod/tactics/ep/time/vxed/whatever the **** key/flags<br />
we log in to kill people.<br />
a server with a lvl 60 cap, with a very tiny amount of zones to hide in and those are virutally unblockable as far as preventing access and a visible and atainable end game might actually bring some of the pvp crowd BACK to eq.<br />
<br />
oh yeah kill the drog vendor in gunthak.<br />
the reason for my expansion list is simple, pvp was inherently better when melees could resist root/snare but still eat a nuke or not bounce a dot 100% of the time. the ONLY reason for the loy expansion is for the bankspace and raid features that went live with it. find a way to get those in game with out loy and we dont even need that expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for fixing the existing servers. <br />
Bluebie zones, aka pok/tranq/nexus/baz<br />
remove all bind points to the newbie bind (after a 1 week warning)<br />
disable ALL spell casting in these zones, theres 0 reason for people to be allowed to sit in a safe zone and heal/buff on a pvp server.<br />
enable ALL deaths to be exp deaths, preferably triple the exp cost of a death in a normal zone. you want to run and hide in pok so you can die without your opponent getting your cash or so you can be one of those pussies who like to talk smack about getting away from a pk with your uber book clicking skills? make sure you dont have a dot on you or it could be one hell of an unresable exp death.<br />
<br />
thats it, my only fix for the existing servers. they are simply to far gone to repair effectivly at this point.<br />
well one more change, BRING BACK CASH LOOT WHAT THE ****ING **** WERE YOU THINKING REMOVING THAT FROM PVP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My information is PvP server specific.  I don't duel much so I don't have any idea how to fight a prepared opponent. (well, I have SOME idea)<br />

<br />
You miss my point, Sir. I am a level 67 Zeks Shaman - on Vallon. VZ is the only server I have ever played, and shaman is the only character I ever took above 25. My point was that most of the people I fight have at least 300 in all resists. Quite a lot of them have 400+ and some of them have 500+ Throwing Malos on those guys is p1ssing in the wind. I have 1300 or so AC with buffs but melee classes can hit me for 1300 damage in a single hit. In PvP there are only 2 spells that will land with any degree of consistency: Tears of Saryn and Epic (and anyone who stands still long enough for you to land a 9 second spell should move to a blue server heh heh). <br />
<br />
In 1 on 1 PvP against an opponent with bazaar gear (i.e resists between 120 and 240) a shaman can do pretty well. I have been reasonably successful against, for example, necromancers and warriors. But on VZ most PvP is multi person and basically the strat is Clerics first, then shaman (or sometimes shaman first, then clerics) then anything robe wearing, melees last. And frankly all you can do is run around a lot and try and get everyone malos before you get ganked. I hope that I will be able to improve my gear to get MR up to 300 or so, because I think that will make a big difference to my survivability, but right now, apart from some very specific (and unusual) situations, I do not rock in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just currious, how well to Clerics do on the PvP servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">In a hypothetical 1 v 1 situation, clerics do ok. That is to say that clerics are very hard to kill, but conversely, they don't have a lot of ability to kill either. You want to see a slow ass fight, go shaman v cleric hahahahahaha<br />
<br />
In reality, PvP is decided by 1. Gear 2. Level 3. AAs<br />
<br />
In double reality, as has been mentioned before, most PvP on the zeks is not &quot;clean&quot; 1 on 1. Its multiple players versus multiple players. In this situation clerics are usually the first to get targeted - its a case of take out the clerics (and shaman) first, because once you take their clerics are down, chances are that you are gonna win.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Heh, I am happy for you Shinerbokk. <br />
You have <br />
almost 7k hp unbuffed<br />
almost 1750AC unbuffed<br />
about 800AA<br />
36regen 17mana regen<br />
resists between 280 &amp; 400 unbuffed<br />
You are the No1. Shaman on the VZ server. You should be able to kill people!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What is important, and which you missed there, is that Shiner has rabid bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I also think that Shinerbokk - aswell as Asta - has something that many others lack... A will to fight on with no regards to how great chances you really have. Just refusing to give up or give in is the key to the most victories.<br />
<br />
Myself? Im waaaaaaaaay to lazy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You miss my point, Sir. I am a level 67 Zeks Shaman - on Vallon. VZ is the only server I have ever played, and shaman is the only character I ever took above 25. My point was that most of the people I fight have at least 300 in all resists.<br />
  No, I did not miss your point, I just continued on past it.  I think we can all agree that shaman pvp is problematic at 65+ and I am merely trying to create a discussion that could benefit someone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just currious, how well to Clerics do on the PvP servers?<br />
<br />
  On rallos, number 17 on the pk leaderboard is a cleric.<br />
<br />
  Clerics dominate in group pvp-- the group with the cleric wins, ceteris paribus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Unless there is a bard around.<br />
<br />
The group with the bard wins. ;)</div></div><hr />
