<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi gang<br />
<br />
I am sorta trying to decide which way to go for my shaman? Right now<br />
he is lvl 65 and has only 29 aa's and was trying to decide IF i should just bite the bullet and get my core aa's like: scr3,scrm1,scm3,nd3 and maybe vp3 then LR.<br />
<br />
My thinking was that if i stayed 65 i would get aa's alot faster then lvl 70, then when i got the AA's i wanted then would go 100% into lvl exp.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts, i also like 2 boxing him with my ranger who is well geared so the NEW sense fotitudew and wushi would also help him last longer lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's a tough decision because I think you do get better AA percent at 65. I would go for 70 though, because those new spells really come in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if your planning to duo I would say definitely do them at 65...<br />
<br />
The mobs that give good xp at 70 are mostly in elementals and oow and with the exception of fire, either hit too hard or have too many hp to be efficiently duoable. <br />
<br />
If you do have fire access for your toons then you can probably go to 70 without much consequence and still kite duo there. Otherwise, if your using the lower planes etc for xp stick to 65 for a bit. <br />
<br />
Duo experience in zones like NC, RCoD, and WoS really is pathetically slow at 69... I imagine its even worse at 70. Thats my oipinion at least :)<br />
<br />
For your fastests aa xp at 65 though if you do not have elemental flag then maybe try to finish the sewers/vxed/tipt. Kod Taz xp at 65 was definitely the fastest aa xp I ever got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember reading somewhere that there'a an AA break point at 68, so to speak, and wish I'd tested it out.  I've been soloing in Fire lately to grind out some new AAs but I went ahead and pushed for 70 and never tested the AA % at 68.  I'm currently getting about 11% AA/kill at level 70 at the tables or C2, was this true at 65 or 68?  If you've got access, it may be worth going to 68 so you can use the tradable OoW runes, push on to 69/70 when those spells fall into your grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say definitely 70. With level 70, you get access to three new abilities via AA: rez (very handy to get an exp cleric back to their corpse), ancestral aid (if you don't have epic 1.5, it's your only group heal option, if you DO have epic 1.5, great, you have TWO group heals, level three available at 69) and spiritual channeling (God can).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a big fan of level &gt; AA. If you have Canni 5, I would work on your leveling as fast as you can go. New spells (ie. new canni!), a larger mana pool, more HP, and access to nice AA (like the ones Glori listed) are plenty of incentive to level. Also, given a choice between two shaman, groups usually pick the higher-level one.<br />
<br />
Once you reach 69, you can zone into Riftseeker's Sanctum (a rather nerve-wracking run through Muramite Proving Grounds). A full group there nets me 4-5% AA exp. per kill, which is pretty hard to match. Kod'Taz exp. is still pretty good, though nowhere near what it was at 65.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It might be worth stopping at 68 to get AA for time saving purposes, if you get say, 17%AA/kill in Fire as opposed to the 11% I've been seeing, you could save up the 21 AA needed for CotW and SC much more quickly, 123 kills at 17%, 190 at 11%.  Then proceed to 70, get the AAs the moment you ding.  Just an example, not to mention dependent on his access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually advise level &gt;aa, but with the new spells at 69 + being no drop from not easily killed mobs, you might stop at 68. <br />
Oh, and fixed duration invis rules for the Riftseeker run :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guildmates think it's a mistake, feeling as most do that levels &gt;&gt;&gt; AA, but I think i'm going to stop at about 99% of level 68 and switch to full AA until I start regularly hunting in places where 69+ spells drop.  In my view, finishing out my healing AA, DoT AA, and some others is a better power increase than the resists/HP (but not spells) from the higher levels.  Once I have all the &quot;core&quot; pre-GoD/pre-OOW AA I want (maybe another 100 or so?), I'll probably switch levels back on to open up the spiffy new AAs opened up by level 70 (rez/HoT/etc).<br />
<br />
Unless of course my guildmates give me too much crap, in which case I'll submit to peer pressure.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just think that when there are three Shamans LFG, and they are 70, 68, and 65, the 70 will get the first invite, regardless of AAs. From the point of view of the group looking for a replacement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow<br />
<br />
I really appreciate the advice :), and now i think i will go to up my lvls especially since i completely forgot about the increase in hps AND mana.<br />
<br />
Also the New spells ARE really nice the foritude /sense and new canni would help alot more.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for the advice, i really appreciate it :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Somebody told me there is a bonus in reaching level 70 in the form of 250 hp.  Can anybody confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been holding at 99% untill I get all my spells for the next level.  <br />
<br />
being lvl 70 with only 6 lvl 66-68 spells doesn't do much good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are level 70 with 29 aa's you will not be up to what groups are expecting in a shaman and might unfairly get a reputation as sucking at your class.<br />
<br />
I'd go for 68 and then get to 100 aas then go for 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been holding at 99% untill I get all my spells for the next level. <br />
<br />
being lvl 70 with only 6 lvl 66-68 spells doesn't do much good.<br />
<br />
if you want to maximize your toons power/abilities level to 70 because-<br />
less spell resists at level 70, more mob melee misses, better mitigation, more HP because of the level, VERY nice level 70 AAs, and access to rift seekers where you can get 69 and 70 spells more easily (not to mention the xp is killer).<br />
 <br />
also in reguards to the quote: outside of ancients and the god spells, all spells up to and including level 68 can be solo obtainable with out much hardship other than time spent, but it is much easier to get a 66 spell if you are level 70 simple due to the fact that mobs droping these spells are easier to kill at a higher level.<br />
<br />
outside of canni v leveling has always been better than AAing in the minds of most people that are frequenting these boards.  i know this because this has been a common question on these boards (with a search you will see countless threads with this info.)<br />
<br />
what i did- i leveled straight through to 70 without stopping for AAs...our rez and spiritual channeling are must have AAs after canni v imo (they are level 70 only).  i got those 2 AAs before i got the group heal AA which is another must have imo /shrug.  imho VP3, RC3+, spiritual channeling, rez, group heal1+, spirit calling1+, and canni v are our 7 most powerfull AAs in terms of opening up further class utility.  can't get 2 of those without level 70.  that is the way i see things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The world definitely does shrink when you hit 70.  I was also a level &gt;&gt;&gt; AA guy and still am, but there are some situations for some folks where that rule won't apply.<br />
<br />
I think a guy who just duo boxes in odd spots with a shaman with only 29 AA might be those situations.  You need about 100 AA to get the core ones.  I'd think hard about leveling to 68/69, and then getting the core AA you want before dinging 70.<br />
<br />
One of the best things you can do to help yourself in this situation is make sure you have Bane.  I'm startled at the number of shaman who don't get Bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">70 gets you some amazing AAs and straight numeric bonuses that you do not see but which are clearly there - you resist more, get resisted less, get hit less and so on.<br />
<br />
Of the AAs you listed only VP is not a lesser version of just leveling. So grinding AAs for LR is not worth it compared to levels. Grinding AAs for VP and other abilities you can not get merely by leveling might.<br />
<br />
Ok, that is for the straight up &quot;what gives me the most power over the next level/next 5 AAs?&quot; answer. If you are interested in long term benefits of gaining AAs at a sweet spot it gets more difficult. Personally I don't think it is worth it to stay lower level to gain more % per kill. Odds are you will be getting experience at least as fast at higher levels due to being able to kill the same things faster/for less mana or to kill similar things that are higher level at more or less the same speed.<br />
<br />
Depending on what zones you have access to and how much you duo/solo/group that may vary some. Generally speaking though I do not know personally anyone who has gained AAs faster at lower levels. There may be the odd person who did but overall AAs come faster the higher level you get.<br />
<br />
Now after all this rambling my advice is: If you have any game altering abilities that fit your playstile (Canni 5, Spiritcall, VP, Radiant cure) left get them now, maybe while having a little experience going to levels. Then level to 70, possibly stopping to get your 9th spell gem along the way.<br />
<br />
Alternatively set your experience to 50/50 and get some AAs while leveling. I recommend getting new abilities rather then numeric bonuses. If you are going to take the scenic route (slow and probably not optimal) you might as well get enjoyment out of it and new abilities are usually more fun then slight number increases to old ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's easy to say &quot;Go the level route&quot; when you already have 300+ AA's<br />
Alot of the people here telling you to go straight to 70 have been 65 for a long time, and as a result have already Maxxed their AA's. I'm not so sure they would be willing to give them all away just to reach 70. Do what YOU feel like doing. There is no right or wrong way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Do what YOU fell like doing. There is no right or wrong way...&quot;<br />
<br />
totally agree, it is really up to the individual.  he did ask for advice though /shrug.<br />
<br />

<br />
the way you state that is not really right imo.  i have over 500 AA, i kind of know what AA are importaint and what aren't importaint.  i am level 70, i kind of have a good idea of the benifits and losses that come along with leveling to 70.  most of the shaman left in game and who have posted here remember trying to decide if they should level or AA.  personally- i got several AAs before leveling all the way to 65, i look back and wish i could kick myself in the ass for not leveling straight up (outside of canni V.) =p<br />
most of us were talking from experiance when we posted here.  i remember trying to get wisdom gear at one point,  i remeber switching to HP/AC gear, i remember lossing my corpse in EF as a noob and some very nice guy helping me find it (i still remember his name,) i remember dieing behind that waterfall in the zone past quenos (cuz i had no clue what zone i was in or where i was,) i remember what it was like to solo with dots that broke root, i remember what it was like to have to heal with chloroblast and no torpor, i remember useing Scale of Wolf and not understanding what the hell the spell actually did, i remember when i thought 50 AA was a ****ton, ect... <br />
would i give up 500 AA for level 70? well not really, but when you analize that question in depth it is an obserd question (with the stockpile of AA i have i could have leveled several toons to 70).  i can tell you at level 70 AA comes faster for me than it did at 65 /shrug.<br />
<br />
i didn't mean to jump on you lachdanoncoldpaw, but that last quote i linked made me feel like you were saying not only me, but the other posters here have didn't really know what they are talking about (or can't remember that &quot;long&quot; ago.)  perhaps that was not really your intention, but that is what it came off as when i read it.<br />
<br />
i do agree with do what you feel like doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wasn't trying to imply that you didn't know what you were talking about, as im sure your trying your best to inform everyone to what is the best overall way to play. But in lue of the fact that you need to win rolls on 29 Rune drops, just to get your spells, kinda rubs me extremely wrong. So even though I might be 70, I might only have 7 of my 29 spells. I personally would rather have VP3 and RC3 before reaching 67, because I know that I will be a more effective shaman with those in my arsenal. To me AA's are a sure thing, I know I can get &quot;X&quot; ablitiy with  &quot;Y&quot; amount of time invested. Whereas with levels, im relying on the luck of my dice to further advance my spellbook. <br />
<br />
I'm of the mindset, 66, aa's, 67, aa's, 68, aa's, etc...<br />
<br />
But as I said before, Do what you feel...<br />
And im sorry if I came off as hostile, it wasn't my intent...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree that it depends on the person.<br />
<br />
Stopped at 60-61 to get canniV; was very happy with that :) <br />
<br />
I goof around now at 65 and don't plan on going higher til I max &quot;reinforcement&quot;, quick-buff and probably vp. So far I am very happy with each level of spell casting reinforcement; solo or grouped, life just gets much easier with it :D<br />
<br />
ps: i did get the extra spell gem as well-like that a LOT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How well geared is your ranger (Elem, Time, Qvic)?<br />
<br />
Depending on that is the deciding factor on where to stop.  I would probably say that 69 would be the lvl to stop at, not 70, for grinding AA.  Why?  Well there will be times when you cannot get a group, I know this happens.  In these cases I can go to WoS (south of wall) or PoE and pull mobs that are lvl 64 and duo them.  Since they are lvl64 you still get the 5 lvl xp bonus.  But having Breath of Trushar, all PoP healing AAs and SCRM + Eterniostrum buff focus makes it much simpler.  If anything, lvl 68 should be your goal first.  The new heal and canni mack so much difference.</div></div><hr />
