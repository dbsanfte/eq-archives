<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been relying on horse for quite a while, so I wanted to get this straight:<br />
<br />
When cannidancing, how much time after your health ticks up (from sitting regen) should one remain sitting to ensure that the apparent mana gain is really there on the server, and not just a phantom on the client?  Also, why does health tick twice every 6 seconds?  Is the spells tick different form the med/sitting health regen tick?<br />
<br />
It's almost a shame can4 isn't a 3.0 sec spell, as those can be hasted faster than 2.5 sec.<br />
<br />
My question about phantom vs real med ticks is also apparent if you don't cast any spells but simply sit for 1 sec to get the visible mana tick, then run for 5 seconds, then sit ... especially with a lower level character or taking off all your +mana/wis items ... you cast a spell and it appear to use a ton of extra mana - really the server is just updating you with its opinion on how much mana you have, and eliminating your deluded phantom mana you thought your dancing was giving you</div></div><hr />

I'll try it.  I know that a short quick turn has helped me with the stop, cast, move kite routine (although I've chalked that up to the extra step forcing me to wait a fraction of a second longer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The turn help syncs to sync the client and server.  As when your running in a straight line the client/Server tends to try to save bandwidth and not update/sync with each other near as much.  Soon as you change directions turn/look left right.  They resync with your new current heading.  I'll help when you run / sit, canni / sit, or run / cast but making sure the server knows you have stopped running and are now sitting / casting.  Besides doing a little spin while canni Dancing helps you keep aware of your surroundings and is never a bad idea.  Dont know how many times I have caught that mob trying to sneak up on us as I am doing that little spin while canniing.  I still do it even when I am on my mount.</div></div><hr />
