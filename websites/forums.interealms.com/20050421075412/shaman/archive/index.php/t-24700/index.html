Form of the spirit hawk... sounds really cool.<br />
<br />
I can find tons of stat debuffs in the spell list. Will stat debuffs have any effect in PvM? When I look at cripple I'm still not sure if it does anything to a mob beside a small AC debuff.<br />
<br />
Comparing both I see more healing power in the mystic spell list (direct heals / wards) and more debuffs in the defiler list. Hard to belive that both will be equal good healers.</div></div><hr />

I'm really torn though whether to go Defiler or Mystic. To generalize I guess Mystic gets better heals and Defiler gets better debuffs.  I'm thinking there will be a lot less Iksar Mystics as you'd have to do the betrayal quest but that's probably not the best reason to choose a class either. <br />

Glaani of GukYou get all spells awarded to you, they're just at the App1 level. You purchase upgrades from there.<br />

<br />
Also, some spells you get at certain bubble dings.  For example, you may see some lists state something like:<br />
<br />
10 - spell x<br />
10.4 - ability y<br />
10.6 - spell z<br />
<br />
This means that when you ding level 10 you get spell x, when you hit 40% into level 10 you get ability y, and then at 60% into level 10 you get spell z.  All abilities and spells just appear in your spellbook or your hotkey bars if you have room. :)</div></div><hr />

I received this as an Adept I drop in Blackburrow (off of a scrawny gnoll  by the entrance) a few hours after posting this question. =)  <br />
<br />
Another question: &quot;15 - Grey Wind - Cold DD + slow&quot; --- I thought I had read elsewhere that this was a snare, not a slow.  Can anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

From my experience, Grey Wind is just a cold nuke.  It leaves no debuff icon which indicates that it does not have a lasting effect.  Also, it seems to get resisted a LOT and doesn't really do much more damage than app2 smite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jumblies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grey Wind is supposed to have a slight snare.... not slow.  (Slows the movement rate of target vs. Slows the attack rate of target etc...)</div></div><hr />

Scribe in Qeynos Harbor has this spell for around 14silver.<br />
<br />
Not sure where in Freeport.  Would check close the guild maker guy there if you are of evil race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Udor's Spirit of the Hawk must be purchased from a vendor? Wow, I didn't think any spells had to be purchased.<br />
<br />
Why is this one so special?<br />
<br />
What does it do?<br />
<br />
Are there any others that have to be purchased?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My understanding is that certain &quot;flavor&quot; spells (spells that don't have any real game impact other then to look cool) have to be purchased.  It looks like spirit of the hawk falls into this category.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you fly?<br />
<br />
What does it do man?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
I turned off Exp at level 18.99 so I could farm Vermin's Snye a little bit tonite, but I'm so tempted to turn it back on and rush to level 20 lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know the Ranger pet hawk spell needs to be purchased, and I would imagine the Druid illusion spell also would be included in this line.<br />
<br />
If these are the only spells i have to buy from vendor, I will be very happy indeed.<br />
<br />
Now, if the player vendor prices came down.... :D<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Can Hawk form be cast on others? Nope  :( <br />
<br />
Can you fly? about 2ft off the ground<br />
<br />
What does it do man?!?!?!?  it allows you to be smaller in tight spaces.<br />
it gives eb cause you fly above the water.  no safe fall though, which bear form might have.<br />
<br />
To use this with bear form, cast hawk first, then bear.  You will stay in hawk form then, but get the stats for the bear spell.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">oh golly Bear form has no safe fall..<br />

Thyr said it; all the fluff stuff is vendor bought.  Think it was just Hawk, Badger, and Great Stag.<br />
<br />
That level 50 Sparklie spell-thing, though... I dunno if it's &quot;fluff&quot; or what, but it wasn't granted at 50 as far as I know, and I never saw it for purchase on any vendors.  Will be curious to know if it's in, so when someone hit's 50, lemme know... and what the hell does it do? =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you have a free hotbar slot for it? I'm guessing you hit level 8 at the same time that you became a citizen (which I believe is when you get the &quot;Gate&quot; ability) and that Call to Qeynos might have taken your last open slot? I'd check your spellbook (&quot;k&quot; key) and see if Revive is in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Also, Revive might be a &quot;mid level&quot; spell  . . .  some spells come to you in the middle of levels instead of right at the start.  Not sure if Revive is one of those, but do keep your eyes out for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Spiritual Replenishment is level 28, NOT level 25. I know, I just did the entire level 25 and did not get it. *sigh*.<br />
<br />
Ancestral ward is the 60% level 26 spell, Cry of the Ancients is the  &quot;ding 26&quot; spell. Grr again....</div></div><hr />

Since I dont' see a shrink in the picture, this is the best i can do.  Bear form is just to big for the likes of Stormhold or VS type locations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yea - that's as good a use as any.  You'll need to stack it with Bear form in order to get the statistical benefits.</div></div><hr />

Everyone gets a &quot;for fun&quot; spell at 20 that has no real benefit. My Warlock friend can turn people in his group into toads. We get an illusion that lets us annoy group mates with constant *flap flap* and *screech screech* sounds. :)<br />

<br />
At level 19 and being on the Freeport side of things, I have yet to fight a mob that runs! Are there mobs around FP that do that? I was beginning to wonder what the point of my scout having a snare was!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I am cursed with mobs running, its a bug with our Wraith Form. Some times the last mob in the encounter will run like mad once all its buddies are dead. Every now and again all the mobs will take off for their lives.<br />
The fear portion of that form is supposed to only work if you attack a mob and even then it breaks if you do any damage once that mob starts to flee.</div></div><hr />

Damn frigging dangerous. Tank ended up chasing mob into a bunch of aggro mobs and we all wiped.<br />

I hate fear spells. I never use Phantasm because of the fear component. The last thing my group needs when I'm generating hate is to have all the mobs run away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't use Phantasm often, and when I do it's more of a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card when I sense a wipe coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Both of these lists are wrong again.<br />
<br />
At level 28 I got another worthless specialized cure spell, Arcane something. Woo. Not.<br />
<br />
At 40% into 28, I got Miasma. I am told Wards of Shadow is at 80%.<br />
<br />
Miasma at level 28.... so far.... eh. Keeps resisting even at adept 1. I'm sticking with contagion for another level at least until it stops sucking.<br />

Best quote of the day:<br />
<br />
Zorander: &quot;Harvyst, you're a bird!&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Yes, I'm quite the chick.&quot;<br />

It's been awhile since I spooked someone by being a bird, I can't wait to be a beaver :) Ooooh, the puns I have lined up for that one!<br />
