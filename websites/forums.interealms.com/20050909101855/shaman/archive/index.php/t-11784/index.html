Its one of the graphics files in the custom directory. Also related to the Animations xml file.<br />
<br />
Unless you know what to look for you won;t be able to fix the problem yourself.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem after a patch and had to track down which graphic file it was and do some minor editing to fix it, along with patching in the changes to the animations file.</div></div><hr />
