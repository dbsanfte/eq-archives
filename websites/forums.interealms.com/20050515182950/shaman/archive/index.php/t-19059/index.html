<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that I am in the swing of things and have been able to do multiple Adventures in all of the themes, I feel that I can comment on what it takes to win EVERY time.  I have had 1 loss since I purchased LDoN and that was the first adventure I was ever on we backed out right after the first pull when the Cleric got swamped on a very weird/bugged pull.  Anyway, If you Have a Chanter/Bard, Shaman/Cleric, Pally/Warrior/SK, and any three other classes you will win.  As an example I put together a group last night all 65's of course.  Shaman (me), Cleric, Mage, Necro, Druid, Pally.  Our mission was to kill 60 Creatures in the 90 minutes.  We encountered 2 Named mobs in the adventure one at the very begining within in 10 minutes and one at the end 2nd to last kill.  We finished with 23 minutes to spare.  This was out of the EF camp.  One Tak adeventure I was in group had a Chanter, Shaman(me), Cleric, Monk, Wizzy and Pally and finished with almost 40 minutes to go.  So I guess the real point of this is Have a class that can slow, a class that can heal, one to take dmg, one to put out dmg, and any other 2 you want to put in there and you will win IF you are on a normal level.  Hard setting is not much different other then have a cleric as healer or 2 others, (ie. Druid and Shaman).  A perfect group doesn't exsist as each theme is different.  In EF most everything is undead so a Necro can mez, pacify, etc.. no need for a chanter at all.  On the Ruj Hills EC Adventure mobs are spread so far apart that again parking with root has seemed to be a very reliable way of crowd control.  So use good judgement and you will always win, minus a bugged pull or something else beyound your control.  Have a good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a quick note, on guk adventures, you do need CC, either a bard, chanter, or 65 necro with mez undead, those mobs come packed in tight and furious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah sorry if I wasn't clear in the fact that CC is needed in some way on every mission weather you have to root(ghetto mez) them or mez in some fashion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Off tanking (even with non-tank melees or pets) is also a viable method for LDoN (normal only ;) ) as the mobs don't hit overly hard. But requires, that the healer knows his stuff and is alert during the whole run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to vote for Miragul's, but that's probably just because it's in my backyard. I'm always partial to tundra\ice environments.  :D <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I can't stand Guk. As soon as I max out points in Guk I doubt I'll ever LFA there again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a barb so I had to vote miraguls =)<br />
<br />
Mistmoore Catacombs<br />
Not bad usually. A good portion of undeads usually too. Good for pally/necros and even clerics. <br />
<br />
Takish-Hiz<br />
Tends towards a pain because of lots of doors with mobs right behind them. Lots of summoned mobs tho and druids/rangers/mages love it. <br />
<br />
Deepest Guk<br />
Least favorite zone. Most interesting but too much up and down, water, door ways and such that just combine to make it a very generally irritating zone to do. Also a fair number of chanter/clerics mobs for casters. Also has it's share of undead.<br />
<br />
Miragul's Menagerie<br />
Descently spread out on most maps altho on some maps the mobs tend to blend into the map. Seem to have a fair number of meleers.<br />
<br />
Rujarkian Hills<br />
Fairly spread out mobs in nice long halls. Makes pulls easier. Occational intersections that can be crowded but thats it. Only problem seems to be the occational sowed runner from all the shaman around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guk is the worst.<br />
<br />
Miragul's can be a pain with wall agro with some of the side rooms.<br />
<br />
The rest are all about the same.<br />
<br />
Perfect group?  No such thing.  I did an LDON with a wizard, 2 druids, 2 shaman, and a warrior.  We killed 57 and had 40+ minutes to spare.  I've also done it with 1 cleric, 2 rogues, 1 ranger, 1 paladin, and a shaman... and we rocked the house... had like 60+ minutes to spare on a collection...<br />
<br />
It's all about knowing what to do to maximize the group of people you have.</div></div><hr />
