Unfortunately we couldn't patch out new pet data because of the changes for Mage/Necro/Beastlord pets that are in transition at the moment. The next patch is scheduled for about 2 weeks from now I believe and it *should* be all set by then. <br />
Also, if you have a shaman on test with this ability it should be functioning correctly now, so the fix is complete, just not patched live.<br />

New Shaman Heals on Test! (http://69.93.210.2:8080/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20323&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=2) <br />
<br />
Hey gang,<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn’t post about this earlier. I was waiting for the numbers to be on test server, which I thought was going to be a lot sooner then today, but anyway…<br />
<br />
The new spell parameters should put shaman heals on the same ratio that they were for Planes of Power spells:<br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 2750<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 1750<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 1300<br />
<br />
Comparatively for HP/Second:<br />
Supernal Light: 100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
With the new Daluda:<br />
<br />
Holy Light: 3275<br />
Sylvan Infusion: 2100<br />
Daluda’s Mending: 1550<br />
<br />
for the same comparative HP/second as the PoP heals:<br />
Supernal Light: 100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Daluda's Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
Likewise, the Quiescence and Breath of Trushar changes should make the HoT balance equal from PoP to Gates between Clerics and Shaman.<br />
<br />
Still looking at the slow mitigation concerns in several gates zones.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry I didn’t get this info out earlier, and for letting the bad mana cost on Breath of Trushar go live. There’s really no excuse for that blunder.<br />
<br />

Brenlo, Ryan? Question about March 10 change to BoT (http://69.93.210.2:8080/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20259) <br />
<br />
Folks you already knew about this change as it showed up on Lucy before we began this dialogue. This is not part of the work that Rytan is looking into now for your healing. This was something already planned and locked in. It would have been far too soon to have implemented changes to your heals in the 2 days since Rytan visited. <br />
<br />
I know that it has been a long road for you, but I would like to ask you all for just a little more patience.<br />

Brenlo does listen, and even responded to my email - please read. (http://69.93.210.2:8080/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20190) <br />
<br />
Just to expand a bit on what Brenlo said:<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
The frequency of slow immune NPCs in Gates is also being looked at, and there is the possibility of some adjustment in certain areas if we find it necessary. Although this will likely only apply to a few specific areas where the concentration is especially high.<br />
<br />

Some news for you all.<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients, apparently the description is incorrect and we will be refunding any AA's used to purchase it. It is intended to grant HP and not endurance.<br />
<br />
I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />
<br />
The team is also looking to shift the slow immune creatures about, in some Gates zones, so that there are no concentrations of them in one area. <br />
<br />
I will pass along more information as I get it.<br />

I have asked the designer who implemented this ability and I am awaiting an answer. I hope to have one for you folks tomorrow.<br />

Ah well I am sure I will always mind the ads from Yantis, but I will get over it. ( at least until I figure out what a shaman is) =P<br />

More on the &quot;combine&quot; fiasco... (http://69.93.210.2:8080/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20185) <br />
<br />
Hello there,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the trouble you had. I am not sure why you were not assisted, and I will ask around. <br />
<br />
As an aside, this issue should be fixed on test and patched live on the 10th. So at the very least you will be able to finish the quest then.<br />

<br />
In a perfect world I would know what the designers have planned for the shaman class. Unfortunately this is not a perfect world. I know what my idea of a shaman is, I know the role they play in the game, I do not know what is in our spell guys head as far as the direction he sees the class moving in. I will try to find out what that direction is and pass it along. <br />
<br />
As for concerns, the first I will pass along is healing. I will see if this is what is intended or if there was an oversight. As soon as I know, you will know. <br />
<br />
Keep ironing out these thoughts and ideas and I will keep reading this thread.<br />
<br />

Not forgotten, just haven't been able to patch out pet data yet. Probably won't be until the next scheduled patch if I had to guess.<br />

The damage output and the HP of the pet was mistakenly set too low and should be fixed shortly. Very sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
