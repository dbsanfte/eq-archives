<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to hear that Jharassik, but you should know you're just making your life harder than it needs to be. AAxp is way easier at 65 than at 60-64 for several reasons.<br />
1) groups want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
2) raids want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
3) More powerful spells mean mobs die smoother, faster, and present less of a challenge<br />
4) with the revamp of the exp system, shamans can solo lvl 51+ mobs for blue-con exp while easily farming stuff. <br />
5) Quiescence makes SO much possible, where Torpor did not. For instance you can Q your dog and he tanks very well in places like CT. This gives you additional options. Malos also really helps vs. uber resistant mobs, we're talking -15 additional debuff resists here! Not trivial! That's like having a personal OOS bard along! <br />
<br />
That's about it . . . there's no reason anymore not to level to 65. None whatsoever. <br />
I recommend you just do it and start saving to buy Q and malos. Then get BoS and the rest of your spells. That will keep you occupied for quite some time. Once finished, you'll have acquired so many AA you won't believe it! <br />
<br />
Finally, people don't recruit for groups based on the AA levels of a player. It's /who all 65 shaman<br />
remember that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to avoid hijacking the &quot;kudos to SOE&quot; thread, I'd like to say that I'm going for MGB and Canni5 now to make raiding easier on me.  I'm almost there, it hasn't taken a lot of time, and I've never, to my knowledge, been turned away from a group due to my levels.  I have, however, been not as effective as I could be on raids due to not having MGB and/or Canni5.  <br />
<br />
BUT I think both routes are valid.  Just depends what you're trying to accomplish/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never, to my knowledge, been turned away from a group due to my levels. <br />
<br />
You may not have been turned away from groups but you have definately not been considered for many groups in BOT &amp; HOH where the XP is better than tier 1 or POV/POS.<br />
<br />
At 65 I almost always get a grp within 10 mins of looking in BOT &amp; HOH which I mostly ONLY EVER got invites to pre-65 during off-peak hours.<br />
<br />
AAXP in BOT &amp; HOH flies so fast you are missing out by grinding AAXP before leveling to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know what to say except get to 65 so you can get groups in bot (or similar).  Maybe things are different on other servers, but on Quellious, no 65 no tier 3+ group for the most part.  In an efficient bot group you make an aa every 1 hr 5 min - 1 hr 30 min and have a decent chance at picking up a spec/rune or other item worth 10-30k.  Also, folks tend to know how to play, tanks are better, chanters are better, clerics are better. How much more convincing do you need?  Also, from my experience, and I didn't believe it either when I was in my low 60's, a 65 shaman with all spells and 100aa's or so is 100% more powerful than a low 60's shaman. It is also more enjoyable to play because more skill is involved if you are in a fast pulling rocking and rolling group where you can show your stuff. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do what's more fun for you.  Some people like working on aa's pre-65, and good for them.  However, if you want the &quot;most efficient&quot; approach to it, get to 65, and then work on aa's, hands down.<br />
<br />
MGB is not a useful skill if you're only 60 -62, and you've got a 65 shaman around.  Stamina is a 64 buff, and group focus is a 65 buff.  People want those on raids, not the lower level stuff.  Can5 is nice, it's probably a tossup whether it's worth it to get can5 before levelling to 65 (I got it pre-pop, so no personal experience).<br />
<br />
I also have to agree with the levels for pickup groups thing.  When I'm in a group, if someone goes lfg who is not 65, they have about a 1/10 chance of getting into my group.  You may not have been turned down, but how many people have done /who all shaman lfg, saw no 65's, then went to look for a beastlord, enc, or even bard to slow for them, just because they're 65.<br />
I'd agree with the above there, I very rarely wait more than 10-15 mins for a pickup group if I want one, and I'm always getting tells asking if I want a group even if I'm not lfg and doing something else.  Which is great for making fun of monk friends, while they complain about being lfg for hours, you can say &quot;Yeah I know what you mean, I've turned down 5 group invites in half an hour!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah have to say 65&gt;AA. Spells alone would be sufficient to drive that conversation. AA is nice, don't get me wrong, but what good is MGB if you can't cast Fo7 or group boar?<br />
<br />
As far as hunting... Things that were kinda tough with pre 64 dots became easy. The key here is Blood and Breath do NOT have a DD component, which mean no root break, faster kills, less down time, and overall more xp faster and more safely!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had to wrestle with this, chose AA's, then changed my mind after getting MC2+2 banked AA's.  Why?  All the reasons cited here, plus <br />
<br />
  *) Not eligible to roll on guild runes unless 65<br />
  *) I wanna be 65 dammit!<br />
  *) Easier to get from 63 to 65 than from MC2 to CannV plus MGB.<br />
<br />
I've already pushed from level 63.12 to level 64.22 since making that decision, and that was only about two weeks ago.  Definately worth it to me.<br />
<br />
When I ding 65 I'll only have 4 AA's to MC3 and 5 more to Cann V.  Woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not sure that the level 65 &gt; AAs approach applies to everyone.  Before the exp level expansion a few patches ago it was a no-brainer.  I am guildless with no PoP flags.  It made perfect sense for me to stop at 61 and start into AAs.  Now I am not so sure.<br />
<br />
I am still a casual player and I 2-box most of the time due to the fact that I usually only play an hour or so at a time.  The 61+ spells are all available in the Bazaar.  Some at decent prices, some still quite expensive.  With the exp level expansion, it is quite possible to get to 65 and still have decent places to hunt.<br />
<br />
I am just not sure right now what I want to do.  For now, I will stick with AA for a while.  I am about 15% away from MC1.  I may pound out CanV and then go back to exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the exp changes so that mobs stay blue longer and the cheaper prices on 65 spells, I have finally decided to level up and am now 64.5 and have all my 65 spells in the bank.  I did a lot of aaxp at 53 and a good chunk more at 61 ( 79 total aaxp now ) and would say what is most efficient is situational and depends on play style.<br />
<br />
I spend more then 95% of my time solo so most of the arguments about group desirability are meaningless.  I also have no interest in joining another guild.<br />
<br />
What is best is to evaluate your own situation, access to spells, play stile and entertainment value and then do whatever give you the most pleasure.<br />

<br />
<br />
Possibly for you, however I get HoH and BoT groups, and I get them easily. Maybe I just have a good reputation?<br />
<br />
I'll address Land here since i didn't pay attention to that other post enough to see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) groups want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
2) raids want 65 shamans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60-64 shamans.<br />
3) More powerful spells mean mobs die smoother, faster, and present less of a challenge<br />
4) with the revamp of the exp system, shamans can solo lvl 51+ mobs for blue-con exp while easily farming stuff.<br />
5) Quiescence makes SO much possible, where Torpor did not. For instance you can Q your dog and he tanks very well in places like CT. This gives you additional options. Malos also really helps vs. uber resistant mobs, we're talking -15 additional debuff resists here! Not trivial! That's like having a personal OOS bard along! <br />
<br />
<br />
1) Again, I get groups just fine and dandy, even in BoT and HoH. In fact I spend almost all of my exp time in HoH these days.<br />
2) I am not in a raiding guild, not everyone is. I tried that route with my warrior but eventually wanted to relax more often and retired him to play my shaman. I am the raidleader of my current guild, and I must say for the mobs we go after my level is more than adequate(vindi-ish/HoT level).<br />
3) Ok, you got me here. Better spells do make life easier. The catch is my spells right now make life pretty easy already.<br />
4) Yes, I love the exp revamp. Even with the revamp however, most of the spots I enjoy soloing/farming(sebilis) started light blue at 61. I solo disco often enough when there, and 80% or better of it is light blue to me in 62.<br />
5) Yes, I would love quies and malos. I don't even have torpor/malo yet, however stoicism really cushions that blow...and to be honest I haven't run across a real NEED for malo yet, even in tier 3 pop.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons not to level to 65 still. a couple spells that are wants but not must haves do not mean as much to me as the better aaxp I have at 62. <br />
<br />
I'm by no means staying 62 forever, but I do intend to stay 62 until i knock out a good 60 or so aa's to get scrm/mgb/canni5/spirit call/rc. Those aa's will make life easier too, just like better spells. In some cases, they will make life MUCH better than the spells..and they'll make those spells much more powerful right from the start.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up Land, but I already know the difference in aaxp between my current level and 65. It's actually why I made the choice to stop for more than run/regen 3, I've had a firsthand look at rushing to be a 65 warrior instead of doing aaxp at a lower level :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I stopped at level 61 and got Cana 5. I've never regretted it. But once I had Cana 5, I pushed on up to level 65 before getting any other AA's. I've got 117 AA's now, and probably wont be happy until I have well over 200, but Cana 5 is the one that has made the biggest difference. <br />
<br />
The next largest beneficial change with AA's is having all the AA's (Quick Buff 3 + Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery) to make Quie a 3 sec cast for that heals for 1800 to 2100 HP. Its an amazing tool to have. Add in Spell Casting Mastery 3 and a Mana Preservation 4 item, and it just gets even better.<br />
<br />
As for groups... Yes, 65 matters. Nobody asks a shaman thats not level 65 to join their group if there is a 65 shaman or enchanter available. And people learn fast which players have lots of AA's and will ask them to group over someone that has very few AA's or someone that they dont know. Would you want a shaman whose Focus of the Seventh lasts 80 mins or the one that makes it last 136 mins? 36 min Talisman of Alacrity or 61 mins? 63 min Boar and Wrulan or 107 mins? And so on. Levels matter greatly. AA's matter less, but having the right ones sure is noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a little surprised at the lack of responses from folks that have stopped and worked on aa's prior to 65. Maybe there are only a few of us... <br />
<br />
At any rate, here's my take on it. Do what you want! It's your monthly fee, it's your character and it's definitely your choice. I, for one, have stopped at 61 to work on Canni V. I may also work on nd3 before moving on. I haven't decided. <br />
<br />
&lt;65 and groups. I'm sure if I were 62 and tried to get a group in one of the open tier 3 zones, I would find it hard to get a group. As it is, I turn down at least one group just about every day I log on. There are other zone besides the tier 3's and shamans are often needed (or at least wanted) in those zones. It's even possible that because so many people have raced to 65, those of us that have stopped to smell the roses have an easier time finding groups in lower tier/non-pop zones. <br />
<br />
Our small band of misfits spends about 20% of our time in POP. The  other 80% of it has been spent in new and re-vamped zones. We're currently working on rings for everyone in charb, but have explored most of veksar, nadox, torrigans, hates fury, acrylia, etc. We're anxiously awaiting the new Lost Dungeons of Norrath. We may never see a pop zone once that goes live (assuming it's as advertised at least). <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say (long story, longer) is, there's more to eq than racing to 65 and spending 99% of your time in pop zones. Explore new zones, go back to the revamped one, help a friend's alt do his/her epic in one day. If you're fairly new to EQ, you may have missed a ton of content in the old world, kunark and perhaps even in velious. <br />
<br />
Bah, this is 4 times longer than I planned. :) <br />
<br />
Have fun. It's a game.</div></div><hr />
