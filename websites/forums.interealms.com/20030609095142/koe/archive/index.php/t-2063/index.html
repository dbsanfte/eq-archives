<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please pardon the sp errors and inconsistencies.<br />
<br />
<br />
	The muffled hiss of the dagger being drawn from it's scabbard rang true through<br />
the clear night's chill air.  True enough to Helec's sensitive ears, as strolled through the<br />
shadows of  an alley far removed from the central section of town.  This area was by far<br />
the worst part of town, yet Helec felt perfectly comfortable strolling through it's dim<br />
thoroughfares.  So comfortable that he barely noted the rocks shifting noisily underfoot,<br />
but who could miss that smell. <br />
	The smell of pig sweat had initially assaulted him soon after entering the long<br />
alleyway.  As he continued, step by step, the stench became stronger.  His elven senses<br />
had paid off again.  No human would be able to detect this scent  this well at six feet,<br />
much less sixty.<br />
	Around the next corner a pig faced creature, much larger than the approaching elf,<br />
shifted his grip ever so slightly on his dagger to a more comfortable position.  The dagger<br />
itself more closely resembled a short sword  but served  well as a dagger for the gigantic<br />
beast.<br />
	A gleam of intelligence that was uncharacteristic for such a breed, sparkled in his<br />
eye, as he bobbed up and down rhythmically timing the approaching steps.  A patience<br />
gained through past reward  allowed the long seconds to pass by without effort.  Yes this<br />
would be an easy kill.  It was well rehearsed, not to mention the numerous others that had<br />
fallen to his blade using this very same technique.<br />
	Still bobbing up and down, the orc listened to the grind as his victim plodded along<br />
on the gravel he had spread earlier.  Nearer elf, nearer...ready...set...  As the footsteps<br />
reached  the corner the orc lashed out at the elven heart with the rhythm of a well<br />
practiced performance. Striking only empty space.<br />
	The footsteps continued past the orcish assassin nonchalantly padding into the<br />
distance.  He looked around, dumbfounded.  Brak tried  to gather his wits and begin to<br />
follow the invisible quarry but behind him another set of footsteps approached noisily<br />
echoing through the darkness of the alley.  The orc whirled to the ready wanting to see<br />
who was playing tricks on him this night.  For the same one would die.  Ghost or no<br />
ghost, this was definitely not the way it was supposed to be. <br />
	 His thoughts raced as he saw a diminutive black cloaked figure step out of the<br />
shadows and stop.  The hood pulled low over the face of the stranger.  Quickly the orc<br />
realized that this was no stranger. This elf was his bounty.  Helec Delion.  He had never<br />
met the rogue elf even when he was a guild member.  He towered over the elf by two feet<br />
or more.  The elf said nothing but ended a simple emptyhanded gesture and gave one of<br />
his rings a twist.  Eerily the footsteps that walked into the distance ended their traipse<br />
simultainiously as the elf stopped. <br />
	Seconds passed as they both sized up the situation and their reputable opponent. <br />
Grak was definately an expert in the art of deqaling death but he lacked the finesse and<br />
grace that was Helec's strongest point.  It struck Helec as being odd that the guild would<br />
appoint Grak to the task of murdering an elf that had seen his style and had even trained<br />
aginst him.  It was true enough that Grak's hatred for elves and Helec in particular would<br />
be astrong weapon for the orc.<br />
 With a sudden roar Grak charged with a speed that belied his great size and quickly<br />
covered the spans of ground between himself  and the quiet and calm target of his<br />
frustration.<br />
	With ears laid back in a rage the orc swooped in for a quick kill as his dagger<br />
began it's decent upon the elven opponent.  Helec knowing the grave danger of the<br />
moment  suspected the typical orcish attack.  No creature, regardless of  intelligence could<br />
avoid it's true nature too very long, especially Grak.<br />
	With smooth finesse Helec dove under the attackers swing and inside the defenses. <br />
Unshaken he landed and rolled putting a good distance between the two again.  He was up<br />
again at the ready, this time with two daggers of his own, both dripping with blood.  The<br />
wild eyed orc ended his downward thrust and slowly turned to the grinning elf.  The<br />
tension mounted as the silence was drowned out in the orc's ears by his furiously pounding<br />
heartbeat.  Knowing he had been cut was bad enough but to add insult to injury was the<br />
fact Helec had done it so easily and remained unscathed.<br />
	The crimson began to pour and the orc suddenly felt weak as he groped at the neat<br />
line that had been drawn across his throat.  Then he felt it.  Poison. His blood coursed<br />
through his veins carrying it along. He felt numb.  Losing control of his muscles he<br />
dropped his weapon to the ground. why weren't his arms responding.  His guts burned<br />
with an intense fire.  Grak looked up and saw the elf still smiling as he cleaned his daggers. <br />
Helec was eyeing the orc.  There was no honor here amongst the shadows.  After all he<br />
was just doing his duty or was he just following his nature.  Knowing there was an open<br />
reward on Helec's head maybe the orcish assasssin was trying to collect on his rival's<br />
bounty.  Helec could understand.  But didn't.<br />
	With a deft flick of the wrist Helec launched one of the small daggers and a few<br />
moments later he bent over the dead orc to pull the knife from  Grak's eye socket.    He at<br />
least saved his would-be assassin a great deal of pain and torment from either the poison<br />
or bleeding to death.  As he wiped his remaining blade clean he doubted that the orc<br />
would have done the same.</div></div><hr />
