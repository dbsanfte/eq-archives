<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, slightly irked by something that just happened to me in game.<br />
<br />
Been camping the Enraged Soulstealer for the last couple of nights, up until this evening about 6 hours in total.<br />
<br />
So, there I was camping it again tonight, knowing that I've got no work tomorrow so I can stay up as long as I need.<br />
<br />
After about three hours, it spawns. I didn't realise the size of the aggro range on it, and as soon as it spawned it started casting on me. I had just killed the last mob, had about 80 percent mana left and Alacrity had just worn off on my pet, so I wasn't totally prepared for it.<br />
<br />
It was going badly. I'm not the most skilled player in the world, I ain't got anywhere near good gear, and I was slightly panicking. However, I managed to get it down to 25 percent but had run out of mana and my HP was at 30 percent, so I /ooc 'ed for help.<br />
<br />
Two people said that they would help me, but only if I let them roll on the Soulstripper. One of them being a level 51 Druid who I had talked to previously and they had told me about how badly they fared when they had tried to solo it. I thought that I had no choice but to accept it and let them roll, as there was no way that I was going to survive.<br />
<br />
So, the Druid turns up (not sure what happened to the other guy) and helps me finish it off.<br />
<br />
We then /ran 200 and he WINS!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Arrrrghhh. You would'be believe how annoyed I was. <br />
<br />
I know it's fair 'n all. As I had agreed to let him roll on it, but it just felt as though all that time and effort had been wasted, and this this guy gets the item.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I know it ain't that interesting, but I really just don't like it.<br />
<br />
The evening turned around though, when my application for a new Guild was accepted....so I feel better for that.<br />
<br />
But still...............ARRRRRGHHHHHHHHH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That sucks brother. I know that hindsight is a beautiful thing, but it is for situations just like this that I carry a 10shot Stinging Wort - in that situation youu can take 2 or 3 gulps and either tank it in teh face, or canni mana for that last DoT...just a thought.<br />
<br />
Better luck next time</div></div><hr />
