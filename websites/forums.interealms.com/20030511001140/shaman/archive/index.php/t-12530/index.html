<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Some Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ahoy hoy<br />
<br />
Im just getting back into EQ after a long hiatus and am going to be making a Shaman. In my past life as a Cleric I was always envious of the great range of spells and skills that the Shaman had and now its my turn. I would like to get some pointers from you if possible. I have read the posted tips and poured over the board for a while now, I admit I haven's used the search feature as while I was reading I saw several posts saying that it was not working correctly.<br />
<br />
I decided that I want to make a Troll (yay regen) and follow Innoruk (yay snare clicky). I read the creation threads on The Casters Realm where they advised 25 points be spent in Wisdom with the remaining 5 going to Agility. While reading here I saw that it seems to be the popular concensus that AC/HP is the key. Should I listen to that guide and get the Wisdom up with those starting points or should I put it into Stamina and count on getting the more abvailable Wisdom items?<br />
<br />
Also could I get some suggestions for some beginner armor to seek out? I have been out of the game since shortly after Kunark came out and I am sure that there have been some changes made that would probably outshine the totemic I would be saving my coppers to try and buy.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the assistance</div></div><hr />

      Two things that I can suggest. When adding points during char creation dump as many points into stamina as you can and the rest into wisdom. Once you get cannabalize you'll see the benefit. As for getting gear, sit in the bazaar and see whats cheap but concentrate on ac/hps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All sta rest into wis for sure.. sta is the hardest stat to max out but wis is VERY easy.. Ogre = greatest shammy though, you can jbb w/o interruptions and torpor w/o interruptions.. (knockback interrupts but you can lean against a wall)...<br />
<br />
I'm a barb myself :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogres can still be interrupted, just not stunned.<br />
<br />
But I won't argue that we're the superior race when compared to everyone else. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your kidding right sta the hardest to max out? For us shamans it's rediculously easy and then only in general easy to get or cheap gear. My gear is hardly uber yet my hp is fairly good. Seriously I would suggest as a troll maxing out wis and the rest going into sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a troll wif a base Wis of 85, me'd recommend max Wis, rest inta Sta.  Me an AC/hp troll (not an ubah one by any stretch, but...) and it only recently dat mah Wis has gone over 150.  Self-buffed, all mah melee stats are higher dan mah Wis.  Can't access Magelo atmo but methinx even me unbuffed Sta be higher dan me Wis and me knows me'll hit da Sta cap sooner dan me hits da Wis cap.<br />
<br />
As a troll, yu get a great startin Sta and terrible starting Wis.  It be true dat Wis drops like rain at high levels (late-50s) but ya gotta get der first.  Sup ta yu ultimately tho.  Shammies do juz fine wif real low Wis but me's shur der be a lower limit ta dat.<br />
<br />
Btw, welcum to da Crucible and well dun on choice of race.  Poor form on choice of god tho.  Juz coz we moved in wif da Inkies dinna mean we's gotta like dem's god's butt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wis, then agility.  <br />
Trolls have low natural agility and you need a bit extra to be sure you won't go into penalty.  <br />
Trolls also have very low starting wis, so you need to max that first.  <br />
Stamina isn't worth considering for three reasons:<br />
1) At low levels, a few more points of stamina might give an extra 5 hps . . . hardly worth it.  <br />
2) At high levels, your gear will likely have stamina on it in large amounts, plus you have large stamina buffs you can put on yourself.  Using myself for an example, unbuffed stamina is at 254.  That only leaves 26 points of stamina left for me to buff before it's hard capped anyway, which just isn't worth it.<br />
3) You have a rather high base stamina on a troll in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Your first instincts were correct.  Go wis then agil for starting stats.   <br />
<br />
For armor, I would just go to the bazaar and see what is available for sale.  Filter by slot and stats or hps or something you want on armor.  I think you will be amazed at how cheaply you can buy adequate armor.</div></div><hr />
