<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zuklog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I apologize in advance if you have discussed this to death and then a little more.  I've been playing druid, 31 levels into it I cannot possibly log his little wood elf butt in one more time without poking my eyes out.  I'm sick of not being able to take a hit and spending most of my time on my butt waiting for someone to need a heal.  If I wanted to play main healer I would have been a cleric.   Maybe it's just me, but groups don't want me for dots or dd spells, they want me to sow and heal.  When I started druid seemed logical, speed spell, ports, dd, dot, snare, etc...  I have since come to my senses.  Is a shaman's lot in life any different?   <br />
What role do you guys generally fill in groups?  Slower and buffer I assume.  Then do groups just expect you to sit back and heal?  I'm hoping that groups treat shaman as a little more of an offensive class.  I don't mind playing a back up healer, but I would like to be able to get in on the action too.  And I want to be able to take a HIT once in awhile.  Thanks for info or ideas.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, you nailed us pretty close:<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Slows<br />
Med<br />
<br />
I have my JBB, so I have a little damage to add (some mob's anyway - you can pretty much rule out Velious), but that's about it.  Sometimes, I feel a little frisky if in a really good group and will walk up and poke things a few times, but as a Troll, me tend to get yelled at for blocking the melees who can't get close when me is in the way.<br />
<br />
Multiple Shammies in a raid?  Split buffing duties, but only one slow is needed (DoT's are too slow for a multi group raid, so don't even bother, unless you have your free EPIC one).  You can cripple and stuff if you like, maybe try a Maloxxx or two.<br />
<br />
But buffs and slows are my main duties, then yes, med so you can be backup healer if needed<br />
<br />
p.s. - you WILL take a few hits now and then.  Resisted slows are UBER taunts ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should consider a ranger or a paladin.<br />
<br />
But, if you want to play a shaman -<br />
Our DDs suck even more than druids, so don't expect to use them...you'll just make people unhappy in your group.<br />
<br />
You will do a lot of healing...a lot.  More than any other spell.  Your buffs will be nice when you first join a group, but after the first 5 mins in a group you go back to being a healer.<br />
<br />
So all groups want (again) is Sow and heal.  <br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
All of the above was based on the fact that you only made it to 31 as a druid...so the first 30 levels as a shaman are going to be almost the same as what you just went through.  <br />
Join group... Buff, buff, buff.  Heal for 30 minutes.  buff buff buff... Heal for 30 minutes.  repeat until group disbands.<br />
<br />
Once you get into your high 30s and up...you start slowing more, healing less.  You get better buffs, you can solo pretty good, and basically you aren't just &quot;generic_Wisdom_Caster_01&quot;.  But until then you're gonna fufill a lot of the same roles as a druid/cleric in a group.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  I hope you choose a character that you enjoy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Part of the beauty of the shaman class is that we can fill just about any role in a group, and perform well btw thanks to the tools we have been given, and generally can solo from 1 - 60 (NO KITING NEEDED!). The strengths and weaknesses throughout the life of a shaman will change, as well as how we deal damage.<br />
<br />
You will have the ability to tank, nuke, dot, buff, control a battle with one heck of a slow later on, and much more.<br />
<br />
If you can get past the crap power you will have at 19-23 you'll have an idea of what the shaman is all about. When 34 comes along you will wonder why you ever decided to play a druid so long ago. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shamans aren't really all that different.  The problem stems from walking into a zone - going LFG, then getting tells to join a group.  Come to find out, there's a shortage of clerics in the zone so groups are picking up shamans and druids as main healers.  If there's a cleric in the group, shamans are quite fun to play - debuffs, slows, buffing tanks.  IMHO the most enjoyable grouping class with the most versatility.<br />
<br />
however, when I get invited to a group and I'm main healer - well I simply hate it - I think Shamans do better than druids as main healers since they get decent slows and canni, but it's a lot of work and there's usually downtime if the MT isn't twinked.<br />
<br />
When i'm LFG, I usually find out first if they have a cleric - if not I don't join (which unfortunately forces me to solo alot - but it's better than main healer).  I wouldn't pick a shaman if you despise being a main healer and don't want to solo....  Try a paladin - they get some decent healing spells and truly are thought of as &quot;backup healers&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course none of this matters if you play your shaman the way I do - Find ONE tank (preferably monk or paladin cuz they can heal themselves) - buff the living snot out of him, haste him and doggy, then go to town as a partnership - fastest exp in EQ.  (because shamans can slow - druids and clerics can't)  you can't beat shaman healers in a partnership.....  But ya - at lvl 49 I suck as main healer in a group and we share the same problems as druids....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Be warned, until level 24 your going to be pretty bored.  <br />
<br />
and 30-33 are pretty damn boring(29 is too for that matter, but was fun for me cause i loved being a bear-and was amazed how well i could slow...but then the novelty kinda wore off, and i realized i still had trouble recasting a root, or sticking a new dot in there unless i timed it right).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway heres how its gonna break down<br />
<br />
Your lower levels will be jus like a druids, only somewhat less casting required(i jus pulled w/ burst and beat those polar bears down!).<br />
<br />
5-9 are pretty boring as always.  at 9 you get your most used spell, sow.  Being a druid im sure your familiar ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, 9-14 arent great, 14 isnt bad at all though.  At 14 you get a decent DD, and root, your best soloing tool until 30.<br />
<br />
19 gives you a heal, thats it...well a disease dot that does nothing, but is decent for soloing after 24(extra damage for very little cost).<br />
<br />
24 gives you regen and canni, i take back what i said earlier, canni will be your most used spell, very very very good spell..  also get a decent DD, and quite a good DOT.<br />
<br />
29 gives you buffs, and a decent slow...<br />
<br />
34 gives you a pet, which will open up your options to solo tremendously, a good disease dot, and several other things.<br />
<br />
as Raikor said, 34 is a great level<br />
<br />
-note, on my char i am not 34, still stuck in that awful 30-33 range(32).   I played a friends 36 shammy once though, best fun soloing ive ever had(i pet kited like a mutha, very effecient.  Ended fights w/ almost full HP, and about a bub of mana, which is easily cannid back, though you dont need to if the fights are that efficient :).  <br />
Other reasons why im still playing through this boring as hell period:<br />
<br />
I saw a 49 shaman Quad HG's in rathe.  He pet kited 4 HG's in a remarkably short time, and was back pulling more in under 5 minutes.  I sent him a tell and he said he was making about 400pp an hour, w/out JBB/Fungi OR epic.<br />
<br />
ive seen logs of a shaman soloing things that other classes wouldnt even touch.  For example, ive heard many 60 shamans call Yeldema a pushover(some claimed having solod'er in about 4-5 min), yet the only log ive ever seen of a other class soloing her was a 60 SK, complete w/ Primal velium bow/Axe-2hs, and a cudgel that proced a 150hp-approx lifetap.  <br />
<br />
And ive personally never seen a log of anyone else soloing emp chottal in seb, but i have seen SEVERAL 60 shammys post logs, of proof that they took him down.<br />
<br />
Also, druids kite, shammys take hits w/ little more then a flinch, tho we do 'wince' alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can survive lvl1-33, you  will finally get the beef.<br />
<br />
We really, really, really sucks before 34 with nothing to do but heal and buff IMO  (buffs that dont  do jack, heals you cant  keep up).<br />
<br />
Then things opened  up at lvl34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I haven't made it all that far on my Shaman but one thing I've learned is that I find a group apropriate for what I want to do that night.  If I feel like slowing, debuffing, dotting, and buffing, then I find a group with a cleric.  If I feel like kicking back and getting some free xp I find a melee heavy group looking for a healer.  Of course you can't always find a perfect group but one thing I do is make sure I know what spells other classes have.  That way if I get in a group and I'm main healer but I don't want to be, I just wait for a spot to open, then tell &quot;why&quot; would could use another healer class.  I tell them the other stuff I can do along with what the other class could bring.  <br />
<br />
Also one difference from a Druid that'll let you get into the action is regen and cann.  Keep regen on at all times.  Cann while meleeing, and then sit in between pulls.  Worked pretty well for me.<br />
<br />
Or you could just try a Ranger. :)  They seem to be pretty similar to what you describe you're looking for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At the levels you're talking about a shaman will be very similar to a druid. If anything you'll be healing and buffing more.<br />
<br />
The primary difference is that spall groups stay efficient for shamans longer. A druid only works well in a small group of 2-3 players up untill about level thirty, after that mobs just start hitting too hard. A shaman gets his best exp in groups of two or three all the way to 60, and in such a group you will of course use a wider vareity of spells.<br />
<br />
Not so sure a shaman is what you should be looking for though. A ranger might fit better.<br />
<br />
Once you get past 51 you will rarely need to group with clerics. One of the things I detest most is people who wont go places because you don't have a cleric. There are a whole two groupable dungeons in which you need a cleric when you have a good high level shaman, Cazic-Thule and Ssra. Slightly dependant on other things of course.<br />
<br />
One day I went to get some Fungi tunics for guild and we brought a cleric down to mr shroom king. The Cleric cast like 1 CH per hour and sometimes cast celestial elexir on me or a nuke or a stun. Now these are supposed to be reasonable tough mobs. A couple of days later I feel like going to upper dogs in Velks and those pesky Kobolds are a lot weaker than a Seb Shroom so we opt for a druid as healer. The druid refused to come because we had no cleric /boggle I can solo UD...<br />
<br />
Pallies can rezz too you know...<br />
<br />
But going back to topic your low levels will be quite similar to a druids but once you get past 34 or so the druid starts soloing for the morepart and the shaman should start duoing. It's usually more fun since you get to do more stuff, you run in to fewer poor players and you get more involved withthe one or two group members you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It sounds like you want a melee toon. Go with Pally or Ranger. You get to melee all day long and shoot spells. <br />
<br />
Shaman in group you will be healer, buffer, slower, every now and then you can throw in a DOT. But in a group most of your time will be spent on your butt or doing the cani dance. You won't be meleeing in a group. <br />
<br />
Now solo and dual (2 peeps- you and a tank) you can shoot more dots and DD spells and you can melee. I solo half the time to keep my defence and melee skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">geez - everyone recommends ranger...didn't you guys read?<br />
<br />
And I want to be able to take a HIT once in awhile.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
&quot;Eek!  Not in the face!&quot; - ranger_01<br />
<br />
<br />
(ok - couldn't help myself. Rangers are actually very nice peeps.  tracking, very nice damage output, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I play both a 41 shaman a 48 monk and and two druids (!, 51 and 12), and find the classes similar in terms of the Boredom Factor. Both do one primary function and med. For my shaman its buff, heal, slow, med. For my druid its buff heal, snare med. Unless pulling, the monk is even worse...autoattack then FK. The only way out of the routine is to solo and luckily all three classes can solo effectively.<br />
<br />
My personal feeling is that the monk is the most efficient solo class. I lack &quot;uber&quot; gear on all 3 chars but as long as I have bandages my monk solos more effeciently than either my shaman or druid. <br />
<br />
The druid comes next. Root rotting with a druid is massively effecient. Druid roots last a long time and combined with snare mean more Butt Time for mana regen. <br />
<br />
My shaman gets his dog which really helps clearing greenies and soloing blues, but he is expensive to cast and buff meaning more downtime. <br />
<br />
You may wonder why I have a second druid....I got the urge to be a halfling and do the new quests and work up tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with most of whats posted here.<br />
<br />
Shaman can take hits better, but we don't melee much (some do, some even make it remotely effective), if thats what you want, play a hybrid.  Shaman spend most of their time slowing and buffing.  I heal when my cleric/chanter takes hits or if I notice my cleric/healer is slow on the draw.  I duo with druids quite often, they are frequently impressed that I tend to wait till a slowed mob enters melee before I cast on it and that I don't take nearly the damage they do while doing it.  A shaman is definately an in your face character.  Just don't expect to be a melee type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman? Simple:  We can do it ALL.  Sure the other classes may do it better, but no class comes close to the versatility of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Example:  Most would agree that to do the crypt/emp camp in Seb you need a cleric and an enchanter.  Last night for 5 hours, my guildleader, a 60 paladin, my guildmate a 60 epic'd wizard and an ex guildie 60 rogue held that camp....EASILY.  Splitting the ICGs and the crypt caretaker was the only dicey part and it was still cake with the wizard ghetto mezzing one.  No crack on anyone either.  Alot of fun :)<br />
<br />
I try to play my alts, but honestly, I miss my slows and dots and dogdog.  I really can't imagine playing anyone other than my boob queen, Az. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What do I do usually?<br />
pick my nose<br />
/nod<br />
/snicker<br />
<br />
I'm not too good of an example.  At 60 with the gear and spells and AA skills I have now, I can fill any role in any group, as long as it's not a &quot;melee dmg&quot; role.  I can main tank tho and am forced to do so more often than I like.  <br />
<br />
I am a better healer than a cleric, if you count heals over time and mob exp flow, since I can keep up with slows, heals, buffs, and put out one to two nasty DoTs on each mob in addition to all that.  Only thing we need clerics for in an average exp group if I am in it is for rezzes if things go badly.   And with Paladins getting all sorts of rezzes even sooner, I'd rather have a paladin than a cleric.  <br />
If I get stuck in &quot;healer&quot; mode it's np and hardly distracts me from the other things I am doing.  Last night I was doing karnors basement with a group of lowbies for the hell of it.  I was main healer, buffer, slower, and partial crowd control (we had a necro for mezzes).  In addition to all that I was a wizard and a monk since I was also the puller for the group.  <br />
My level 60 druid friend was in the group, but honestly his best contribution these days is to click his marijuana bp (hemp) to give us group regrowth, PoTG us, and spend the rest of his mana on nukes.  Bastard can do a lot more spell dmg than me a lot faster.  So that's what he does and he is happy.  If I hadn't been there he'd be doing heals . . only heals. <br />
I was healer and about 3 other jobs as well including pulling.  <br />
<br />
I do shaman/druid for support most places.  Then I add classes that contribute damage.  Wizards are last on the list, followed by SKs.  First on the list are rogues and monks, followed by necros and mages and rangers and paladins and warriors.   <br />
<br />
But heck, I wanted a char that could be THE support class for a group and be all that was needed.  I can do that now so I am happy.  <br />
<br />
in fact i'm so contented with my current power I'm having a hard time thinking up reasons to log on.  <br />
:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I didnt read through all the posts ill just give my view on the shaman class. Work  work  work! Like one guy said try and find out if your the only healer and then say no to the invite. The average moron thinks that cann is so damn efficient one cast and your good for another hour, but that isnt the case. slow, buff, heal, haste and cann is not how i like to play. I literally have to take nights off if i had to do a lot of canning the night before cause my wrist gets sore (computers are my job as well so :( ) Celerity last like 11 minutes and a melee heavy group that is a lot of mana to loose and recover every 11 minutes. Shamans are better at slowing and being a back up healer to a cleric, that way we can focus more on buffing and debuffing. In a lot of groups im in i prefer to pull (in zones that i can) so the melees are always killing and not waiting on the next pull. <br />
Anyways, back on track here. The mid levels are boring but once you get around 39 you can really go your own way. 55+ shaman are so powerful we can do stuff other classes cn only do with help. Its a fun class but dont think for a minute we dont work for Exps.</div></div><hr />
