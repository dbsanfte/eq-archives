The first part doesn't really bother me, but this piece at the end does.<br />
In addition, the bill would set up an Internet domain (such as .prn) for material harmful to minors and requires all websites containing such material to register on that domain name. Any websites currently on other domains (such as .com, .org, etc.) would be required to close down those sites and move to the new domain. <br />
Aside from the various free speech concerns, such as what does &quot;harmful to minors&quot; mean and who the hell gave congress the power to tell private business what and what not they can name there website, I have two questions:<br />
<br />
Does the drafter of this bill realize that the US does not control the internet?  Whats to prevent someone from having &quot;Hotnudesexmommas.com&quot; in say, taiwan. <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
would linking to said site from a .com or .net be illegal?  If so, that seems like a blatent violation of free speech.  If someone can pull up a relevent law or ruling that says it isn't, I'd be actually quite interested to read it.  If it isn't illegal, whats to prevent me from registering Hotnudesexmommas.com and simply making it a redirect to Hotnudesexmommas.prn?  I mean, doesn't that completly defeat the purpose?<br />
Edit: I forgot to say, but I really find this entire thing amazingly funny.  A prn domain.  Oh the hilarity that will ensue:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense to you personally Kullaas, but I'm tired of people defending issues on porn/child porn/whatnot.  Our country is going down the crapper because of this mess and people want to defend them.  It's very frustrating.</div></div><hr />

With a system such as .prn or I've even heard of .xxx being discussed, filtering unwanted Internet traffic would become trivial. Think of how useful this would be for public liberarys.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever actually had your rights violated?  You sure put up a front as if people are constantly beating down your door to opress you.

It would be nice for a break.<br />

<br />
Nitefox, removal of rights doesn't neccesarily have to be a wholesale gutting of those rights.  Infact, a incremental removal is far more insidious, because people are much less likely to object to a bunch of small steps than one large step.  Thats why we can't let that first step be taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you are speaking of a website labeled .prn I think its pretty clear what we are speaking of. If there is nudity then it gets that label. If there is no nudity then there would be no reason to force the website to use .prn.<br />
<br />
This can also be compared to magazines. Stuff or Maxim dont require plastic bags, nor do their websites prequire filtering.</div></div><hr />

Businesses could block only .prn sites, and still allow full use of the Internet for those who need it for research, so could schools. Current filters will prevent you from researching topics like &quot;breast cancer&quot; from a school computer, because the word &quot;breast&quot; is filtered out. It would also mean fewer accidental entries into such pages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm going to have shock several people here but I'm going to have to back Kullaas on this one.<br />
<br />
Firstly Nitefox if its getting old take your (and many people's) advice and just don't click on the topics you know will be hot (or repetitive in this case as you state).<br />
<br />
Secondly the .prn or .xxx domains are firstly not going to work as law for several reasons.<br />
<br />
A) its not enforcable.  As an internationally controlled entity the internet is not solely the domain of the US.  Now if they could push this through say the UN then we might have something.  But part of something being able to be taken as law is it has to be enforcable.<br />
<br />
B) it is an infringement on free speech.  Its very much like saying to Skinheads sure you can protest so long as you keep it restricted to your homes.  Or to NAACP sure you can protest so long as you don't do it in Washington.  Essentially instead of real space they are trying to shove people into obscure virtual spaces.  <br />
<br />
Also these domain names wouldn't apply to JUST porn sites.  It would apply to any form content of what is considered &quot;adult&quot; oriented.  The term is very broad and usually refers to porn but it can also include certain literature, art (aside from nude stuff), political forums discussing very grown up type things (including but not limited to porn), guns, drugs, medical, online counseling, and a host of other things not considered appropriate for &quot;children&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now morally I dislike the porn industry also but its been established as allowable so we need to either stick to our guns and maintain its right to continue OR we need to amend the constitution to ban pornographic material all together.  But to be honest with the sweeping language used around pornographic debates I'd be reluctant to support an amendment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What tel says.  You can morally dislike something without gutting the first amendment over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howwl</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Kullaas on this one.  Who decides what material is &quot;harmful to minors&quot;?  Is art with naked people in it harmful to minors?  Some people will say yes.  Does that mean art sites need to move to .pm?<br />
<br />
The problem with most proposed &quot;children accessing porn&quot; solutions are that they are myopic, unmanagable, usually discriminatory, and sometimes unconstitutional.  If you don't want your kids accessing porn on the net, then supervise their access.</div></div><hr />

People said that the DMCA wouldn't go through.  People wrote it off.  And now we are stuck with a law that by every right is a violation of several freedoms.  Oh GAWD, you all just circumvented my ROT26 encryptions, time to sic the FBI on you!<br />
I know I'm being melodramatic but &quot;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty&quot;.  Every single one of these laws is like a little chip in the paint, individually there OK, but taken together...<br />
If we aren't vigilent in protecting our freedoms, even in cases where it is morally reprhensible, those libertys *will* disappear, one little piece at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmmmm.... here's a couple thoughts from one individual.<br />
<br />
Some one said stop looking for the obscure lines in the  bills. Well, i hate to break it to ya but its those little obscure lines that  should be the most worry. If you took the CBDTPA at face value, it sounds like a good idea. Its touted to bring broadband to everyone. What they are hiding behind the hoopla is the fact that is just  a renamed version of the SSSCA which is  meant to limit end user  fair use rights.<br />
<br />
Now, as far as having rights violated. Yes, I have had my rights violated on numerous occasions. Two particular incidents come to mind. I was fired from a job because of my &quot;disability&quot;. The  people even wrote  the reason in a &quot;letter of recommendation&quot;  Now if thats not a civil rights violation then there  never has been one. Ever.<br />
Then second incident is when a woman  had me arrested for &quot;stealing my dogs&quot;. She knew the sheriff  in the county. She swore a warrent out on me and I went to jail. I sat in that cell for 8 days. During my entire  incarceration, I was never once marandized. I was questioned on several occasions. Never once was I offered a lawyer even after I asked for one. So yes, we must ALWAYS look at the fine print. Examine laws and bills with a microscope. If we don't, we WILL lose eventually.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Speaking of the DMCA, did you realize that if Sunmoon were to turn off signatures, amd some bright, enterprising individual decided they wanted a sig, (which is easy to do with notepad) that person could be arrested for bypassing the security measure Sun put in place? According to the DMCA, that could very well happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronarin</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kullaas may be a bit more strident than some of you like, but he is right to bring these laws to our attention.  What proposed laws make it out of a committee is largely determined by:<br />
1.  How a Senator/Representative thinks voters will react to his position on a law.  <br />
2.  Vote trades where Senator/Representative X votes for bill A in return for Senator/Representative Y's vote on bill B.<br />
3.  The personal views of the Senator/Representative<br />
<br />
So, if a Senator/Representative can vote for bill X in return for a future vote on bill Y without having to worry about backlash from his constituents he will.  It is your responsibility as a citizen of the US to monitor the votes of your chosen representative and inform him/her when they are going beyond the bounds.<br />
<br />
IMO this proposed legislation goes beyond the bounds.  I do not think minors should be exposed to pornography.  However until somebody can clearly and consisely define the difference between this:<br />

***** WARNING THIS IS A PICTURE OF WOMAN WITH NO CLOTHING******<br />
<br />
and any number of pictures of women in similar poses and states of undress on the net that are pornographic I will stand against any law that tries to segregate material &quot;harmful to minors&quot; into some internet ghetto.<br />
<br />
If YOU want to protect YOUR child from material that YOU think may be harmful then monitor YOUR child.  IMO, If it is too much trouble to sit at the computer with junior and surf with him/her then it must not be that important to you.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to see that kids these days are smarter and more aware of the world around them...at least one (Woot go Kullas).  I'm thinking you need to go to law school man hehe...maybe even run for senate.  I also agree every little &quot;fine print&quot; line that we overlook is indeed another chip at the foundation.  No I've never had my rights violated, but that doesn't mean I have to hand the opportunity over to someone who would like to either.  Keep up the vigilance Kul don't let them get you down I like to keep up with this stuff as I'm sure quite a few others do as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I will repeat what others have said here:  It's just not doable.  All a US legislative piece would do is force US porn sites to change their domain extension.  <br />
<br />
So if there's a elderlynudeswedishtruckdrivers.com in the US (mind you I wouldn't put it past our society), it would be renamed to elderlynudeswedishtruckdrivers.prn... but a week later another foreign site could start right back up at the old .com address.<br />
<br />
As for people who believe they are personally being kept down or oppressed...  please take the time to educate yourself about other cultures around the world and then take a look back at what you have.  People face things, daily, that involve much more than a virtual, online service having its domain name changed.<br />
<br />
No rights are being violated.  A change like this wouldn't require anyone to &quot;close down&quot; a site, just a few DNS entry updates.  I don't know any spot in the constitution that grants someone the &quot;freedom of pornographic domain names&quot;.<br />
<br />
But I do want to end with a quote from Ronarin which I though was really, really good:<br />
<br />
If YOU want to protect YOUR child from material that YOU think may be harmful then monitor YOUR child. IMO, If it is too much trouble to sit at the computer with junior and surf with him/her then it must not be that important to you.</div></div><hr />

How is givein a different domain to adult material any different than giving .org to non-profit organizations, or .gov to all government?<br />
<br />
<br />
The .org, .net and .com TLD designations are largely voluntary and there is no penalty associated with the inapropriate use of any of them.  In fact, after the whole fiasco surrounding the whitehouse.com web site many organizations will register all three top level domains to prevent people from putting up parody sites using the alternate domain names.  According to the press release Kullaas posted content providers would be required to register as .prn.  <br />
<br />
Since there is nothing to define what qualfies as &quot;harmful to minors&quot; I must assume pictures of unclothed people could qualify.  This means whole parts of the regonized art world would have to register on .prn if they wished to display pieces from artists like - Degas, Gauguin, Cezanne, and Michelangelo.<br />
<br />
Oh and just to move the subject away from pornography.  What about pictures of dead bodies?  If I create a web site devoted to showing graphic police photographs of murdered people should it have to register as a .prn site?  If so, does that mean cnn.com or msnbc.com will have to become cnn.prn or msnbc.prn if they want to show pictures of a massacre in Bosnia?<br />
<br />
I am not saying there can't be laws to protect children from innapropriate material.  I'm just asking you to provide me a clear definition of &quot;harmful to minors&quot; that won't include material that isn't harmful to minors.<br />

I agree that copyright should be protected.  However, it should not be against the law to write about or discuss various copy protection schemes.  Under the DCMA a researcher who examines an encryption scheme, determines that the encryption is worthless and publishes a paper detailing the flaws in the encryption scheme can be sued by the publisher of the encryption scheme for violation of the DCMA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly it shows he is at least questioning what is going on around him which is better than most people (kids and adults).<br />
<br />
Secondly I like to quite often take the opposite side just to challenge him and myself even further.<br />
<br />
Verabl sparring/debate over top of the day topics is an excellent way to keep yourself sharp on the issues affecting us.<br />
<br />
Can't say I mind Kullaas keeping me informed and further more engaged in debate since I thrive on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, Kullaas can get riled up about a lot of stuff.  He's at that idealistic age, where the lines are pretty clear cut still.  However, I think it's sad that the response he got was &quot;shut up your just a kid&quot; instead of &quot;well I think you're wrong and here's why&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Actually, that wasn't the intent of my original post at all.  Everyone seems to try and put a political spin on every little word someone says that what they really meant to say get's lost.<br />
<br />
All I asked was for a &quot;break&quot; from this kind of post as we have about 4-5 going already.  It was a simple request.  Anything else said was just in response to Kullaas directly.  My &quot;grow up&quot; comment was in response to his lame &quot;sheep&quot; comment in which yes, he reacted like a kid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately that's the biggest problem with lists like this.<br />
<br />
The written word is a very inadequate method of communication.  75% of communication is non-verbal.  (Inflection, body language, etc.)  So by only being able to write, it's WAY easy to misinterpret what someone is saying or meaning.<br />
<br />
As for a &quot;break&quot;, I certainly don't follow every thread on Real Life.  And will take my own breaks from topics that I'm tired of.  If someone has a wild hair about freedom of speech issues or any other topic I say more power to em if they want to post their opinions/rants/whatever.  It doesn't mean I'm going to agree with them, post on the thread or even read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things I would like to clarify from last nights post.<br />
First, I am not defending porn so to speak. Personally, I could care less for the stuff. BUT, Who determines what &quot;porn&quot; is? Is Michelangelo's work pornographic? Is a site dedicated to animal husbandry porn? Some things are obviously porn. Its blatent. But there are a few gray areas out there.<br />
<br />
Second. The DMCA does more and less than &quot;deter&quot; hackers that are malicious, nor has it stopped &quot;copyright infringement&quot;. It also forces people  that want to enjoy a legal product into doing something illegal. Case in point, DCSS. You cannot watch a DVD on a computer  that uses Linux for its operating system. If you bypass the commercials on a DVD, you are in violation of the DMCA. If you want to make an archival copy for PERSONAL use of an E Book, you violate it. This does nothing but punish the consumers, not the REAL &quot;criminal&quot; element..<br />
<br />
Another thing. I might not always agree with Kullaas, and we may get into a debate  on occasion, but he has as much right to post what he deems relevant as the rest of us, regardless of his age. If his view is  incorrect, it is our job as his elders to try to correct his view with logic, kindness, and understanding. Not attacks and put-downs. His is the generation that will be leading this country in the future. Its our duty and our obligation to guide that generation.</div></div><hr />

I think I understand you more.  <br />
<br />
You are afraid of things that MIGHT happen, not things that have are actually happening.  Out of all the posts on this kind of thing you have posted, the main theme you shout about is what MIGHT or COULD happen.<br />
<br />
To each his own I guess.  I've always lived my life by not worrying about things that haven't or might not happen.  Keeps the blood pressure down and the ulcers away.<br />

<br />
I read a story in the local newspaper some  weeks ago about Art and the Government. There are nude statues in various areas in our governments halls. Including one area where press conferences are  held. In some cases, there are curtains drawn in front of the art works.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a side not, would  some of the government site  have to register THEIR domains under .prn?</div></div><hr />

Who cares if he is a kid? Does that mean he cannot be smart? Does that mean he cannot be right? I personally believe he is right in this case, and often is. I don't care if he is 4 years old, and you are 80. If his idea makes sense, and yours doesn't, I am still agreeing with him. <br />

Well, that's good! Because, once they have happened, it is generally too late to fix them. Or, at least, it makes it much harder to fix them. <br />

When it comes to protecting peoples rights, I'd rather people think about problems BEFOREHAND, not afterwords. Thinking about problems afterwords is how things get FUBARed</div></div><hr />

I'll have to agree with Nitefox there.<br />
<br />
I just happen to agree with Kullaas on this particular subject... but me disagreeing with him on other subjects doesn't make me close minded... it simply means the info presented to me made me choose one path while that very same info to Kullaas or whomever made them choose another path.<br />
<br />
Agreement != open minded...<br />
<br />
In fact I would argue that the opposite might be closer so long as the context of the disagreement is you come to a source of data/information and THEN decide how you stand... and quite often two people will stand differently after viewing the same info.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open minded&quot; or accusing someone the lack thereof is in my opinion a cop out for someone who can't back up their viewpoints and convince the otherside to change their mind.</div></div><hr />

There is an actual law on the books, though I forget where, stating public libraries and schools have no right to block any website from anyone, barring they are old enough to view it.  I.E. A 21 year old can access any site he wants to at a public library.  LIbraries still keep these even in my town, but it is, in fact, against the law.  I lost my link to it, or I'd post it.  <br />

Now, whether it is a state, federal or county law I forget.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ha! I could care less who agrees with me. I don't even make an arguement for this case either way, other than to say I agree with Kullas.<br />
<br />
My issue is with some of you saying to Kullas &quot;...you're still a kid, maybe it'd be best if you let yourself act like one...&quot;. I'm sorry, but that is a close minded statement. I don't care if you disagree with him. If you bring up valid reasons for doing so, then it is certainly not closed mindedness.<br />
<br />
My issue with that statement is that is sound awefully a lot like &quot;...you're still a woman, maybe it'd be best if you let yourself act like one...&quot; or &quot;...you're still a |insert racial slur here| maybe it'd be best if you let yourself act like one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Who are you to say how he should act? And who cares if he is a kid? How does this in any way effect the morality, intelligence, or quality of his posts or ideas?<br />
<br />
Sorry for attaching myself to that one comment, because my objection is more of a general one. I see people comment on Kullas's age almost every time he posts in the RL forums. It is like some defacto excuse to ignore his point of view.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Fixed some wierd HTML thing that happened....</div></div><hr />

UMMM...where are you getting the idea that I think otherwise. My issue is not with people disagreeing with Kullas, my issue is people talking down to him as if he is some kind of child to be shooed away.....if he were older, he wouldn't be treated like that. That, and ONLY that, is what I take issue with.</div></div><hr />

Well, in some cases it is.  I don't mean that to slam on Kullaas but there are some things that you really only learn by growing older and experiencing them.  He thinks that just because he read it on the internet that he knows more than say someone who might have some actual experience. He does come off as somewhat disrespectful at times(not saying he was in this thread, but other times.  As always, this is just MY opinion).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is getting tiresome and I'm sure people will start acussing me of picking on him or something so I'll give way to whoever else want's to go back and forth.</div></div><hr />

That, to me, is like doing the same to a black person or a woman.

<br />
I personally could care less about Kullaas' age save to wish him a happy birthday now and then and to know what his frame of reference is when viewing things.  I won't discount that frame of reference on age alone though age can be a factor in conjunction with other merits.<br />
<br />
However, and I think this is due to the poor medium of text, we simply had a &quot;word&quot; divergence in what open mindedness is but in fact mentally you and I think the same way about the topic.<br />
<br />
Originally I and I imagine Nitefox simply saw your several statements about &quot;agreeing&quot; and then your final statement about &quot;this being open mindedness&quot; and assume you equated the two.<br />
<br />
For the misassumption in your case I'll gladly apologize as it seems you in fact believe that open mindedness is looking at the data/info on hand and coming to a decision about it on your own rather than simply using prejudged ideas to paint everything for you.  <br />
<br />
However my above statements about the use of &quot;open mindedness&quot; in debates could still apply to others on these boards.  To me its pretty much a last ditch effort when someone can't present opposing view points or back themselves up with facts and cases.</div></div><hr />

What about domain name conflicts.  If there is a porn.com and a porn.net, who gets the porn.xxx domain?</div></div><hr />

Subject to a barrage of law suits first I'm sure.<br />

As has been stated already, however, this legislation would do absolutely nothing as someone in Abu-Dabi would immediately grab the just vacated porn.com and porn.net sites...</div></div><hr />

My beef with Kullaas is he obviously devotes a lot of time to finding the little things that deal with freedom. Somehow, he doesn't strike me as the type that will grow up and do something about it, more as someone who will just whine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taolil</div><div class="date">06-29-2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand what's so wrong about Kullaas posting stuff on here for people to read about and ****e. Nitefox has done so in the past, usually with the same sort of set up...find some newstory that goes against his personal views, editorialize on it, and then cause a stink here on the Glade. Myrea also posts alot of stories, although they aren't always politically charged.<br />
<br />
What, if they're funny, or humorous, or stories that reaffirm your own personal rightwing views, it's allright, but when a contrary voice pops up, that's not okay? *confused*<br />
<br />
Wait, wait, no, erm, Kullaas, you're an idiot. *rolls eyes*<br />
<br />
Maybe it might be a better idea for Kullaas to post these stories on another forum with people who share his views and attitudes..it's obvious they aren't welcome here (anymore).<br />
<br />
Suggestion for ya, Kullaas, get a livejournal, join some communities where people are actually interested in hearing about these things....for the most part, it looks like people don't really care here. Heh.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I've ticked anyone here off with what I've said, but I'm getting sick of this 'you're either right wing, or you're mocked' stance that seems to be on here. If you know what he's going to post...don't read his threads. Aiya.</div></div><hr />

Also, Whoa! Talk about a blast from the past, this thing had died a couple months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taolil</div><div class="date">06-29-2002, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.<br />
I didn't even notice the dates on it...just the one that Samin had posted. /boggle.<br />
<br />
I dunno, it just seems that people who are 'left' in their views or whatever are mocked alot more than people who are 'right'. It's just my impression that I get. I know there are people who aren't rightwing on here (Taamar being a good example) but, meh.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* Only a matter of time before I get bored and change it. :p<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yeah, and it also serves as a reminder that positive energy and good feelings DO exist in this world!<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: Hmm... I wonder if that means that positive energy and good feelings make you sick to your stomach?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And before this<br />
<br />
Oh get over it Kullaas, stop being so dramatic. Have you ever actually had your rights violated? You sure put up a front as if people are constantly beating down your door to opress you. My first comment didn't have anything to do with rights or what not, it was only try to curb the massive flood that seems to have overtaken us lately about this or that persons rights. It would be nice for a break. <br />
<br />
Sheep, give me a break. Grow up.<br />
<br />
Wow nitefox, that sure was respectful. Isnt that the pot calling the kettle black?<br />
<br />
Respect is *earned*, so if this post shows anything about some others (and it does) then dont start about Kullas being disrespectful, when you yourself are no better.</div></div><hr />
