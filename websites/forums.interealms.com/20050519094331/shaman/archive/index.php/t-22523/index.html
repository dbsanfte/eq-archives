<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So tonight, I decided to hunt for some essence in Chardok.  I noted that a pally friend was on, so we hooked up, got some C, and headed to Chardok.<br />
<br />
Chardok (and Howling Stones will be the same way), is someplace that I've never spent much time in.  In fact, I don't recall ever being past the first bridge.  So, we pulled some incredibly large hordes of mobs down upon us.  Didn't matter much, as both the pally and I are 65 and failry well equipped (VT some elemental).  <br />
<br />
At any rate, after dispatching our latest pull of 6-7 dark blues, the pally calls it quits when we look at the map.  We had only made it 2/3 of the way to what I assume is the spot we need to get to in order to spawn the echo mob.  <br />
<br />
Well, I, being the adventurous sort, decide it would be fun to see how far I can get solo.  Now, I didn't have all night to play, so after solo'ing a few groups of 3-4 dark blue mobs, I decided to call it quits myself.  <br />
<br />
I don't know the name of the place, but I arrived at a building with a bridge leading into it. Guarding it was a big crystal golem, a couple imperial golems, and a few elite something er others.  <br />
<br />
I cast invis, and noted that the golems saw right through it.  Well darn, I thought.  Next, I look up and see that there appears to be two doorways on either side of the bridge.  These doors don't connect to the bridge, rather, it appears that the sidedoors are meant to be accessed from inside the building.  Being the sneaky troll that I am, I thought, heck, lets see if you can levitate in this place.<br />
<br />
Well, sure enough, I could cast levitate.  Not that the depression/moat was very deep around the building, but I toyed with the idea of floating along the wall and entering one of the raised sidedoors of the castle.  <br />
<br />
I glanced right, I glanced left.  The elites on either side didn't see invis!  I was pumped.  Perhaps, just perhaps this would work.  Well, I slowly creep out over the moat thing, and begin to slide against the wall, when I notice something punching my rather large, somewhat smelly toes.  <br />
<br />
Lol and behold, there's a stupid skeleton in the bottom of the moat, who of course sees through invis.  The game was over, the trickery was done.  In short order, the entire bridge of mobs, the golems, the elites, a couple ghosts, and I think Scooby Do decide to start punching me.  It didn't feel that good, so I thought, hmm. time to gate.  <br />
<br />
Well, being somewhat tired, I hit gate right as the crowd slams into me.  Needless to say, I was interrupted.  How rude.  <br />
<br />
So then, I think, hey.  Root is kewl.  I root about 4 out of the 10 mobs who are earnestly trying to kill me, and then it sinks in:  Craptastic.  I have about 20% life left.  <br />
<br />
First thing that runs through my mind is, dang it,  might as well load the necro up and summon corpse.   The second thing that pops into my mind is, this is plain crap.  I'm a lvl 65 shaman with gear stripped from the rotting corpses of gods, deities and mobs far more badarse than these little fly eating pests could ever hope to become, so.. ...<br />
<br />
.....I decide  to run for it.  And run I did.  With levitate on, I was flying across chasms and bridges, confusing the pursuing lizard horde.  I was weaving left and right, dodging spells, shrugging off root, and just generally making the entire zone really, really mad.  <br />
<br />
All this time, I'm watching my health.  20%... next bend... 17%.... next turn..... 15%.... next turn I'm debating trying a fast heal when I dip to 12% life.... next bend.... 10%.... now I'm getting nervous....<br />
<br />
But, like many trolls before me, I kept running.  Finally, finally, I start to see familar territory.  I'm getting close, as the tunnels become lightblue mobs, then green.  Now the train is mostly little lizard pets, and weenie-wanna-be gecko's.  But still, I have 2% life now.....<br />
<br />
At last, I recognize the ZI area, and, with my tremendous Troll intelligence, head left.  Damnit. Dead end.  Apparently, someone thought it would be funny to block the exit.  Then I remember, its like sebillis.  ZI is not the ZO, so I turn back and hug the left wall, heading for the real ZO. <br />
<br />
Its then I see my life dip to 1%, and a flurry of red text as the mobs that were on my tail, which I'm now running back through, begin to taunt me with their little tickling punches.  Now, I'm getting a bit mad.  Even with 1% life, I debated fighting tooth and nail, err, tooth and scale, and dying valiantly right at the zone out.  That'd show them.  Trolls never quit!<br />
<br />
However, I thought, A) I'm not a Paladin.  That valor crap is their thing.  And B) I guess I just did run about 3 miles anyway.  So, I think, na, we'll fight another day and just run out.  <br />
<br />
Well, 10 feet from the ZO, I get stunned.  First time the entire trip I get stunned.  10 feet from the exit. Something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;A dirty stinking Lizard thing bashes you for 39 points of dmg&quot;<br />
<br />
I check my health.  Hmm.  3 hp left.  And then BAM!!! The newly buffed replenishment ticks and I'm at 43hp !!!.  And then BAM:<br />
<br />
&quot;A dirty stinking lizard thing hits you for 41 points of dmg&quot;<br />
<br />
And then...<br />
<br />
Woot, I zone!!!<br />
<br />
So, thanks SOE for buffing regen.  It made my week:)<br />

Of course, we have to spend 50 hours a week playing to get a thrilling 5 minutes like that, and even then, 1 a week is more than most of us could hope for. <br />
<br />
Gonna have to remember that area your talking about, me and a pally friend hit HS yesterday, and after warning me multiple times about the rugs (which I knew, BTW) he lost SoE and fell through one, LOL. I was healing him from up above while he made his way to the transporter up to the ZI area, then he needed a Levi so he could re-float to east, LOL. It was hilarious. Once I healed him and trained myself of about 5 skellys and golums, LOL, had a blast. By the time he made it back to me, he had 4 more on him, I had 3 dead, 6 others rooted, was meleeing one, doggy was on another, heh. When it was over, all I could do was say . . .<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I fall through next?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
While you are in chardok And if you go back to howling stones. <br />
<br />
Make sure to pay attention to the layout and the feel of the zone. <br />
<br />
I bet it feels different. It feels more like an Adventure than any carbon copy LDON run. Or an encounter set up somewhere in one of the new zones.<br />
<br />
Kunark was by far my favorite expansion. It made the game better. Not just bigger.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the times in those zones. They are good ones. I spent months in both learning everything I could about them.<br />

oh wait. it does. usually right before I die. hehe</div></div><hr />

I couldnt agree more. I loved Kunark. It had a wonderful mix of dungeons and outdoor &quot;single pull&quot; zones so you could actually have a choice. The dungeons themselves are incredible. Key quests were actgually totally doable, 1 group, 1/2 a group eventually, and even yield good gear (OS key). And of course, Kunark gave us Turgurs and put SHaman on the map. <br />
<br />
There were a few things about it I didnt like. One is the way factin was handled. As a troll, I wasnt welcome in Cabilis or FV. That left the OT Outpost. However if I wanted to use that as a &quot;city&quot; I was forced to avoid certain dungeons, like HS and KC. That kinda sucked. They solved this rotation faction in Vedlious though, having one go up as another went down. Didnt have that luxury in Kunark. <br />
<br />
Another bad thing about Kunark is that I think it was the beginning of the creation of the &quot;Unskilled High Level Player&quot;. You could litterally go from 1-55 without even entering a dungeon or fighting more than 1 mob at a time. These &quot;Kunark Babies&quot; as we called them would then create HAVOC in real dungeons through their inexperience with things like aggro, multi-pulls, trains, etc. <br />
<br />
No denying the beauty and outstanding design of most of the dungeons though. With the possible exception of Droga, all the Kunark dungeons are so well thought out and planned. None of this &quot;up a hall to a 4-way, pick a way, rinse, repeat&quot; that we seee in LDoN. These zones are full of little quirks and unique pathways that were a big part of the adventure, by themselves. It was so refreshinbg to go back to HS, and have all those memories come flooding back. I go back to OS and Chardok once in a while anyway, Trak BPs, Heiro Cloaks, Cleric and Chanter epics, etc, make these places still somewhat visited. But of the 3, I think HS is the best (ok, maybe OS has a slight edge, but no fair, its bigger and has the expansions &quot;Main Man Dragon&quot; in it). <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to camping these essences, although I will probaby end up getting a regular VP key instead, for the better aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Awesome story!<br />
<br />
An alternate ending would be that the last thing you saw was a lower level raiding group entering the zone, and that Chardok decided to raid them =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I love Kunark dungeons, they just have a feel to them that other places dont have.  Every now and then I will romp through one with my 65 Magician and see how deep I can get.  I just wish I could have experienced the Kunark dungeons when I was leveling up instead of having to go back when its trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">But Waz, its not trivial when you adventure with a Troll!<br />
<br />
Even light blue mobs hurt a bit when there are 50 of them:)<br />
<br />
And I agree with the above posters. Kunark for sure had a &quot;feeling&quot; that hasn't been reproduced in any later expansions.  It has a higher feeling of realism, or something along those lines.  The dungeons curve and twist, etc..  Whoever designed them had a good time doing it, and probably felt some attachment to the layout and design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slizarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What a great story. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/nod that's a nasty run fer sure. <br />
<br />
Just one correction! Those mobs are no lizards, they are a perverted crossing betweeen the true race, Iksar (of course), and  those wimpy dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But, like many trolls before me, I kept running.  <br />
<br />
Yes, we saw that at the battle for Grobb :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, we saw that at the battle for Grobb :p<br />
<br />
rofl.. whats funny is at the battle for grobb the trolls stopped running from the frogs to chase my tail :( and i was trying to help them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LOL so thats what happened to the frogs.. tricky frogs :p.. was there story bout that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">it should be in the /story or whatever the command is.. but i think mithaniel told the frogs to take over grobb or something.. i didnt really follow the story, only knew that i wanted to help them trolls who ran funny :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks for posting the kind of thing I pop back in every couple weeks to look for.  *grin*  That reminded me of why I kept playing for so many years.</div></div><hr />
