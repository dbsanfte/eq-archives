<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone found a way to make a Shaman useful in a PoJ Trial?<br />
<br />
I have recently been attempting to complete the trial of execution, but most times I am left ungrouped when I am replaced for a DPS class.<br />
<br />
Will AE Slow together with torpor be an effective tactic of Shaman Mezzing?<br />
<br />
Any advice gratefully received.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on who you are grouped with. I've gone through twice successfully, neither time did I even slow. First time we had a chanter AE stun while the warrior (ultra well equipped) held one mob at a time. Second time we had the guilds #1 warrior, even without a chanter and no slow he never came close to going down. In both cases all I did was rain, nuke, and rain some more. :) Was pretty fun.<br />
I've done it in pickup groups and without a chanter it just doesn't work. AE stun and you slow the mob the tanks on, rain, nuke, maybe help heal. Thats about all you can do. A Shaman is going along just to get his flag, not so much to help the cause. Just one instance where our shortcomings are brought out in the open in a glaring kind of way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman is very usefull in a PoJ trial if you are with the appropiate class and you know that a shaman is not only a buffer or slower.<br />
For Exe trial<br />
First , get some DS potions for your tank .<br />
Second don´t slow first mobs , DS help a lot for DPS.<br />
Third use rains , you will get the agro of 3 mobs , then let your enc/bard mezz them . If one can´t be mezzed , slow and tank him , if more then run in circles or root park them.<br />
Four while you are tanking use your rain spell on the mob of the MT and let him know to get his mob far away form the mezzed mobs , you don´t want to break mezzs with the rain.<br />
With 2 rains on 1 mob you are doing more damage than most of the &quot;DPS&quot; classes and you can regen mana faster , so when most classes in the 4 round are LOM you are ready to help with heals , dam or slows if needed .<br />
When the first mob is dead , MT must take mezzed mobs not yours because they wasn´t slowed and you want the DPS from de DS , so use quiescence/torpor on you while tanking and rain, rain , rain on the MT mob.<br />
If all work fine , you are dealing 3k dam per mob with rains and the dam of your pet , so Do you thing that shaman is not useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've always shaman mezzed the ones the tank's not on.  Just get potion and druid/mage DS and cast our little AE dot from i think lvl 19 or AE slow and keep yourself in the corner torpor/Q'd and the tank can just pull off mobs when he's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems a bit optimistic to me tamarix.<br />
<br />
First off, even if he was level 63 and had tears of saryrn, that's 4 mobs x 2 rains x450 = 3600 mana per wave. Quite a bit for a level 62 shaman who probably doesn't have canni V yet. At level 62 you're stuck with the lower level rain, 540dmg/wave for 380 mana.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you've got a 12 second refresh time, it takes a good few seconds for all the waves to fall, and you have to kill these mobs in &lt; 30 seconds each. Unless your MT is very fast at switching targets and positioning, its not going to be easy to get those 2 rains off each time. Certainly not if you're avoiding mezzed mobs too. One rain and one nuke is perhaps more realistic.<br />
<br />
Really, claiming we can do more dps than a rogue, wizard, mage, beastlord etc is plain ridiculous. You do realise that many classes get rain spells right? And they're almost all better than ours.<br />
<br />
Nope, if you want to do trials I think shaman are more a dead weight than anything else. I agree with Tamariz though that our main aim is dps, with a good tank and stacking up some DS, slow is not required and just reduces the damage to the mob.<br />
<br />
Shaman role in trials is debatable - if you don't have any cc then you might need to slow some mobs and then rain/nuke. If you do have CC then I'd just flat out nuke away, rain if you have room to do so. But I'd never claim to be playing a major role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree but of course PoJ trials at 65 you can easily become MH with Q on everybody and nukes / rains / dog as dps. Pre 65 I think I would have felt &quot; carried &quot; through trials. A feeling I hate as a shaman - I do the carrying  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just did my PoJ trial a few days ago (I know I know whey the hell did I wait so long) and I didnt slow at all, it was in essence, a waste of mana the mobs literally didnt live long enough for slow to matter; that was you get when you have a Time geared mage rogue paladin and wizard there though hehe.<br />
As far as what I did though, the paladin aggroed and stunned as many mobs as he could and I used tears, dogdog, puppygun, spot heals, etc and cannibalized like a fiend...ended up near OOM at the end and the only mob that I slowed as the boss at the end.<br />
I think that the only thing that you can do is get a group together that wants to try the trials, attempt it with what would be your standard group tactics for that group (IE you slow heal debuff etc and others do what they do normally) and see if that works. If your failing, then you need to switch to all out offense and just spot heal/nuke. If your finding that your cleirc is LOM then sure aoe slow, it would be more mana efficient than single targeting but make sure your torpor yourself first as it may get you more attention than you want.<br />
But I agree with the others above, it really did feel like I was being carried around just for focus :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my experiance the best way to get through the Exe trial is to AE. When I got my flag the group looked like this...<br />
<br />
65 War (not great equip, not bad)<br />
53 Cleric - 2boxed by the war<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Cleric - 2boxed by the Enchanter<br />
65 Wizard<br />
65 Shaman<br />
(None of us in gear beyond bazaar/Tier2/BoT gear)<br />
<br />
It took us one failed run to get down our tactics. Afterwards it was no problem, and could probably have been done by a bit lower level group. Esp if they were all played by one person each.<br />
<br />
Tactics went something like this.<br />
<br />
-Everyone waited in far right corner(as you enter) except warrior who Sat in the middle of the room(sitting to be sure to get aggro, no one else sat at all). Mobs would aggro the warrior. Everyone else would move in then, clustering around the warrior(except the 53 cleric, who was there to heal the war). <br />
<br />
-The Warrior picked one mob and beat on it till it died, picking a new one asap and doing the same till all 4 were dead.<br />
<br />
-The Enchanter chain cast his AE stun, keeping the mobs locked in place.<br />
<br />
-The Wizard alternated his 2 highest PB AE spells.<br />
<br />
-The other Cleric cast his highest level AE spell as often as possible.<br />
<br />
-Myself I would cast my rain spell and then /assist the Warrior and then single nuke his target once or twice. Mob would die, /assist War, cast rain, single target nuke, repeat.(I also made sure to buff my PR so I resisted my own rain spell)<br />
<br />
-After all 4 mobs dead, we'd move back into the corner, use modrods, canni, sit on horses, whathaveyou. Warrior would sit back down in the center. Repeat.<br />
<br />
-After the 4 waves of mobs, I slowed the Executioner and it was up to the War and the healer to take him down(although we threw in a few nukes as we had mana from canni/regen through the fight).<br />
<br />
Now I realize I didn't contribute the majority of the damage in the fights, but I didn't feel like I was carried. And as I said befor, I believe 6 semi competant players should be able to do so, even at slightly lower levels.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps in some way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tamariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If he is 63 , don´t need to wait 12 sec to cast 2 rains , he can cast tears and torrent , tear if not resisted is 1950 dam and torrent is 1620 and both spend less than 30 sec to land for 830 mana/mob.<br />
Which classes without critics spell at 63 land 3570 dam for the same amount of mana?<br />
Wizzis with Agnar thunder level 63 2305 dam for 580 mana ? 2 per mob and oom at 5th mob? 1 per round and oom at third round?<br />
Which is the DPS of a non ultraubber ranger , pal , sk , at 63? 60 to 90, 100 with a very nice weapon ? How much dam are they dealing in 30 sec at that level ? 2 to 3k?<br />

Shaman (Yours truely)<br />
SK<br />
Druid<br />
Wiz<br />
Rogue<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Finished all 6 trials in 90 minutes.  Redid Exe since we had to wait for Lashing to reset from last groups win.<br />
<br />
I kept Q and FA on the melee.  Flame was admittedly a pain in the ass since all of our rolls were reversed.  Just sucks with all the off tanking (Couldnt slow mobs in there to save my soul) and the AE going off and what not.  We just ground threw it and finished LoM but still okay.<br />
<br />
Pets with weapons, fully buffed outside and positioned correctly are important for trials if your group isnt the highest dps around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild recently ran a few groups through trials and had this same quandary.  We ended up trying a shaman as MH and it worked pretty well as we succeeded on the first try.  He was a little LoM (15-20ish) at the end of the Executioner fight, but otherwise didn't really have much trouble.  We used (as I recall):<br />
<br />
63 Warrior<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Rogue<br />
65 BL<br />
64 Monk<br />
63 Shaman<br />
<br />
We are a very small guild with about half of the people that came out to help being friends or former members.  We only do PoP stuff occasionally, have higher-end bazaar level gear and certainly don't have anyone in EPs.  The shaman only had 6 AAs and the other folks probalby ran in the 15-30aa range.  <br />
<br />
Shamans can certainly act as MH, even without Q.  I need to confirm, but I believe ours was only using Tnarg (no Kragg) to blast heal.  The DPS in the group was pretty good (probably 350-400), even though it was mostly melee.<br />
<br />
I'd say the best bet for a shaman w/o Q is to get into a pretty heavy DPS group, make sure the MA does his job and be judicious with heals.  I might even be tempted to pull out Kragg's Mending for this for a slightly better hp/mana ratio heal.  With Q, I wouldn't think it would be much trouble at all.</div></div><hr />

You really think all DD spells have the same resist rate as our rains?  Especially Torrent of Poison.  Its horrible.<br />
<br />
/boggle.  Just think back to your own experiences with VStrike...Do you usually get 1/3 resists? <br />

Unless I can malox I dont bother with rains...just a waste of mana.</div></div><hr />

Yup the resist rate for our rains is very bad on mobs close to our level without malo/s , but the most common spawn in Exe trial is :<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10432<br />
level 53 , so at 63 with 10 levels of difference , your rains rate isn´t so bad .<br />
I am not saying that we are gonna deal 3650hp dam in every mob , I am saying that at 63 , we can deal the same or more dam than other classes in all the trial  because we can get mana fast than most of them, if you are not considering ultrageared/weaponed/with 500aas people to compare.<br />
So when someone say that shaman are death weight or left ungrouped because we don´t have DPS in a trial /duel 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Our usual trial technique is to do exe with a 65 war/clr/enc/nec (necro with DC pet) and then they can carry pretty much any other combination of 2.  They seem to have a higher rate of success with the full shaman suite of buffs so in enchange for being carried once I buff them.<br />

How? Well a Nice Damage sheild + a Alchemy damage sheild. + Tigirs = Woohoooo damage. (Please resist please please!)

<br />
Don't confuse the Executioner trial trinity for the standard trinity.  The standard trinity is Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, while the trial trinity is Healing, CC and DPS.  The two are similar but different.<br />
<br />
Tanking is ONLY necessary for the Prime Executioner and then the quality of tank only needs to be proportionate to the the quality of the healer backing him/her up combined with the overall DPS of the group (more DPS = faster the mobs drop = less healing needed).<br />
<br />
 -- CC really ought to be an enchanter to be most effective, unless the DPS is through AE casters.<br />
 -- Healing can definitely be Cleric or Shaman and probably a druid.<br />
 -- DPS is anyone who has high DPS with a fast impulse response.  (i.e. auto-attack or nukes, not DoTs)<br />
<br />
That said, shamans do NOT have to be carried through a trial group.  Plunk us into the healer spot, give us a tank who can stand up to Vathoch on our heals, a CCer and sprinkle liberally with DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My executioner trial run when that trial was excruciating to wait for, just after pop release, was a group make up of:  61 sk/warrior, 61 cleric, 61 enchanter, 61 rogue, 61 mage, and me 61 shaman.  We went several times this makeup swapping out different rogues and/or our sk/warrior buds.  We had a group of friends and cycled each in till got all passed.<br />
<br />
What I did was basically just like what Uhamok told in his reply.  I did AE slow however to assist the chanter if got a resisted stun.  I used the AE slow on the Executioner as well so not to have both memed.  I tossed in a rain per mob usually as well.  When 4 up, 1 rain, then again at 3 up and 2 up.  By the time just 2 and 1 up it went really fast on the melee dps.  Tossing in a single nuke if it got really close and spot healing.  If I wasn't casting a heal or a damage spell, I was canning.  I'd can V every chance I got and modrod as well and keep myself torpored as well as the enchanter as we were not moving.  Mage did his AE and banishment if lucky on a spawn too.  At times we'd 'JUST' get the mob dead as the executioner got to the prisoner.<br />
<br />
We pretty much did this most times.  For some reason we'd win easier when I went with them than when I didn't.  Don't know if a fluke or what I was doing was just that much different over other shaman.  Oh, I also used a pet.  Hey, every dps helped at the time. :)<br />
<br />
I'd agree that ae'ing is such an easier way to go, but I really think a shaman thinking outside the box can provide enough to not be considered just weight in the trial.<br />
<br />
Being higher level with spells will definately change your pulling weight in the group as well.  I'd go help out other folks later when I was 62+ as well and could see significant improvements to my abilities, and omg when 65 with Quiescence. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've gone through the trials three times with my guild.  All three times, I have been Main Healer.  We do it with a shammy, a tank, and a cleric.  Necros and mages help, but the remaining 3 can be anything as long as there is enough DPS. The cleric does no healing through the waves -- they will just heal for the boss.  I just AE slow the wave, MT and one DPS take down first mob as fast as possible -- to reset timer, and finish blowing up the rest after the first falls.  It takes seconds with little healing to be done.  All stand in the center except me to keep mobs centered.  Anyone taking damage outside the tank gets a HoT, and the tank gets Tnargs.  It takes little mana per wave to succeed.  But, by the final wave, you might be low.  If you are low, the tank will just kite the boss, the pets will chase it, and you'll debuff it as soon as you can.  Then, fully engage when ready.  The boss is very easy to kite.  We always finish in a matter of minutes.  We don't have the greatest gear in the world either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well, I guess what I've done at level 65 wasn't the same as what you would be able to do at level 62, but I myself ended up casting BoS on every mob (pfft, who needs mezzing), and then bane on one of them, and then chain torrent until the mob the main tank is on is dead.  I did this in about three groups with different people (druid was the healer in one of them, and I know he did more nuking than healing).  In two of these groups there was a 51 shaman sitting down in the corner, so we were basically short a person too.  I found that by the time that BoS ran it's course, it did a good deal on the mobs, so they were already damaged by the dots before the tank started in on them.  We did have a group of people that know how to play, so even though I did take agro from them mobs, it wasn't so bad that I was afraid that I was going to die.<br />
<br />
It's possible at your level to do some dmg.  But really, there is no reason to worry so much about getting flagged for this unless you need it for the guild that you are apping/in.  If that's the case, than they should help you get the flag.  Since you are already 62 (per your signature) you should already be able to get into BoT, where I would just get to 65 and then maybe try the trials again.  <br />
<br />
You can go ahead and try to slow mobs, but whenever I tried those trials at those levels, I always died from slow agro (whether or not I got slow on them didn't seem to matter, AE slow was too much agro and reg slow was hard to get to stick sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did a trial with this group:<br />
65 beastlord<br />
65 mage<br />
65 bard<br />
65 druid (main healer!)<br />
So far nothing unusual, right?  Now add...<br />
58 paladin (MAIN TANK!)<br />
56 warrior<br />
<br />
Mage and bst were highest dps available at the time *grin*  I was the paladin (my alt).  Fully loaded on buffs, but boy was that fun :)<br />
<br />
Paladin/Warrior were last 2 left for flagging (we'd sent through a few groups as a guild event).  Initially paladin was going to be replaced by a 65 cleric but I begged them to try the druid as main healer (he's one heck of a druid) and we made it! (Finger over the Lay hands button on the big boy at the end, no kiting him, just straight killed. Didn't need LoH)<br />
<br />
To be a bit more constructive, my shaman went through a while ago, pre-c5, barely.  Level 60 maybe?  I refused to do it before then, just not that useful a class for execution trial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
stupid question maybe, but with high level (65 or so) group, what's the lowest level a shammy can go thru this without being detrimental to the group? <br />
47.  If you have a high level group of skilled players, all you need to do is summon dogdog beforehand, get him buffed and Alpha'd, then get ready to chain cast Blast of Poison or Shock of Venom (if 49) once a mob is around 60% health.  Other than that you are basically dead weight, but the group should still pass.  You could get away with being 46, but if you do something stupid and lose your level, it could ruin your whole day. ;) <br />
<br />
I flagged a 47 Magician friend very recently - so he could join us on a BoT key raid in the Plane of Storms.  Parked him in a corner, told him to nuke any mob at 50% health or lower, and to spam-click pet attack after assisting the MA.  We did just fine, and probably would have still passed if he was afk the whole time.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about making a meaningful CONTRIBUTION to the group, I would say you should be level 60, hopefully w/ Malo &amp; Torpor scribed.  Anything below that, and you are in my opinion being carried through (like w/ my mage friend) more than helping out.  As it is, Shaman aren't the greatest assets in PoJ Trials until you have some AA's and a mostly full spellbook.  At 65 w/ scads of AA's, I'm confident I can push just about anyone through the Exec trial if I can pick any 3 of the other group members.  I can MA, main heal, OT, or whatever. <br />
<br />
When I was first flagged at 60 way back when, I felt carried &amp; mostly useless, though I did my darnedest to help out every way I could think of.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've found my one useful role in PoJ trials is main healer.  Make a couple DS potions for the tank, sit in a corner and cast healing over time and blast heals to MA.  This kinda doesn't work until you have quiescence and some healing aa's though.  PoJ trials are obnoxious and don't really cater to our strong points.  You'll get through them eventually though, wait for some friends or talk to a beefy tank late night or just grind out 65 and some aa's and don't stress too much over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just one instance where our shortcomings are brought out in the open in a glaring kind of way.<br />
<br />
&lt;sigh&gt; whatever.<br />
<br />
If you think the shaman class sucks - don't play it.<br />
<br />
No one class is going to be the the perfect for class for each and every type of the widely diverse content in EQ.  Get over it.<br />
<br />
I did the first PoJ trial with some friends and we absolutely crushed it.  About all I could do is nuke.  It was one of the very few times in my entire shaman career that I didn't feel like I did that much - usually I always feel like a contribute significanly to group success - but who cares - the first trial is a cakewalk that doesn't require a lot of anything special.<br />
<br />
How does not being suited to one little piece of one type of content indicate that we have glaring shortcomings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've done a bunch of PoJ trials (executioner only) with my warrior, and one thing I'd never do is slow a mob.  Between Kilva's DS and the mage/druid/bard DS, that's a significant amount of damage if the mobs are not slowed.  (except on the final mob...that one should be slowed)<br />
<br />
As to shaman on trials...having the shaman help with healing and spot nuking has been useful on the trials I've done.  Dots are a bit slow, unless it's the LDoN curse line.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have healer/tank/mez/dps/dps, the 5th member can be anyone.  We didn't have any problems pushing through some guildy alts in the mid 50 range with a grp that was warrior, cleric, enchie, wiz, mage.<br />
<br />
Almost forgot...we haven't gone elemental yet, so we aren't uber types...just a bunch of decently equiped players that know how to work well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As people already pointed out, DS potions are good - of course anyone can buy these.<br />
<br />
Other then that shaman pretty much suck in the Exe trial. We can still get by, especially being higher level, but every other class contributes more.<br />
<br />
Heals / DS potions / pet /  nukes is basically it. Slows get resisted a lot and mitigated if they land, rains get resisted, regular nukes still kinda bad. Unless your group is hurting on damage healing is probably your bet best, save your cleric some mana.</div></div><hr />

We did it fine with a level 63 shaman with 6AAs as MH:<br />
<br />
64 Warrior<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Beastlord<br />
65 Rogue<br />
65 Monk<br />
63 Shaman</div></div><hr />

My Guild Alliance is accepting requests to PoJ trials, and I will hopefully go this evening.

Any dps helps so nuke away (no dots.)  <br />
<br />
Make sure you have dogdog out and equiped.  Work it out with the tank so dogdog gets the back - it helps alot on dps.<br />
<br />
Make sure everyone is fully buffed.  <br />
<br />
If the tank can't take the beating, help out with slows (although I hate using slow in the trials when playing my warrior now that I can take the hits :p  - except on the last mob...slow away there.)  <br />
<br />
Watch the health of everyone else and cast heals immediately if someone other than the tank is getting hit - the one thing you cannot afford is to lose someone.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and bring those DS potions.  :cool:</div></div><hr />
