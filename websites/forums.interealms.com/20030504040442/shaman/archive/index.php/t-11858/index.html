<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to get an idea of some of the better ways to arrange spells in my book.  As of now, they are just in there as I got them.  Really messy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I group similiar type spells on the same page/pages. All of my buffs get grouped together with the group version on one page and single target versions on the opposite side of the page. My dots/dd spells are together an another page, utility spells on another (Gate, Enduring breath, shrink etc), heals and regens on another, debuffs and roots on another and so on. Move all of your lower spells that you don't use to the back of your spell book and out of the way. I also put all of the pre 60 buffs on a page after all of my main ones, that way if some lower level asks for buffs and I can't use my higher level buffs on them I don't have to go digging for the lower level versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Page 1-2  All buffs, Invis, SoW, Bearform, Regen, Heal spells.<br />
<br />
Page 3-4 All Debuffs, Dots, Annul Magic, Gate.<br />
<br />
Page 5-6 Resists, Cures, utility spells.<br />
<br />
Pages 8-9 Level 44/49 buffs for low level players<br />
<br />
Pages 10+ everything else that I either no longer mem or once in a blue moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Page 1: Group/single target buffs<br />
Page 2: sow/bihli, invis, acumen, group/single regen, haste, HoS<br />
Page 3: Debuffs...slows, cripple, malxx, etc<br />
Page 4: Resist buffs, cures<br />
Page 5: Dots, dd's<br />
Page 6: Utility...eb, lev, char etc<br />
Page 7: bear, puppy, summon puppy, gate <br />
<br />

I recently went thru my spell book and reorganized everthing, it was a horrible mess :( had 12 front pages of spells all crammed together every which way and finally got tired of the waste of time looking for something when I needed it pronto. All in all, took about an hour to organize it all (including old spells I don't use in the back) but it was well worth the time spent as I can now find things more efficiently. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I played my ranger and druid to level 51 and never arranged my spell books.  Rangers don&#8217;t really have enough spells to have to worry about, though some organization certainly wouldn&#8217;t hurt.  With my druid, being my first character, it just never occurred to me to do so until I was already used to where everything was.  Kind of like if you cleaned up your room you&#8217;d never be able to find anything again.  *grins*<br />
<br />
But when I started my shaman the spell names really threw me. So many of them have nothing to do with what the spell actually does.  So I decided to group things together.  My first page has attack spells, my second page has buffs and the next few pages have utility spells and such, things I think I&#8217;ll use and don&#8217;t want to have to dig for.  Starting about page 20 I put all my other spells, arranged in alphabetical order by to level.  When I organize, I organize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mimoza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I arrange my spells the way I mem them... my basic line-o'-8 spells are the first 8 in my books, and then the ones I'd be swapping for most, etc.<br />
I also have a special page for group buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my spells grouped (in a similar layout than Grimrod and Fenora).<br />
<br />
In addition I got one page (the page that opens up when i click my book) where I put all the spells that are not permanently memmed but that I might need FAST.<br />
<br />
These include Gate, Invis, Summon Companion, Chloroblast, Cure Poison/Disease, Cure Blindness, Stamina Regen, Annul Magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First pair of pages: spells that I swap in and out a lot (some dots, some buffs, some misc).<br />
Next are the spells I generally mem after I die (which is frighteningly often :eek: )<br />
After that are spells that aren't quite as common (like single target versions of the buffs).<br />
And then buried amongst the rest of the clutter are the 49 spells because I'm too lazy to reorg my book again for easy access. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How's this for obsessive compulsive :<br />
<br />
My spellbook is alphabetical :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pages 1-4 Healing spells/Canni.  Hotkey = HEAL<br />
Pages 5-8 Shield-type spells.  Hotkey = SHIELD<br />
Pages 9-12 Stat Buffs/debuffs.  Hotkey = BUFF<br />
Pages 13-16 Direct Damage spells.  Hotkey = DD<br />
Pages 17-20 DoTs.  Hotkey = DoT<br />
Pages 21-24 Speed (SoW, Billy, Haste, etc).  Hotkey = SPEED<br />
Pages 25-28 Misc (invis, lev, gate, Dogdog, etc).  Hotkey = MISC.<br />
Pages 29-32 Vision (Acumen, Blind, etc).  Hotkey = Vision.<br />
<br />
My Heal hotkey looks like:  /book 1<br />
My Shield hotkey looks like:  /book 5.<br />
etc.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
When I want to mem SoW, I shift to my spells bank, press 6 (/book 21).  This brings me right to all my speed altering spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Page 1-2: heal, haste, slow, debuff, dot(solo use)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1: Resist &amp; group buffs.<br />
2: Stat/AC buffs.<br />

5-6: Utility spells &amp; highest rain DoT.<br />
<br />
My &quot;Book&quot; macro points at page 3 so everything I need is only a click away.  All my obsolute spells go at the back of the book, sorted by type and level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can't remember how many times I have re-arranged my spell book, but what has worked easiest for me is my most used spells at the back. In general, your newer spells are going to be used more often, so if you put them at the back you can just add your new spells, and not have to worry about changing your whole book around again. Of course, I don't have all my spells yet, but when I do, I might consider moving them to the first page. One of my pages is set aside for the spells I mem after I die and I have them in order of which they go on my spell bar. This makes it really easy and I don't have to think (usually you are occupied enough after you die, and don't need to think about any more things :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for all of the great info.  I used a combination of a few different ideas listed here.</div></div><hr />
