<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>favreiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone,<br />
<br />
I am new to this board and am extremely happy that I found it due to the wealth of info located here.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if a few people could lend me some suggestions on what spells I should use when soloing my Shaman.  He is currently level 39 and I have done a mixture of soloing and grouping so I understand the basics.  But, I want to make sure that I am doing this as efficiently as possible.<br />
<br />
When I solo I summon my dogdog and find a camp spot.<br />
<br />
I buff him with the following:<br />
Talisman of Tnarg<br />
Chloro<br />
Shifting Shield<br />
Tumultuous Strength<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li<br />
Health<br />
Quickness<br />
<br />
I buff myself with the following:<br />
Bear Form<br />
Talisman of Tnarg<br />
Chloro<br />
Shifting Shield<br />
Tumultuous Strength<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li<br />
Health<br />
<br />
When I pull a Mob, normally I pull with spells in this order:<br />
Togor's Insects<br />
(Sick dogdog on MOB)<br />
Instill<br />
Insidious Malady<br />
Scourge<br />
Venom of the Snake<br />
Affliction<br />
Shock of the Tainted (Use as needed)<br />
<br />
Am I doing things in the most efficient manner or I am wasting mana or not using spells that I should be using?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is your defense maxed for your level?  If not, then you should be in there swinging! :-) [or in there sitting on your horse, letting the mob hit you instead of dogdog.]<br />
<br />
How long is it taking you to kill something?  You are using a disease resist debuffer and two disease dot's.  These are really slow working.  Is the mob dropping before they wear off?  Have you tried to do it without the disease debuffer?  Are you getting resists without the disease debuffer?<br />
<br />
You are using a group str spell on yourself and then casting it again on dogdog. That's a lot of mana for a barely noticable difference in str.  I'd use Furious strength.  It should be about 1/2 the cost in mana for about the same strength and about the same duration.  (Bih'Li is group also but it's probably worth it for the increased attack for dogdog, but since you apparently aren't swinging yourself, you could save mana and just use SOW for yourself).<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that STA doesn't affect pet hitpoints, so you can probably drop the Health on the pet.<br />
<br />
Are you feeding dogdog his alpha food?  If so, you might consider a dex buff depending upon what type of alpha food you buy him! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>favreiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My defense is almost maxed as I tend to take a few blows for my dogdog to share regen time and conserve mana.  However, my attack really sucks and I am not sure how much time I should spend honing my piercing and bashing skills.<br />
<br />
It does take some time for me to bring down a MOB.  Normally my casting is not resisted so I guess I would not need the debuff.  <br />
<br />
Are there other spells in the poison line that I should be using instead of the disease spells?  Do the various poison spells, that we get over time, stack with one another?<br />
<br />
Thank a ton for the help and suggestions!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at 37 i pull with scourge or envenomed breath, run to my dog, slow and then melle.  I only buff the pet with haste and sow.  I put all buff on my self and beat down the mob with my 2 hder.  Works pretty good.  Will be reall nice when i get vos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also have<br />
Agi, and Dex up<br />
u can also buf dex to your pet its helps to land hits and it helps to cast while beiing smacked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How do you cast group buffs on your pet?<br />
<br />
I've never seen Tumultuous Strength or Spirit of Bih'Li actually land on my pet. /pet report health doesn't show them. <br />
<br />
Is there a trick I'm unaware of? Eventually I will be able to /tgb but that is a long way off.<br />
<br />
I only use project alpha, haste and (sometimes) SoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly I never ever buff my pet with anything aside from SoW and Haste (whichever is the fastest I have at that level). I really can't say I notice much difference with HP and str buffs. As far as I can tell there isn't one.<br />
<br />
And pets, like all other NPCs, have huge regeneration when they are not in combat. If you just tell your dog to sit down for a minute or two while you pull mobs, he will regen a huge amount of hitpoints, making chloro unnecessary. Aside from that I think you're doing fine. however you're using 3 dots... I personally when soloing only use one. I know we can stack, but I find that only using one DoT, I can find a good balance between killing the mob after enough time for there to be no downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never been able to get Bi'Lih to stick on Scooby either.  If I target him the spell hits me but he still walks around.  If I use SoW on him he runs around.  Don't think Bi'Lih hits pets.<br />
<br />
When I fight I don't use a lot of buffs.  Bi'Lih, Talisman, Chloro on self and Sow and Haste on pet.  I add dex and fury if I'm working on weapon skills or Str if I'm carrying a lot of weight (Hill Giants).  If Scooby is getting hit a lot I throw him a Talisman too.  <br />
<br />
After that I pull with slow (VoS on longer pulls) then cast VoS (slow when close to camp on longer pulls).  Then sic Scooby and replace VoS as neccessary.  If I feel like I need a little more I pull out Blight, Hammer of the Scourge and whack till it procs.  If I'm good on mana I'll nuke them once when they start to run otherwise I'll root them and finish with melee (I hate runners drawing adds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">buffs for self: hp/sta/regen/ac/bear/sow (sometimes agil/fury depending on if I'm close to an ac break)<br />
<br />
buffs for dog dog: regen/speed/alpha (talis if an extremely tough mob)<br />
<br />
pull with slow to dog dog. take a few hits while he nips from behind. back off, disease (if long fight), cani up a bit. poison, cani up a bit, repeat poison if needed. Usually by this time my agro has built up enough the mob comes to me. melee till dead. If the mob is extremely resistant, I'll pull with malosi. <br />
<br />
I didn't start using regen on my pet until 44 or 49. Perhaps it's the pets at those levels, but I've found him to be a very reliable mt (and no whining for zing when his sta is 180+). ;)<br />
<br />
I'm curious, I see a lot of folks sowing dog dog? I'll usually either dispell a mob if it has sow or root if it's fleeing will cause adds. Once the mob flees, it's usually going slow enough for both of us to keep up with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well when soloing I cast the following<br />
<br />
Pet<br />
Regen(if he get beat up alot)<br />
Haste<br />
Talisman(never know when the extra HP are going to help)<br />
AC buff<br />
<br />
Self<br />
Everything :D<br />
Agi/Sta/Str/Dex/AC/HP buffs<br />
Haste<br />
Fury(Stat increaser as well)<br />
regen<br />
<br />
Spells I use when fighting use<br />
<br />
Disease Dot (long Pulls)<br />
Poison Dot<br />
Slow<br />
Cripple<br />
Root (for exscaping only)<br />
<br />
For long pulls I use the Disease Dot to pull with then cast slow on inc.  Other wise i just use my slow to pull with.  As the mob is incoming I will send my pet into attack with taunting on.  Mob ussually stops to beat him up.  At this time I will ussually cast Cripple as it makes the mob hit for less and lets both pet and myself hit harder and more often.  Then I will cast my best dot and reapply it as needed.  Something to note though I find if you are needing to apply the poison dot more then twice on a fight then there is most likly somewhere else you could hunt for better experiance and less danger.  From level 39 on I have yet to find a place I could not tank a mob with slow and pet that didnt die before I had chance to cast the second round of Poison dots.  With this stratagy I was half the time casting Canni 1 or 2 in the middle of fights due to being at almost 100% life.  And with you only casting one Poison Dot after a few seconds you should be able to back out of combat and let dog dog take some abuse and let you med/regen if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">long pulls use scourge to pull then slow on incoming. also, if you have kei (which you always should when soloing imo) you can do a little extra buffing (like full buff yourself, and for pet, throw on a buff or two you might not normally use-like strength). <br />
<br />
short pulls - if its hill giants, or other crowded loot zones,the competiton is such that i dont even bother pulling with a spell. either by the time i get done the cast, someone already got it, or because im so anxious to get the cast off before anyone gets it, i didnt allow myself to be stopped long enough and im interrupted (which has got to be the most annoying thing in this game lol :) ). so ill just run up whack it, toss an ebreath (quick cast time - usually can get it off even unslowed) when it lands turn and run and sick pet on, then slow, dot, etc.<br />
<br />
one thing i noticed was that fury wasnt really mentioned that much. i use this a lot, usually always have it on when soloing. you usually have to sit and medd at least a little bit frequently when soloing, so while you waiting to regain you can cast fury, and get a nice boost to stats (also give a str boost to help with weight - nice if you are hunting hg's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">pet - haste and sowed<br />
