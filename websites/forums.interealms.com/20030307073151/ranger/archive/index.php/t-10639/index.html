<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hunt this zone alot due to the fact it is easy to get a group and I can solo garangas, albeit slowly, while lfg.  But for god sakes there are so many morons here it is unbelievable.  I acctually do not have much problem  with the wizzies and druids who are quading they usually got their Sh%# under control.  IT is the morons who run from UP.  IT is a never ending train.  How about running around the zone it is not that much longer?  But I guess trainging people is alot easier.<br />
<br />
Monks you have F#@$$ng FD use it before train.  other casters snare and root away from zone first if you get an add you can't deal with, I do.  If you do get a train do you have to run right by the scouts so you can get 4 more in your train?  Is it impossible to run around them?  We all know where the normal groups camp why run right through people or hunting?  Please make a loop and try to run far enough away from other groups so they don't get aggro.<br />

when someone is pulling a  train, you just root them.</div></div><hr />
