<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of the mobs we've been fighting lately seem to summon, and I'd appreciate any advice on this.  What do you do when your slow is resisted and you are summoned?  A particular situation, the big lvl 65 whimps by the hedge in PoN.  Several times yesterday (my first time at this camp) my slow was resisted, and I was summoned.   With AC at about 1050, I was getting whacked on pretty good after being summoned for the tick that it took the warrior to taunt it off.  My question is, now what? stand my ground (that being right in the middle of the battle) and recast slow immediately?  Stand my ground, wait til warrior has aggro and then recast slow?  Or wait til not getting hit, back off and hope warrior really got agro, then cast slow?   I tried all three, and got scolded by different members of my party for each.  Is there a fourth option I'm not seeing here?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what level you are, but if you are in a camp where they are resisitng your slows, cast a debuffer 1st--Malo or Malosini.  If there is a chanter in the group, you may want to have them tash.  After the defuff, cast yer slow.  If there is a Beastlord in the group, they will often land a slow 1st, then you can delay a tad more before landing yours (hence letting others build more aggro 1st).<br />
<br />
Even though I tend to slow immediately on pulls to camp, I do not usually get summoned until the 2nd or 3rd resist of slow.  If you are getting summoned after 1st resist of slow, maybe your tank is using a very slow 2hander and has not built up taunt yet?  Not sure from your post how many resists you had before summons.<br />
<br />
As for what happens after you get summoned, I usually stand there and take a beating til the mob is taunted of me, then I wait a minute or two before attempting to slow again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My usual tactics are somewhat situational. <br />
<br />
1) Mob summons me on SUCCESSFUL slow: I grin and stand there a sec or two and let tanks get firm taunt, then slowly move away.<br />
<br />
2) Mob summons me on UNSUCCESSFUL slow: I wait for warrior to get taunt back then reslow THEN move away. unless:<br />
         a) the tank is getting eaten do fast that an immediate slow is required for the survival of the group. - slow immediately <br />
         b) Mob does an AE attack then I move awybefore slowing unless above applies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm doing it wrong too , I don't know. /shrug seems to work ok. <br />
Some warriors get real upset about casters getting hit, untill they realize that I'm not a druid I can take a hit or two  :cool: <br />
<br />
btw for the record I'm currently level 59 and counting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i keel these guys pretty regular and am also 61.  i usually open with malosini then slow, if resisted or it lands pretty much i get summoned, esp with warrior tanking.   if resisted i just click slow till it refreshes hehe, and i've never died at this camp, well there was the once when me and ranger were alternating tankin em but thats different  :D .<br />
but ya i just stand right there where they summoned me , maybe move a bit where they're not hittin me in the back, till i can re cast slow.  with them hittin for 656 a pop even the tanks are mana sponges with em not slowed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And you could always Torpor (or Stoicism if you don't have Torpor yet) yourself on the puller's &quot;Incoming!!!&quot; message so that if you do get summoned you've got the extra bit of regen reducing the severity of the beating you're taking.<br />
<br />
In general I find it best to debuff on pull, and spam slow as soon as possible.  Especially if you've got a warrior tanking.  You'll get high on the hate list, the warrior will taunt and get to hate list + 1, this'll leave a nice cusion for the rogues and nukers to not have to worry about aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this may change a lot if they make the changes they're talking about regarding proximity-dependent aggro, but...<br />
<br />
Even with summoning mobs (especially with summoning mobs?) I find that a quick root will do wonders to help keep the aggro where it belongs.  I'll still stand behind the tank's shoulder while I cast, though.  It's important that the critter not be standing inside you as you cast, since a lot of your aggro depends on how close you are to the mob.<br />
<br />
I try to position myself so that if the mob wants to hit me, it has to stand directly in front of or on top of the tank, giving the meat shield the most proximity-aggro that I possibly can, while avoiding ping pong.<br />
<br />
I'd rather take a couple hits and save my group 1 CH per mob than play it stupid-safe and never get touched.  Maybe the group thought you were an enchanter, fragile to slow before the mob's health is at 80%.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I get resisted on a slow attempt I'll usually tell my group.  That way there are no surprises because a) cleric knows to step up the heals  b) chanter or another debuffer knows to debuff quickly and c) when I attempt to slow again there are no surprises because everyone knows the ungodly aggro slow creates.<br />
<br />
usually I'll attempt to debuff the mob first though so I don't get resisted.  If debuff is resisted then I'll attempt a slow anyway unless it's a raid situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stand your ground by the tank so he dosent have to chase it all over. Recast slow when able if you get aggro agine no biggie your by the tank. Once the tank has aggro back out wait a few befor casting anything eals and dont sit :P</div></div><hr />
