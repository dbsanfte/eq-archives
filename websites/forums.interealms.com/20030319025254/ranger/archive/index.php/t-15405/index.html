I would like to know where to start the Quest for Tolans bracer  , hehe with the Fletch Nerf and I'm only at 180 on it  , I would like this reallly bad any info would be Great  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a quest and it is easier then getting the thing to drop.  Don't let these guys fool you.  <br />
<br />
Here is the quest.  Round up 4 to 8K (varies depending on server), go to the bazaar and search for Tolan's Bracer.  Now the hard part.  Once you find the name of the Player-NPC selling it you have to find your way to him or her in the maze of people in the bazaar.  Don't worry this is only about as difficult as trying to find help during the christmas rush at your local department store.  Once you find him browze his wares till you see Tolan's Bracer.  Click on it and hit buy.  You now have Tolan's Bracer much easier then camping for it and time frame wise it is a much better deal this way.<br />

Oh and /Bonk :)</div></div><hr />

Heh, I wish it was this easy.<br />
<br />
In 60 levels on Kane I have seen exactly one Tolans bracer in the bazaar - and it was 65k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">man i think all prices are inflated on brell.... lost you are most likely to see on a tolan's bracer in bazaar or otherwise is 9k .... and that is rare, normally 10-10.5k :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What's the drop rate of the bracer off Brogg btw?<br />
I went to Sebilis for him last night but he wasn't up and i was so unlucky to spam 2 ph and then had to go as it was quite late.<br />
I WANT the bracer, and as he's not that difficult to reach I do not want to buy it for 10-15k!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulamwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I saw 2 bracers drop in about 15 Brogg killings.  It's a fairly rare drop.<br />
<br />
I was actually 0 for 12 or so before I saw 2 drop from 3 kills in the same night.........haven't been down to kill him since</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ilystil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've only ever seen 1 bracer off Brogg in about 40 kills or so. I hate that bastard with a passion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Depending on your server, watch out for the placeholder. The PH sells the bracer at 3x the normal value. Often times the PH's name is something like &quot;Leetnecromule&quot;.<br />
<br />
The vendor you do want is usually a ranger with EQ or a confused cleric who thinks it's more trash Kunark class armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gendias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">woot! after 2 weeks of camping in the Bazaar I finally completed my Tolan's Bracer quest... was a bit expensive.... but well worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>akgriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Woooot gratz , hehe hopefully soon I will have one but the first part is kinda a pain and I know that if I go to OS it will drop on the first spawn  ..wait am I wakeing up now  shoot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tinolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Still camping the PH in the bazaar, anyone know his spawn cycle as ive yet to see him spawn, plus is he on the same spawn cycle as the Jade Reaver merchant :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seeker39</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You guys are killing me. How hard is it to camp the bracer. What kind of timer is it on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tolan's Bracer drops off Brogg in D2 in Sebilis, it's a rare drop, and Brogg has placeholders.  If you camp D2 for six hours straight, you'll have maybe a 33% chance of seeing a bracer drop.  Respawn time is the same as the rest of Sebilis, 22 minutes or 26 minutes, I forget which.  Brogg spawns all the way at the end of the tunnel, which you enter through the hidden wall in the back of the library.  Be careful pulling him or you might get adds from inside his room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Akgriz, They dropped to 5500pp on Vaz already?  They were like 10k-12k when I was looking not all too long ago hehe.  I think in September or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>akgriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya was only 1 when I saw it and no one was on for my Guild to help me with The Plat :(.....and I have not seen  the Place holder in the bazaar..LOL so will prolly Look at going to OS and camping there for a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kyrviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got one for 600pp about 3 weeks ago..I love it when people forget zeroes on their bazaar prices =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>akgriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OMG  you lucky *&amp;^%^  Gratz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Terakkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I saw 2 drop off in a row off Brogg, 3rd time was the crappy shield though, But I got me one to sell amd make a profit off of gettign my investment back on the first one I had bought a few months previously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I camped it for a long long time. Finally just bought it about a year ago for 6k off a shaman I think who got it for his ranger twink and then found out it wouldn't work till 46.<br />
<br />
Right after I bought it I saw 3 drop in a weeks time, but at least all 3 went to guild rangers at the time.<br />
<br />
On Torv for a while the bottom fell outta the price when a bunch hit the /bazaar after people started getting endless quiver. I'd say 5kish on torv.</div></div><hr />
