<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>littlra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting to put together some resist gear and I thought a good place to start would be some BD stuff.  A few questions:<br />
<br />
1) What is customary to give to a chanter, just the diamond or also the metal?<br />
<br />
2) How much should I expect to pay?<br />
<br />
3) Should I request a certain level of jewler to make these items?<br />
<br />
4) How failure can I expect?<br />
<br />
Any other resist gear tips?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mez have BD resist gear but mez just buy it outright....  mez know of other people that gave materials to chanter for da combine but it was a guild (alliance) chanter did da work.<br />
<br />
1) mez think yoo give both DB and metals<br />
2) pay depends on faction with chanter...  if in guild nothing else a 100 200p or so.<br />
3) only get a 250 gm to do it...  BD bracer is not trivial at 250.<br />
4) not sure on failure.<br />
<br />
Tips:  dem BD are going up fast in price now that a lot of trade skills use dem for uber items.  If you got da BDs yoo lucky and the price of BD resist gear is going up also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 must have shaman resists items<br />

1: Stone of Morid<br />
2: Crown of the Froglock Kings<br />
3: Sarnak Battle Shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im not sure on failure rate, but what i would recomend is grouping with the chanter while he combines, it will give you a message if he succeeded or failed if your grouped, then you dont hafta worry about getting ripped off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If yer after Blue Diamond Jewelry go for second hand stuff. It's going for penies on the dollar any more compared to having it made up. Check your server message boards for current prices and availability (there's been a ton of it available on Tholuxe latley). Right now the BD's are becoming totaly imposible to find, in the last week the only guy I found that had any for sale was asking 3K apiece for them ( I laughed, hard), and I hear the average price is starting to normalize between 1 and 1.5 K on most all of the servers if you can find them. I almost wish there were a way of canibalizing the gems back from the old jewlery, it would be cheaper. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
