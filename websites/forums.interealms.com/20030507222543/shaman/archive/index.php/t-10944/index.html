<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tooncis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.. <br />
I am currently a 52 shammy on Tunare and well I have been struggling with the issue of what is a good wisdom for me. For many years the rule has been over 200 is a waste cause of the soft cap placed on wis but that was when the cap for wis was 255.. now that conceivably you can get something like 355 wis has the soft cap been raised or even elimated or not changed at all. <br />
If anyone has any info it would be a great help... <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not entirely sure what your asking.<br />
<br />
You can only get to 355 wis with lvl 65 and max planar power as far as i know<br />
<br />
As for the soft cap, I think it's still in place.  I have a level 65 cleric friend with a good bit of AA and 355 wis that said it didn't help that much.<br />
<br />
You should be ok with around 200 wis though, it's not as important for a shaman as, say, a cleric or druid.  And honestly, with that much wis after 255, it will come with levels if your in a raiding guild and go on raids enough.  Most of the higher end gear for shamans has wis on it anyway..I had about 130 wis in 30s, and now without trying at all (never looked for wis on gear) I'm nearly to 180.<br />
good luck, sorry if that wasn't too much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 50 you get 10 mana per point of wisdom<br />
At 60 its 12<br />
Above 200 mana at 60+, each point of wisdom is worth 6 mana<br />
Above 255 I believe it drops even more<br />
<br />
To test it, create a magelo profile and plug in the numbers/equipment to figure out what your mana pool would be and what each additional wisom would do for you.</div></div><hr />
