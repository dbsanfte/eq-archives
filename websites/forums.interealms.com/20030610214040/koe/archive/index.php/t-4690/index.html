And Frankly what happend last night I don't feel compelled to even do my epic.  I put people in a total cluster #$#@.  I messed up last night, and no matter how many times I apoligized I still felt bad. <br />
<br />
That being that FG's Started to pop right after we failed, And we had to assemble and take them out soon as possible. I didn't want to take Toke away from his camp last night, but he came and rezed the people.  (thnx bro)</div></div><hr />
