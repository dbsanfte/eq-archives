<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild's getting our first shot at Aary tonight.  Should be fun, wish me luck landing Turgurs  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck! I remember my first ntov raid.. and every ntov raid after that. Call me crazy, but I love killin there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hope its not too late to post some advice after facing off against the beast myself.<br />
<br />
First you got to be right underneath Aary to get slow off.  This likely means you're going to get hit by the mana drain.  So make sure you have someone in your group to heal the rest of them, because you will be OOM after slowing.<br />
<br />
Second, after slowing Aary, you will want to canni back your drained mana for when you have to reslow.  However do not do this until the mana drain wears off, or else you'll just be wasting HPs.<br />
<br />
Anyways, hope this little bit helps, good luck tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good luck!  As you probably know Aary is the key to NToV.  If you guys can kill Aary the rest is much easier excluding the Vulak event of course.  The fight will probably last around 10-20 minutes or at least it did when we were in NToV.  After Malos/malosinia and tash you shouldn't have too much trouble with slowing.  Just don't forget to refresh the slow before it wears off.  I usually refreshed slow every 5 minutes to be safe.  Also, don't forget Radiant Cure can get rid of his ae mana drain.  Its fairly random but it does work sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can do Aary, the only dragins you will have a problem with is Vyemm and Lady Nev.  Vyemm has a nasty knockback and is a pain to slow (disease only).  Lady Nev is more of a endurance fight.  I ended up making a macro key to sit, stand, and attack because of her AE.<br />
<br />
Every other dragon fight on the front side of NToV is about positioning, be it the dragon or raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't have to have the mana drain on you just watch the spell spam and run in after it's gone off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GOod luck! If I have any advice....<br />
<br />
1) remind all your melees the success of the fight is dependant on two things, knights picking up the chickens as they respawn, and positioning Aary around the corner.<br />
<br />
2) grind out 2 aa before aary if you dont already have Radient Cure. I found it had a 50%ish chance of taking off the curse that drains mana. You will get hit by it unless your timing is immaculate.<br />
<br />
Have fun, its a very important fight... once aary is under your belt the rest of NTOV is open to your pillaging. Plus he drops a badass neck piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">GOOD luck on aary.<br />
<br />
HEHE we killed in NOTV last weekend (we were about 25 for the raid.<br />
<br />
about lady nev: it was a long fight for us (i casted 3 slows),i was chain casting quiescence and fast  heal to the one who needed  some heals.due the lack of clerics.<br />
<br />
i don t know how many Q i landed (maybe 40+ and some fast heal also),but when we killed her.i was  still at 90 percent mana P. i love to be a shaman sometime :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">good luck, word of advice get magic resist to around 200+ and resist his drain completely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">good luck, word of advice get magic resist to around 200+ and resist his drain completely<br />
<br />
200+ was not enough at level 60ish IIRC.  Maybe at 65 it would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Took Aary down on the first pull with 26 people, avg level of 62.  About an 18 minute fight, with no losses thanks to some superb tanking and positioning by the MT and a rock solid rotation by our clerics.  <br />
<br />
Grats to all my brothers and sisters in Dragonchow and Shade of Hope.  North Wing, here we come!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats! beating Aary is a huge step for any guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grats on Aary, it really is a big step forward. First time you see Aary spread his wings and charge down the hall at you rates as one of the top EQ moments imo ;)<br />
<br />
My favorite AAry experience (about a year ago) was having slow wear off at 3% after being manadrained trying to reslow as only shaman; guildleader screaming 'nuke nuke' as aary killed half the melees :P</div></div><hr />
