<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail !<br />
<br />
I have been talking with the druids in my guild about priest balancing and what they feel would be appropriate and then in turn what I would feel can help the shaman class.<br />
<br />
I honestly can not with a clear concious say we &quot;need&quot; anything.  A shaman with a full spellbook is pretty powerful.<br />
<br />
Here is my &quot;wish list&quot; that I have thought up.<br />
<br />
Increase the epic range up to JBB range.<br />
<br />
Increase the ability to channel when casting the epic.<br />
<br />
Add a command toggle of /topor 1 that would allow us to use topor on non group members who have it enabled.<br />
<br />
Puppy should have innate Spirit of Wolf<br />
<br />
Remove the level restriction levitation and everlasting breath<br />
(or)<br />
Remove the level restriction on all spells.<br />
<br />
Remove the Direct Damage Component of all all DoTs.<br />
<br />
Incease the damage to mana ratio of all our DoTs drastically.  They should be 1/3 to even 1/2 better ratio then they are now.<br />
<br />
Give shamans a small bonus to healing spells to help make up for the times we are primary healer.<br />
<br />
Give shamans an additional line of buffs that are pure +attack.<br />
<br />
Give shamans a 50percent experience rez at level 50 and a 75percent at level 60.<br />
<br />
Once I get a few comments on these and have others add some new ones I will post it in the developers forum and every day retype it by hand using /feedback.  My hope is it will at least be looked at during the re-balancing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rezes?  I dunno about that.  Personally, I don't really want to rez.  I have a cleric for that ;)<br />
<br />
However, I DO agree with allowing Torpor to be cast upon non-group members.  I know why they put the restriction on it, because of the snare component and messing with people in game, but it really is a severe limitation on an otherwise excellent spell.<br />
<br />
SoW on my puppy...damn right!  Why my WOLF doesn't have Spirit of WOLF on him innately is stupid and lazy.<br />
<br />
Taking the level restrictions off of Everlasting Breath and Levitation is another good idea.  Silly not to be able to cast it upon other lower level toons.<br />
<br />
Increasing the range on the epic, another good idea.<br />
<br />
I can see keeping the level restriction on some spells.  While I like to cast group focus on a group of toons sitting at the derv camp in NRO, I don't really see them releasing that restriction.<br />
<br />
Instead of a bonus to heals, I would prefer a group heal spell in line with Healing Wave of Prexus for paladins. Even if its level 60 or 56+, I think it would be a welcome, very useful, and not entirely unbalancing addition to our spell book.<br />
<br />
An atk only line of spells?  I think rangers have that area covered, don't they?<br />
<br />
Increasing the damage ratio on our dots?  Aren't they insane enough as it is?  I mean we can theoretically stack Bane, Ebolt, Epic, Plague, and Pox all at once.  Bane and Ebolt twice in the time it will take Plague and Pox to run thru.  Thats alot of damage for relatively little mana.  However, removing the DD component is a wise idea.  Less resists.  Highly doubt they'll do that, as they won't even do that for the druid epic.  Why would they do it for unlucky shamans? :P<br />
<br />
I thought we already had the ability to channel with the epic?  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you, but is not channeling the ability to maintain concentration when casting a spell?  I know I've continued casting my epic many times while getting beat upon.<br />
<br />
Really, the only thing I REALLY REALLY want?  Up the drop rates a bit more just on the 'uber rare 6', especially Torpor and Malo.  Class defining spells such as these two shouldn't be that rare. :( I've bought Torpor, and have enough for Malo, but after two months of constant auctioning, I have yet to see it for sale. :P (Yes, I know thats not a long time to wait for that spell).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like cheese!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I honestly think that any input that involves giving a non-rezzing class rez (or non-clerics cheal) gets immediately discounted.  We don't need it.<br />
<br />
The dot stuff i think is a little too wishful as well, I think that the initial damage while annoying for us, is a balancing feature in their game scheme.  <br />
<br />
Out-of-party torpor would be very cool to have, but I'm not holding my breath.  /allowtorpor  is an interesting idea of getting around the possible negative side-effects though. :)<br />
<br />
Pure ATK spells? Doubt it, since they just removed it from the one spell we DID have it on. <br />
<br />
I don't have my epic, so I can't comment on the range issues of it. VI has been pretty resistant to any changes to epics though, I know that necros and druids have been asking for a change to theirs for a very long time.<br />
<br />
I'm on board with removing the 10%-healing hit that shamans/druids receive; that is a relic of a long-gone era. Also, dogdog with innate sow would make me happy, even though I know all it would allow him to do is wander off and train me faster :D <br />
<br />
All in all, I am kinda hesitant to ask for much as a shaman. I think we are hands down the best off of any priest in terms of solo, small group, full group, and raid-level desireability.  A tweak here or there, but I'd prefer to save my chips to cash in later down the road, if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basically, the board agreed we could not agree on what improvements (if any) shaman needed.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Summon Companion pretty much negates the need for puppy sow, who wants their stupid pet to be running around anywhere?  Park and call, park and call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hiho,<br />
<br />
first you have to keep in mind that Verant wants a lot of single persons to write in request, not any form of petitions.<br />
Further keep in mind the &quot;grand scheme&quot; of EQ, balancing between classes.<br />
<br />
On to your suggestions:<br />
<br />
&gt;Increase the epic range up to JBB range. <br />
While I can understand that the range of epic is very small, I don't have many problems with getting the epic to some use.<br />
<br />
&gt;Increase the ability to channel when casting the epic<br />
Problem with interrupts of the Epic cast is the long casting time. Channeling is used on this cast as every other cast, so I don't see how Verant could change that without changing/upgrading channelingon a grand scale.<br />
<br />
&gt;Add a command toggle of /torpor 1 that would allow us to use topor on non group members who have it enabled<br />
As I see it there are 2 situations where Torpor is used out of groups: First when PLing (from Lvl 44 up .. this is something Verant wants to avoid I think), second on raids.  You can work around this on raids in a few ways. Would be nice to have to make things easier. But who wants that ?<br />
<br />
&gt;Puppy should have innate Spirit of Wolf <br />
Again nice to have .. but it does not hurt too much to SoW the pet from time to time. Problem with inate SoW will be indoors, how to handle inate SoW speed there ?<br />
<br />
&gt;Remove the level restriction levitation and everlasting breath <br />
Yep, agreed, this one is strange. Has something to do with us casting Lvl 51+ buffs on other chars in general. Guess they won't change that to keep PLing a bit down (still easy to do wth group buffs)<br />
<br />
&gt;Remove the Direct Damage Component of all all DoTs. <br />
We asked for this quite often, never got any answer to it. Would really like to get an answer to this problem from verant.<br />
<br />
&gt;Incease the damage to mana ratio of all our DoTs drastically. They should be 1/3 to even 1/2 better ratio then they are now.<br />
Hmm, where would that lead us ? To the point that we can solo more easily as we do now. I guess Verant does not want to give us more solo ability.<br />
<br />
&gt;Give shamans a small bonus to healing spells to help make up for the times we are primary healer. <br />
They should just remove the healing penalty for non-clerics after a specific LVL (like 51+). This won't endanger clerics for their spots in XP groups (and definetly not on raids), but wil make a cleric in lower LVLs still wanted.<br />
<br />
&gt;Give shamans an additional line of buffs that are pure +attack.<br />
Hmm, stacking issues come to mind, which would have to be solved. Otherwise I can buff ATK with STR buffs, so what ?<br />
<br />
&gt;Give shamans a 50percent experience rez at level 50 and a 75percent at level 60. <br />
NO WAY. Thats the job of cleric (and paladins), I see no way we are getting stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Now some suggestions (most are on the wanted list on this forum since some time):<br />
<br />
-Stackability of DoTs from different shamans<br />
-Remove those stupid AA skills like /pet hold and add useful ones (like a lure slow for 50% usable all 72 minutes). As stated by verant we are no pet class, so no use in those AA skills. Make rabid bear reusable more often or increase the duration.<br />
-Check spell drops again. Think about moving the class defining spells from big raid encounter to hard mobs which can be done by 2 or 3 groups. It is still too difficult to get spells like Torpor or Malo for the average shaman. Remove spells like Malosini from mob drop tables.<br />
-Try to improve stackability of shamans on raids. On most raids 2 shaman are fine, 3 still do, after that all other shaman act as secondary healer (in which they are inferior to LVL 60 druids). A quick thought comes to my mind that shamans get an ability that they can combine 4-6 shamans so they can cast some Uber buff for example on the entire raid.<br />
<br />
Thats it for now.<br />

 I get enough tells for buffs and groups...I dont want tells for rezzes... Shamans are awesome in groups and in solo..what more could you possibly want..<br />

<br />
I want them to make malo and torpor more readily available.  I also want them to make my dots stack with dots from other shamans, so that we can do damage on raids if there is no healing, buffing, or debuffing to be done.  I don't really like my epic effect and would like it to be something more fitting... like a slow.  That, however, is just wishful thinking and it is not going to happen.  Other than these points, I am completely satisfied with my class and wouldnt change a thing.<br />

My reasoning is that all other classes gain their class definining abilities through leveling. Level up and a monk gets stone stance automatically. Level up and a rogue gets backstab automatically. Level up as a caster and either hope for a random drop or spend ours in EC auctioning for your class defining abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My 2cp worth is - the shaman class doesn't need major changes, just a few tweaks. More common spell drops would be nice, although at lvl 55 I don't know about this problem first hand yet.<br />
<br />
The one major change I'd ask for is allowing the same DoT cast by 2 people to stack, but that wouldn't be a shaman change if they did it, it would be a change to all DoTs I imagine.</div></div><hr />

  Change Avatar.  I don't like the spell too much as it is.  6 minutes only, and it is raising stats which are for the most part capped.   <br />
<br />
   I propose making it or an AA form of it sort of a Shammie Manaburn.   Lasts for 18 seconds, and adds something like mana/5 to the targets ATK rating.  Make it black out our spells for as long as Rage does, and we would be kept from Canni 5 + Torporing up, and give it a nice long recast time (like an EQ day or so).<br />
<br />
  That, is the kind of AA I would like on a shammie.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that clerics are priests, don't you?  I think our class is just about right (if they can get dot stacking to work).  But to say that we are more desirable than Clerics on raids is just plain crazy.<br />
<br />
Please, no more buffs.  They give us another +100 ATK buff, then they buff all the mobs (at least the new ones) so that you need it to kill them, then Uggok has to do more clicky-clicky-clicky for no net benefit.  No thanks.<br />
<br />
One thing that I would like to see.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT SHRINK.  I HATE that buggy, group only, pain-in-the-ass-yet-practically-required-in-some-places spell.  Please, give everyone in the game a cheap, unlimited charge shrink item.  Or at least give me (and chanters) a targetable, check-box group shrink spell.</div></div><hr />

---<br />
<br />
You're right, I worded that ambiguously. What I meant is that we have the best mix of all of the above.  We can do any of these quite well, whereas the other priests have holes. (Clerics solo, for instance. Or druids in raids.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think all current dropped casters spells should be obtainable via quest,  except the 'ancient line'.

<br />
Another thing; I hear the 'non-cleric healing penalty' thing bantered about, what is that exactly?<br />
<br />
I personally tend to enjoy the 'wish list' type of posts.  My ideas of what we need as a class tends to change a bit as I level up and raid more.    Having been the infamous 4th shaman on a raid alot lately, I totally agree with the need for us to have something else to do.    DD's would be very nice.  A better range of Poison and Disease based DDs would be excellent.  I find myself nuking alot on raids ;p<br />
<br />
Additional debuffing duties is also up there on my list of 'wants'.  As is slightly better healing ability.  Every group should not REQUIRE a cleric damn it!  There aren't that many of 'em around./<br />
And I have dreams of a 75% rez potion.. Hehe.. dreams I said.. dreams.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hail,<br />
<br />
As a shaman about halfway through 53, with JBB, my beloved glue-factory pony, Fungi, and still w/o epic, I really can't ask for any caster balancing issues.  I am immensely powerful compared to most classes.  Much of the inherent power is gear driven I'd admit, but even w/o it we are very powerful.<br />
<br />
A better DD nuke would be nice, but I'm not going to whine about it.  Icestrike is on my horizon, which will probably be just fine for me.  A group healing wave type spell would also be nice.  A better AOE would be fun.  BUT IT IS NOT worth complaining about in my eyes.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing I would really like addressed off the top of my head is ALCHEMY! <br />
1) Increase vendor sell-back to 80-90% of the component costs.  <br />
(Keep vendor buy prices of shaman potions astronomical.)<br />
2) Allow us to make 5 &amp; 10 shot versions of the vendor buyable potions (invis, etc) in our POTION bag, even if we can't make the potions ourselves.  <br />
3) Allow us to make the potions that are already available from vendors.  Make some of the ingredients loot only if they must (would prefer all store-bought), but let us make these potions!<br />
<br />
That's all.  I love my class, and would have no other.  All my twinks gather dust until called upon to help others, and it is usually drudgery to play them.  (Although the monkey is fun to play sometimes...)  We don't NEED any upgrades.  The less Verant looks at us (except for alchemy), the better. ;)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

The other day I needed to lev some newbies in Seru who had gotten stuck in a buggy fountain. I couldn't, however, cast my lev spell on them. Of course, since I got Levitation, I've never even bothered to carry batwings. I had to ask them if they had any. I looked like the biggest dip**** shaman in the world. :P<br />
<br />
Give me something to do with this copy of Protection of the Cabbage I'm toting around. At least let me turn it in for the droppable components for the 'just spell' version of the quest that druids can do so they can 'buy' the spell for 750 pp rather than doing the long tradeskill quest. This'd at least allow me to give the damn spell away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">1. Better nuke. About 800-ish would do me nicely, and I don't care what level I get it OR what &quot;element&quot; it's based on. Personally I'd prefer disease because then I'd get to carry around my own uber Tash... but whatever. It'd help me solo though... so not likely.<br />
<br />
2. DDs taken off DoTs. Maybe then I'd actually USE them instead of not bothering because I know it's 50/50 whether it'll actually land (the RNG hates me) and that's mana I could be slowing with. Plus, JBB + Epic is infintely more damage for ZERO mana. It'd help me solo though... so it'll never happen. Meh.<br />
<br />
3. SoW on Dogdog. With the new changes I only Summon him when he fails to ever arrive... normally because he got left behind. If he could keep up with me though (Run3 &gt; Run0) then that wouldn't happen as much. He doesn't path all that bad if you shrink him, and besides... the mobs can sow indoors! Why can't Dogdog?! But I don't really care about that either. If he's not where you want him to be, Summon him. I just hate memming sow ever since I got The Boots(tm).<br />
<br />
And yeah... I hate Druids whenever I don't want a port. A class that can't actually DO anything, and yet they swarm all over the place. All they have to offer me is Snare and Ports... and I'd rather have a Ranger/SK/Necro snaring anyway. What REALLY gets me though is SoE. WHY O WHY do they get SoE?! I get sow one whole spell level earlier dangit! Plus I never get Group Regen/Chloro. Grrr... THAT is why I hate druids. :mad:<br />
<br />
And I still don't want a Lure Slow. If 3-4 Shaman can't stick slow after Malo/Tash/Occlude/Malosini in a few casts then the mob is either slow immune (/boggle... talk about shaman stacking on raids) or the MR is so stupidly high the Lure would bounce anyway. It's only 66% as effective anyway. How often do you cast Togors? Seems to stick more the Tugurs, but it's still at the back of the book.<br />

But I'm not raiding in Vex Thal so what would I know... :confused:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Clerics can buy their Celestial Elixir from a Vendor.  It is more powerful than Torpor - same healing effect but no snare / slow.  Both Torpor and CE are from Kunark, but shamans have to get lucky with a drop or get gouged on price from some jackhole that got lucky on a drop.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that a lower level, lower power version of Torpor be introduced, and make it vendor purchasable.  Something similar to Celestial Healing and be obtained at level 52-ish.  This type of spell would probably have the slow/snare effect, which is fine in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
There's not much else necessary to balance shamans.  Ressurrection would be a nice ability, but it isn't something that would &quot;balance&quot; the class.  <br />
<br />
Solo:  One of the most powerful classes in terms of solo ability.  Only necros and some enchanters can claim the same solo kills.<br />
<br />
Group:  One of the most powerful classes in a single group.  Slows mitigate damage quite well, to the point that healing can be done by the shaman themself or a druid.  Buffs are very desirable, no matter how 'useless' tests may claim.  Of course, HP buffs are never useless :).<br />
<br />
Raid:  Very potent class, but not required.  Enchanters can slow mobs fine, and mages can fill in with Mala.  The HP buffs are very strong, thouh Avatar is useless to most top tier guilds since their melees have primal weapons.</div></div><hr />

Oh, that's right they don't get those types of spells.  Because they're a different class.  They also don't get the massive mana regeneration ability that we get either.  You can't take two spells, compare them, and say that the classes are imbalanced based on that alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even without these upgrades it's easy for us to solo, but it adds a small amount of danger that makes the life as a shaman a bit tastier.<br />
<br />
and we don't really need better heals or rezzes either. sure, considering highlvl raids you realize that a shaman doesn't have big healing abilities (except in his group with torpor), but it's not intended that one class should be able to do everything :p<br />

This is not a petition.  I never inferred it to be nor will I be submitting in petition form.  All I wanted was to bounce the ideas off other shamans and see what they would add.<br />
<br />
Is it a wishlist ?  Sure.  Will we get most of it ?  Probably not, but that is not the point.  The point is that people need to send VI feedback.<br />
<br />
I do at least one or two feedbacks every day I play.  I have done this since June 1999.  I do probably a /bug every week.  Why ?  Because /feedback is the system that VI gave us to talk to them.  I have submitted certain feedbacks via the developers corner too.<br />

The only two things I'm going to comment on is someone said that SoW speed wolf's indoors would not work.  Ever seen the Magician Epic pet ?  It has SoW speed innate and it works just fine in dungeons. Also the channeling with the epic.  If you have an epic and you have a JBB you know that channeling with a JBB is very easy even when getting hit a lot.  Channeling with the epic is very difficult.<br />

Hail !<br />
<br />
I have been talking with the druids in my guild about priest balancing <br />
<br />
Like someone else said...don't! Many druids seem to think that being second or third best at most tasks in game isn't good enough. Druids want to be best at 2 or 3 main roles, and then second or third best at the rest. ;)<br />
<br />
How's that for generalizations? <br />
<br />
The horrible thing is, I actually kinda feel that way. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Heh, having the best slow in the game by 5% is NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING, compared to Complete Heal and Res, the most game-breakingly powerful spells in the game.  <br />
<br />
CH: the entire raid game is centered around this vendor-bought, level 39 spell.<br />
<br />
RES: hours of gameplay restored at the snap of a finger.<br />
<br />
These two abilities are more powerful than everything else in the game by many, many orders of magnitude, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said, shams are pretty much fine by me since they fixed the spell drops.  Would like to see less drudgery on the shrink front and more raid stackability via stacking dots.<br />
<br />
But to compare slows to CH or res is a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yes, I would agree that CH and rez are two of the most powerful spells in the game.  <br />
<br />
That being said, why don't I play a cleric?  Why wouldn't I want to have access to the two most powerful spells in the game?  Why don't you play a cleric?<br />
<br />
Maybe that's because it's ALL they have, and I can't imagine a more painfully boring class to play.  Plus, they trade great power for being pretty helpless in a lot of situations.  No lev, no invis, no sow...huge difficulties traveling (of course, they do have gate/root/DB).<br />
<br />
Everything involves trade off and balance.  Clerics get what are arguably the two most powerful spells in the game but pay a price in monotony and helplessness.  Shaman, well, we just get to be really good at lots of different things, a very well rounded and balanced class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Mukas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">[i]Raid:  Very potent class, but not required.  Enchanters can slow mobs fine, and mages can fill in with Mala.  The HP buffs are very strong, thouh Avatar is useless to most top tier guilds since their melees have primal weapons. [/B]<br />
<br />
I suppose in a raid environment if you didn't have a shaman you could have those classes fill in. If you are leading a raid without a shaman I would question your knowledge of raiding environments first off. I am kind of dissappointed that as a member of the shaman community you would make a statement like that.<br />
<br />
In my raiding environment if I am the only shaman in Vex Thal I am getting worked over by buff requests and debuffing pretty hard. As it is we have one shaman who doesn't have malo. So if it is him and one of the 3 other shaman in my guild we are worked over good. With all 4 of us in attendance we are very effective and actually contribute to speeding up a raid greatly. The last standing shaman in a wipeout can mean the difference from coffin time and advancing forward.<br />
<br />
In luclin things have changed quite a bit from Velious. While enchanters indeed can slow in place of a shaman, crowd control(ie locking a mob down with mezz), tashing, buffing and sieving mana is what my enchanters are mainly doing. Along with the number of other things an enchanter with high alternate advancement can do. We can take a punch alot better than an enchanter can in most cases so slowing I would catergorize as a shaman duty.<br />
<br />
Mages are the difference in most raids for us. We have 3 and I guarantee you they will let us malo all day long. They do follow up with malosini very quickly. The long crawls we have from boss to boss in Vex Thal our mages will nuke, make mod rods, pet up and do whatever else they do. A good back up for shaman but unreplaceable in an hour long fight with a mob that has 3 or 4 million hp and can kill an entire raid if heals are not flowing and on time. Mod rod 2 is the one utility item that can bail a bad situation out. Most time mod rod management can make or break a raid.<br />
<br />
Most of our main melee have primal, heck even I have primal. They switch out their weapons all the time for this buff. I on occasion keep both my avatars up if a ranger requests it cause he doesn't have a primal bow. Even our Main tank will request because the extra dex can help a blade of carnage proc that much faster.<br />
<br />
If myself and my other shaman aren't online for Vex Thal I would wager that not many mobs will die in an evening. We have cleared it twice over and it is a complete team effort. To say one class is replaceable wouldn't be accurate given any class you insert. We are a considerably small crew of 48ish at any time during our entry to Vex Thal until our exit after Aten Ha Ra dies and her guards die after that.<br />
<br />
Forgive me if I sound braggish on any of this but I think it is laughable to say a shaman is not required for a raid to happen. I consider myself a good shaman with mad skillz but I am only as good as my shaman counterparts on my team. We are basically a team, heck even redundant. Mobs are slowed twice, even three times over cause one unslowed mob or undebuffed mob can mean an hour of summon time or perhaps even more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I think it's a huge paradigm shift that a large number of high level shaman are slowly reaching.<br />
<br />
It's no longer only one shaman needed to malo/slow and the rest are redundant (at least in my opinion).  In my guild, it's no longer &quot;single shaman on slow,&quot; it's one shaman on malo, then EVERYONE slows til it hits. <br />
<br />
We are powerhouses of mana generation when grouped with mages, we are insanely powerful in large fights since torpor keeps mod rodding clerics alive.  Torpor is excellent for casters as well, heck, I'll even cast it on melees if all the clerics are busy in a CH cycle.  In nearly all cases, if a fight wipes out, my group is the last alive.<br />
<br />
I truely feel that shaman have a unique and powerful place in fights that last 30+ minutes.  It may not be what we've done before, but that doesn't make it less valuable.<br />
<br />
It's tough for us to make this shift because for so long the slowing shaman had a &quot;rock star&quot; role in the raid, when the mob was slowed, everyone cheered!  Now, it's important for me to look beyond that to WHAT I can do to make the raid successful.  If it's unglamorous mod rod making or cleric healing, so be it.  All that matters is if we win, not if I made the winning play that brought the crowd to their feet.<br />

Screw Alchemy.  They've so consistantly got it fubar'd that I've given up any hope or interest.  So be it.<br />
<br />
What I do want to see is a new DD spell (800ish range) preferably in poison or fire.  We've got cold spells out the wazoo (which makes me wonder--since they seem to view barbarians as the quinticential shaman prototype--why would a barbarian from halas use a cold spell on creatures that live in everfrost???  Can we say resists???).  As for fire, well we get burst of flame.  Nothing else fire related ever showed up. &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing a better DoT either.  Sure, now we have caster focus items, but still.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I find it kind of offensive that shaman have not received a 50+ offensive spell upgrade since kunark.  Other classes get upgrades.  We get utility spells.  I can see maybe 1 expansion with no damage upgrade, but two?!?  (Let's not even mention Ancient Spells--I'm starting to think that even VI has come to the realization that ancient spells are a total ass move.  Maybe that's why no one ever sees them.)<br />
<br />
Don't try to tell me it's because we are so phenominally overpowered.  VI screwed us.  I would be willing to bet they didn't even notice that shaman did not get so much as one new offensive spell.  It may not be an active nerf, but we got nerfed all the same.<br />
<br />
Aside from the damage thing, there are a few issues that should be addressed--non-clerics should have that healing penalty removed post 50.  As it stands, clerics get a bonus AND we get a penalty.  I don't really see the need for both.<br />

<br />
Why disappointed? Maybe it's the truth or not far from it?<br />
<br />
Unique and useful things a shaman brings to raid:<br />
- Focus of Spirit<br />
- RH/Brute<br />
- Torpor (CE is better but Torpor on rodding clerics is very useful).<br />
<br />
Unique and useful things an enchanter brings to a raid:<br />
- Haste for ALL melee, 60%+.<br />
- Mana regen of around FT15 value, for ALL casters/hybrids.<br />
- Dire Charm ANY type of mobs, within levels of course.<br />
- Dictate.<br />
- Glamour of Kintaz.<br />
- Tash.<br />
<br />
Unique and useful things a mage brings to a raid:<br />
- Duracell aka God rod.<br />
- Call of the Hero.<br />
- Focus items.<br />
<br />
Mage can Mala/Malosini. Shaman has a tad bit more powerful (Malo).<br />
Enchanter can Slow fine. Shaman can do it a little bit better.<br />
Shaman bot can MGB FoS and dispense RH/Brute easy.<br />
<br />
Wich leaves Torpor. Very useful in some encounters, utter crap in others, soso use in the rest. CE is better, of course clerics have nowhere near the mana regen of a shaman, BUT it can be substituted.<br />
<br />
So it all boils down to shaman having ZERO abilities that either can't be taken care by one bot OR by other classes.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean shamans are not needed nor that they aren't wanted on raids. My guild killed big NToV dragons, some Ssra mobs with only one shaman bot. Is it effcient? Hell no. Doable? Hell yes. We also failed on mobs because there weren't enough shamans on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slightly cheaper effect potions, or better ones, or longer durations on the ones we have... justify the cash outlay.<br />
<br />
Spells drop a bit more?  Please?  I have a while to go before I can scribe some of the really cool spells, but I haven't been able to get that many of the dropped ones, despite camping a lot of things that allegedly drop them.  Quested spells works for me just FINE, just please don't make them random results.  I'm getting tired of turning in all the Spirits of Scale that drop to get copy after copy after copy of the same 2 spells back.  And turning in all 4 at once doesn't improve chances of getting 4 different ones back.<br />
<br />
Longer range epic would be nice.<br />
<br />
Better dodge would be cool.  Big bashing would be awesome.  Higher melee skills would be loverly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Baldaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Personally I think the heal spells for all priest classes need redone.  Not counting complete heal, all the single target heals are very weak at level 60.  I would love to see clerics get a 6 second 2000 hp heal for around 350 mana which would be around 1800 (not sure on the numbers) for druids and shaman.  I could also see clerics getting a group CE spell for a fairly large mana cost.  They also need to find a way to give clerics something a bit more useful in a typical experience group beyond the ressurection line.<br />
<br />
Realistically, all I could hope for is the removal of the buff/debuff limit for npc's.  It's simply a pain in the ass and probably will never be fixed because it would be 'tough to fix'.  The only purpose it serves is to piss off bards, necromancers, shaman and druids.<br />
<br />
In the end nothing will be done though.  Even minor changes such as removing the buff level could have a fairly high impact on a large scale raid.  Allowing those 4 classes to add an extra 800-1000 damage a tick over the course of a 5-10 minute without affecting the output of what they would normally do can really add up.  At this point though, I'd assume most groups are like ours, low on bards, shaman, druids and necromancers.</div></div><hr />

And I don't know about the rest of you but raids where the enchanter slows seem to go like this.<br />
<br />
Mage01 says &quot;%T has been MalA'ed!&quot;<br />
Enchanter01 says &quot;%T has been Tashed!&quot;<br />
Enchanter02 says &quot;%T has resisted slow!&quot;<br />
GenericGuildie01 says &quot;Enchanter02 down!&quot;<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That in my opinion is why Shaman are better slowers. Sure, you can stop that with proper aggro control but you're on a MUCH finer line. If the Enchanter even thinks about where they are on the aggro list... they die. A Shaman on the other hand can just think &quot;Yeah... about now&quot; and cast it. If it goes bad you cast again and then pray that Torpor &gt; Slowed DPS. :p<br />
<br />
And I have never ever EVER understood the &quot;One shaman to slow&quot; system. What the hell is wrong with having a contingency plan? I mean really, who was in charge of thinking that idea up?! If the main slower bounces slow twice and lands it on the third one... then wouldn't 3 shaman have most likely landed it on the first cast, and definately on the second?<br />
<br />
3 casts in 3 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 casts in 21 seconds<br />
<br />
Yes? No?<br />
<br />
Everyone that CAN cast slow SHOULD cast slow. There's only 9% difference between a 51 slow and a 60 slow. Beastlords included. 50% is soooo much better than 0%.<br />
<br />
Once everyone has done their &quot;thing&quot; though... what's left to do? The mob is slowed, tashed, crippled, etc, etc, etc. What do I do now? Nothing. What does a cleric do when it's not their turn in the CHeal list? Nothing. The only classes that really so something constantly are melee (gotta mash that taunt button... whoo hoo!) and Mages, and anyone that thinks God Rods(tm) don't make or break a big raid needs their head examined. They mightn't be killing anyone, but they're sure as hell making sure nobody dies. Even if it's only indirectly.<br />
<br />
My point is that once the stuff that doesn't stack is in... nobody really does anything. We all just sit and wait for whatever was cast to wear off because those spells just don't stack. During this &quot;Null time&quot; the only classes you really need are the ones that hurt stuff. The only thing anyone is doing is damage... so if you want to do something constantly either hurt stuffs or be a Twitch-Bitch (so others have mana to hurt stuff).<br />
<br />
I can't cast Canni on other people so I'm only left with hurting stuff. Melee sure won't do it. That leaves DoTs or nukes. DoTs don't stack (if you can land them with that damn DD at the start), and we don't have a nuke. So either make DoTs stack (ha!) or give us a nuke. Poison or cold are okay. Disease would be [i]very nice (self cast disease Tash!). Fire/magic are off limits. We don't do that. Burst of Flame is a mistake. Get over it.<br />
<br />
That's just the way raids are. Help do damage or sit over there til you can do the thing that you do.<br />

Something else I forgot to add. Why don't they make vendors that sell spells are outrageous prices? Like having someone on Chardok faction sell Torpor for 30k. You get the time sink for the faction (You know Verant loves time sinks) and the large outlay of $$$. Would help settle the economy a little. Heck, have one vendor sell Torpor and another sell Malo with both being on opposing factions. You could work around it by buying spells off others but that's probably as much effort as mass killing Goblins anyway.<br />

'Fixing' Disease aggro is a two headed beast.  SK's WANT the aggro from it, it's one of their best taunts.<br />
<br />
And why can't they just make Torpor Group only on PVP servers and non-group on the Blue servers?  They have different rules on various things on there, why not that one?<br />
<br />
Noticed something on Lucy regarding mez spells on test as well.  All Mez type spells, Bard, Enchanter and Necro, except Glamour and Rapture, now have a level limit of 56.  Glamour can effect up to lvl 58 mobs and Rapture up to lvl 60 mobs!   That's quite a power boost to the usefulness of Enchanters for high end encounters.<br />
<br />
If they make DoTs stack, we probably dont' need better DD's.  And that's something they said they're working on.<br />
<br />
Also on the Test Server there is a line of Test ATTACK buffs.  Starting at an attack buff of 20, and increasing in increments of 20 up to 160!!  Beneficial spells that last an Hour.  The history of the 20 Attack buff started at 20, then went to 5, then went back to 20.  They are Self only buffs and the message is 'aura of battle'.<br />
Course, it has no casting time, mana cost, recast time or class put in at this point.  So who knows who or what it's for and if it it'll be in the game at all ;/.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give shamans a small bonus to healing spells to help make up for the times we are primary healer. - hmmm not sure on how to go about this one without damaging cleric uselfullness.<br />
<br />

<br />
Give shamans a 50percent experience rez at level 50 and a 75percent at level 60. - Not at all, strongly oppose this.<br />
<br />
Biggest thing would be for our spells to have a sensible drop rate, I know they are supposed to have fixed it but a shaman is vastly different at 60 if they dont have the two main spells as opposed to not having them. Casual or not hardcore players dont have access to VP even Kunark dragons are not easy especially when they die within an hour of spawning.</div></div><hr />

Cast time on the epic is 9 seconds. Cast time on jaundiced bone armour is 10 seconds.<br />

I rarely am interrupted on the JBB, but easily half of my spear casts are interrupted when I'm taking hits.  To me the difference in the number of interruptions is too great to be explained by a casting time that is one second longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I kind of condensed the encounter a little, but I think the point was still there. If your Enchanter slows at the wrong time... they die. If your Shaman slows he/she gets a second chance (hopefully) and THEN they die. Enchanters are a very fragile lot. So I prefer they stay as far away from the aggro list as they can.<br />
<br />
Less dying == more good.<br />
<br />
That's why I prefer having Shaman as primary slowers. On mobs like Aaryonar everyone needs to throw in a slow before the AE goes off and everyone is screwed. As Landragoran said earlier, after it goes bad you break out the slow stick. SOMETHING is better than nothing. I'm sure if you asked the Enchanters they'd have a bitch about their slows being over written as soon as they've landed them (which would be your second attempt dropping in. Thanks 3sec cast time!).<br />
<br />
I'm sure a raid could go fine without Enchanters too. With 40% haste items you're at cap with Celerity and a bard song, and with a super set of modding Mages I'm sure you could get by without any sort of Clarity.<br />
<br />
Different classes just make it &quot;easier&quot; to get by. All that's really essential are Warriors (Go defensive!) and clerics (Go CHeal!). Other classes are what lets you use a squad of 18 instead of a massive &quot;zergling&quot; force.<br />
<br />
If DoT stacking makes it in I probably still won't use my DoTs because they won't actually land (Thanks DD component!) and because Bane of Nife (36DPS) be wasting slots that other much more useful debuffs/DoTs could be running in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Blah, I might as well toss in a couple things. <br />
<br />
This is more of a fix than balance.  It's been mentioned before about certain spells not landing on lower level players.  I find it lazy amongst the coders that Celerity, a level 39 enchanter spell, is unable to land from a shaman, because it's considered level 56.<br />
<br />
AE groups.  I've only been in a couple because well... it's pretty worthless having a shaman in one.   Another true AE'r or stunner is more preferred.   Tigir's only affects four mobs (not to mention any resists), and when ten comes, all the mobs need to be hit at once for efficiency.  Rain spells really only affect one mob with max efficiency.  With 2-4 mobs, the waves of damage lowers.   I see no reason why Tigir's and rain spells can't be changed to true versions of AE's, or up the limits (like 8-10 mobs max).  Some mobs cast these spells and cheat anyway.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's better that certain classes can group up and do a mix of things that others can't, but I like to see every class (including beastlords, heh) be useful in some way, in any situation.<br />
<br />
Removing the DD component to DoTs and have them stack, and removing the healing penalty and upping the healage of heal spells, I see as pretty balancing.   Things I wish for, are curse spells and/or an Arch or Class ability of a Super SoW, similar horses, but without the horse, just run our legs off (druids would be included as well).<br />

Clerics pretty much have two things that they get to do. CHeal and Rez. They give up EVERYTHING else for that. No sow. No ports. No invis. Ask ANY cleric what the last mob they soloed was. It'll probably be an Orc Pawn. A Paladin gives up a very sizeable chunk of their damage dealing ability so that they can do those two things. <br />
<br />
NO SHAMAN REZ!<br />
EVER!!!<br />

You want to live on the edge then be ready to die. Bring a Paladin. Bring a Cleric. Can't find one? Cross your fingers and pray to your significant diety that you don't die (sorry agnostics... you're screwed :( ).<br />
<br />
The ability to solo high conning mobs doesn't make you a good class. How often do you see Warriors or Clerics soloing? It does happen... but it's pretty pathetic to watch. Those two classes are, for me at least, the foundation of a raid. No Clerics? You don't go. No Warriors? You're very restricted. No Necro's, Wizards, Bards, Druids or Shaman? Just makes things a little more interesting.<br />
<br />
I really think it would help if people pushed for something reasonable. No crazy ideas that go beyond &quot;The Vision.&quot; If we were supposed to rez we would already be able to! <br />

Getting better at things we can already do (Grow Shrink is the best idea in ever!!!) should be well within our reach.

Just hate that while I have some of the best DoTs out there I don't use them), and letting me nuke stuff better! It shouldn't even matter if it's a 800pt nuke for 600mana or something stupid like that. The only time I'll use it when I'm raiding and have more mana than I know what to do with.<br />
<br />
Seriously... not too much to ask is it? Losing the DD on DoTs isn't even that important! Just the nuke. Let me shoot stuff and do some form of damage so I can stack just like every other class does. If you have an extra shaman then you have some extra damage. I really don't see 40-50DPS as too much to ask for when I can do 30 with a right click item (at best).<br />
<br />
But we'll never get anything because no one can agree on what they think the class needs. Everyone has their own little want. Combined we could be many...<br />

They took rezzing across the board (i.e. lvl 14 up-to 50's) and reset all the levels, mana, and cast rates.   <br />
<br />
I would expect that VI is going to adjust some of our mid 20,30, 40 spells on the same basis.   Level of usage , mana , and cast rates.   In addition, consider any changes will need to take into account Beast Lords and their relationship to the Shaman spell book.     <br />
<br />
I predict we'll get a touch here and there in the 50's ... plus a spell or 2 like a better lvl 58-59 spell dealing with health ... maybe a improved Chloroblast type.   But everything else most likely will be spread out across the board ... lvl 5 up.<br />

Edited due to hitting post in a rush to meeting and some really sloppy grammar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Let me explain...<br />
<br />
No there is too much. <br />
<br />
Let me sum up. <br />
<br />
My thoughts on Balance. These are mine. Flame me if you will but think about them first. This applies to only the shaman class as a whole. Druids and clerics are completly different beasts and would need to be balanced thier own way.<br />
<br />
1st. No new buffs, but make the buffs we are used to casting have a real noticable effect. <br />
<br />
Str buffs should do what they do now and give a + main hand damage bonus scaled to the level of the spell. Maybe +2 points for the levels of the spell. So at level 60 it would give you a total boost of +12 (for focus)<br />
<br />
Dex would give you a + to attack (As in hitting more often) Maybe a total of +20 at Focus levels. (Or add a small number of Double attack points to your total already.)<br />
<br />
Agil would give you a dodge Modifier. + 10 at Max levels wouldnt be too damning. (Plus it would scale from classes nicely. beef would get the most effect, but everyone gets some small dodge skill.)<br />
<br />
Stamina seems to be okay. Maybe a small regen component to Stamina and Health but it aint bad now.<br />
<br />
Charisma Woohoo charisma!! Maybe make the buff at a small chance to channel (Or fizzles) I know I am stretching here. ;)<br />
<br />
2nd. (Yes people will scoff and deride me for this) Add Revive. No XP Returned just call the spirit back to the body. Allow xp res to be cast after the person has been revived however. (I think that already happens) If you talk to a proper Holy (Or unholy) person.<br />
<br />
It will allow a shaman to get the people back to the fun faster without stepping on the toes of clerics and paladins. And I mean we are the spirit callers are we not?<br />
<br />
3rd Changes to AA. <br />
<br />
Move Pet Discapline to a single AA point in the first tab. A class skill of that much limited use, costing that much is just silly.  Refeund the points for people that have spent it.<br />
<br />
Add a class ability for dots. Twice the damage, in half the time. ( In other words same damage total just faster. A spell cast by a master shaman should have more effect than a standard level 60. If they have focused on it. (same aggro though please)<br />
<br />
Rabid bear. Double the duration Hell maybe even triple it. It is too short for all the points. <br />
<br />
Make the healing gift and Adept Alt points effect Torpor. I know it would be hard but if you spend the points make em work for the spells you cast in the game.<br />
<br />
Allow Clicky's like the JBB to be effected by the Inherant boosts that AA brings (Spell casting Fury) You should be able to focus (as in channel) the force from the bracer and give it a bit of extra oomfh, but a bracer shouldnt  be effected by other items in your possion. (I mean you spend the time getting the points..)<br />
<br />
4th Healing ability. Have torpors negitive effects only effect the shaman. Every time they cast it though. Not effect the target. Then they could take out the negitive of only casting in your group. <br />
<br />
Remove the healing Penelty at level 51. Clerics already get a bonus. We don't need to be that much weaker in healing. <br />
<br />
Make Torpor and Cel Elixer stack. It would be a whole lot of healing going on then. <br />
<br />
5th  Pet<br />
<br />
With the recent changes to pet he is fine. I wish they would triple the duration of out 50th level pet buff. As it is I never cast it. but that is nitpicking.<br />
<br />
6th Alchemy.  (sigh) Where to start. Easy thing to do would be half the cost for ALL potions. And make the sell back for a potion 85% of the cost to make it.  Make the vendor bought poitions able to be combined in a bear bag as well for conveniance sake. <br />
<br />
Make the damn skill a workable money sink. Not a paper tiger of a money sink that is rarely used. Once a potion is used it is gone, so the money made to make that potion is destroyed. Make the potions viable to be used and have a small drain on the Inflation of coin.<br />
<br />
Hmm. I seem to have not Summed up. Oh well. <br />
<br />
Oh and Zorlac please pick this apart, but before you do think about the revive thing. I belive it makes sense, we are spirit callers. We should have something to do after the death of a friend.<br />
<br />
What yall think?<br />

This is more of a fix than balance.  It's been mentioned before about certain spells not landing on lower level players.  I find it lazy amongst the coders that Celerity, a level 39 enchanter spell, is unable to land from a shaman, because it's considered level 56.<br />
<br />
All hybrids know about this. Paladins can't cast naltron, reso, or shield of words on lower level characters even though they are level 49 cleric spells.<br />
<br />
Heck, I can't even cast my best heal spell on low level characters.<br />
<br />
It's by design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">No revive none, period.  Not even non xp one.  Play necro, cleric, heck pally if you want a piece of that.  NO NO NO.  We have a lot of useful tools already, we don't/ shouldn't have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
New heal?<br />
Let's be real, I for one think if a cleric used Complete heal in a group, he or she's not that good of a cleric.  Let's freaking take this out of the equation.  The phrase &quot;Giving other healers better heal wouldnt hurt, because cleric has complete heal&quot; is just lame to me.<br />
<br />
Balance?  Let's see.<br />
Torpor - Comparable to Cleric heal, but have negative side effects (group only, snare).  Yeah sound reasonable<br />
<br />
Nature's touch - No negative side effect, but lower HP healed.  Yeah sound reasonable also.<br />
<br />
EDIT: mistake, thanks for pointing out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Originally posted by morbad <br />
Just remove group only on torpor.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Random_guy00 running from badass_mob00.<br />
You begin to cast Torpor.<br />
Random_guy00 falls in a state of Torpor.<br />
Badass_mob00 is ripping a new one for random_guy00.<br />
Random_guy00 has been slain by badass_mob00!<br />
Random_guy00 tells you 'You just got me killed, I was fine before. Thanks for snare!'<br />
<br />
Reason #412 why Torpor should remain group only.<br />
<br />
How about getting shamans a druid 60 heal spell clone and leave Torpor as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">We are the last class that need a balance. we are just good. No better heals, you would piss druids (not clerics). No rezzes, they would be useless 90% of time, and anyway, i dont want any. <br />
<br />
Only thing i'd lke that is not really a problem of balance, is JBB affected by spell casting fury, the buffs like celerity that are castable on lower lvls by other classes but not by us, and a poison blast equivalent in damage to our ice one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Forgive me if any of this has been mentioned, I did read *most* of the threads before I grew crosseyed, and am not really sure why I am posting this as everyone else is probably sick of the topic too.<br />
<br />
I think shamans are right in line with how we are supposed to be.  I played my shaman because i wanted a class that was the jack of all trades, that's what I am, working as intended.  I can slow better than a enchanter, I can debuff better than a mage, ya they *can* fill in when I can't be there, but trust me, sharing debuff duties and balancing the hate involved in debuffing amoung many players, classes is a good thing on a raid.<br />
<br />
Alchemy sucks plain and simple, its extremely powerful if you have more money then sense.  But none of the trade skills are really all that useful, with the exception of the new cultural smithing, which is godawful to get smithing that high in terms of expenses and time spent, to find (same as alchemy) the limited population that will use it.  So rather than just an alchemy overhaul, I think all trade skills need to be looked into.<br />
<br />
Damage upgrade, think about it, every single class, except maybe enchanters, have recently received a damage upgrade.  Shaman's haven't seen an increase in damage since Kunark.  You can argue that focus items and maybe spell casting fury ( think its a silly skill for a shaman to get, given our roll) are a damage upgrade, but its a damage upgrade for everyone, still leaves the shaman amoung the low end for adding damage to a situation.  I would like to see a fire based nuke or dot, I hate feeling useless on cold resistant mobs.  Doesn't have to be uber, but do something, or maybe just an upgrade to our poison nuke, which for 400 damage is extremely mana inefficent to use.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm pretty happy with my class, ya I may not be the best candidate for brainless fast killing xp mobs.  But when someone wants to do something hard or challenging for once, I am the one they call on.  I may not be the best choice for a velks spider, or fungus grove mushroom group, but I get daily invites to do more challenging things, like duoing or single grouping ww dragons, cazic thule crawls, velks castle groups, single grouping seb juggs and myconids, or single grouping in the planes for xp and gems.<br />
<br />
I dont want rez, I dont want better heals, I have no issue with dot stacking by other shamans.  I wouldn't mind a nuke upgrade, or at least a nuke that's decent and not cold.  I wouldn't mind tigirs having the 4 mob resistriction removed.  Rains I think should be a true ae, that can hit you if you are in range, but are not limited to 4 mobs and the rains should fall in all 3 waves on all the mobs that are within its radius.  Or make it one wave yet hit all in range, if that's too powerful. <br />
<br />
What other class can debuff, heal, do damage, buff and yes even tank in situations?  Just shamans, we can do it all, maybe not the best, but we are a sure fit in almost any situation, and can fill any roll to turn the tide of the battle, as gloriana said, from winning or a coffin cr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Nature's recovery - No negative side effect, but lower HP healed. Yeah sound reasonable also.<br />
<br />
Why are you even mentioning Nature's Recovery as a heal? It isn't. It's a regeneration spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">I think he meant Nature's Touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Heres how I see it. ;)<br />
<br />
Casters in General:<br />
1) Better defense, the current caps were set pre Kunark, and oh how the times have a changed.  Up dodge 51+ and look into balancing our defense out in other ways too.<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
1) Melee combat:  We all like to do it on occasion, howabout letting us feel were making some kind of dent?  Upping priests to oh say the pre 50 bard combat tables would let us hit more, but wouldn't be any major bonus.<br />
<br />
2) Healing.  For cripes sake at least get rid of the damned penalty for non clerics!  Clerics aren't nearly common enough in the 34-49 range and Greater Heal barely cuts it.  Let everyone heal a touch better, this just might settle the bulk of healing complaints all by itself.<br />
<br />
3) Defense, just worth noting twice. ;)<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
What to say, we DO rock!  Just a few minor issues.<br />
<br />
1) Torpor, howabout allowing a toggle for accepting torpor from out of group?  /torpor on  or /consenttorpor &lt;name&gt;?<br />
<br />
2) Spell drops, we all know this issue well.<br />
<br />
3) AA.  <br />
  a) Make Rabid Bear something other than a novelty item.  Tweak the duration and reuse times.<br />
  b) Ditch /pet hold.  They've said it time and again we're not a pet class, and thanks to the wonderful gift of obedient, non agrivating pets :D  we've all been given its pretty useless.  Give us a differant AA instead.<br />
  c)  Dot AA please.  Anything useful would be nice.<br />
<br />
4) Alchemy.  Please make this skill useful!  It has so much potential!  Heck even including its use in a few uber tradeskill quests would at least make Alchemists feel needed!<br />
<br />
5) Damage upgrade, we're the only class that hasn't gotten one since Kunark.  A new DD would be nice so we don't feel so humiliated when a cleric starts nuking, or just improve our melee.  I know there are plenty of Shaman that would love that!<br />
<br />
Beast Lords<br />
1) Our poor misguided former aprrentices need their own AA skills, not just generic ones.  VI needs to actively ask for ideas on this if they don't have any themselves. ;)</div></div><hr />
