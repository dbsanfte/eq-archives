Named like 'Wraith of Daigmor' or something like that. She's in the last cell on the evil prisoner side of the second block. I walked into the room, and it said 'a black flower transforms' or something like that and she pops. I of course peed myself and ran, cause she scowled at me and that's what I do.<br />
<br />
Also, anyone know what the wraith guy is that pops on the floor sometimes after you kill a wraith? forgotten something of Marr or something like that. Doesn't attack, can't be attacked, but it will take hand in's (although nothing I've tried has worked). Despawns after like 2 mins.</div></div><hr />

You hand the soul box thingy to him and he returns it.  The entire quest spoiler is on the safehouse.</div></div><hr />
