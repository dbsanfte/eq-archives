<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do any of you think you have a good understanding of the Pvpresistbase, Pvpresistcap, and Pvpresistcalc fields in lucy?<br />
<br />
For those not familiar with pvp, these 3 values have been recently added to all spells.  It allows Sony devs to tinker with the resist rates of spells in a pvp environment.  You can find these values by going to lucy and clicking on the raw data section of a spell.<br />
<br />
Since these values relate to how spells are currently being calculated for resists on all zek servers, they are quite possibly one of the most important data values on any spell.  For a shaman, who has no innate resist mods on any of his spells, other than malos and malicious decay, determining how these 3 values affect how our spells will now be resisted in the pvp environment is crucial if we want to barter for a better position on the leaderboards.  So I've been working on compiling information on this question, and here is what I have so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Information on pvpresistcalc:<br />
<br />
I am fairly confident that I have the numbers for pvpresistcalc nailed down finally. They're not based on spell lines, resists, or class, but on level ranges and spell types. When looking for pvpresistcalc, it considers the lowest casting level of a spell, despite the class (ie, the 49 necro dot ignite blood will be used to determine the value of pvpresistcalc rather than the 61 shd dot version of the same spell).<br />
<br />
136 seems to be a number including all detrimental spells level 59-70. So far, this has included stuns, dots (including tap dots), direct damage (taps+nukes), roots, resist/stat debuffs, snares, and stun+dmg spell lines.<br />
<br />
135 includes nukes levels 54-58 and dots 55-58.<br />
<br />
134 includes nukes and non dot detrimentals levels 49-54 and dots levels 52-54.<br />
<br />
133 includes nukes and non dot detrimentals levels 44-49 and dots levels 49-51.<br />
<br />
121 includes nukes levels 1-44.<br />
<br />
101 includes dots and non nuke detrimentals levels 1-44.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still have not figured out how this implements itself into spell resists or pvp damage numbers.  My biggest question deals with why dots and nukes are not considered under the same pvpresistcalc values.  If a higher value indicates that the spell will land easier, then dots are being unfairly hindered by the development team who created this system.  But, if lower values indicate that the spell will land easier, than the reverse is true, and nuking classes, who I feel absolutely no compassion for, will be hindered.  Either way, the Sony pvp development team who created this system needs to make people aware to end any argument that may arise.<br />
<br />
It may be possible that the value itself has nothing to do with how pvp resists/damage are calculated, but instead, is a placeholder for an equation which would factor pvp resists/damage.  But even if this was true, the question still remains why dots and nukes are being considered under different resist/damage formulas.  The only way I think this would be acceptable is if dot resists are now being formulated in such a way on the pvp server so that each tick is being checked for resistances, rather than when the spell is initially cast.  We all know which one dot users would prefer, but apparently Sony does not, because as Jinheim points out below, his dot was resisted 5 times before it finally stuck to a player.  So if pvpresistcalc is a placeholder, why is it different Sony?<br />
<br />
Have been working on it through the night, so if anything is off, let me know and I'll update it.  It was an interesting question, one I immediately looked at and thought was unanswerable, but I think if we keep hammering away it, asking Sony hard questions on the forums, we'll figure it all out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alright, here's what I have been able to gather about pvpresistbase/cap.  <br />
<br />
Pvpresistbase and pvpresistcap have different values depending on the spell type (dots/debuffs/nukes/taps), and the level of the spell.  Surprisingly, pvpresistbase and pvpresistcap do not seem to change when a spell has a normal resist mod on it.  This could be for a number of reasons, which I'll speculate on in a second.<br />
<br />
Nuke/snare/root pvpresistbase/pvpresistcap:<br />
Level 65: -2/-94 --------------------- Level 51: 22/-16<br />
Level 64: -2/-89 --------------------- Level 49: 27-7<br />
Level 63: -2/-67 --------------------- Level 44: 50/-2<br />
Level 62: -2/-62 --------------------- Level 39: 50/0<br />
Level 61: -2/-57 --------------------- Level 34: 50/3<br />
Level 60: 12/-52 --------------------- Level 29: 50/25<br />
Level 59: 12/-48 --------------------- Level 24: 50/28<br />
Level 58: 12/-44 --------------------- Level 20: 50/30<br />
Level 57: 12/-31 --------------------- Level 16: 50/32<br />
Level 56: 12/-28 --------------------- Level 12: 50/34<br />
Level 55: 12/-25 --------------------- Level 8: 50/36<br />
Level 54: 22/-22 --------------------- Level 4: 50/38<br />
Level 53: 22/-20 --------------------- Level 1: 50/39<br />
Level 52: 22/-18<br />
<br />
Currently, only wizard lures (-300/-400) and necro taps (-300/-400) are including normal resists within the pvpresistbase/pvpresistcap values.  So, for these values, there is no difference between casting the nuke with a -10 resist mod on it and a -50 resist mod.  At the moment, the level of the spell is currently the only thing that will change these values.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dot/resist debuff/slow/dispel/ac-atk debuff  pvpresistbase/pvpresistcap:<br />
Level 65: -87/-144 --------------------- Level 51: -47/-66<br />
Level 64: -87/-139 --------------------- Level 49: -42/-57<br />
Level 63: -62/-117 --------------------- Level 44: 5/-52<br />
Level 62: -62/-112 --------------------- Level 39: 5/-49<br />
Level 61: -62/-107 --------------------- Level 34: 5/-47<br />
Level 60: -62/-102 --------------------- Level 29: 5/-24<br />
Level 59: -62/-97  --------------------- Level 24: 5/-22<br />
Level 58: -62/-94  --------------------- Level 20: 5/-20<br />
Level 57: -62/-81  --------------------- Level 16: 5/-18<br />
Level 56: -62/-78  --------------------- Level 12: 5/-16<br />
Level 55: -62/-75  --------------------- Level 8: 5/-14<br />
Level 54: -47/-72  --------------------- Level 4: 5/-12<br />
Level 53: -47/-70  --------------------- Level 1: 5/-10<br />
Level 52: -47/-68<br />
<br />
Dots on the other hand consistently add in the normal resist mod to the pvpresistbase/pvpresistcap values.  In addition, dots consistently have lower pvpresistbase/pvpresistcap values.  So if you're trying to decide between casting a level 65 dot with no resist mod and a level 60 dot with a -100 resist mod, you're comparing -87/-144 vs. -162/-202.  At the moment, I'm not sure how pvpresistcalc is figured into this equation, so that could make a significant difference in the comparison, but you get the point.<br />
<br />
There are a number of dots in the 24-49 range for necros and shaman that do not have the values listed.  The pvpresistcap value is missing the negative sign, which essentially means that that value is between 40 and 100 points higher than where it should be, depending on the character's level.  Not shockingly, the druid dots did not seem to have this problem - I wonder what character the dev who assigned these numbers played??  Hehe, I'm sure it's just a typo, but still, it's affecting how young shaman and necros pvp!<br />
<br />
More questions arise when I look at these numbers.  Malos and Malicious Decay are unresistable spells, but they both have the same pvpresistcalc and pvpresistbase as Bane.  However, Malos has a pvpresistcap of -144, Bane -139, and Malicious Decay -117.  Both Bane's and Malicious Decay's cap can be attributed to level.  What is seperating these 3 spells?  If these 3 spells can have such similar values, is it saying that Bane will now be near unresistable, whereas MD will not?  Is it saying that there is actually another hidden value we do not know about, which really gives a better indication of resist rates?  Or are you just saying that you don't have a clue and you're still tuning this?  If I was to speculate, I would guess that Lucy isn't displaying all the information.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we can only compare numbers and speculate what lower values for dots vs. nukes actually means.  Getting Sony to nail down what exactly these three values are responsible for would go a long ways towards helping the pvp community identify on paper where these different spell lines need help.  It would also help us identify why resist mods are not being added to the pvpresistbase/cap values of nukes, whereas they are being added to the pvpresistbase/cap values of dots, not to mention the fact, answer why unresistable spells seem undifferentiated from resistable spells.<br />
<br />
If I could post this on the Sony website I would, but unfortunately I can't, so somebody else really needs to copy and paste this over there and get some answers.  About once every year or two, the zek servers receive attention from Sony.  I wouldn't let it pass by without getting answers if I were you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't PvPed on my shaman yet, but my 59 bard is consistantly landing snares in pvp after doing occlusion of sound. the real test on him will be when he hits 61 and can pvp against the time geared server transfer pks</div></div><hr />
