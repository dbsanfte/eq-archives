<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, first off let me say that I have no idea how this forum's moderators control when a thread is stickied, reposted, cleared, etc.  That being said, I think that maybe the only stickied thread in this forum, an incredibly useful one called &quot;Tips from the Shaman's Crucible,&quot; is getting a bit long.  I mean, its almost to 100 replies now.  Could someone maybe explain to me how what we could do to turn that initial thread and 97 replies in to just one post again?  Unless I'm the only one who finds this thread hard to read, in which case I'll just shut the hell up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you want to consense all 100 posts, feel free, and i'll even post it :).<br />
<br />
i'd want it in this format though...<br />
<br />
Tip goes here.<br />
-Name of submitter<br />
<br />
Tip #2 goes here.<br />
-Name of 2nd submitter<br />
<br />
got time? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I go to UC Santa Cruz (good school, but it's also a slacker school) and I'm a senior in my last quarter.  Therefore, I have senioritis like you wouldn't believe, and wayyy too much free time.  So I'll get working on condesning it later tonight probably, and maybe have it done later tonight or sometime later this week, depending on how long it takes me.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/cheer Loramin!<br />
<br />
&lt; -- too damn lazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LMAO i remember having senioritis...twice.  too bad there's no slacktime for me now :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Give me mod control over that thread and I'll trim out the stuff that was added to the main tip part and leave the other tips which are valid but that I didn't add to the main tip part.  <br />
<br />
I could make a new thread, but all the cutting and pasting scares me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd love to see a condensed version. I know there's tons of good stuff in there, but I haven't been able to push myself to read through it all for the nuggets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gart, the cutting and pasting doesn't scare me, so I'll be happy to do it.  But if you would rather do it, you started the thread, so I will bow out.  In the meanwhile, I'm going to start another thread to discuss the topic of categories for the tips.  See &quot;Suggestings for Tip Categories&quot; for more on that.  Whenever you read this, please post back whether you want to take the project, or whether or I should.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
