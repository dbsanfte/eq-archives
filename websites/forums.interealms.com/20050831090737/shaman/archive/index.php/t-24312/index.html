<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This seems like it could be equally applied to EQ2 from my so far limited info, but was written about WoW here (http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/setview/features/gameID/15/loadFeature/1/page/2) <br />
<br />
The quest system is nicely done, if a bit repetitive at times. A lot of bragging has been done about the massive amount of quests in the game. One of my biggest problems with the MMORPG genre is the inability of most games to differentiate between &quot;Quests&quot; and &quot;Tasks&quot;. To me a quest is something I have to think about. Something with a lot of story behind it, that spans several areas; something that I have a sense of accomplishment when I finish it. To me going and killing 5 rats is NOT a quest, it is a task. Delivering a letter from NPC A in one town to NPC B in another town is NOT a quest, it's a task. Taking this philosophy into account WoW has FAR fewer quests than they advertise. I can't count how many times I had to go kill X things, or take something to some random NPC. I know this isn't just a problem in WoW but in the genre as a whole, but most games out there don't brag about their quest system to the extent that WoW does. I was expecting so much more because of this and was so severely let down. <br />
<br />
And to make matters worse they would string several of these &quot;quests&quot; (read: tasks) together and try to play it off as a quest storyline of sorts. For example, I had to go kill 5 of a certain creature. Upon getting back to town, I was informed that I then needed to go kill 10 more or something. So I go do that, then go all the way back to town, and am informed I need to go back and kill a certain named version of said mob. Whew! Let me tell you my legs are killing me at this point from all the running back and forth! But none the less I make my way back out there, because surely this is a vital quest which is important to my kingdom! Anyway, I find the named bugger and dispatch him and make my trek back to town. Guess what?!?! I get to go back and kill ANOTHER named variant of the same mob... Anyway, you can see where I'm going with this. And this isn't a lone example; I did that same basic storyline with quite a few different mobs as the targets. Basically it's around 5 different &quot;quests&quot; which could easily all be accomplished in one go. The NPC coulda just told me &quot;Go kill 5 of MOB A, 10 of MOB B, named MOB C, named MOB D and named MOB E then come back for your reward.&quot; And yes, I know for a fact this is possible in the game mechanics because there are several &quot;quests&quot; like that in the game. <br />
<br />
True?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds a bit drama-queenish to me.<br />
<br />
I've only really concentrated on the Horde (evil) side, which is supposedly less developed than the Alliance (good) side, but here's what I've found:<br />
<br />
OBSERVATIONS:<br />
- There are a lot of quests in the game (definitional semantics aside).  I have 2 characters in the mid-20s that haven't earned a point of experience that wasn't quest related.  That's probably unprecedented in a MMORPG (not my playing skill - the fact that you can do this!  :p )<br />
<br />
- Quests range in depth from the simple task quests mentioned here, to multi-hour, full group, insta-dungeon crawl quests.<br />
<br />
- Many, if not most, of the quests have multiple &quot;chapters&quot; (or phases) of increasing difficulty.<br />
<br />
- Specific example: The shaman class quests for its totems at levels 5, 10, 20, and 30.  The level 5 was fairly easy, but rich in lore.  The level 10 and 20 quests required travel to far away zones I probably wouldn't have visited for a while otherwise.  These quests were multi-step, big challenge, high reward adventures that continued the same lore as the level 5 quest.  The level 30 wasn't ready when my shaman passed that level so I got the totem in a 1-step quest.  Personally, I was relieved - the level 10 and 20 quests gave me too many heart attacks to want to do it again!  :D <br />
<br />
SUMMARY:<br />
- The WoW quests range widely in their depth and degree of difficulty. The nice thing about this is you will probably always have a quest you can do solo - no requirement to group for many of the quests.<br />
<br />
- The quest descriptions are straightforward, but still require player imagination to figure out some of their puzzles (or just ask on general chat and spoil it for the rest of the zone  :eek: )<br />
<br />
- Quests are group friendly.  Everyone in a group receives the required quest item (except the &quot;farm-fest&quot; type mentioned in the first post.  Those items are individually looted) - most groups seem to be formed around a mutual need for the same quest.  The game makes it easy to share quests to further facilitate grouping.<br />
<br />
- Quest rewards (in experience, cash and/or items) are always better than just straight grinding, even when a lot of travel may be involved.<br />
<br />
- You will never run out of questing opportunities.  If you think you have, simply go to another zone at your level and start the new quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Little off topic but there is no evil or good side in WoW.  You can call Horde uglier yes but that s a matter of taste  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not to be mean, but that's not news.  Sounds like you're looking for reasons to be disappointed.  (maybe you don't like mmorpg's)<br />
<br />
If I want an in-depth storyline, I am NOT going to fire up my mmorpg.  I'll play a game from a genre that supports in-depth storylines (generally requiring single-player play - because then the world really CAN revolve around you).  I enjoy the quests in WoW because it lends direction to the evening's gameplay.  Everyone in my party has this *thing* to accomplish, and we're going to go do it together.  This keeps the group on track, and I don't care if you're sabotaging a doomsday device or beating 5 rats bloody with a stick of wood - there's still a feeling of having finished something at the end.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just expect a lot less out of my video games.  If every quest is to save the world, it gets really old, really fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm only repeating what's said online.  <br />
<br />
After Warcraft III, the waters got a little less clear, but in Warcraft I and II, good and evil were clearly defined.  WoW is a little less clear because of some arbitrary alliances (i.e. orcs and undead on the same side), but the Human, dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome alliance is clearly a bunch of namby-pamby do-gooders. <br />
<br />
Trust me - there's good and evil.  And we Taurens know it's the humans that are evil!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play the undead (Forsaken) always and right from the character creation cutscene they leave no doubt in your mind that you're evil.  It's even coded into the game such that Forsaken have lower faction even among the other Horde races (troll, orc, tauren).<br />
<br />
I mean, really- so far I've poisoned to death a dwarf, a human and a dog.  Yes, a dog.  Never mind the hundreds of human peasants and paladins I've put to the sword and flame.  Yes, I'd say they're evil.<br />
<br />
The only quibble I have is with whatever environmentalist is writing the tauren quests.  Every apothecary quest the Forsaken have given me revolves around creating a super plague that will annihilate all life in the lands of the Forsaken.  Yet I get a quest from a supposed Forsaken at the tauren city and he wants me to go kill those naughty gnomes that are strip mining and ruining the forests.  Uh, I care about that why? As a really evil capitalist, I was looking forward to helping the gnomes and investing some of my ill-gotten plunder with their mining ventures.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That DOES make a little more sense.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have actually had a great time, trying diffrent quest and seeing lots of new places.<br />
<br />
Sure alot of them are kill this or gather these, but crap alot of that went on in DnD also.<br />
<br />
Last night , I discovered a cave full of naga, a tower of dark necromancers, and found the source of corruption of the Mookins. It was a pretty good night.<br />
<br />
Now tonight, I can either, Talk to the elder of lore, find the Ogre's and kill them or , i can kill the leaders of the Trogg's<br />
<br />
Pretty busy to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love finding the 'hidden' NPCs for the totem quests, I did feel like I was on a special quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of the things I really liked about the warlock class that my man chose (loosely equivalent to mages in EQ) was that in order to subjugate the next most powerful demon (i.e. get their new pet spell), they had to first defeat that demon in single combat.  Well, you might be able to bring a group, but he was never patient enough to wait for anybody to get there to help him.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I thought it was a nice twist on the ol pet class schtick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quests in WoW are definatly cool. While the quote in the original  post has some truth in it. There are a lot of quests that are kill x number of that mob / collect x number of that item. <br />
<br />
On the flip side tho, the quest system is very well done. It not only rewards you with XP, items or money but it also shows you the world. I wouldn't have visited half the places while I was playing the Stress Test if it wasn't for quests.<br />
<br />
The totem quests were well designed and implemented and not that easy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Same for Hunters. None of this &quot;go buy your next spell that allows you to summon a pet&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
I had to TAME that beast before he'd be my friend. I LOVED that aspect of the Hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah I did the fire totem quest as a Tauren and man, finding that guy up on the mountain, I went up SO MANY wrong paths; it was a little frustrating but I also like that a lot of quests are designed to sort of push you out into the world and lead you to new zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think quests are ever going to be all that remarkable in any computer game - there is no live game master - there is only so much programmers can do.  This is particularly true in MMORPGs where devs have to create quests that are suitable for thousands of players of all types of playing ability and tastes.<br />
<br />
Some people say play single player FPS type games for deeper quest and storyline but even those are totally contrived and you have limited choices - usually you do the quests/missions/whatever and finish the game or don't (and you waste your time).  Few games have truly wide-open gameplay (and one that comes to mind, Sacred, usually leaves players frustrated because they don't know what to do!)<br />
<br />
I think there are a lot of good features to WoW's quest system (and it sounds like EQ2's system is similar in a lot of ways).  The differences I see are that EQ2 has a harsher level grind, so you'll do more quests per level (I read that one mid 20's guy had done 150 quests and a level 14 guy reported doing 60-70 - that's a lot of questing).  WoW is highly quest oriented but I don't think you'll do quite that many quests per level.  WoW quest givers are obvious (with the exclamation points).  Some say it's not immersive or makes it too easy - I totally disagree - I think it removes tedium.  Going around and hailing every NPC in every zone every level or using a fansite is worse, IMO.  There should be a way for you to know when an NPC has a quest for you and and it's asking a bit much for devs to code in the 50,000 ways humans interact to spice it up.  Most player activites in a MMORPG don't match what players do in PnP RPGs, where GMs can come up with clever ways to integrate quests into the game.<br />
<br />
I've played a lot of MMORPGs and often times quests I've done are a major let down - rewards rarely match the time spent (or you get a cool reward...for another class!).  A lot of times I'd never get any interesting quests until higher levels and/or there would be so few quests worth doing that I might go several levels without having any quests to do.  And then there's always those few really good quests that everybody does since they're the only ones with decent rewards.<br />
<br />
I like WoW's quest system from the first time I logged on.  Before I ever smacked a critter I had 3 or 4 quests in my journal providing direction for my immediate gameplay.  Upon finishing those quests I got rewards (often a choice) that were good for my noobness.  I like how they keep you loaded up with quests - it gives a lot more meaning to your game other than just camp and grind (if you want to do more than just camp and grind).  Once I was done with the noob area (as in, I'd leveled up to where it was time to move on) the quests pointed me towards the next appropriate area, and once I got there I started a bunch more quests.  I exhausted those (and by this point had explored quite a bit of territory) and I was starting to think I should check out a city - and my trainer sent me off to the city to do a quest for my trainer there (most classes have quests to do to get some class abilities - like my warrior got the defensive stance ability for his 10th level quest reward - warlocks get their first real pet, etc).<br />
<br />
A lot of what's involved in WoW's questing isn't that new or original - it's just that they've done a really good job with refinement and presentation (which is a common theme throughout WoW).  It's little things like having a quest journal, being able to find quests without talking to 300 NPCs every level (or using fansites), often having choices for rewards or multiple rewards (sometimes get xp, coins, and more).  It seems like WoW quest rewards usually match the amount of effort you have to exert.  Not always, it's not perfect - but it hits the mark a lot.  There's also variety in the basic quest types you do and they're difficulty.  For one quest you might have to run around and do stuff for 20-30 minutes.  For another quest you might have to win a barfight in the same room as the quest giver and it's over in under 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
I'm a WoW fanboi.  I admit it.  I try to be objective and tie in years of MMORPG experience but I'm still a fanboi.  WoW has me excited about MMORPG playing again and it feels good.<br />
<br />
All I can say is take whatever you read for what it is - the opinion of someone other than you.  Try out WoW in the open beta or splurge and but it retail for the free month of play - and make your own decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agreed with the above.  Some of the quests are a little frustrating at times with the &quot;go kill this and come back&quot;  &quot;now go kill this thing that was 10 feet deeper into the cave&quot;  &quot;now go kill this named who was at the bottom of the cave&quot;, but for the most part they do a good job of keeping you up with a reason for doing these things, and tie a lot of stuff together.<br />
<br />
By far the best feature is how they lead you around with the quests.  Start out in Anvilmar, get to level 5-6, suddenly you're out of quests, but have 1-2 more to go to Kharanos.  Go there, do all the quests, now you're level 10 and have 1-2 quests to go to Loch Modan.  Go there, do the quests, after a few more levels you've got people asking you to go visit the Wetlands and Menethil Harbor.  By this point, you're in your mid 20's, know your way around 5 or 6 regions, and all the while you've just been following along on the quests you've got.  I never really felt the need to go off wandering (though I certainly have!) to find some quests or things to do.<br />
<br />
There are also a number of larger quests which are more story in depth and very nice as well.  The one about the missing king in Stormwind you can start at about level 20 or so and it keeps moving you up and around and through lots of areas, meeting lots of npc's, and you finish it in your late 20's.  The class quests are often good as well -- Warlocks have to quest for each of their pets (plus the pointy hat!), and once you find the device your guildmaster has requested, you use that item to summon the pet, then you have to fight it to gain control.<br />
<br />
There's also the great Blizzard humor value to take into consideration.  The quests for Gnomeregan are great (well, pretty much everything gnome-related is), and you meet all sorts of interesting folk who have some fun things to do.  If you haven't visited the salt flats in Thousand Needles, you need to get out there.  Gnome vs Goblin rocket car racing, enough said~  I encourage everyone to create a gnome, zoom in pretty close with the camera and type /train =)<br />
<br />
There are just so many quests that make you want to go off and find stuff, it's amazing.  You very rarely feel like you're killing things just to kill things, and things move very smoothly throughout most of your levelling.  That damn 20 quest limit is your eternal enemy though, you'll hit it every time you get to a new area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The one about the missing king in Stormwind you can start at about level 20 or so and it keeps moving you up and around and through lots of areas, meeting lots of npc's, and you finish it in your late 20's.<br />
<br />
I dont think that quest is quite finished at that point. You can go visit one of the quest npcs in Theramore after having &quot;visited&quot; Hendel. That npc will hint at having use of your services at a later point.</div></div><hr />
