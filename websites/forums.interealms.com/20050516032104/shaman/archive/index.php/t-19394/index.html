<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muggum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hackers unleashed an agile worm Monday -- using a sneaky, fairly new tactic to get unsuspecting computer users to diffuse their malicious code. <br />
<br />
Dubbed &quot;W32/MyDoom&quot; or &quot;Novarg,&quot; the worm circulated so fast anti-virus firms quickly raised threat warnings to &quot;high&quot; saying the bug was one of the worst in recent months. <br />
<br />
The worm is contained in e-mails with random senders' addresses and subject lines. While the body of the e-mail varies, it usually includes what appears to be an error message, such as: &quot;The message cannot be represented in 7-bit ASCII encoding and has been sent as a binary attachment.&quot; <br />
<br />
While many computer users are savvy about not opening executable files or other attachments that may contain viruses, the latest worm masks itself as an innocuous text document or a file that your computer appears unable to read. <br />
<br />
&quot;This one is almost begging you to click on the attachment,&quot; said Sharon Ruckman, the head of anti-virus firm Symantec's security response team. <br />
<br />
When loaded, some versions of the worm launch Notepad and show random characters. At the same time it replicates itself and installs a &quot;keystroke&quot; program that allows a hacker to break in and record everything being typed, including passwords and credit card numbers. <br />
<br />
The worm sends out a slew of messages that forced some companies to shut down their e-mail gateways to stop the infection, said Vincent Gullotto, who runs Network Associates' McAfee Anti-Virus Emergency Response Team. <br />
<br />
MyDoom also appeared to launch a Denial of Service attack on the site for SCO Group, a California company which recently sued IBM, challenging that firm's intellectual property in parts of Linux. SCO.com was inaccessible for some time Monday afternoon. <br />
<br />
Anti-virus experts said MyDoom was on track to hit even more machines than Nimda, a 2001 worm that spread widely with an attachment that read &quot;Readme.exe.&quot; <br />
<br />
This time, besides the &quot;binary attachment&quot; message, MyDoom comes with all different file extensions including .pif, .zip and .csr. It also uses an attachment icon similar to one used for Windows text messages. All of this, security experts warn, was succeeding in tricking people into thinking the e-mail was legitimate. <br />
<br />
After a relative lull in the number of viruses distributed during the holidays, anti-virus experts expected a hectic Tuesday as office workers fired-up their computers and unwittingly spread the worm. <br />
<br />
Two other less prominent worms, Mimail.Q and Dumaru, were also making their way around the Internet. <br />
<br />
Mimail.Q changes the body and attachment over time, but, for now, some of the e-mails containing the worm used the subject line: &quot;Hi my sweet Nancy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dumaru comes with the subject line &quot;Important information for you. Read it immediately!&quot; and includes an attachment called myphoto.zip. <br />
<br />
&quot;The virus writers [are] ... back from vacation and they've started pushing out their creations,&quot; Gullotto warned.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've already recieved 4 emails with some form of this virus....so watch out!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could have just shorted that whole post to &quot;Some hacker made a virus recently!  Well, it's just like the other billion out there.  But I'm giving you clever information about this virus that being never open up an attachment in your email unless you know what it is.  Hmm.  Then again, that's the same advice you give for every other virus out there, by which you already know how to not get infected.  Sorry for spamming your message board&quot;<br />
<br />
Off to the Grey I go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone needs to say it:  &quot;Good morning, and welcome to two days ago.&quot; :D<br />
<br />
&quot;The virus writers [are] ... back from vacation and they've started pushing out their creations,&quot; Gullotto warned.<br />
<br />
Are those the ones that Symantec employs to keep spitting out new viruses so they can sell more software?  They need to stop giving these people so much vacation time. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually these ones are different because they randomly change their subject lines and message, and also use legitimate subject lines that an Email server can't just arbitrarily block.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they steal the address book and spoof the email to make it look like you or someone you know is sending the message. These look ALOT more real coming in then anything previously has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No they don't.  Email spoofing has been around for quite a while now.  Many viruses have multiple subject/attachment names as well as morphing behavior.<br />
<br />
There is nothing new about this virus whatsoever.  I don't get why anyone would be fooled by this virus that wouldn't be fooled by any other virus.  I've gotten half a dozen or so copies of it so far and the moment I opened the first one, alarm bells were ringing in my head saying... &quot;Gee, could this be a virus???&quot;<br />
<br />
Tips for the less than savvy interweb user:<br />
<br />
If you get an email from someone with an attachment ending in any of the following : .exe .scr .pif .bat .com .vbs<br />
(NOTE: the LAST part of the attachment is what matters.  Don't be fooled by attachments with names like Filename.html.exe)<br />
<br />
DON'T OPEN THE ATTACHMENT.<br />
<br />
If you get an email with an attachment from someone you don't know....<br />
<br />
DON'T OPEN THE ATTACHMENT<br />
<br />
If you have any reason to suspect that an attachment may be a virus.... Ask the sender what they sent you.  If they don't know, it's probably a virus.<br />
<br />
These simple rules will drastically reduce the chances of you ever getting infected by an email virus.  You may thank me later for sharing my ultimate wisdom. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Many viruses spoof the sending address and have random subject lines.  Nothing new here.<br />
<br />
edit: Bah, Sciek beat me to it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haven't used an antivirus in 12 years, or more. Never cought a virus. Today you can do a GREAT deal for pretty much free to never have virus/hack issues:<br />
<br />
(1) Stop using the browser made by the Monopolistic Empire of Evil (aka Micro$oft). Use Firebird: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/ . It blows Internet Exploder out of the water. Slick. Small. Fast. Oh and no annoying popups. Internet Exploder is nothing but a t-shirt with a &quot;hack me&quot; or &quot;infect me&quot; sign and a target on it's back. It's horrid. Slow. Buggy. Bloated.<br />
<br />
(2) Use a personal firewall. Either hardware (router) or software. There are plenty free ones out. And D-Link or Linksys routers are superb and can be gotten for 50$ easy.<br />
<br />
(3) Do your surfing on Linux. Or Mac. Again, stop using the bloatware called Windows. If you have no choice to use Windows, create yourself an account that has no access to pretty much any system component other than browser. <br />
<br />
(4) Use a different email client, Mozilla crew have a nice one: http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/ . If you really must use the bloatware from Micro$haft (Outlook or Outlook Express) make sure you turn off completely preview or you gonna get hit by drive by Radioactive-X plugin installs.<br />
<br />
(5) If you want to feel warm and fuzzy, install an Anti Virus. Keep it updated. Keep your operating system updated.<br />
<br />
All this won't matter a thing if you keep clicking on links that promiss a &quot;Super PC optimizer&quot; and &quot;Speed up your PC&quot; or &quot;Meet someone online&quot; or &quot;free pr0n!&quot;. For the love of (insert God you beleive in here) stop clicking on those annoying Popups. Some have drive by installs that exploit current (unfixed) security holes in Internet Exploder 5 and 6 and you'll wake up one day with your PC r00ted, SPAM backdoor installed and at least 20+ DDoS clients too. Then a few days from there, the FBI might ask you nicely to patch your system and stop spamming/DDoSing.<br />
<br />
The Internet is the Wild West, common sense and a bit of paranoia can keep you virus, backdoor and hack safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow, that's a whole lot of microsoft hate.  I use a lot of microsoft stuff and don't ever get viruses simply by not opening things that people didn't tell me ahead of time they were going to send<br />
<br />
<br />
edit to make sense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would just LOVE to get one of these geeks by the throat and proceed to beat the living **** out of them.<br />
<br />
The last outbreak cost me hours of my time fixing numerous computers for friends and family.  No I don't charge them either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow, that's a whole lot of microsoft hate.  I use a lot of microsoft stuff and don't ever get viruses simply by not opening things that people didn't tell me ahead of time they were going to send<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed.  Viruses are 95% social engineering (tricking stupid people into doing things), and 5% technological.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, people are very stupid, and that 95% target is very easy to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep pretty well said by all here so far.  You just got to think before you click.  Any email I get with an attachment gets deleted unless I know what it is AND I asked for it to be sent to me.  I also tend to stay far far away from websights that have those annoying pop ups. Grrrr... I've been luck so far with viruses but I know sooner or later I'll get one by shear bad luck as nothing is 100% effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah thats alot of microsoft hate, but it's well deserved hate.<br />
<br />
Microsoft insists on things being so integrated, so seamless, so userfriendly that they end up building the mechanisms for virus replication into their products.<br />
<br />
Stupid things, like making file extensions hidden by default plays into the hands of virus writters.  <br />
<br />
Follow that up with numerous security holes that go unfixed for loooong periods of time, you get the wonderful operating system we all know and love called Virus XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muggum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Little more info on this development: <br />
<br />
Novarg or Mydoom is programmed to run through an infected comp's address book, selecting one address as sender, and spamming to all of the others. This results in you receiving an e mail from a friend that you know, so naturally you will trust them and open the attachement....<br />
<br />
Very diabolical and wicked, hackers are getting quite savy...</div></div><hr />

OMG.  THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE WITH A VIRUS.  WOW.  GOOD THINKING.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WARNING US ABOUT THIS OR WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A funny little story about this virus<br />
<br />
One of the advisors at college (UNC) somehow got it on his/her comp and it proceeded to send itself to all of the people in the adress book. Unfortunately, most of the people in the group were various listings for different &quot;teams&quot; of students, based on major. The one im in contains Business, Journalism + Mass communications, and some undecided people. Easily some of the most popular majorw on campus. I think half the students on campus got it this way.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Lucky for me i dont tend to open attachments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Microsoft deserves every single bit of hate it gets. Hell, IMO, it's nothing. They are the epitome of what can go wrong with capitalism, they are the perfect proof. They are pretty much above the law in the US, and the EU doesn't seem to be doing much other than empty threats. Microsoft is like a parasite, actively destroying any competition it can find and the same time lock in users even more in it's bloated software that has more security holes than the best swiss cheese.<br />
<br />
Macintosh, Netscape, OS/2, Wordperfect, Lotus, and a myriad of smaller software like disk utilities, media players and whatnot. PS/2 and Nintendo are next. What then?<br />
<br />
Microsoft never did any innovation (despite what it's propaganda claims), they assimilate the technology that they can and they copy the rest. Much like The Borg. <br />
<br />
Why does the US administration allow a monopoly to exist?</div></div><hr />
