Ravens a kitable in PoN, but a pain to get single and not worth the exp...PoD is the way to go, I'm going to be grinding AAxp solo there whenever I can't get a group in PoV/PoS.<br />

I only tried to Swamp rats when I gave Pod a solo shot and it resisted every time. The Disease are fearable though huh?  Guess I'll try that.</div></div><hr />

They give 2% AA per kill.  I did a few rats as well in PoD bt there seem to be more adds in PoD.  I also tried tree frogs in PoV as they looked so small and wimpy (a bit like a feeble rat :rolleyes: ), but they resisted all my casts and chased me out of the zone.<br />
<br />
Never got around to trying on the nightmares in PoN although I have killed a couple.  I do seem to remember that they are immune to snare anyhow so I guess it would not work.</div></div><hr />

I can see verant pulling out the ol' ban card for doing this.  Just like they did in ToFS, fearing at the ent.  Anyone else have any ideas about this and if it's legal or not?</div></div><hr />

Any mob (animal or not) that is feared BEHIND the T door will fear path to the door, open it and stop on the otehr side and not move at all.<br />
<br />
 Did it for a few mobs and then started feelign like big brother was watching me so I stopped, I sent in a couple bug reports, but that was like 3 weeks ago, and the bug is still there.<br />
<br />
 Even without the bug, the rats are very easy to solo there,  Just go alittle further back and they never reach the T part. I did most of 57 there and exp flew by, there is always people in the trial area, so if you are nice, you can get all kinds of buffs, just remember to ask nice and not to often.</div></div><hr />

but the PoD diseased rats are really easy snare fear, with large space to run off to re-land fear when it leaves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The assist code in PoJ is a little weird.  <br />
<br />
If your a pet using class the Rats will assist each other.  <br />
Prisoners will assist rats, but if your high enough level you aggro radius is small enough that you can kite down most of the halls.  Warrior NirTan is one that will aggro if you kite past his cell at level 60, so I just dont kite past his cell.<br />
I've had Gaolers assist Festering rats.  Gaolers are the 2nd level guards above Sentries, and Festering rats are the lower level mostly light blue to 60 rats.  But they rarely path next to each other, so its not really a problem.  <br />
<br />
I wouldnt fear into the pathing bug at the T intersection, at least not on purpose.  It's obviously a bug and could be considered and exploit.  Why risk a warning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coruscare</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoJ is quirky.<br />
<br />
Festering Rats are not social for the most part, but occasionally I'll pull one and another will add. It's like there is the random spawn that is on a diff faction table or something.<br />
<br />
The bug where they stop pathing at the door is good and bad. I make it a point to agro/snare/fear wherever I find em at least half the time, instead of pulling them to the pathing bug and fearing them. If a GM wants to complain, I'll just tell them that I pull em where I find em and they path there themselves.</div></div><hr />

Just a little information that I have observed in PoD with the rats at Level 61.<br />
<br />
Diseased Rats<br />
Snare and Fearable quite easily.  At least 4-5 spawns that roam towards the beach near the Graveyard.  More elsewhere, but much harder to pull and fear without adds.<br />
<br />
Swamp Rats<br />
Snareable with some attempts, but NEVER have landed one fear (no immune message).  I usually just root it, and zone, not worth the time it takes to kill it with arrows.  They seem to hide in the water around the fly islands.<br />
<br />
Pestilent Rats<br />
Snareable most of the time on 1st or 2nd try.  Fear is resisted quite often, but you can get it to land.  They are usually found near the oozes in the middle river of slime areas.  Again most of the time, just not worth killing.<br />
<br />
Feeble Rats<br />
Pretty much the same as Diseased Rats.  Snare easy, fear easy.  Can find some singles near the river if PoD is quite busy and pull to one of the walls.<br />
<br />
My preference is to stay near the zone in, pull rats till they are all gone, maybe pull a few tsetian flies (some light blue some dark blue at 61), root-arrow kill till I can get a group.  XP moves, but nothing like Castle/Caves XP.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps,<br />

Regarding the ravens that you couldn't land fear on; I have been doing the rats in PoD and when the  area got overridden with groups I ventured into PoN. At lvl 60 I had zero prob with the first three Ravens I picked, but strangely the fourth one I tried would not be feared. Snare and root worked fine, though. Seemed strange to e, but maybe I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
PoN is tier one, so you don't need to be flagged.<br />
<br />
You should do fine getting a group here - on Mith Marr it seems that PoN has more 55-58 xp groups, and PoD more of the 58-61 groups.  I have found just having LFG on will get me tells from any of the tier one zones asking to join.</div></div><hr />
