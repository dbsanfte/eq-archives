<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I just got a JBB..  This bunch of pixels is more than pretty good.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking for some ideas on blue con mobs with low HP's that I can grind through at 45.  Bloodgill goblins come to mind as a possibility.  How do they compare to the Nurga spiders?  There's a ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) in Nurga, so they might come out ahead.   On the other hand, many a shaman know of these places, so I'm assuming it will be camped.  Loot, although always nice, isn't a big priority because I mainly want to push to get to 49th for my new spells.   Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  Am I the only shaman that doesn't like to buff people?   I play the character for its versatility, and its soloing ability.  I always get a little ticked when I group up and the tank invariably say &quot;STR/DEG/AGI/AC/HP plz&quot;  I play a necro as well.   Can't you tell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I sometimes dont like buffing, but i do like making people into walking gods, and the compliments are nice.  Its really mixed feelings, i used to play a necro as well, and i find it very well worth the time and mana and annoyance of buffing to be more accepted and usefull in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played a necro as my main for quite some time....yes I hate buffing too :)<br />
<br />
Then again, I solo a lot...so I don't really have to worry about it all that much. :D<br />
<br />
ah...almost forgot..Grats on the JBB.<br />
<br />
hope I can snag one by 45 to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeti's in DL are low hp mobs that should be pretty damn easy with the JBB and they were good xp solo when I did those levels.  Bloodgills have 1500 or so hp and would be just as easy and you also get the newbie ZEM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did 45 -  48 in DL on brutes and drogna and anything that didn't cast just pulled with slow rooted. <br />
<br />
Set pet on and JBB till root broke and tanked it till it died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't mind buffing in the group, as long as I am NOT the only healer type.  Tanks/Melees do not always seem to understand the concept of limited mana.  Even canni-dancing your butt off, one shaman cannot usually keep all group members, SoWed, haste'd, Str/Dex/Agi/sta/hps and slow the mobs and be the only healer.  Gotta get them to have realistic expectations.<br />
<br />
As far as hunting goes....<br />
<br />
1) Nurga lv. 44-46.  Nice exp on the spiders, with JBB you should be able to pull pretty constantly.  On Torv. Server I had absolutely no competition for the spiders spawns the week I spent there.  As a matter of fact, I was often the only one in the zone.<br />
<br />
2)  Tim. Deep lv. 46-49.  Spirocs are very tasty exp.  Again, I did not have JBB and got great exp. here just pulling singles.  With a JBB I imagine you will FLY thru these levels here.  A little more competiton here than in Nurga (Ogre Island is very easy to get to from Oasis raft), but during the 1-2 weeks I was here I did not find too many people here...and never so many that I had to leave except once, when a +54 level toon was pulling everything and killing in within seconds.  /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
Those 49 spells are nice, exp. the 2 new DoT's.  Try them out on the Seafury Cyclops in OOT :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Golrag Spiritfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hit 45 while soloing in Tenebrous Mountains doing the sonic wolves.  They were still blue to me but I moved to TD and hit 48 3 days later playing 3-4 hrs a day.  However, what will happen is you zone into TD, and there will be noone there.  You will feel elation at having the whole birdhouse to yourself, pulling them, rooting them and jbb'ing them to death rather quickly.  Then, inevitably, 2 druids or 2 druids and a wizzie will show up and all of a sudden your exp will drop.  :)  I got tired of that, so I moved to DL again (shudder) and found a decent spot away from the crowd.  Just east of the FM zone is a nice area full of blue roamers.  I would also recommend hitting the widow webs as well, because there are many blue spiders as well.  So far, about 1/2 way thru 49 and still getting mostly dark blues.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the replies!  I've been doing most of my hunting in DL since making 45, but sometimes I take down a drolvarg rager or a drachnid widow and they have a bunch of HPs.  <br />
<br />
An area that I have heard about that I would like to pass on to others would be the giant fort in FV.  These are decent mobs that can drop some OK loot at the same time.  Just bind yourself at the bank for a quick return and you should be making decent cash pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />
