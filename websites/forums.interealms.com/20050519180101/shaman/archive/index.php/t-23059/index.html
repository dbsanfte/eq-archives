<br />
I have spent my 23 aa points and have trained Cani 5.  Now I'm going to grind it out to 65 or 70.  So my question is when I stop grinding what AA's should I get next.  I'm in a family guild with good Bazaar gear. I like to solo, but that is getting harder to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your sugestions.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I did MGB (big raiding guild), SCR, SCRM and Quickbuff 1&amp;2 right after Can 5. Nowadays, I might also recommend the first level of RC (nice bang for the buck at 2 AA) or Virulent Paralysis (very nice to push mobs AWAY from you, or a caster).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you like soloing, full Virulent Paralysis will be excellent for you.<br />
<br />
Dont forget to pull with Mal. Decay though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you enjoy solo'ing I would suggest that you go for Natural Durability 3 and Lightning Reflexes 5, ND3 is a nice chunk of hit points which is never a bad thing, and with LR5 you take a noticeable ammount less damage. Spirit Call and VP are also a nice addition as they give you ways to better deal with certain situations. SCRM is great as well, if you get SCRM, ND3, and LR5 you will find that you have a much easier time staying alive. Getting hit less, taking more dmg, and Quiesence lasting longer can't be beat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't go wrong with getting spell casting mastery. :)  It will save you mana on EVERY spell cast.  This will make a big difference with SCM3 on your spell-casting endurance in any situation.  I'd recommend this next for the most bang-for-your-AA-buck.<br />
<br />
If you are really hp challenged, ND1-2-3 might be better first so you can safely hit Canni5, but I'd still recommend SCM early.  If you do alot of adventures, Radiant Cure 1 and Virulent Paralysis 1 are pretty cheap investments for some extra tools in your arsenal.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

VP actually interrupts casting on NPCs? since when? Everytime I use it to interrupt a gater/CHer... it fails miserably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't say it interrupted, I said it physically moved the mob away from you or a caster. I meant, a caster that was taking damage from a mob.</div></div><hr />

My bad, read it wrong :)</div></div><hr />
