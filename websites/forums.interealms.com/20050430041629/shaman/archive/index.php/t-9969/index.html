<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just hit 40.  Have an ikky bp and reif, and about 1600 hp and 800 ac self buffed.  Always have KEI up.  Well, I've been killing yetis like they've been going out of style, and quite frankly, I get through the first spawn and sit there at full mana and full health for about 10 minutes before they respawn.<br />
<br />
It's decent experience, but all that downtime gets to me.  Is there anyplace with similar experience per mob, but a larger base number of mobs to pull from.  Don't want a partner, nor a group.  Just solo.  Any help you all could give me would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, after talking to quite a few people and reading more and more posts from this forum and others, can anybody give me some solid information on DSP?<br />
<br />
Looking for a specific spot for excellent experience, which mobs to pull, and maybe the spell lineup used if you want.  Mainly just looking for a specific spot to pull from.  thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't do DSP. This may only been my opinion but i say exp gets a bit crappy after 37 so i moved out to CC(thats where i am atm, hunting there and EW Ulthorks). The good thing about DSP is constant pulls, theres a lot of mobs and the Zelniaks dont aggro each other(you should do Large Zels btw). IMO DSP doesn't have more exp than other zones, it jsut has more mobs meaning FASTER exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just left DSP at 40 ~ spent from 34 to 40 there.  I think you may not find it challenging enough, but the nice things there include lotsa MOB's, and little chance of dying as the only things that aggro in most areas (wolves, lightcrawlers, and ,mushrooms) are easy kills.  I leveled very fast on zelniaks from 34 to 40, solo (with Druid buffs), but after that I had to move along =).  Am in Great Divide now for a change and like it much plus you can gather compenents to start the shawl quest if you haven't done so yet :) Good hunting to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tymson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did 40-43 in Dreadlands.  I tried grouping through 40, and did OK when I could find a group.  Did 41-43 in the same time solo with KEI.   I used the pull spot on the ridge side of KC, and would agro-kite with dogdog, root/rot.   I found that rather than pulling with a slow, pulling with Malisement kept mobs parked.  I'd tell you to only pull the Dog Beasties and leave the spiders alone.  If you Malo to pull, root, dot..when root breaks you should have enough agro to kite until he tries to run.  <br />
<br />
<br />
at 43, move to Tenebrous Mountains and take the Grimling Runner camp at the GF zone.   Pull the Sonic Dire Wolves with slow and sick pet on him.  Once pet has agro (just a couple of ticks into him) Dot with Poison and med.  It'll be tougher at 43, but once you ding 44 and come back you can make it from 44 to 46 in about 4 hours if you're consistent.  I didn't really need KEI here, but it wouldn't hurt to allow you to throw in some DD and make it go faster.   Use the Grimling runner pouch for the Rallic Pack quest (800pp auction on Ayonae Ro) and you should be on your way to financing JBB's (20k pp on server).  Grimling runner is a 1.5 hour spawn cycle that spawns IN the cave you're pulling too.  <br />
<br />
at 46 Move to CoM and solo entrance.  I am there at 47 and averaging a yellow every hour at entrance.  I haven't had a problem soloing with a slow pull, but there is another good thread outlining those strategies!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sadhu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My opinion is Echo Caverns, the side to the Deep, past the dwarf side of SH.  The underbulks in there are great for shaman, and the first area has 4 spawns that can be single pulled with a little practice.  If you get in trouble the guards and zone are close.  They start turning light blue around 47 to 49.  Great solo XP, challenging, and will give you time to med if needed.  It's also close to Nexus/Bazaar for KEI recharge!<br />
  If you want a faster pace than first camp then head a little further in and take the immediate right past the first spot.  If not camped, there are 7 spawns in there (Fiends, Stonegrabbers, and Underbulks).  Problem here is they might agro when running away, but all rarely resist root.  Stonegrabbers are really offensive spell resistent, but can be debuffed easily.<br />
  This also leads to the Taskmaster room, I wouldn't suggest playing with him alone until 49 spells, and slowing is a must.  If you see a big alien looking guy whose name starts with a &quot;X&quot;, don't even bother.  He's a 55+ Chanter and spawns if you keep clearing the Taskmaster's room.  Highly suggested to keep atleast one skelly alive to prevent this.  I wouldn't start in this room until the latter 40's either way.  I think the incline between Taskmaster's room and first room is a nice pull spot once initial spawn is broken, or just pull to the entrance to first room, so people will know it's camped.<br />
  If that room is camped keep going straight from first camp, pass the turn to second camp, then hug right wall until it opens up into a very large room.  Follow wall all the way back until next tunnel starts.  Now you'll be close to zoneline to the Deep.  That huge room has 9 spawns of Underbulks, Fiends, and Stonegrabbers.  Only one roams around and could be any of the three critters listed.  It spawns close to the legde by tunnel to the Deep.  This ledge is your friend and pull-to location.  Park dog there for solo, or have group stay there while puller pulls.  Casters can see and root adds easily from the ledge.<br />
  Now the critters can be single pulled with practice and high enough level.  I think around 44, maybe earlier.  Form the ledge you'll see roamer, and a static spawn right next to it, usually a Stonegrabber lying on the ground.  Behind them you'll see 4 Underbulks.  To the left of the Underbulks below a ledge is 3 static Fiends.  <br />
  Solo'ing it will be constant pulling if mana holds up.  I think these things are on a 10 to 15 minutes spawn cycle.  With a duo or group, you'll be pulling the first camp too and it almost works out perfectly.  Breaking up the first 4 Underbulks and 3 Fiend groups will be fun, but after spawn is broken, you'll have time to med, relax, and BS if in a group.<br />
  Oh the problems with these camps.  The named ones.  Trillcor and Fireclaw.  Solo'ing, these guys will kill the fun of the spot because they will kill you if you are under 45 (severly twinked will most likely have difficulties under 42), and are a pain/mana drain solo'ing with 49 spells.  Duo will be a fun challenge (maybe deadly), and grouped will add excitement and a change of pace.  Trillcor (looks same as Fiends so be careful when you pull them) hits hard and fast, not real magic resistent, and I have never seen him drop anything, but fun nonetheless.  Now, Fireclaw, you will know he pops when you see the Underbulk that's back touches the ceiling.  He too hits hard and fast, and for added excitement, cannot be rooted or snared.  He'll get the blood pumping just at his size.  His back is higher than an Ogre is tall, makes for a nice 3rd person screen shot.  He'll drop Fire Carpace almost always, and an uncommon drop of the fireclaw.  Not great loot, but lower levels like them.  Remember your egress routes when fighting these two and run early if things look bad, because they will catch you without SOW.<br />
  Worst thing about this camp is it's inside so no SOW!!<br />
  I told you the spots and a little of what to expect, but left the pulling and fighting up to you to experiment with.  Hope this helps and is a challenging and enjoyable spot.  I was amazed how fast I flew through the 40's to 50 here.  I got 51 here too, but mainly had to pull from Taskmaster's room, and it was slower than I was use too.  There might be better places, but I don't know any.  Overall, great Xp, crappy loot, and on many servers empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urssus da Greenbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Echo caverns is very annoying methinks<br />
<br />
First of all, echo is way way way overcamped on Drinal. Second, at 42 I find the first 4 underbulks give me way too much time when waiting for respawns.  Third, the big room near the zoneline to the Deep is incredibly hard at my level.  Fourth, Trillcor kicked the c r a p out of me and my dog.  Going from full health and full mana with kei and my haste/regen/hp buffs (with same on dog) down to 20% health, no mana, dog dead, and Trillcor at 51%.  Needless to say, I wet my greaves as I ran for the Deep.<br />
<br />
Geos in crystal caverns is the best exp I have ever had 40+, but it's camped 99.9999% of the time.  Out of like 100 trips there it's been open once.  I've spent many many many hours waiting for people to leave the camp with no luck, grrr.  Terrors are pretty good exp and 'decent' would be overstating the loot.<br />
<br />
Ry`gorr orcs are decent exp and kind of fun, rarely camped.<br />
<br />
Overthere is easy and decent exp too, plus berzerker war braids are good to turn in to Captain Rottgrime if you are evil.<br />
<br />
Karnor's Castle would probably be great if you brought your own group and didn't care about your outpost faction, I do care, so my knowledge is very limited here.<br />
<br />
Sol B is pretty damn dangerous, always been partnered or grouped and I still have trouble.  Kobold shamans are bitches.<br />
<br />
Dreadlands is s h i t t y exp unless you have a really well-equipped partner (grouping has always sucked for me there) or are getting PLed.<br />
<br />
Tenebrous seems worth looking into, and I'm also questioning how good the exp of the gnomes in Sol A would be at 42.  Was incredible around 36, 3-4% per kill.  Nurga might be worth looking into as well, although soloing there is much easier for necros (fear + fd).<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say 39-44 are some of the worst levels, second only to 29-34.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 copper pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">40-44: Beach in Gunthak, trolls and skels (Mokon camp preferably) or the &quot;open area&quot; heading towards the Lugglad Castle and kill the drogs and shrooms there.<br />
<br />
44-49 Either camp the fire eles in Nadox entrance (a nice challenge at 44 and 45) or, go to gunthak and start camping the corner for the flask for the stoicism spell.  Good xp and loot in both of these places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">toad, what was the experience per hour looking like on the beach in Gunthak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow i recently went through lvl 40-44 and really wish i would have read this post before.. seems it summed up my entire experience with all the zones i tried to level at.. and i even walked away with some knowledge about where to xp post-44</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">toad, what was the experience per hour looking like on the beach in Gunthak?<br />
<br />
I've been on a quest to find the best solo spot for level 40 and its been very hard to find a steady 2% per kill anywhere. I'll post later on all the places i've been.<br />
<br />
I only get 1% per kill at the Gunthak beach. Mobs are pretty easy though. I'm going to try other places at Gunthak to see if there's anything better.<br />
<br />
Best XP I could get at 40 at the beach was about 10% in about 30min I&quot;m not sure if thats considered good exp or not at my level.<br />
<br />
I've still got a couple places to try.<br />
<br />
I also just tried a DL group for the first time. The XP there is crap. about 20% in 2.5 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You want better place to hunt in Guntak then goto the fort.  If the trolls inside are too tough then kill the random ones outside the stockade fence.  There is ONE mob just outside the gate into the interior of the fort that is named and can see though invise.  I forget his name but the house is right by the wall so be carefull.  Outside near the gate if your looking out of the gate to the right by the wall near big rock is good place to pull to clear the surrounding houses.  Be sure not to allow any mobs to run very far or your going get one hell of a train.  Once you see that first add just RUN for the Nadox zone.  The exp inside the fort though is bit better and much easier to get singles.  You can pop your invise halfway between the Gate to the interior and the center house and buff up and get your pet up.  Once you start to clear the trolls around the outside you will have more room to work with.  Once again Dont let them leave though the gate.  If they do you might as well start running or Gate.  Adds dont ussually come in singles once the start adding.  They come in droves.  One other thing to note.  DO NOT pull your mobs too close to the center building.  There are Luggards in there that will assist will heals but will not agro.  Have made that mistake a few times and was wondering why the darn mob was not dieing.  Just fight a bit closer to the outside wall then the center building.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">not so much worried about finding a 2% kill.  if it takes me 5 minutes to kill a mob that will yield a whopping 2% exp, that's all great.  but if it takes me four minutes to pull and kill two mobs that give me the same experience, i'd rather spend my time grinding on those.  you know?<br />
<br />
kind of upset that they changed nurga/droga around, as that's where i leveled my necro from 39 to 44 pretty easily.  was a great lower level zone, shame to see it disappear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I quickly learned that 2% per db kill at level 40 didnt exist, and hearily agree with what you said. I ended up slaughtering the kodiaks in GD for a very easy 1% per kill.</div></div><hr />
