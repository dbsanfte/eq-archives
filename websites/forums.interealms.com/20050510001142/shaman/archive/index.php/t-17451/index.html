<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman's my first character in EQ, and has a lot of memories connected with it, but i'm no longer sure I want to spend time levelling one. Part of this is connected with the fact that, due to timezone, being part of a guild is largely impossible. And even XP groups are rarer than they are for many, there's simply less people on line. Great if you like soloing though.<br />
<br />
I have a char on another server (necro) who's elemental flagged in a great guild, so I got to see that side of it, although not as a shaman. Obviously there's guesswork involved. If someone proves to me how completely i've missed the truth I would be *ecstatic*. I'm L55 with my shaman, but group with lots of L65 shaman with my necro (And the guild shaman are very skilled).<br />
<br />
I'm not really trying to prove anything, just putting down my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Shaman on Raids: Very Desirable.<br />
Stackability: Average.<br />
<br />
Raid targets are very magic resistant and have massive DPS. Thus the combination of malo and the best slow makes shaman's more or less mandatory. The shaman HP buffs, while not the most important (Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Paladin) stack nicely and are thus part of the standard buff lineup. <br />
<br />
The damage and patch-healing abilities of a shaman are less than impressive. They are worse in both categories than their closest competition (druids) and far inferior to the specialist classes in these categories (clerics, wizards). While each shaman increases the raid power they are unlikely to shine unless they are they are involved in slowing mobs.<br />
<br />
The number of shaman needed for slowing mobs depends on the power of the guild. PoP has a lot of fights where multiple mobs need to be slowed quickly, which also tends to mean shaman fatalities are not uncommon. This means you need more shaman available, which means more shaman get to shine. NToV and Luclin is much the opposite with their commonly only being one challenging target.<br />
<br />
In other words if you are going to be one of the core shaman in a raiding guild you are going to be a valued member, able to camp for the night knowing you've made a difference in the successes of the guild. Being shaman number 3,4,5 or five is significantly less exciting.<br />
<br />
Shaman Grouping: Varies, but generally low.<br />
Stackability: None.<br />
<br />
The grouping shaman brings one A-class ability, slowing, which is a massive damage mitigation. This combines with the shaman's healing abilities to make them a potent package in one character. The cumulative effects of haste are substantial too.<br />
<br />
Shaman slow is most valuable in challenging environments. If the party drastically over-powers the mobs, like time-geared characters going through easy LDoN adventures, slow is less vital. Shaman have a potential strength here in that they can combine slow, haste and healing in one person which allows more slots for DPS specialists.<br />
<br />
As the environment becomes more challenging the value of shaman slow increases, but the danger of having the shaman as primary slower and only healer also increases. Thus it is likely more than one support character will be involved. The most likely is that slow and healing will be seperated, giving the following desireability.<br />
<br />
Healing: Cleric, Druid, Shaman.<br />
Slow: Shaman, Enchanter, Beastlord, Bard.<br />
<br />
The core of the problem is that shaman have no synergy with the other healer classes. In simple terms we can't give them buffs they care about. Each of the other slow classes can increase the efficiency of the primary healer in addition to providing satisfactory slow. This is before considering that enchanters and bards bring crowd control and pulling, in which the shaman and beastlord have minimal ability (ie. root / pet tanking).<br />
<br />
If the group is in a very challenging environment, which means it's probably not an XP group, the advantage of being able to slow and patch heal rises. However CC probably becomes mandatory. Meaning you'll go with the full defensive lineup of Cleric, Enchanter / Bard, Shaman. The best group I know runs with Cleric, Bard, Shaman having retired a L60 enchanter to make way. What they do with one group many guilds consider a raid target :) I'd love to be a shaman in a group like this.<br />
<br />
In other words if you regularly group with &quot;overpower&quot; groups, or &quot;high-challenge&quot; groups the shaman has a lot of value. The regular pickup XP group falls into neither of these categories. The shaman will generally be aware that their inclusion is an indication that the group is sub-optimal (I came to dread enchanters for this reason).<br />
<br />
Shaman Soloing:<br />
<br />
In a guild? Lets assume you managed to get your epic, malos and Torpor/Quiscience. You've also got excellent gear? If so you can take pride in your ability to take down some impressive old-world big-game that summons. It's not really efficient for XP though.<br />
<br />
Not such great gear? As long as you have Torpor / Q you can still root rot mobs. Melee's not too scary if you're not getting hit. You have great mana regeneration but no snare, so things are a bit more dangerous. Still, you can solo any mob that doesn't summon, can be rooted and can be got single in an area with some room to maneuver. Certainly better than nothing, but you can't compete with the druid agro kiting with a charmed pet for safety and efficiency.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Shaman are not rare, in fact PoP has made them one of the favored bot classes. <br />
<br />
If you are not in a guild then getting the neccessities of being a shaman (malos, torpor, Q) is going to be painful. And without them you're gimpy. <br />
<br />
A shaman with great gear is quite durable. An enchanter with their rune spells is durable in a different way. The runes are easier to get for a non-guilded character.<br />
<br />
What's more you tend to get pickup groups which are generally &quot;moderately challenging&quot;, in which either a BL (no CC environment) or a ENC (CC environment) combined with a cleric or druid main healer is probably a superior choice to anything involving a shaman. If a group wanted high DPS (such as LDoN) they'd probably prefer a beastlord. If they are facing a challenging environment they probably want an enchanter.<br />
<br />
In essence, for the casual gamer or those forced into a non-guilded life, the shaman is a class with few strengths. And the guilded, geared and valued shaman telling you how good you've got it won't make you feel much better.<br />
<br />
On the positive side soloing up a beastlord is so incredibly trivial after playing a shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya shaman are special. We have so many different spells we can do almost anything. I hope they don't nerf us cause we are so uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mandrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that was very insiteful, it also made me realize the importance of a guild.  shamans really seem to be a pretty core class at the higher leves, i hope they are just as fun to play the whole way up...so far it has been</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never thought of it that way. I like playing a shaman. I'm familiar with my spells and my skills. DPS is obviously not our strong point...<br />
<br />
So what is it that makes us so much fun to play? <br />
<br />
I don't know the answer to that. We all have our personal preferences. I know I enjoy the feeling I get in those rare occurances where the cleric and druid die and I have to pull our butts out of the fire. Sometimes you're a hero and usually not, but the times you are make it worthwhile. We re definitely great buffers, and debuffers, and alot of people like us in their groups despite our lack of DPS.</div></div><hr />

Or if your a necro,....etc<br />

Everyone has only ONE SPOT that they are clearly the best at..<br />
Magician is only slightly less DPS than wizard for instance...<br />

<br />
<br />
Just thank GOD you're not a pure melee...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Our slow is the best slow in the game, but not by much.  When I see people looking for someone for their group, they ask for a slower..  not for a shaman.  Slower = shaman, chanter, and beastlord.  Meaning any of which will work.   Both chanters and BLs can also be used for a group looking for DPS...   I've never been asked to fill a dps role.<br />
<br />
p.s.  I like shaman and have been and will only play a shaman for a long time, I just think we're not as balanced as most people (other shaman being a big part of them) seem to think we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One of the things I like is if I get agro from debuffing too much i can take a few smacks without dying. I usually turn on attack actually if mob comes at me. Might as well add some dps while they close enuff. Tank will pull it off eventually or I'll VP it or I'll back off. We are a hardy class and we can take some damage. We also can deal out some damage. Most enchanters die easy if hit too much. Beasts can slow but they can't maloXX or cripple or heal as well as us etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Shaman class is probably one of the more rewarding classes.  The more you put into it, the more you get out of it.  The problem is, you have to put quite a bit in it to start getting some nice reward.  Also, being sub 60 sucks, if you can't level up and you dislike the class so much at your level, don't play it.  I remember hating 56 - 60 myself.  Dinging 60 was great though. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My thoughts on this...I pretty much gave up playing my 56 Ranger a while ago because it was damn near impossible to get a group without AM3/EQ (Pre-LDoN) I have been climbing the ladder again on my Shaman, now 54, and loving it, I usually don't have problems finding groups, can be main healer, ALWAYS main slower and during downtime (cleric LOM) Stoicism helps a lot. Everyone wants our buffs and I've completed assassinate missions with only 1 melee left. Stoic on me and overDoT the mob. (Venom of Snake, E Bolt, Plague, Curse) Ensures I get agro and park myself in a corner so I can channel heals. We are extremely versatile and it's been proven time and again, so what if other classes have higher DPS? Who lives through an unslowed mob when the cleric or druid yells OOM? Noone. Who can take some abuse? Us. Before ya go knockin our downfalls, look at our strengths and survivability. I love my shaman, and no other class has made me feel quite so invincible in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It doesn't make me poorer to find other people love the class, quite the opposite. My ideal would be i'm the only who has doubts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman Grouping: Varies, but generally low.<br />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
Shaman grouping:always getting guild/pick up groups with both of my two shamans 65 (bluebie) and 54 (pvp).<br />
<br />
Stackability: ub3r!<br />
one slowing,the other one can be main healer ?<br />
At your lvl 55 the stackability of two shamans in a group is really amazing and buffing duty can be shared  ;) Crowd control is done and dog-dog x 2...<br />
No need of another healer and no need of a chanter.<br />
<br />
two shamans, one tank, dps dps dps or two shamans and 4 dps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agree 100% on the raid roles. Shaman are great on raids if you're no.1 or no.2. Beyond that it isn't half as much fun except on raids with lots of mobs so everyone is debuffing. <br />
<br />
As for grouping - I find groups very easily. For normal LDoN I find bard+shaman is very desirable, particularly for melee groups. Bard is often busy pulling so not around to slow. Druid or cleric can help heal, or I can do it myself. <br />
<br />
Whilst I agree we're replacable with ench/bst and sometimes even a bard for slowing, we're have some other very desirable features besides slow:<br />
<br />
1) Respectable haste, will cap most 65s<br />
2) Can function as main healer, or backup heals<br />
3) Massive attack buff (FA)<br />
4) Nice hp and stat buffs (Focus, boar)<br />
5) Can handle some CC with rooting or offtanking, and can take the hits. VP really helps with this.<br />
6) Can keep going and going - how often do you wait for cleric/druid to med vs wait for shaman?<br />
<br />
Beastlord can't offer the patch healing or buffing ability that we can, nor can they root park adds or better still VP them out the way. Enchanter haste is better, but for anyone with 40% haste item its not going to help. Bard's can't heal, slow is only half the power of ours, and if they're hasting and slowing and pulling and crowd control then they're not going to be singing any of the other lovely songs they have. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman are the best, but nor are we the worst. I think there's a reasonable balance between us and other slowing classes in xp groups. I actually think its the enchanters loosing out these days as bards take over the CC role more, particularly in LDoN.<br />
<br />
The situation does vary according to level and gear and where you're fighting but overall I don't see us doing too badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OMG now you guys ARE whining!<br />
<br />
  I have NEVER had an issue finding something to do on my shaman,  I can find a group in a second, or solo or raid.  If I have any complaints at all its that I have trouble leaving a group because the group won't survive without me.<br />
  I just can't believe you guys are finding something to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd not really looked at the 65 spells other than quiscience. Effectively the core of the shaman's power comes from malos and torpor. At level 60 these are going to cost you big bickies unless you're in a guild. The spells are very desired and very rare.<br />
<br />
Thankfully pop has added options! except the spells that make or break a shaman are all rune spells. These are going to cost you big bickies unless you're in an uber guild.... damn, that sounds familiar for some reason.<br />
<br />
If Malos / Torpor where spectrals or less ridiculously rare mob drops i'd be a lot more cheerful about being a shaman. The idea of levelling to 65 still casting Stoicism and with a resistable resist debuff chills me :/<br />
<br />
And Shaman will certainly get groups, since slow is mandatory in PoP. Thus the non guilded shaman can certainly level to 65. The real challenge of the class seems to be filling out your spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In response to the original post.<br />
<br />
I am a perfect example of a non-guilded casual gamer shaman, I have bazaar bought gear lv 65 about 100 AA. Here is the best reason why shaman are so much fun. You never have to wait for a group as long as there are other people lfg. As a shaman if you zone into say BoT and their are say only 2 or 3 people lfg. No matter what the class I can take any or all of them and start killing. Why? Because I tank, I can slow, I can pull and I can heal. So basically as long as said lfg person can do some damage we can go hunt. Further your in a 6 man exp group, you can keep that group going indeffinatly for reasons stated above, if the tank leaves you tank till a replacement, if the cleric leaves you heal till a replacement, ect...There isn't a single other class in EQ who can do such a thing in a high level zone. Basically playing a shaman can give you incredible level of control over how you spend your gaming time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is no other class that can debuff a mob the way we can.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look.<br />
<br />
1.  Malos is totally unresistable, fire, magic, poison and cold debuffer.<br />
2.  Malicious decay is totally unresistable - the only unresistable disease debuffer in the game (that I am aware of).<br />
3.  Cripple! omg.<br />
4.  Slow.  Whine all you want about other classes being able to slow, but the fact of the matter is, most enchanters can't withstand slow agro, and hence, they are NOT the preferred slowers.  <br />
<br />
And no other class can buff melee stats like we can.<br />
<br />
1.  Strength - PE, Talisman of the Diaku, Focus = 140 <br />
2.  Dexterity - PE, Talisman of the Diaku, Focus = 140<br />
3.  Agility - Wulan, PE = 80<br />
4.  Stamina - Boar, PE = 80<br />
5.  Ferine Avatar (the bane of my spell set) = +140 to everything<br />
<br />
So, where are we balanced?  <br />
<br />
1.  Our heals will never match those of a druid or cleric - though QS is godly and combined with the occassional backup hit of Tnargs, we can be main healer in anything but elemental/time planes.  In some places, I can be healer in elemental anyway, but it's difficult.<br />
<br />
2.  No group heals.<br />
<br />
3.  No mana regen buff to cast on others.  Though, we have amazing mana regen to make up for it.  Usually, the second Can5 after I die (3 min) I am FM (and I have over 5700 mana pool).<br />
<br />
4.  Decent HP buff, but not even as nice as Nine from a druid.  Doesn't stack for clerics.<br />
<br />
I am so very happy with my shaman.  I try to play twinks sometimes, but I can't seem to stop playing my main girl.  She can do damn near anything.  If she had snare, she would be majorly overpowered.  Doesn't stop me from wanting it!</div></div><hr />

Ya, we're balanced alright.|<br />
<br />
Shaman buffs are better than any other classes, I dont know too many other casters that can cast HOS/IoS, then max out someones STA, STR, DEX, and AGI with a few simple casts creating more HP than other similarly levelled classes. With Brells steadfast Aegis, Temperance, IoS and the sta buffs I can easily get over 2700HP with my 30 paladin. lets see other classes do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always fun trying to get wizards summoned cause you keep telling them you're out DPSing them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Although the original post is certainly well written and accurate, I believe it is a bit shallow.  In my opinion, what a lot of folks miss about the value of the Shaman are the more subtle things that really tend to make a big difference, but in the background.  <br />
<br />
True, DPS is not our strength, but we can do very good damage over time.  Yeah, it is always the Wiz criting for 6K that gets noticed, but a decent Shaman has no problem stacking 6K worth of DoTs on a mob without breaking a sweat or praying for a crit.  Also, don't discount dogdog, with a little TLC and some buffing/weps, he's like a good DoT that just keeps on going and going.<br />
<br />
Also, as was said, with our mana regen, we can outlast any other caster, period.  We will be casting those DoTs and DDs long after the rest have to sit to med.  Or we will be spot healing when the cleric and druid are OOM.  This is many times overlooked, until you group with a Shaman that saves your butt because he could cast when everyone else was OOM.  <br />
<br />
Crowd control is also a strength not a weakness of ours.  Sure, we can't mez/snare, but with pet parking (ala Mage or BL) and VP/root, we can solo 3-4 mobs, so why don't people think we can CC 3-4 in a group.  I do it all the time, even in the fast paced LDoN environment (usually the only thing that keeps the group from getting wiped).  There are many other little things that add to our value, but I won't go into all of them now.  Suffice to say, like most, I never have a problem finding a group, period.<br />
<br />
Face it, we are not the flashiest class around, but like in real life, the guy with the staying power usually gets the girl in the long run (and keeps her happy).  And, being able to fill almost any role, makes this class the most enjoyable I've found, and I've played them ALL (except for Wiz, could not bare to struggle until lvl 29 when they get snare :P).<br />

My slow is slightly stronger, BUT more importantly, my slow is slightly stronger AND has a significantly faster cast time.  Plus with my roots, VP, pet, debuffs, superior AC and HP, I can take a beating most times from a slowed mob.  A good enchanter will rune and get significant HP gear, use mezz, stuns, charm and if their smart, they have a high survivability rate, but on a sustained pull, they have more issues later on than shaman do with staying alive (assuming the shaman is as well AAed and geared as the chanter).<br />
<br />
I get unsolicited tells to group all the time although sometimes I just prefer soloing, and I can.<br />
<br />
We are weak on burst DPS and our effectiveness with DoTs is quickly falling behind necros further with every expansion.  That said, there is still stuff I can do that no other class can.  Our spells are largely horribley mana ineffective which negates some of our mana regen effectiveness.  Spell aggro is insane and in conjunction with the high mana costs, we'd get eatten in most scenarios if we do all we are capable of.  Our best spell hasn't been upgraded in 14 levels and there are no signs it will be.<br />
<br />
All said, I love my class.  I get lots of spells and abilities to play with.  If I'm smart, I can fill almost any group roll.  I like being the 4-5th shaman in a raid (when I bother to raid anymore) because all I gotta do is DPS, utility and heal.  I'm not even expected to buff anymore so I can blow my mana doing stuff I never get a chance to do in ordinary situations.</div></div><hr />

Man, I'm glad I'm not on Bertox.  Either those guys were total tools, or were single-mindedly following their own skill mix formula.  Either way, you are better off not grouping with them, they will only get you killed if you don't play their style (or they are tools, which will guarantee death).  <br />
<br />
Not every group you can get into is one you should.  And many times the ones you don't get into are the ones you shouldn't group with.  On the Nameless, I never go more than 15 min without a group, and last night I got a tell from someone while solo, and I didn't even have my lfg flag up.  If that happens again, find some other Shaman, Druids, Necros, any of the &quot;less preferred&quot; classes and go adventure.  I'm sure you can find a way to win in LDoN with almost any skill mix.  Let the Pally's cross-heal and all die when one or more of them go OOM and they can't keep up with the healing.  900 pts of heal on a bad pull is not very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">On the LDoN sub-thread:<br />
I have been on only about two dozen adventures, but I have seen successes with 4 or 5 different skill sets.  I am becoming convinced that a group of 65's with a ot of AA (a lot to  me, all over 100 easily) can do an adventure with almost any skillset.<br />
<br />
1.    With an &quot;uber&quot; rogue friend, who grabbed a war and pal from his guild, a druid to heal (don't even remeber who was in sixth spot, lol) we flew through a Normal adventure.  I loaded Torgors so I could slow more frequently - If a mob resisted, it was at 50% before Turgurs refreshed.  DPS and people not tanking damage because of their defensive AA's, not sure they need a  slower at all.<br />
<br />
2.  With a good bard pulling - all singles, usually slowed 52% on arrival, and the melee did not have to stop hitting except to change targets.  AA levels in this group were not quite as high as no. 1, mainly because our druid had just hit 65 two days earlier.  <br />
<br />
3.  With an enchanter pulling - mezzing aheead, so all single pulls, very little time to have Pal pull next mob in to kill.  This group also had a high AA rogue for dps.  I was slowing everything easilly.<br />
<br />
4. with a Wiz doing CC!  Kiting adds back to cleared rooms.  Rest of Group could deal with two and Wiz would be back with half dead mob for us.<br />
<br />
5.  With a druid, paladin and cleric and minimal dps - were afraid of two pulls, much less more, and pacified everything before pulling.  Slow moving, but worked well for Rescue and Assassination adventures.  For Collection or Slaughter, any little set back was an issue.  This approach was with people with very few AA (my 55 was the highest, hehe).<br />
<br />
As a shaman I found way sto help all of these approaches.  And I did not try the shaman pulling approach, which I have seen described on the Crucible.  I am not an experienced puller.<br />
<br />
So - if they want to go with three paladins, let them.  I bet it works, too.  I also think that three shaman with 200 AA's could run a LDoN group like clockwork, as well.</div></div><hr />

I usually (not without fail) get an LDON group within 5 minutes of turning LFG on.  And once I find one they generally want to keep me around a while.:)  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to negate your experience, but on Brell we are definitely still wanted in groups.  I wonder why this would differ from server to server.  <br />
<br />
I think I did about 12 LDON groups this weekend.<br />
<br />
You might want to try making a pet only group.  I did one with 2 necros, a bl, a druid and a mage and me, we tore through the dungeon faster than any other group I've been in:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you are not in a guild then getting the neccessities of being a shaman (malos, torpor, Q) is going to be painful. And without them you're gimpy. <br />
<br />
What's more you tend to get pickup groups which are generally &quot;moderately challenging&quot;, in which either a BL (no CC environment) or a ENC (CC environment) combined with a cleric or druid main healer is probably a superior choice to anything involving a shaman. If a group wanted high DPS (such as LDoN) they'd probably prefer a beastlord. If they are facing a challenging environment they probably want an enchanter.<br />
<br />
In essence, for the casual gamer or those forced into a non-guilded life, the shaman is a class with few strengths. And the guilded, geared and valued shaman telling you how good you've got it won't make you feel much better.<br />
<br />
On the positive side soloing up a beastlord is so incredibly trivial after playing a shaman :)<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this has not been my experience at all.<br />
<br />
I am guilded, but I am in a very small family guild.  I can't think of the last time we had to make 2 groups for something - we are lucky to have 6 people on at a time.    I am on CST and work nights and they are on EST and work days.  I generally log on in time to tell them good night:)<br />
<br />
I have malos.  A friend bought it and gave it to me.   I have torpor.  We waited and collected the parts for it and made it.  I believe I paid 4k in bazaar for the last piece.   I don't have Q yet but I almost have the cash to buy it.  I could also get it if I wanted to endure many tedious hours in BOT, but frankly I'd rather buy it.  I have the vast, vast majority of my 1-60 spells.   Yes, I am missing Talisman of Raptor, but when would I need it?   I have all of my 61-64 spells.  In time I will have all of my 65 spells.  It will not be tomorrow.  I am not in a hurry.   My gear is ok.  In time it will be better.  I don't consider myself gimpy.<br />
<br />
I have a friends list that I check when I log on to see if anyone needs a shaman.  If they don't, I go lfg.  I usually get a group within 5-10 minutes of turning lfg on.  Sometimes I meet great people that way, and they get added to my friends list.  Sometimes I meet people who aren't so great, and I try to avoid grouping with them again.    My won/loss record in LDON isn't geat.  I don't care.   If I don't feel like grouping (*extremely* rare) I can solo.  There are a lot of AAs and quest items and LDON items I want.  I hate to raid, so I don't.  I have many goals to accomplish:)<br />
<br />
I am very happy, and I think I have it pretty great:)  And I know I am valued, guilded or not:)<br />
<br />
Note - this doesn't mean I don't think the class could use some improvements.  I just love being a shaman.</div></div><hr />

I've been using my shaman for buffs and a bot in the planes lately (warrior main), and about 1/3rd of the time I get messages asking if the shaman wants to join a group in ldon...and I don't even have lfg on! ;)   I've actually had to start turning afk on immediately so my bot doesn't get asked to join a group... :p <br />
<br />
Getting groups for my warrior is another story altogether, although I don't think I've waited more than half an hour yet.  (total of about 60 missions)<br />

I agree shaman aren't a dps class and they aren't the best healers, but the utility they offer is second to none (imho.)  Shaman allow everyone else to shine, and my experience is, most people recognize this fact and want shaman in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">We get held back from having better dps and healing because of one thing, turgurs...   and yet chanters and beastlords can slow decently and have superior dps.   Some may say we don't get better because they think we could solo too well.  We still wouldn't be able to solo as well as a wizard, druid, chanter, necro, or bard.  And all this does is hold us back in groups where I would like to think a lot of us would rather be, hunting in a group.  I mean hold us back from doing more dps in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't agree with shaman being inferior or unwanted.  Not only is it not my experience, but my abilities allow me to do all sorts of different thing, especially in a normal mode LDoN dungeon.  I can slow and heal (done it before, was fun, but challenging), if we have a BL, let them slow and I'll heal and drop AE rains on multi pulls.  I generally out DPS any other healing class on a long term basis strictly due to my superior mana regen (while adopting the prime healer role).  Granted, in LDoN normal mode, I don't think the difference between a 75% and a 65% slow is all that big a deal, but honestly, I don't care.  I always find a role to play, I always make myself usefull.<br />
<br />
The shaman class is getting mitigated to hell, but we are still a fairly balanced and effective class with lots of abilities to offer almost any group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I love myself!  (my shammy, that is)  I'm only 51st level but I almost always feel that I contribute to my group's success...perhaps this will change with time (and I may never do much raiding...but keep in mind that many roles are duplicated on raids).  I keep saying that maybe things will change as I level up...but I've been saying that for a long time now and if anything, I think I help groups more with time.<br />
<br />
We have a wide variety of roles we can do...even if we're not the best at everything.  Groups can only have 6 people so any shammy should be able to find some way to contribute regardless of group composition.<br />
<br />
I find that yeah, my DD is weak and my DoTs are so-so...but with my puppy I do contribute to damage...and puppy contributes every single fight.  Combine that with my slowing (I'm almost always my group's slower), healing (gimpy but I make it a point to touch up clerics and the non-main tank which clerics generally appreciate, especially if they're burning mana on pac), buffing, hasting (if there's no chanter guess who hears the regular 'haste fading' bit), rooting (I root in self defense if I aggro slowing, root adds to slow em if no mezzer, root anything that aggros on the cleric), and more.  Heck, with my less than stellar gear and KEI I'm usually floating in mana and even toss a DoT or a few DDs here and there while doing everything else.  Granted, some of this may not be viable at higher levels but I'll have to see it myself before I throw in the towel.<br />
<br />
Looking at all the things I regularly do for any group I'm in makes me wonder how they ever get by without a shaman!  (and I didn't even list all the potential things I might do)<br />
<br />
I've had mixed success having 2 shaman in a group.  Overall I think it's viable.  You have two puppies and twice the potential for covering our wide variety of roles.  When I do this one will be slower and one will help with damage output DDing, DoTing, or whatever works.  The only time I've had 2 shammies not work was due to bad communication, arrogance, or just not a good personality mix (which would be a factor regardless of class).<br />

When you get down to it, a shaman added to just about ANY other mix of players works.  You can add a shaman to 5 necros or 5 rouges and you can make it work.  Maybe not too useful in a AOE group I guess.  Stacking on raids isn't super, as we dont default to DPS all that well, although I guess we could do 120ish dps keeping bane and BoS up on a mob, if it lasted long enough to put the dots on it.</div></div><hr />

Character Development will be tough with any class, you are not going to get all your spells and the best weapons in the game by just being the required level. Lvl 65 beastlords have a expensive 65% slow to get. <br />
Shaman stackability, its true that the more shamans the less are needed to debuff. However rather than dwell on this perceived weakness, take thought of other classes roles on raids. When they don't have a role they do dps. This is where shamans can with a bit of stacking and some thought can add dps on a raid in form of dots, shamans are also very valuable in adding spam heals especially when you have mobs with a 3k proc. Also shamans are usually the curers with the AE dotters. <br />
Again in LDon, shamans can provide dps on top of slowing and also shamans are the best melee buffers in the game discounting haste. On normal adventures I find I don't need to use malos, mem malosini for quick casting, also sometimes AE slow is good. Hard adventures, shamans are also very desirable. Btw Ldon dots rock for damage. <br />
Its true shamans do need a kinda big spell lineup and I am guessing this is probably the biggest offputter to you levelling further, as in your conclusion you mentioned 2 times about runes.</div></div><hr />

That totally sucks Fuda, but its the exception, not the rule. I get LDoN groups regularly. In fact, the morning LDoN crews of the most advanced guild on Bert send me tells EVERY day asking what I am doing. In Hard runs a Shaman is near essential, because the chanter has to be on top of CC and charm. In Normal runs, I don't even bother slowing most times, I am just primary healer. Stuff dies too fast to even bother with slow, when a well placed Q does basically the same thing (replace hps = mitigate damage).</div></div><hr />

Cann5 effectively puts a dent in your constant canning.  If your magelo is up to date, get cann5.  With this AA you become free to open up with more spells and less time doing mana regen.  Cann4 is pretty effective, and in combination with cann5, I do DPS, buffs, slows, BU heals and I still have time left to sexxor some of my former guildmates and goof around.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we're gimp clerics and suck at DPS compared to many classes.  So what?  It's a game that has attempted to make sure that every class has some weakness.  If you don't like the shaman schtick - there are planty of other classes for you to take a stab at.</div></div><hr />

There is another way to look at this same situation and see why shaman are so great.  Shaman can do everything and when they do they make the best groups for farming exp.  One shaman and the rest damage.  What other class can do that?  Put avatar on your main tank, and four rogues, monks, rangers, and that is your DPS.  Do not discount the buffs a shaman puts on the group towards DPS.<br />

haveing played both a shaman and a chanter into the 50+ (shaman is 65) range I can tell you without a doubt that chanters do not surrvive well as the primary slower. tash=huge agro, slow after an eternity spent casting it = huge agro, mez=huge agro. with a fresh rune and a ton of buffs my hp might break 3k and once the rune is down you cant get that back with a heal. my ldon success is outstanding, and on every signle one where we have had a death it has always been my chanter...sometimes others die as well but he goes down first every single time.<br />
<br />
my shaman on the other hand can flat out tank if I get agro from adds or if I just over agro.<br />
<br />
and an example for those who think others can do what we do,<br />
<br />
when I was 50something I found myself in PoI with 5 melees crying for a cleric, I said lets go. none of them thought we could do it. group regen, one tank pulls and he tanks first fight, my goal is slow and to keep him alive, NOT at full health, just needs to survive the fight, next mob different tank same strat, and so on and so on, sure I spend the entire time cani, down time I have 5  melees BW on me but with the time spent not tanking Regen heals the tanks back up so we can cycle tanks and keep pulling, the ONLY class on that list that could possibly do that is a cleric, and with no real mana regen the down time would be at least triple what it was with me in there.<br />
<br />
as for dps, I have very little trouble with dps on most boss mobs that will take a dot, for seru I had 10 dots on him for close to 2 min (then it was MY turn to tank!) but I didnt want the faction hit anyway.<br />
I have ks'd raids before with dot stacking. yes our burst dps sucks ass, but no caster can keep up the dps we put out for anywhere near the duration we are capable of.<br />
<br />
as for class balance, the one thing I would like to see is resists getting fixed, nothing pisses me off like getting BoS resisted 4 times on a blue Malosini'd mob, at least tac on a resist modifier to our highest dots. nothing I like more than haveing the best mana regen in game only to have the highest resist rate on my primary means of dealing damage.</div></div><hr />

haveing played both a shaman and a chanter into the 50+ (shaman is 65) range I can tell you without a doubt that chanters do not surrvive well as the primary slower. <br />
<br />
There's a reason why we always say &quot;it's not a real raid unless a chanter dies&quot;   :p   (and in case you're curious...I've heard that saying from different people in 3 guilds on emarr now...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Interesting replies, thanks. The difference in agro between malo and tash is an aspect I hadn't considered.<br />
<br />
Someone said that they're always &quot;prime slower&quot; in any group they're in. I think this is fairly obvious. Shaman have the best slow and simply won't get invited to groups that do not need their slow. Barring the rarer case of being the &quot;prime healer&quot;.<br />
<br />
In groups I have been in a shaman playing &quot;healer and slower&quot; makes me very, very nervous. It works fine as long as everything goes perfectly, but two mobs and no CC, a string of resists on slow, an unslowable mob, or early agro on the shaman and things get dicey. This is less of an issue, of course, if the shaman and tank (pref. knight) are superbly geared.<br />
<br />
The shaman matures the latest of any class in the game. You need solid gear (to support the reputation for durability) rare spells that only occur at level 60 or runes at level 65. You also need substantial AA (canni-V). So to an extent I haven't experienced being a &quot;real&quot; shaman. However the fact that so many people seem to love this stage argues that perhaps i've missed something even at this level.<br />
<br />
I'll have to consider whether to delete my shaman (to stop &quot;sympathy levelling&quot;), re-roll and try again, or continue. Quite possibly i'll end up levelling the beast so he can farm for Torpor :)<br />
<br />
It does seem to me that a lot of people are in love with the &quot;diversity&quot;, imagery and internal durability of the shaman. This doesn't mean my analysis of their place in a group is invalid. Nor, given the game-imbalancing power of slow, does it mean they'll suddenly stop getting groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">If you don't find it fun then just quit yes, a lot of people do find shamans fun and not simply when the shaman is 65 with all their spells. Its the journey getting there which counts more of the experience than attaining the prestiged title of 65 Shaman with all his spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Don't get me wrong as I love my shaman.  But LDoN has changed the game for me.  My regular LDoN group is warrior, cleric, bard, druid, druid (or pally) and myself.  If its a reg adventure I dont slow anymore.<br />
<br />
I find that odd.  The bard slow is way more then enough.  All I do is drop rains and cold DD.  I have not parsed it but I would imagine that my DPS is substantially less then the other characters.  Although maybe superior mana regen makes up for this over the long haul.<br />
<br />
Anyways I still find it hard not to slow mobs but thats the way it is now at least for adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Interesting group. I guess that means the druids are actually the DPS engine of the group!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">the agro from tash is insane compared to shaman slow, I picked up a poker from PoI for my chanter that has a 40% agro reduction modifier to it and I STILL snag agro a good 30% of the time and I wait to tash until I see the shamans &quot;Slowing %t&quot; message. the tank is usually a very well geared warrior with tricksters up and agro proccing weapons. as much as it sucks to get a resisted slow mob pounding on my shaman it doesnt realy phase me anymore, I die so rarely to mob melee with my shaman its almost a non factor, my chanter on the other hand goes down very quickly.<br />
<br />
Bad pull I get a resist on my first mez, bam a mob that noone is trying to gain agro with is now pounding the hell out of my no ac low hp praying for no interupt ass while the healer is keeping the tank alive with a 10 sec spell...it realy is a whole different game between those 2 classes. hell I Know for a fact I died more than I had to with my chanter because I was so used to how tough my shamy was to kill. <br />
<br />
<br />
that said, the 50's really were very difficult lvls for me with my shaman, the exp is hard to get compared to pre50, our heals just plain blow (chloroblast while fantastic in pvp just dont cut it in a group) and torpor/malo are just not there for you in any form and those 2 spells are game changing literally. its tough but personally I find that the reward is worth it, I love logging in and seeing &quot;OMG Diab is on we can raid XXX now!&quot; in /gu as my first text other than the mtod.   I love soling mobs for somone elses epic parts and telling them to come loot. hell for that matter I love casting FA on int casters durring the clear before a raid just to see the reaction when they notice their stats.  take a break if you need one, dont delete a 50+ toon just cause you are fed up at the moment, play something else, tribes 2 is a ton of fun :) <br />
<br />
ok its late and I am rambling, have fun whatever you do, that is after all the whole point behind playing games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get groups usually within seconds of logging on, before I even get lfg turned on with my shaman, BUT, I feel I am getting more and more limited in my role in LDoN groups. I slow and malo, and by the time thats done the mobs are so close to death that dots are pointless. And all of my dmg spells seem to be HIGHLY resisted. <br />
<br />
I have OK gear. 1950hp, 998ac 189 wis selfbuffed, manapres III, but I really seem to be lagging in LDoN compared to my necro and druid. I can tell the difference slows make in group dmg taken, but I also notice that mobs die a LOT faster when I play my necro in a group compared to my shaman in the same group (pally, clr, chanter, dru, bst me (necro/shm).<br />
<br />
I keep thinking  that I should do hard missions where my slows can have more impact, but no one in my level range seems to even want to consider hard missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Do you ordinarily have a difficult time sticking slows in your adventures without Maloxxxx?  I would suggest you drop that off your lineup and add something in its place - Maloxxx on normal level dungeons is just not necessary.  I think in my own experiences (normal 60-65 dungeons), I'll come across *maybe* 3 mobs out of 50+ that resist slow once or twice.  Rather than using Maloxxx, use that time to use a nuke or a dot in its place.  And if slow is resisted twice, burn it down instead of trying a third cast  :p <br />
<br />
It's highly rare for me to be able to cast any sort of dot during a dungeon.  (don't have the new Curse line yet)  There's just no time for it.  I mean, I guess there's time for it but if I see a ldon critter at 50% hp, that's worthy of nukah, not dottah, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I don't use malos in adventures apart from the hard adventures. But on normal adventures I use malosini and slow, so what I am doing is using 2 attempts at a slow. Its helpful for me to keep up. And I usually have a dot or dd in place of root as I have a clicky root item and Virulent Paralysis. Thats just my tactic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once past the 50s groups are all over. <br />
<br />
One skill we have i didn't see mention (skimed the last half of this thread) is Resist Debuffs. We can lower them all with little agro added and anything past T2 planes u should be casting a malo of some sort to ensure ur slow lands as quick as possible. In BoT on pull when mob is still incoming i always throw malo out there. It makes Wizards happy. It makes Tanks happy when ur slow lands on the first cast.<br />
<br />
I don't see Beastlords as a viable slower in the planes because against tough mobs if no one is debuffing it's resists your SoL buddy. Enchanters can do this aswell but our Slow is superior in time casting and percentage.<br />
<br />
I back up heal all the time. Druids enjoy me saving them mana aswell as clerics.<br />
<br />
In LDoN I am on CC most the time parking mobs.<br />
<br />
Usually i find froups within 10 minutes of putting LFG on. I can't complain. I love Shamans. As a Druid it was impossible to find a group Pre Heal upgrades.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of classes that need balance more then we do. Shamans don't need to compalin. We have it good. We can buff we can debuff, we can heal, we can Dot, we have a lvl 58 pet that can turn out soem decent DPS with mage summoned items + your buffs. <br />
<br />
SHAMANS OWN! Why is no one happy with their class nowadays. Only people that have room to complain nowadays are Pure melee and they are opening up the game for them with the enchancements.<br />
<br />
I know a Magician that complains about not having DC .. DC! they only get 1 charm spell for christ sakes. Hell We get multiple animal charms. Give us DC too... <br />
<br />
If u can't find a group. Go solo w/ LFG on. if u don't like to solo play a differant class. Stop complaining and enjoy the versitility of the Shaman Class!</div></div><hr />
