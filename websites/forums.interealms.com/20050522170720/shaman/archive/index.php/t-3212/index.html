How to play EQ drunk.<br />
by mill<br />
<br />
hi all, <br />
<br />
My name is Mill, and I am an alcoholic. <br />
<br />
I have mastered the art of playing eq drunk, and I just wanted to share some info and ideas with you.<br />
<br />
I happen to live with my brother, who is 32, and i am 28, we have a network setup at home, and most of the time, we have a third computer of a friends hooked up as well, just want to let you know my setup.<br />
<br />
Preperation: You first need to banish all the people in your life who may be a hinderance. For me this is primarily my girlfriend, but be this, wife, husband, dog, anything, make up an excuse to get the the hell away. Im tired and am going to bed early works well for me. Next, you need an ample supply of preferred beverage. I love Old Milwaukee Light beer, so one case and some extra is nice, for two, we usually get two cases, and always have the crisper in the fridge full of &quot;mystery beer&quot;, the stuff other people leave when partying at our place. This insures that you have enough even if your liver is kicking ass that night. Also, make sure the way to the bathroom is clear, in case you need to talk to god on the big white telephone. Smokes. jerky, this is a great tool, helps remove the watery mouth im about to puke taste after a particularly brutal death(will explain later). <br />
<br />
Rules: Drink whenever somone says drink in group or guild, no arguments. Biggest rule, if somone in your party dies, finish a full beer. If you die, finish your beer, and pound/funnel abother full one. If more than one person on your party dies, finish, and pound/funnel one for each persons death. This is non negotiable, and really makes you play sharp, or crazy depending on thirst. this is all done after the battle, and when it is deemed &quot;safe&quot;. This can get messy, during a nagafen raid, everyone in my party died at least once, i limited myself to funneling a 6 pack, this was done after the raid, and took me about 15 to 20 minutes(found out next day i puked that night). <br />
<br />
Set your alarm clock(if you work) before you start, because you will never remember after. <br />
<br />
Some neat things that ahve happened to me. Well, I was in kedge one night, and remember the entrance is all, later on, i guess we were in bubble room, and i refused to acknowledge i had a pet, even though my guild kept telling me it was beside me, i insisted it was a kill stealing druid and i was going to out nuke it. Only one person died, that was my brother and he was drunker than me anyway.<br />
Planes are always a bonus while drunk, twice I have been in fear, and not remembered leaving, somehow,managed not to die. Important to let your group here know that if you really start babbling, to trick you into leaving, anything to get you out. <br />
<br />
This is just a rough guide, because the real thing cant truly be written down, as you never remember it if done properly. Stories you hear about yourslef can be truly heroic, or utterly catastrophic. Everything is more fun though, even if your a light drinker(twelve pack and under) Beer makes med time almost as desired as fight time, and you seek new ways to remain at full mana(no, i cant fight yet, only 90% mana, drink!). Now, go out and do this, and do it often and soon, if you dont, you simply are not enjoying eq. <br />
<br />
Oh, and people think im roleplaying when really hammered, But i just cant type by this point, and cant explain it, so Ogres get a racial drinking bonus i think. Thought this just a little humor that should be read. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssizzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Argh... it looks nice, but the site is now pretty much unuseable for anyone at 640x480... <br />
<br />
Any chance you could allow scrollbars on the left frame and not set the width of the right frame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">640 x 480 ??!!  People still do that? <br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, some rollovers and a selected state on the menu would be nice. It's a clean design and I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Remoh Nospmis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm at 800X600...  And it's a bit cramped(sp?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking as a web designer, pretty much no one designs for 640 x 480 anymore. It's a thing of the past, sorry :(. I even find it confining to design for 800 x 600 now. I did a poll on my Western Wastes site, and I believe over 80% of the viewers were running 1024 x 768 or higher resolution, granted EQ players tend to have higher end computers than the average web surfer.<br />
<br />
At home I run a 19&quot; monitor at 1600 x 1200, and at work 1024 x 768.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think I'm the only one left running 1152 x 864.  Allows me to run EQW in a 1024x768 window and still have screen real-estate left over to get at other stuff.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i've been running 1600x1200 for almost four years now.  i can't afford a monitor that will do higher resolution at 75hz or i'd bump it up.<br />
<br />
back on topic - site looks good madcovv.  i don't suppose i'll be able to bribe you into linking to my FAQ when i bang out a final draft? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ssizzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Speaking as a web designer, pretty much no one designs for 640 x 480 anymore.<br />
<br />
Also speaking as a web designer... many people still do. Or at least design it so the page is still navigable ar 640x480, if not pretty...<br />
<br />
There are people with a) poor eyesight, b) old monitors, c) old graphics cards out there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will work on the 640 X 480 issue, i dont want to block anyone from getting information.<br />
<br />
Talamay I would love to link to your FAQ , Thats what the site is all about :)<br />
<br />
Any other guides/FAQs are appreciated too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope to see some of you at Fan Fair ( at least at the hotel bar after)<br />

<br />
*** funneling 6 beer took him 15 minutes??? When I funnel I usually put a beer down every 5-8 seconds :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Looks great!  I remember using that Guide for the Gatorsmash a long, long time ago. =)  Glad to see it around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you care, most of my net browsing is done on my laptop, which is 800x600.  The better PCs are usually hogged my my kids playing EQ, Starcraft, Jedi Knight 2 or MechWarrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anybody, how can you see anything at that res, ok I understand a game with a scalable GUI but EQ or a web page, my type is soooo small at that res I can hardly see it (discounting &quot;old-eyes&quot;) and I'm not running a slouch system either, NEC 19&quot; FE950+ Multisync and GeForce 4 Ti 4600 w/128 for the video.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hiho,<br />
<br />
looks great, but site needs more content for sure. Good to see the shaman epic quest online again (since Belgar's went down).<br />
<br />
Thanx for all your work !<br />
<br />
So long<br />
