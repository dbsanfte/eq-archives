<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kanati</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds to me like they are sacred bundles from Native American religious practices (use is paticularly prevalent among Northwestern tribes). These are generally filled with artifacts (feathers, pipes, etc. of some significance) and wrapped tightly. They are believed to provide spiritual power, which often manifests itself in household protection, healing, etc. As such, it's not terribly uncommon, it's my understanding, to see some of the minor bundles used in the manner mentioned (er...doctoral student specializing in American History-- mainly religious movements-- by the way). Now it's unclear to me wheter these belonged to a Native American family, were adopted by a Neo-pagan group (You'll see New Age groups like Wiccan commonly adopt practices and rituals of Native American groups. I'm not sure if bundles are among them, for varying groups), were considered decorative (many Native American religious artifacts have been turned into commodities to be consumed by American culture) or whether I'm misreading the situation entirely. Medicine bundles tend to be transferred between family or tribe members until they are believed to have lost their power. How to dispose of them is a trickier matter. I would imagine the best way is to burn them or bury them. The means vary among tribes, it's my understanding.  Not sure if this was helpful or not. And who would have thought I'd ever be talking about this stuff on an EQ message board....</div></div><hr />

There have been a few times I had to expain I wasn't really on a Shaman website. But then again, maybe I was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I was a teenager I would wear a little leather pouch around my neck. In it I would place little things that reminded me of something that was important or special in my life. Examples: a small pepple, a folded up letter, a dried flower etc. I would never show anyone what was in it and only opened it myself to place something new in it. I did not do this to follow any religious practice or ritual but was my own little thing that I did. Only time i removed it was to sleep and shower. Unfortunately I accidently left it behind when I moved from my apartment one day. I left it hanging on a doorknob after a shower the day I moved out and was not able to get it back. Somehow leaving it behind felt right though as that move marked a big turning point in my life. I have often wondered what the people who moved in after me thought when they found it or what they did with it though.<br />
<br />
What would I do if i found some? Probably take them outside to a wooded, wild area and hang them from a tree branch and leave them there.</div></div><hr />

 If all you need to keep evil spirits at bay is a thin leather bag, you're probably safe in throwing it out. <br />

(Or words to that effect)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, you should burn these respectfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Native American belief in Spirit pouches is not that they protect one house. They are a communion with the spirits. This does not mean they protect you from evil spirits, but rather they provide you with guidance from the spirits. Good fortune if you will. As far as I know there is no special ceremony reguarding the handling or moving of spirit pouches. As a matter of fact it was custom amongst many tribes to give such pouches to those newly married or those going on a journey. Now I'm not to sure that these are spirit pouches, at least not from a Native American perspective. The reason I say this is she said they were hung above every wondow/door. This is typically suggests they were hung to ward evil spirits from entering the abode. This goes more towards an Eastern European or Asian philosophy. Without knowing the origins or the pouches and the particular culture it comes from I would say that it is going to be nearly impossible to &quot;handle&quot; this situation correctly. The contents may provide a clue as to the origin/purpose and there should not be anything wrong with viewing the contents. I only know of a few rites that would bring negative results from viewing. All of those involve beliefs in &quot;Dark&quot; Magic, for lack of a better term.<br />
<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

so was it a male or female name that sent the email ?</div></div><hr />

Leave it to an EQ addict to be thinking of ways to pick up Women...If you show me your pouch, I'll show you mine!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the Ohwah Tajer Kyam and Mayonnaise rituals should be combined. I liked that.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the funniest thing about all of this is that everyone is laughing or freaking out over the fact that someone left behind a few used potpourri bags and some chick isn't sure how to throw them away.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kanati</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, I think that saying it's all about &quot;communion with spirits&quot; is the right sentiment, but not precisely the way I'd like to see it put. Native American tribes, traditionally-as far as we understand anyway, tried to live in a sort of balance or harmony with nature. This did not always mean they were &quot;friendly&quot; with Nature, a fact that often gets lost in  New Age romanticism of Native American religions. Several tribes, take for example the southeastern Cherokee and Creek, would say a prayer upon a creature such as a bear after they killed it. It was not done as an act of communion, but rather out of fear that the bear's spirit would haunt them and cause harm to them. Similarly, when we think of things such as medicine bundles (I'm not sure spirit pouch is the right word), we're really talking about things that were put together for purposes of granting the bearer power of various sorts. There are bundles aimed at granting the bearer hunting power, healing power, fertility, protection, etc. You'll see the same phenomenon in regard to dreams and visions. They are sought after because they provide power, which equals status in the tribe, power over the enemies, etc. <br />
<br />
Kal bring's up a good point in saying that these bundles are not necessarilly Native American in origin. I alluded to this, but focused on the former thought mainly because the indigenous origins is what occurred to me.  Still, it's possible you'll see these things used among Asian or Eastern European family (though I would think the latter far far less likely).  Still, you have shamanic groups in these regions that construct similar bundles. As Kal said, some Asian religions (often most prevalent among syncretic or &quot;hybrid groups&quot; like Yao or other Daoist types) rely on household protection types of things relatively extensively. I'm really not all that well versed on these groups, so I won't comment a lot further. Still,  I'm not entirely convinced that looking at their contents, unless you just happen to have a real keen eye for this type of thing, is going to reveal too terribly much to you. I suppose a feather or a wilted lotus leaf might reveal something to you. Regardless, she shouldn't be too worried about taboo. Minor bundles can generally be opened from time to time, if done with reverence, or so it's my understanding. <br />
<br />
Anyway, enough of this nonsense... I'm truly shocked that someone would e-mail these type of questions to you.</div></div><hr />
