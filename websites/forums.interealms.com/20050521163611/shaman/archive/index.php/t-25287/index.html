<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard a rumor that they reset specialization back to 50 with the last patch.  Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I didn't notice anything today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just looked at mine a few minutes ago... nothing changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The patch reset specialization skills to 50 for anyone that had their secondary specialization over 100.  It is kind of a bug fix but they should have just reset the affected skill to 100 instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But for people who had two specializations at 200, there would be no way to tell which one to reset to 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WaringMcMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They could have reset both of the 200 skills to 100 so there would be less casting involved to set them back up agian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">all specializations were actually reset to 49, not 50....at any rate i am supreamly pissed off at all mine being reset....  it wasn't my fault that secondary forte was bugged and that my conjuratoin made it to 114 (or whatever it was.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had the skills been set to 100 (as opposed to 49), then you would have had people skilling up the wrong spell casting skill before the noticed anything.  <br />
<br />
Skills at 49 is very very noticable, you should be seeing the skill increases in your text windows.  <br />
<br />
The people who have had skills above the allowed cap's have enjoyed the benefit of them for quite some time.</div></div><hr />
