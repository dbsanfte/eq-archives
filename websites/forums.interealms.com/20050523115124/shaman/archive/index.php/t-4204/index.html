<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a level 48 shaman, jbb equipped, solo the ent of the hole? OR should i get a partner/group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think at 49 you should be able to solo the mobs at the entrance, with a JBB. I'm not too sure about it though, since I'm not far enough to actually try it =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would say no .<br />
<br />
those elementals even when slow hit VERY hard and are high on MR . god forbid you pull more then one , your dead .  im 49 and even with my new pets and spells and a jbb ...  im not even thinking about soloing the entrance  . now once in side , hmm , thats another story. i htink you could handle single pulls MAYBE . im thinking i could . as long as the JBB doesnt get resisted alot and most important the SLOW<br />
<br />
you can always try . just keep gate up and SOW on so oyu can swim out REAL fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not really sure about this.  I never tried soloing in the hole, but you might as well give it a shot.  At worst, zone out or gate.</div></div><hr />

SoW has been proven many times to not have any effect in the water.<br />
<br />
I suggest swimming around LOIO for a while...i did this to get my swimming mastered while waiting on a monks final epic fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoW doesn't work in water?  <br />
<br />
That doesn't sound right at all.  You just still can't move backwards unless you have levitate on.  <br />
<br />
The zone is right there, should be ok to try it at least.  Pulling will be the hard part I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You will need very good rooting or snare. But you should be able to solo entrance ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Good Rooting&quot;<br />
<br />
oxyrmoron<br />
<br />
<br />
I would recomend you get your swim skill up as high as possible though.</div></div><hr />

test it for yourself, i did.<br />
<br />
I went no faster w/ sow on or off in water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sow does not work in water<br />
a 49 anyone won't be able to solo the hole entrance, it's a little thing called level based aggro.<br />
You will pull 4 everytime at 49.<br />
at 51 I could pull singles or double till the back ones and had to use a special move to get singles for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Easily tested (I did), I swam the length of WK with and without sow, there was no meaningful difference. Without sow was about 14 seconds faster, if I recall...but that can be written off to lag/specific route taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And you might have increased skill if you did it before without sow.<br />
<br />
Ok, thanks, haven't been able to play EQ (Dunno why, can't play any online games, but can still get on the internet, and i can't fix it /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They will eat you at 49.<br />
<br />
49 and you'll get the front 3-4 every time. Good luck. :D<br />
<br />
50 and you can get anything from 1 to 4 depending on the levels of the mobs that spawn. If you were a Vah Shir you'd be able to pull 1 nine times form ten coupled with a bit of secret ninja fall-in -the-water magic. Heh... and you all say sneak is useless.<br />
<br />
51 and you'll get one most of the time and the odd 2 pull. You could almost guarantee ones with sneak (unless you get lazy and screw up your pathing :o )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even if you manage to pull one -- once it gets low on health it will run back in while resisting 2 or 3 roots, and bring a train of 6 more elementals.<br />
<br />
I am sure that SoW made my young Barbarian Shaman swim faster in the entrance pool of Halas back in 1999. Couldn't tell you today since my Iksar swim skill has long been maxed at 200.</div></div><hr />
