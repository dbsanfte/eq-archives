<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">of mine and thought you might enjoy this piece on the Titanic.<br />
This was written after researching the calamity but before the &quot;TITANIC&quot; was popular.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN TWO TITANS MEET <br />
<br />
<br />
Stacks Belch, purging, <br />
screaming smoke<br />
and howling steam behind.<br />
A behemoth of steel <br />
defies a young child's eyes.<br />
Tugs push her out to sea,<br />
guiding left to right, <br />
finally letting go.<br />
<br />
Solid flood of awkward construction,<br />
crystallized perfection approaches <br />
costumed in passive power,<br />
hiding destruction.<br />
Gliding within arms reach, <br />
brushes the side, <br />
people laugh and cry in merriment, <br />
picking up chunks of ice, <br />
light fluffy shards <br />
and toss it back and forth <br />
in child like play.<br />
<br />
Lifeboats full only for precaution, <br />
left adrift in the freeze, <br />
with teddy bears and fathers <br />
left to face chance, <br />
waving goodbye from the deck.<br />
<br />
A mighty crack, <br />
like blackened lightning spent <br />
by the hand of god. <br />
<br />
Inside fine ballrooms, <br />
turn upside down and back, <br />
spinning.  <br />
Walls explode <br />
with the force of water, <br />
halls flood full and fast.<br />
<br />
The coffin augers away, <br />
to rest and be disguised<br />
in explosive silts, <br />
trimmed in swarming life. <br />
<br />
Ramshackled in the deep <br />
with the same contagious dark <br />
as midnight after <br />
candles are blown out.<br />
From her decks, <br />
songs and holy oaths <br />
no longer sworn by sailors, 	echo.<br />
Murmurs still humm.</div></div><hr />
