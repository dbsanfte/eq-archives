<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 2 items with +med modifiers.<br />
<br />
Owlbear Feather Circlet @ +3% med<br />
Brain of Beaked Bear @ +4% med<br />
<br />
Do these 2 items stack that modifier?<br />

Also i'm going to try and get a pair of GEB's and i was thinking that since they have +9 WIS i could exchange another slot that has lower wis to HP and AC. I am also in the process of getting an Elder Wolf Hide. Here's an updated profile with the GEBs and Elder Wolf Hide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure - but modifiers usually do NOT stack, don't know why these would be different.<br />
<br />
I would advise against the GEB's, personally.  Your WIS is already quite high for your level, and you could use more ac in several slots.  At level 30, one point of WIS gives you 5 points of mana.  and you need to be tanking to kill mobs and get your defense skill up (oops, I meant IN TEH FACE)<br />
<br />
ac vs. wis vs. hp is an old, old topic on this board.  do a search for some of the old threads if you want some long reading.<br />
<br />
key question I am partial to - do you run out of mana very often?  or do you often start your fights with full mana?  WIS' main purpose is to increase the top limit on your mana pool (it does help with increases in trade skills, and maybe with fizzle rates).  It doesn't matter how high your mana cap is, if you are not running out and do not med to completely full before starting thte next fight.<br />
<br />
At level 30 you have begun to cannibalize for mana.  As your regen spells upgrade and your hp pool grows you may come to see why many shaman are more focused on generating mana thru regen/canni than on the upper limit of the mana pool.  That leads to ac and hp gear.  ac to avoid losing hp to the mob's hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for your input :D .  I do tend to run out of mana but i think that's partially due to lack of mana efficient tactics if anything unless i have c3 and when i don't i can really tell the difference.<br />
<br />
I will have some money coming to me thru some items i have for sale (at the mo it stands at 1k but i should have another 2k soon) so i am in teh market to get some new items.<br />
<br />
I have been maxing my defensive/offensive skills as per the advice of posts of this board and i think it's at it's max for my lvl (both around 140-150).<br />
<br />
Whats slots do you think could use more ac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. Ditch the Jasper Gold Earring for something with AC.  Even another Forest Loop would be ok.<br />
<br />
2. Get rid of the neck item and get blackened alloy coif from Runnyeye.  Campable at your level or can be had cheap in bazaar.<br />
<br />
3. Ditch the face item and get Arctic Wyvern Mask.  Sells for 50p on my server due to tailors using them for skillups.<br />
<br />
4. If you come into the 1-2k, use it to buy Jaundiced Bone armor.  You can get JB for 350 per piece in the bazaar if you keep looking and it's got great AC.  You will sacrifice some WIS.  JB helm, arms, and feet should all be attainable at that price.  BP, legs, and of course bracer go for a bit more 8^)<br />
<br />
5. Tattered Mantle should be a relatively cheap shoulder item that will up your AC quite a bit.</div></div><hr />
