We were both KOS. She was kiting these mobs. I stole agro from all the undamaged ones chasing her. All that from a simple stat enhancement. ?!!!?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the aggro the bard had was proximity aggro.  Buffing charisma generates more aggro than that, and I am guessing she trained them near you.  Thus, your buff aggro + proximity aggro &gt; bard proximity aggro, and you died.<br />
<br />
Imagine this:  Malos generates as little aggro as any spell possibly can.  A warrior pulls a mob with an arrow, which misses.  If you land malos on the mob before it gets in camp, and the warrior is standing in front of you, it will ignore you and just attack the warrior.  If the warrior is standing behind you, though, and the mob crosses over you on its way to the warrior, your proximity aggro will put you higher on the hate list than the warrior (since he is oor and thus lost his proximity aggro), and the mob will attack you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;----- Blinded by xp loss rage. Well, I learned my lesson. I figured they were all damaged by the time I buffed.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
She even dragged my corpse out of those caves. She didn't ask, nor were we duoing. I just figured I'd throw some charisma her way to help. No good deed goes unpunished! :p</div></div><hr />
