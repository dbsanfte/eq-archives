<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, granted; it is the stupid player.  and i know we have all run into those.  you know the type.  the melee player that as soon as you go OOM healing and buffing him wants to do the first pull 1 sec later.  maybe even before you get a pet up.<br />
<br />
but what class is the one that when they walk up and want to group; you would rather just stay solo?<br />
<br />
for me it is a monk.  and a run3 monk is even worse.<br />
<br />
ok, so they deal some damage.  big deal.  all classes deal some damage and the monk brings nothing else to the table.<br />
<br />
they do not heal, root, crowd control, buff, DS, nothing that a casting class can do.<br />
<br />
big deal you say, rogues and tanks can't cast either.<br />
<br />
my answer is that rogues and tanks are at least trainable.  sure it is carrot and stick, but they can be taught.  they know with out you their down time is hideous if they can only bandage to 50%, monks always have that mend skill hanging over your heads.<br />
<br />
a tank/rogue knows if you are going to die, they are most likely dead.<br />
<br />
a tank/rogue is also greedy.  because monks get encumbered from money, lots of them just don't care as much as i would like.<br />
<br />
perhaps in a two-box situation monks are ok if they are really controlled by a shaman, but being in a two person group with them just makes me want to step on their neck.</div></div><hr />

I duo with a cleric quite often. Tactics no different than soloing just i have someone to heal me when i canni down. I just nuke a little heavier than normal cause i have extra mana....Now that being said, they do make the worst partner but it can be worthwhile.<br />

I think I see your probllem with partners right there. You seem to like to tell your partners what, when, where to do. I have partnered with evey class and never had a problem. That is exscluding the few idiots. Every class is diffrent and the way you fight with them is diffrent. You have to adapt to them has well has they to you. If you find yourself more offten then not with probllem partners that you must take it upon yourself to tell what to do. Then odds are the probllem is you not them. From the way you talk above it seems to me that you do not know how to partner with monks not the other way around.</div></div><hr />

The cleric hamemr is not meant to hit ****. The proc is and with infussion of spirit +dex buff clerics can do quite a lot of damage when that hammer begins to proc 5+ times per fight<br />
<br />
<br />
Still not saying that makes them a good partner but cleric hammer owns.<br />

Best is Ranger (with the AA) / Shaman... hands down un-beatable!</div></div><hr />

The shaman's strength is his flexibility.  Pardon my bluntness, but if you can't figure out how to group with a class that's as straightforward as you make a monk out to be, perhaps you should re-examine your playstyle.  Duoing does not equal soloing with a second pet.<br />
<br />
I haven't got a clue how monk/shaman does at 65, but up through 53, monk/shaman is pretty insane.  Yes, I control both most of the time.  On the occasions when I get a good friend to jump in and drive Aemon, we're capable of a hell of a lot.  Both of us know how to play our respective classes (he's probably one of the best shamans there ever was) and we know how to group with each other.  Part of that comes from us both knowing how shamans work, the rest from being adaptable.  I'm not apprehensive at all about tackling encounters as a duo through level 60.  PoP adds a new element though.<br />
<br />
Shaman + Pet Int class is probably pretty damn good.  after that i can't say.  i play shaman and monk exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play cleric, shammy and rogue, not in that order. :)  All are 65.  Recently I was playing all three in PoV killing Larvae.  Couldn't get a group so I decided to try to see how well my rogue could tank a slowed PoP mob. <br />
<br />
Well.... it wasn't pretty, but it was doable.  I think it'd be impossible without the cleric though.  BTW: My rogue has LR5 but doesn't have any other tanking related skills.  I think almost any other melee class tanks better than rogues.  I've had rangers, monks, BST tank for me in PoV and they all did just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree with Aemon, I've played a lot with a monk up to lvl 53 and had no problems, its individual players that make monks seem like arseholes. The monk I duo with will take a death if that means I'll have time to get away (has only happened once due to feign failing). Something I'm noticing not that many 50ish warriors are prepared to do (die period. let alone for someone else to live)<br />
But enough of that, to answer the question in the topic. I don't even know what would be the worst class, I know some of the worst people. I think any combo will work well (not wonderful mind you) if both people know what they're doing and adapt how they play to compliment each others class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">clerics are worthless to duo with as a shaman.  especially one that thinks he's a paladin with his uber hammer of can't hit ****<br />
<br />
I've duoed with a cleric quite often before, while its not the most efficient, the combo does surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
Heck, just me and a fellow cleric had Wuoshi to 5% before we died.<br />
<br />
As for the worst class, I'd say wizard myself.  They can quad in Fire much better and always whine about not getting the same amount of exp  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aemon, let me tell you how this works.  <br />
<br />
52 monk is in guild.  he has been putting all exp in AA so his pally gf can lvl up and her do an old world dragon.  she is now 52 from grouping with me on the lvls up. cleric is lvl 50, known him since 30.  no two boxing, everyone playing their own.<br />
<br />
monk might not be the best as he cannot get a group without us.  but Prexus is busy.  PoI is all camped for what we can handle.  PoJ rat exits are camped as is by the grave yard.  we decide on PoD.<br />
<br />
we all have KEI, and ageo.  everyone gets HoS, group SoW, cleric is doing the AC buffs.  decide to hunt the flys and rats just past the pond, but monk does not know the zone.  i say to follow and me,  and the cleric and i take off.  get to the spot and turn around, monk and pally are not there.  they never said a word.<br />
<br />
as neither of them have track or are good with loc, cleric and i turn around to go back.  cleric runs beside me and we get an aggro.  <br />
<br />
cleric has lvled 4 straight lvls with me and not one death.  basically he thinks i have it covered, but slow gets interupted and a few adds.  it is all over but the crying.  i honestly think the cleric was surprised we died.<br />
<br />
monk drags clerics corpse, i come back invis and drag mine.  we get the decent rez and then gate back for ageo and kei.  <br />
<br />
rebuff everyone with the HoS and regen,  spirit sight everyone, and invis everyone.  this time, as i am just a tad miffed, i say we will follow the monk to where ever he wants to hunt.<br />
<br />
we are invis, he follows the wall out.<br />
<br />
have not cast a pet or haste.  it is like a car wreck unfolding.  first rat he sees he turns to.  i am on auto follow, and like the death scene in a bad movie just can't turn my head.<br />
<br />
i think he says &quot;hail a diseased rat&quot; and wacks it.  pally says add, cleric says add, i get one cast of slow off. pally runs with on on her,  cleric waits till 50 to gate, and i get it off with a bub of health.<br />
<br />
after that i decided to camp out and play an alt for a bit.<br />
//////////////<br />
same monk two days before in a group with a druid for evac, 3 monks, same pally and me.  52 monk asks to pull over a 55 monk , because &quot;i chose a monk so i could pull.&quot;<br />
<br />
we are down the drop at the house.  i really don't think he has been paying a lot of attention.  first pull we almost wipe from the largest pull we had all night.<br />
///////////<br />
night before that in Jpine gnolls.  same monk, same aforementioned cleric and me.<br />
<br />
while i had duo'd there with the cleric and done single pulls with the random add for hours, the monk is enjoying the fact that he is pulling two at a time.<br />
////////////<br />
so why am a ranting here?  mostly because i wondered what everyone thought was the worst class to group with.  some, because i am just hacked.<br />
<br />
the out loud thoughts about monks not being trainable was probably born from the fact that he is my guild leader and isn't known for listening to anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I duo with monks in Tactics pit, I don't see where your problems with monks come from. A decent monk with some smarts works fine for a duo partner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kermeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think your monk experience resembles many bad pickup group situations I've had.  It's just that every once in a while I roam outside my comfort zone and try grouping with new people.  It's always a gamble.  Sometimes we get lucky and find good people to call friends, and other times, we find people to never group with again.<br />
<br />
Specifically related to monks:  I've grouped with monks in my guild and others, as well as a 2-box monk.  Grouping with a monk that knows what he's doing makes for a great duo.  The only thing that I find missing is some form of snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">YEEEEOUCH!!! yeah, that's pretty miserable.  the whole time I was reading that i was thinking &quot;why in the hell was he still grouped with them all?&quot; but the guildleader bit clued me in  ;)  unfortunately, that's a problem with the poor guy at the keyboard, not from monks as a class.  there are many monks who are better than me, but i'm getting better... I grew up as a shaman, and picked up the monk because i like the mentality: always at the front line, lots of risk of dying (if  you are afraid of dying, DO NOT PLAY A MONK), heavy damage and some nice abilities.  <br />
<br />
I didn't know you were on Prexus too.  If you'd like to group sometime, send me a tell.  I've been hanging in Dulak's Harbor lately and would love to give you a better idea of what monks can handle.  It'll take a few to get ourselves synced, but then we should be set.  i was clearing dandolak pretty easily with my shaman last night and getting decent xp.  atm i'm working AA and trying to get some cash for new toys.<br />
<br />
what's your toons name?  i'll keep an eye out for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have and will group with any class, any time.  IMO its not the class that is at fault its the person behind it.  I have done amazingly well with unusual class combinations, and i actually prefer duoing with said classes rather than grouping sometimes.  One of the strenghts of a shaman is that we are so diverse.  If one area is lacking we pick up the slack, often with surprising results.  That is not to say that every duo combination is tight and manna efficent, but then again most of the times that i duo im not looking for xp anyways just a different experience, and maybe make a new friend<br />
<br />
As far as the flack about monks, well they are the class i have duoed with the most, and although they have lost a bit of their power post PoP i would still duo with them given the chance.  They have good damage output and with a few buffs can even take a few hits as well.  And in zones other than PoP  a shaman/monk duo can do amazing things, especially if the monk knows his/her class.<br />

Second worst would be wizard, but still better than cleric because you can kite duo stuff, using DoTs and nukes to kill each mob rather than melee.  But still, a really good wizard could probably kite 4 at once, making their net exp greater than the shaman+wizard combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duoing with some classes, you just really have to pick your spot.  Did some undead in PoV with a pally friend - that was a real eye-opener.  Bards can be gimpy on the DPS end of things in some between-charm levels, but if they have those songs, and you pick spots where they can nab up something -- stand back.<br />
<br />
A lot of EQ is &quot;set up shop and smack things&quot; - but it's amazing what you can do when you pick your spots based on the strengths and weakness of the people/classes you're with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is a bit of a hijack question (sorry).  Concerning pulling, how do you guys do it?  What I mean is this... some guild friends and myself were doing the OC in Dulak, I was single pulling with slow, lead back to group, we kill mob in about 1 min, I go pull next et. etc.  My guildmate wanted me to go get next pull as soon as I get the first to the group.  I said no, that I would wait till we get it to half life, then i'll go get the next (safer, more controlled).  Guildmate very politely asked me to let him pull, so I could see how it was done &quot;properly&quot; (please bear in mind that I had been pulling for about a half an hour with no mishaps).  Well after he pulled 3 on accident (heheh) and we got a rez for the druid and mage (sniff, sniff), I asked him why he didn't like my pulling style.  He said that he didn't think it was fast enough, and wanted the exp to come quicker.  (ahhwell)  The guildmate is a friend of mine, and a good guy, and usually a good player too.  If you older and wiser shammies have any advice on pulling safely and quickly please share it, Thanks. (my friend is a lvl 53 BST)<br />
BTW, our group was all low 50's, high 40's. I was slow/ debuff and druid was heal/ DD (I would spot heal also).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shandrillar, i think that is a great valid question and not a hijack.<br />
<br />
personally, i think you did it right.  not sure what class your guildmate was, but you should have politely said no.  and keep saying it in the future.<br />
<br />
who would not single pull when you have the chance?  <br />
<br />
part of it is zone/faction anyway.  <br />
<br />
when i was lvling up our cleric at plaguebone thieves, i tried to tell him to either sit down farther away or stand when i was pulling.  undead just love to leave me and take a swipe at a sitting lower lvl cleric as they are incoming.<br />
<br />
same with monk pulling gnolls in JPine.  my faction is shot there far worse than his.  first i was hitting assist and mashing the slow key, i got the agro as the gnoll came in slowed. (not a ton of damage as buffed ac is just over 900) but it was just as bad if he pulled it all the way back to group, it still ran past him to me because of faction.<br />
<br />
when he pulls you have a gnoll at 99% that is going to attack me regardless.<br />
<br />
when i pull with slow you have a mob that is slowed and the sec i am back to group i usually get off Ebolt before the gnoll makes it to group as i had the head start spell range gave me from the slow.  now you have a slowed gnoll that has a 1k dam dot on it.<br />
<br />
of course his mantra is it is the monks job to pull.<br />
<br />
it is a monks job to pull if you can't single pull.  i think if you can single pull with slow, it is preferable to almost every other action.</div></div><hr />

I loved this part on how well shaman duo with beastlords:<br />
<br />
Duo Rating: Optimal <br />
Two Box Rating: Optimal<br />
<br />
For Jeebus sakes, this class is a hybrid based on our class, and they still consider us optimal Duoers.  What more can I say, except &quot;of course, Shaman rock :)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">who would not single pull when you have the chance?<br />
<br />
I will always single pull when duoing.  I can handle serious overpulls, but it generally slows things down in the end.  <br />
<br />
-HOWEVER-<br />
<br />
As a monk, if I am in a full group with an enchanter (and especially if there's a shaman too), they will need every last bit of mana they can muster because I will always, always, always bring multiples, usually 3-4.  Say what you will, but the xp is faster and it's much more fun for everyone and is RARELY unsafe if your enchanter is worth his/her salt.<br />
<br />
when i pull with slow you have a mob that is slowed <br />
<br />
-snip- <br />
<br />
it is a monks job to pull if you can't single pull.<br />
<br />
amen.  let shaman pull with slow if he can single pull.<br />
<br />
i usually get off Ebolt before the gnoll makes it to group as i had the head start spell range gave me from the slow.  now you have a slowed gnoll that has a 1k dam dot on it.<br />
<br />
i usually like to wait a bit before I drop in a dot for a couple reasons:<br />
1) depending on how far away from the group you dot it, you will lose dot damage while it runs you down.<br />
2) fights typically only last long enough for 1 dot to run its course.  Why not dump it in once the mob hits 75% or so.  No aggro problems for you and you still get your 1k damage.</div></div><hr />

Not all monks are like you make them out to be.<br />
<br />
And like many others, I miss the days where a monk/shaman duo could tear anything apart in no time flat, providing the mob was slowable.<br />
<br />
Good old days...  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Froglegs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ronaan makes a very valid point.  Your problem is the player not the class.  As many have posted here monks still are great duo's with shamen though of course not what they once were.<br />
<br />
Try to get in some higher level groups away from guild and if you're lucky you'll see a good monk and understand.  They can be quite a good class to have around.  My monk gets compliments at the end of many groups and sometimes tells when he logs on to join a group...it really helps because if I don't happen to get one of those tells I get to sit LFG for 2 hours being bored because no one loves pure melee anymore...<br />
<br />
It is admittedly a different mindset.  With FD a click away (no fizzle, no cast time, no interrupts) you learn to be a hell of a lot more brave than most.  Death also doesn't scare you nearly as much since you die less than most.  When you haven't died for a month taking one for the group doesn't bother you nearly so much.  I've done truely stupid daring things in the name of pulling, exploration, and just bloody-minded-&quot;I bet I can&quot;-ness.  You just gotta make sure your group's monk doesnt have the same laissez-faire attitude with group memebers that can't FD...You also have to make sure they aren't Ebay or an idiot that only knows how to click throw, FD and auto attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I played a monk for a long time.  I don't consider myself the greatest monk, but I'm compentent enough to pull singles when required, to ask mana status, to hold off on pulls when people are lom, or at least ask if we can handle xxx before pulling it.  The key here is that I'm aware of the group condition and I will adjust what I'm doing to be the appropriate action.  I will bind wounds on the shaman as s/he canni to allow them to get mana back that much faster, I adjust pull style to fit the group, and yes, I will go down to the last possible instant, and sometimes past it, to give others a chance to get out.<br />
<br />
Now, would you rather group with a monk with me behind the keyboard, or a warrior I know who didn't know Taunt was a skill until level 50? (I believe they had been just typing /taunt the entire time.)<br />
<br />
People generally play monks when they are tired of sitting on their butts.  They want to be up and moving.  If you want behavioral changes from them, (i.e. do not run off and pull when you're out of mana), make a polite request, framed as a question, explain why.  A bit of courtesy can go a long way.<br />

Worst class?  hmm...  Personally, I think wizard would take the most coordination for maximum effect.  I just like my DoTs to go all the way through, and if they gain agro from me or my pet, they go down faster than a cleric.  Besides, if nothing else, a cleric can heal me as I canibalise, effectively giving me the mana to DoT the crap out of stuff.</div></div><hr />

Granted...you could kill damn near any mob you wanted to, but the downtime for xping would be terrible....only one can do damage basically, and our pets don't do a ton.  Our nukes are decent, but nothing special...our mana supply is infinate, but that doesn't help when you can only put one bane of nife on a mob.<br />

Maybe I should level a monk to 35 and get him his seb key and then rail about how his group gets rapped in seb. /boggle<br />
<br />
Of course, please check your ill informed opinions of monks at the door please.  A monk hunting in a level appropriate zone can be everybit as valuable group member as any other melee class for douing with shammy. <br />
<br />
And to think tier 2+ is gonna be opened up to this kinda crap. I sure hope they put some hefty level limits in these zones they are opening up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think I see your probllem with partners right there. You seem to like to tell your partners what, when, where to do. I have partnered with evey class and never had a problem. That is exscluding the few idiots. Every class is diffrent and the way you fight with them is diffrent. You have to adapt to them has well has they to you. If you find yourself more offten then not with probllem partners that you must take it upon yourself to tell what to do. Then odds are the probllem is you not them. From the way you talk above it seems to me that you do not know how to partner with monks not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Whenever we are bored (hasn't happened for a month) a level 60 monk and I would duo sk spiders in pod, I'd never go lom he'd constantly pull, when kei would fade I would canni down he would bandage me back up to full health... <br />
<br />
Recently I've duoed with a different, I pull, root, monk then beats on it and I jbb until root breaks.. the mob at this point is snared because of the monks snare proc off of tunare.. GOLDEN. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER from 46 to 51 I duoed with monks, rangers, paladins in DL and I HATED monks... they just took too much damage and some of them would practice intimidate.. &quot;why is that thing running away from us? uhhh..&quot; RETARDS.. if you are in that range then monks just might not be developed or skilled enough.. <br />
<br />
I love duoing with all, I LOVE duoing with wizzys.. but overall they have the least to offer us, specially if they keep saying &quot;I got a 800hps rune let me tank&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I duo with monks in Tactics pit, I don't see where your problems with monks come from. A decent monk with some smarts works fine for a duo partner.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what my other post was referring to.. once all tier2/3 zones are open to public,.. you can't rely on the monk being good, you HAVE to stick with guildies and high end guild monks and close friends ONLY.. &quot;random monk anon&quot; will not work unless you like frustration or a lot of training and praying..</div></div><hr />

All of our dots even same named ones stack. Even w/o that at low levels one can tank while the other heals.. one can malosi while the other slows, 2 pets both smacking the mob I duoed a lot from 40-45 in Rathe Mountains with another shaman and he was great.. at the other end of the spectrum 2 shaman = insane when root breaks if he's after you the other guy will root, 1 guy malos, the other malosinia (if needed) both of you drop slow and 1 WILL stick ;) then you dot and mob will die twice as fast but like 4 times the safety.. (and for you anal people, I have no statistical evidence for the amount of safety 2 shaman have compared to one) =]</div></div><hr />

I hope they double the spawn time to gy for ALL zones so they can stay out of my way for a little while longer &lt;grins&gt;<br />

Hehe, ya, 2 shamans can take pretty much anything they want short of a 18+ raid :)<br />
<br />
God.....wouldn't that be scary, seeing 2 shamans kill Velk....Or like a group of em<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">My favorite partner of late is the shadowknight.  They can tank, fd split, do decent damage, hold agro, snare, heal themselves somewhat, etc.  Plus they don't seem to be as cocky as monks.  And if he does get out of line start healing with stoicism, they hate that.  I still like monks though cause they seem to appreciate my buffs more than any other class  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Talanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Monks are still one of the best classes to duo with. I guess you have bad luck with monks since alot of them are clueless twinks. Dont get me wrong, I have NOTHING agaist twinking. Due to political correctness I like to call them A Benificary of Previous Experiance herein named after  as a BPE. As a matter of fact my shaman is himself a BPE. Clueless/Ebayed BPE's are another story , but thats another post all together. I duo with a 61 monk all the time at 53 and we have no problem in PoN/PoD. We have even taken scourge hobgoblins (dear god just dont try to cripple them) Now the monk is pretty decently equpied NToV gear mostly and has 64 AA's. But like I said at 53 we have 0 problems even w/o KEI or aego/virtue. So go find a monk who has half a brain and duo till your hearts content!</div></div><hr />
