This is the first poll to this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21999). As I am limited to 10 options I will post this as three polls, please vote on all of them. I will edit this post and add the links to the other polls.<br />
<br />
Shaman need help in the following areas:<br />
* an upgrade to Daluda's. It is simply too small.<br />
* some sort of emergency heal to recover from a resisted slow.<br />
* some sort of group or AE heal for raid usage.<br />
<br />
That said these seem to be the options we could ask for. When voting on them please keep in mind that simply asking for the biggest numbers in each category does not solve anything. Ask for what you think shaman need to be competitive and no more.<br />
<br />
Daluda's<br />
a) improve amount healed to 1800, improve OoW heal to 2100<br />
b) improve amount healed to 2000, improve OoW heal to 2500<br />
<br />
emergency heal[/B]<br />
a) targetable stonestance<br />
c) single-target divine arbitration<br />
e) spirit shifting - drains HPs from shaman and gives them to the target<br />
<br />
[U]AE/group heal<br />
a) group HoT, Torpor style<br />
b) group HoT, Quiescence style<br />
c) direct group heal<br />
d) AE heal, heals 4 injured players in AE range to target<br />
Obviously the HoTs would be MGBable which SOE does not seem to like. The AE may be hard to keep your group alive with but being able to cast direct heals on a cleric group or tank duo may have it's own advantages on a raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Voted 1800 now, 2100 OoW, but honestly, this may be too high for my tastes. However, without a true CH type heal perhaps we won't be relied on as &quot;primary&quot; healers too much. Its simply a role do not care to fill. I like support healing best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. 1800 for GoD, 2100 for Omens(if Druid heals will increase by more than another 10% this needs to be revised, though)<br />
<br />
2. Spirit Shifting(20%/30%/40%) or Single-Target Divine Arb.(Shaman's Divine Arb would have to either have a lower re-use or be scaling like 0/+10%/+20%)<br />
<br />
3. Direct group heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I choose b . At least like druid. Druid have already lot of trouble ,so having less will not solve anything for us. Now a with a really fast casting is another story...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd rather have the smaller heal but with a very fast cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will follow fafner, our heal is ... a little bit slow..<br />
<br />
I am so sorry for multi-replying agains poll...<br />
But as the result, I pushed them up ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Coolness, I got an &quot;Attempted&quot; negative rep bump for voting for the lower heal, LOL. Too bad they guy doesnt have anough reputatin to affect me. <br />
<br />
Called me a moron too. Sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I vote SoE should rework on GoD. Mobs got phat dps improvement, not heals (not only ours). Programmers dont understand +x% improvement on heal (and mob dps i assume) will increase the gap btw healing classes and like we just saw, mob dps.<br />
<br />
Anyways, they just should find some clever programmer who dont put difficulty in dps only, but that was said hundred of times before. Giving more heal power will not resolve the problem, but help some.</div></div><hr />
