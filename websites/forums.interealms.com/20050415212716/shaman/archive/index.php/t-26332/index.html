<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Want to start a new toon, I think.  Since I will be getting another computer shortly, I was wondering what yall thought to be the most effective class to duo with my Shammy.  Please include personal experiences that you may have had duoing yourselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To elaborate: Pet can tank most things that you want to duo just fine. As well as that, you have a dps machine that's completely seperate from the rest of the heal/tank combat that will just keep trucking on even if things are looking down.<br />
<br />
Coth. - do NOT underestimate the power. coth split, coth train, coth if-something-goes-wrong and you need to get out to rez, coth to safer places if kos but mage isn't, coth if you get unwelcome aggro, it's bloody useful.<br />
<br />
Plus mages get pet toys, and aren't competition for a lot of loot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a great question. I'm surprised no one has thought of it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Necro no question about it. <br />
<br />
I've two boxed a lot of toons over the years everythign from ench/shaman necro/shaman necro/druid necro/cleric shaman/cleric and magi/necro and time and time again I keep coming back to shaman/necro combo. <br />
<br />
Why? Because they are pure and simply the only class that can keep up with shaman in mana regen and pure power. Magi/Shaman is not bad but the necro combo is going to be much better. The necro is going to be able to keep up with shaman mana regen... do more dps... fd split.... ghetto mez... he's going to be able to be self sufficent with healign so as a shaman you don't need to do anything for him. You basically get to play both classes exactly like you would solo with no modification what so ever. This allows you double the power since your not doing somethign with one char or the other that you normally would not. <br />
<br />
Also necro will have some nice abilities like res... summon corpse etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have a mage already, on same account...got him to lvl 11 and left him sitting in KT....went back a few weeks ago and stripped him naked.  Just didnt have much fun with the mage...good suggestion, just not quite up my alley.  Keep 'em coming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This has been asked soooo many times.<br />
<br />
Basically, ANY class can duo with a shaman.  (you'll see people advocate all combos given enough time)  It all depends on what you are looking for.  <br />
<br />
Will the shaman be the tank?  Will pets be tanks?  Do you want you're 2nd to be the tank?<br />
<br />
Will you kite?  Dot-rot?  Straight-tank?  <br />
<br />
Do you care more about easy rezzing?  Easy travel?  Easy pulling?Variation in buffs?</div></div><hr />

I dunno I think you lose effectiveness being forced to switch from program to program. I am constantly casting spells at the same time on both chars when i two box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seriously,  any class can duo with a shaman.  Totally depends on what content you want to focus on.  Also totaly depends on how well you can gear them.  For me, necro is the best choice.  Rez, FD, pet pulling, good dps, I tank mostly anyways, works well.  <br />
<br />
More seriously,  top right of this board has a search function.  Type &quot;duo &quot; in the search field, and select &quot;search titles only&quot;.  You'll get about 3 million hits.  <br />

Uber seriously,<br />

Then, there needs to be code put in place to automatically reply with this:<br />

anytime someone makes a thread with the word duo in it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My personal combo is SK/shaman.<br />
If I didnt have an innate penchant for hacking all paladins into perfect little pickle parts, they'd be a nice duo too.<br />
<br />
But I prefer the tank(melee)/healer duo'ing combos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a class thats a better tank and does more DPS then rangers, does more DPS then a Knight, you have Stuns and Snares.  Once you get to a high lvl, they have some seriously nice AAs and can do close to Rogue lvl DPS when tanking.<br />
<br />
To me, an effective combo must be able to handle most situations and have very little overlaping abilities.  A necro/shaman duo, while nice, is limited to non-summoning mobs.  A mage/shaman duo is probably the best INT class to pair a shaman with, especially once a mage gets to lvl61 and gets Ward of Xegony (air pet).</div></div><hr />

If youre planning high end level wise (65/100aas) then I would totally agree. If youre looking in the 50-65 casual crowd, its generally not worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the key is to cast on one and then flip to the other while you are casting ect. hotkey buttons and hotkey macros are great for everyday stuff (i remember there was a thread with a ton of 2 boxing tips on it. was maybe a year ago when some of us were discussing it?).  i play both my shaman and pally on the same comp. the only thing i have issues with is kiting, and being the puller/slower/healer/tank/CC (it is ****ing hard to do it all at one time no matter what though lol. if you are talking about nontrivial content at least.)  also, my comp isn't that fast so i have issues if we tend to move large distances constantly (that is my own hardware problem though as i can't put my toons on autofollow.)<br />
<br />
really it has taken a LONG time for me to perfect playing the two on the same comp. not nearly as easy as 2 comping it.  i use to have 2 comps so i would commonly 3 box and 4 box with a 70 druid and 70 wizard added in the mix.  no question about it, using 2 comps is a lot easier for playing 2 toons, but imo you can still work at max box efficency duo boxing on 1 comp.  i say max efficency because you will NEVER play 2 toons at one time to the max possable potential that you could while only playing 1 toon.</div></div><hr />

Agreed lol but now your making me want to swtich my cleric to a 3rd account and just three box him and have him on second comp depending on the content...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necros are great, i agree. All the way up to probably 60ish they outperform mages in duo. But when the mobs start summoning, the necro pet is going to go down faster, and not have nearly as much aggro.<br />
<br />
On the plus side for necros is non-summoning mobs, shaman necro duo becomes just amazing. Pet split can be done with a shaman pet and coth as contingency. But the other advantage of a necro is definitely FD rez. Mage shaman combos just tend to have to not die :p<br />
<br />
With melee: I see melee as a serious downside, because gear directly affects the difficulty of the mobs you can duo. With an int caster though, gear has MUCH less bearing.<br />
<br />
So aye, if mage is out of the question for you i'd definitely say necro, but will also plead for you to reconsider for the high end's sake! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Depends on what u want to do as a duo. Mage's and Necro's are great with Shammy. But for pure fun i love the Berserker:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">anyone can dou with a shammy and do well.<br />
<br />
i usually dou with wifes beastlord or cleric though.  i can tank when she a cleric and take tons of dmg, or let her beast work and keep the pet up.  either way its funand challenging.  i think any partner would be fun, hell i used to dou with another shaman, was actually impressive how fast mobs died and 2 VPs rocked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zerker is the one combo I havent thought about.  And Rechief had a good point about non-overlapping abilities.  But if Im going to go melee as my partner, I want someone who can really crank out the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you go with a melee as a partner, you will want someone who can really take the damage; you'll be dealing it out fine. :)</div></div><hr />
