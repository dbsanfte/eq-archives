<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just realised that after soloing through the majority of my 50's that now, at 60, my abjuration is horrendous.  I occasionally used guardian as I never really realized it's worth, and never obtained shroud of spirits untill now. But, after raiding THO/Trak and a couple other disease/poison mobs that I fizzle an average of 10-12 times trying to cast Talisman of Epuration, or Talisman of Shadoo. Its not only embarrassing but costly on my mana pool, and I was wondering if anyone had any creative or useful tips for raising it to a reasonable level. Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cast Inner Fire over and over and over when you have time to kill ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, I maxxed it with Inner Fire while camping the rotting skelly for my VP key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Inner Fire should work. Myself, I always used my AC buffs because I was a 2h blunt wielder all the way to level 50 or so (until Kunark and epics came around), so I needed the extra AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Inner fire is a small heal, so you can do a few inner fires followed by one cannibalize and just cast endlessly. It takes a long time to raise it but it'll do it. I'm in the process of catching my abjuration up myself. I just don't cast the buffs enough to keep it up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Practice everytime you are waiting for the spires, I find that I can keep both Abjuration and Divination maxed by doing it whilst waiting.<br />
<br />
Alternate between True North and Sense Animals, to raise divination, You can cast constantly by alternating them.<br />
<br />
<br />
On, a side note, does anyone know the best stat to help with spell skill raises ?<br />
Does a high WIZ make the spell skills go up faster ? (Or INT / DEX ?) Any ideas ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - Why doesn't the sig show up in the preview pane ?</div></div><hr />

The current popular theory is that Int or Wis (whichever is higher) is the right stat. It's definitely NOT dex (though channeling is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">please show me a link to any evidence that would indicate that dex helps with channelling.<br />
<br />
a test, a statement from VI, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think he is saying that dex helps channeling percentages, although there is plenty false information from Verant on that topic.  I believe he is saying that DEX is the statistic that directly affects skill raises in Channeling.  I don't recall this from all of Verant's stat/skill disclosures, but it would make a certain bit of sense.<br />
<br />
As for using Inner Fire to raise Abjuration...I thought that you had a better chance of raising a casting skill by casting more recent spells.  Maybe I had that wrong...maybe just a relic of my thinking that you are more likely to get a skill raise after a failed attempt.  <br />
<br />
After reading this post I guess I will have to dig inner fire out of the depths of my spellbook.</div></div><hr />
