<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on Tholuxe Paells<br />
<br />
About a month ago: 9k - 15k<br />
Now 20k - 50k :(<br />
<br />
Not real sure why the price has gone up so much, but I guess that's just supply and demand at its worst. :confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>pathogen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last 2 I saw on Drinal were asking 30k</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Tarew Marr they go for 15k - 25k on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Roughly 12k on Xegony last couple times I've seen it auctioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen 8 to 15k on Mith Marr.  Generally they are sold for 10k though.  Any other price is a variation from the norm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Purchased my JBB for 18kpp cash on E. Marr within the last 30 days while at level 46.  PC's still go for around 15k-16kpp here, but the auctions are mostly WTB and only rarely WTS...<br />
<br />
It took a solid week of searching (including a post here and one on my server's boards that got only one lame &quot;maybe I'll sell it&quot; response) before my spouse saw it for sale in EC while passing through.  I won the bidding contest, which started at 15kpp.<br />
<br />
The really sad thing is that I would have hocked all the rest of my JB (helm/gloves/boots/arms) just to raise cash for this one piece if the bidding had gone higher. :(  And the sellers seem to realize this. :mad: I felt really taken advantage of by the seller, who kept asking what else I could add.  For all I know, the person I was bidding against was non-existant.  With the bidding at 17kpp and a weapon from the supposed other person, I said I'd give 18kpp if it would end the barter shenanigans right then and there.  Thank goodness he agreed, as it left me w/ about 112pp in the bank after the deal. :b<br />
<br />
Good luck in your search!<br />
Frekkels, now 50 and climbing because of my JBB</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On my server they would usually run for 15-35k<br />

<br />
Bagged mine for 13k on Sol Ro, no arguing or hackeling just a SOLD to YOU! (should have offered 10 ;)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bruinfantasy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Anywhere from 12 to 30k on Karana.  Everything seems to be going down in price but for some reason these have shot up.  Used to be at 10-12k constant for a long time.<br />

I paid 15k for mine and everyone says I got a great deal for the time (just bought it 3 days ago).  Lots of peeps WTB but no sellers.<br />
<br />
Seems strange.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">They usually go for about 15k on Morell thule...just have to find someone willing to sell it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Bought mine for 15K yesterday on AB.  Probably at the high end of the price range but I don't think I was ripped off.<br />
<br />
When the times comes to sell (if ever) I reckon there will still be room for a small profit if I'm patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Briarbear Spiritmonger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Does anyone know what the current price for one of these on fennin ro is?</div></div><hr />

I could have probably gotten it for 12-13k, except a competitor was offering 12k plus some dragon bracer worth aroudn 5k. Of course the seller saw this offer from a few days earlier so and wouldn't go down in price. &lt;sigh&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tisnotme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Got one yesterday for 14k on Xegony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Elric the Feeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">on Solusek Ro, anywhere between 20-35k.  It just depends on supply/demand.  I got mine for an Iksar mask (rogue) and 15k.  But I've seen them selling on auction over 30k</div></div><hr />

Got mine for 6K.  :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Dragher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i saw 1 being auctioned for 35k yesterday on Tarew Marr. Not worth that much imo but hey i got mine for free at lvl 51 when sebilis was the place to be hehe</div></div><hr />

4 weeks ago one was going for 13k - had 6k at that time.<br />
1 week ago one was going for 14k - had 11.5k at that time.<br />
<br />
So both times I missed it :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sellers are asking 25k on Seventh Hammer.  I didn't get mine until I hit level 60, and it's been somewhat anti-climatical, as I rarely solo at this level.  So if someone is actually offering 25k, I might just sell it.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kubax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hail all !<br />
<br />
Price for JBB seems around 15 to 20k on Tunare. Guess got quite lucky finding someone selling me it for 13k.</div></div><hr />
