<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ugsomecur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just returned to EQ (doh!) after about a year away.  I've seen all the CSI shows to the point of reruns, seen the &quot;burning moon&quot; a lot, and took the kids to their softball games, and winter's setting in and the wife and I decided to come back as casual players for a bit.<br />
<br />
I'd greatly appreciate some general updates on the important things that might have happened while I was away.  This board contains so, so many news items that are just plain greek to me, and try as I might I can't put many of them into context.<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
1.  quit shortly after POP came out (trials really pissed me off, and I never got through any of them since we were in a small guild).<br />
2.  don't have LDON or any expansions after that<br />
3.  level 61 with epic, all spells to include torpor/malo (wife is 62 warrior)<br />
4.  armor is decent, to include wolf caller BP and such<br />
5.  AAs = have about 21, but have not yet gotten canni 5 (that's next)<br />
6.  casual player = about 2 hours a session...i'm too old and impatient to sit for 6-10 hours without losing what little is left of my mind<br />
<br />
<br />
Any general purpose info you can share for someone who &quot;zoned out&quot; for a year?  For example, a friend told me last night that we don't have to finish the trials to get into valor and such (woot!).<br />
<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />

LDoN adventures should be perfect for you 2 if you can find groups.  They are timed instanced dungeons for a single party (or a raid but hardly anyone ever raided 'em). The experience will be good at your levels, and accumulating adventure points for wins there will let you upgrade your gear, as well as getting some great spells (the curse line rocks).  In addition, they drop augments that you can use to upgrade your existing armor.  The adventures have a 90 minute timer on them (but you can leave earlier when you have met the objective of the mission), and give you 1/2 an hour to get to the dungeon and get inside.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, LDoNs no longer provide significant exp after level 65.  Since most are over 65, it is harder to find groups now - everyone is in teh new zones grinding exp and looking for spell runes.<br />
<br />
Get maps - you will learn to love them.  http://www.mapfiend.net/ <br />
<br />
Have fun and good luck.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. My wife and I play also and LDoN's were perfect for  nights we didn't feel like playing for hours on end. Unfortunately, as Wilcas stated, it's tougher now to get folks to do an adventure (OoW just offers too much). With that said, I'd definitely purchase LDoN and make a real effort to get one adventure each time you play. It may take a few days/weeks but I'm willing to bet you'll meet some other casual players of like mind. It might even be possible to set up some times to play each week. <br />
<br />
If you're on Tribunal, give me a tell and I'd be happy to group or try to get some guildies to group with ya'll. <br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope you enjoy your time back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll take a stab at this one since I have taken off two 6 month stretches.  Burnout is the #1 issue for me, so I'm careful about overplaying.  #2 is to take a longer term approach to spells,aa's armour etc so I don't get pissed if I lose on a roll, etc.  #3 is to download maps, woot - nice not to get lost.  #4 is to leave ASAP any crappy group you get into, but do it with some style so you don't hurt peeps feelings.  #5 is to figure out what you like to do in EQ, don't grind if you don't like it, don't be in static camps if you don't like it, etc.<br />
<br />
Myself, I came back and really liked LDON (as above peeps have said).  Have fun with it, change up the groups (have all pet groups, have all shaman groups, be the puller, be the only healer, etc. etc.).  LDON is only boring if you are chicken and don't experiment.  LDON will fine tune your skills immensely if you are puller, only healer and only slower and no CC - try it and you will see.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend thinking about a guild - although raiding isnt my favorite thing it allows you to see parts of EQ you would not ever see and hopefully get a steady experience group partnership going - help on epic, etc.<br />
<br />
Thats about it.  Have fun.<br />
<br />

PS: I would not suggest doing duo only stuff with your wife, good groups are way more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at lvl 65 you can get into most pop zones with a flag or not, at least the pre elementals ones. <br />
ldon is nice for your time frame but alot of people burn out hard on ldon so keep that in mind.<br />
what class is your wife?<br />
get a tactics flag (get in on a manetic behemoth kill in poi) when you can, with VP you can solo in there and if you get comfortable enough in the pit you can get the occasional drop, loads of ep's and sp's and its possible to solo a rune drop in there. (rare as hell doesnt even begin to describe it) pop offers a good range for casuals to get good exp and drops.<br />
skip GoD, dont spend a dime on that expansion the hostility for casuals in it is nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats about it.  Have fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
To me, that is the essence of playing. Do what's fun. Doing fun things is what will keep it enjoyable and entertaining. :)<br />
<br />
As for tips on how to do that, please see the other answers in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would add OoW to the mix of &quot;to get&quot; expansions. Dranik's Hollows expeditions are decent xp and named have some decent drops for you - considering your gear is a few expansions behind. NC is a nice easy xp zone from 60-65 (and beyond.)<br />
<br />
If you stay in old world, Nurga (deep in) and Droga are decent xp and will offer upgrades and cash as well as some quest gear. Tons of threads here about them. Get your chardok faction up and move into Chardok B. Each of these are decent duo spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As someone from a small guild, I thought I'd add a few points from what people have said.<br />
<br />
If you want a tactics flag the easiest way is to go kill Diaka in the Plane of Storms as you can get the alternate access flag by collecting the four corners of a Diaka symbol, which when handed in will flag a group for tactics (You still get the bonus AA and PoP charm boost doing it this way).<br />
<br />
GoD isn't too useful to me, but I did find the first zone was ok Xp and has a few nice drops that randomly drop from anything there. Also some of the quest items there are quite nice and you get access to the Abysmal Sea which is a god send for tradeskill and had most buyable spells for sale.</div></div><hr />
