<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a good place to 2 box my war and shammy. Outdoor zones give much better exp as I can use the horse and never have to wait on mana. Mobs that dont cast and are easy to slow are the best. I want to try the giant fort in burning woods, but it is often camped. <br />
<br />
We both have very nice gear, fungis/horse/jbb that type of stuff so our limit is basically getting the mobs slowed. We did COM a bit in the early 40s but the exp in DL was better(faster kills) and easier(didn't get 4 mobs on a pull)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have read about sea furbies and echo. Are there enough mobs in either of those places for us to duo? We kill pretty fast so I would rather not be in a place where we are running out of mobs. I have also considered the giant fort in BW, I will probably try that out tomorrow, but I am open to suggestions.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
