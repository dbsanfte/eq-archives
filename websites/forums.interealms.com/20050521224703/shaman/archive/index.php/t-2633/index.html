<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay so the other day there was a thread about Faydedar that got me thinking.<br />
<br />
Can a 60 monk, 60 shaman and 51 druid do the entire druid epic alone?  hmmm!!  A good friend of mine(the 60 monk) would be working together with me on this.  We have solid, but non-uber gear (monk can probably get to around 4000hps/1200ac with my buffs and 51 druid buffs).  I have my spells and Canni5 AA skill.  Monk has some 35+ AA.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to be fatally overconfident at all times, so naturally I think we can do this.  I've been informed that I am nuts.  So anyways, the fights I list below are my concern.  Unslowable, mostly 32k hp mobs.  Take a look, if you are bored at work like me, tell me what you think!  :)<br />
<br />
**note:  It's very unlikely that I will actually do all this, but it's an entertaining mental exercise, humor me.  Also, I could have my other friends help me, but where is the fun in that?**<br />
<br />
Fights of note (from long ago memory of a friends epic)<br />
<br />
Black Reavers<br />
-This is a problem, gonna need a rogue to open the doors.  I suppose I could just buy the Jade Reaver.  Is it cheating if I drive a roguebot over to open the doors?   So beyond the pull, I should be able to keep up healing the dmg output of these guys right?  They can spawn up to 8 in a row right?<br />
<br />
VSR (Venril Sathir Remains)<br />
-This version doesn't have his lifetap.  Last time we killed the real VS, I think we only had 7 people or so and I was the only healer.  It seems like we could take him out.  Afaik, this version isn't slowable either.<br />
<br />
Ulump Pujik<br />
-Also Unslowable with turgurs, maybe POI works now.  He is like a level 55 warrior type that hits for double 250s I think, 32k hps.<br />
<br />
Faydedar<br />
-I am confident I could do him with 1 group of 60's.  How does he compare to WW dragons again?   I know of a 60 shaman/monk team that does many of the WW dragons with comparable gear to me and my monk friend.<br />
<br />
--so, what do you all think?  doable?  some doable, some not?  Any shaman done this for their little portbish?  Tell me what ya think.<br />
<br />

ooooh, almost 1000 posts of nonsense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
You could always try, and the fights would be uber uber hard...but it could, MAYBE, be possible...<br />
<br />
Those fights should be doable w/ one strong group anyway, if you can find abit more damage dealing and all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We did faydedar for druid epic a few nights back, I told them all I was going to solo him for a bit then they could jump in =)  Fugger refused to be slowed, no matter what I did.  They didn't listen to me anyways, but I'm glad at this point.  Pretty much spent the whole fight spamming malosini hoping it would stick, after a warrior used a tash stick and malo.<br />
<br />
We had I think 9 people total, 2 rogues, a monk, and a paladin.  I think we had to cheal once.  Pretty easily done with 1 group I'd say.<br />
<br />
The jade reaver is such a rare drop, that you might be able to kill the reavers for it with 3 of you, but it would take so long as to not be worth it.  Though dragging other people out to fight reavers for your port bot might be a little tough to manage as well =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Druid epic is pretty easy (my main is 60 druid with epic). <br />
<br />
My guild did Faydedar with <br />
<br />
60 warrior w/epic<br />
60 cleric w/epic<br />
60 rogue w/epic<br />
60 bard w/epic <br />
<br />
The bard is the key, throw a bard in adn you might be ok with that set up.  <br />
<br />
As for the epic itself, the monk/shaman/druid combo should be fine for the rest of the epic.  Our guild I believe has 7 druids TWINKS with their epic that they just use for 2 box, if that gives you any idea how easy it is.  <br />
<br />
I'd rank druid right up there with shaman/rogue/monk epics in difficultness.  <br />
<br />
Good luck 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">60 monk with NTOV loot + 60 shaman with torpor can kill reavers.  Friend of mine did it with shaman on 2nd comp.  He had to do it to get his twink shaman his epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">grab a cleric for ulump pujik. he's a nasty mofo.<br />
<br />
you'll likely want a good tank and a cleric for faydedar as well.<br />
<br />
VSR is also a slight stretch, but that depends completely on your skills.<br />
<br />
black reavers is doable. quite difficult but doable. you may wanna grab a cleric, as i've personally seen 11 pop out of 1 mob. good thing the last one dropped  a JR or we woulda been quite pissed. 60 tank 60 cleric 60 monk 60 druid 53 druid. dropped em easily, JR was for the 53 druid :D<br />
<br />
oh, also have your monk prepare to spend 10 mins blind if it comes to that.</div></div><hr />
