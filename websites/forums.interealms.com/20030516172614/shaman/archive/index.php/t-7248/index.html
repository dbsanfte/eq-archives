<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well thanks to another expansion with yet even more things (namely attaining lvl 65) to aspire to I've reached a point of...what to do?<br />
<br />
So here's what I'm thinking and I'm open to feedback :D <br />
<br />
My original goal(before PoP) was getting my class title but that has now changed and instead I'm looking at gaining lvl 65 despite the fact I have yet to see a single parchment drop for me to get spells.<br />
<br />
At level 61 I am doing 90exp/10AA<br />
<br />
What my biggest question is where to put the points?<br />
<br />
While MGB is nice I don't see that as being all that great.  I have 3 lvls in spell casting reinforcement(archetype) and now wish I'd had gone with Mental clarity for the Cann5 since I don't notice a longer time on buffs except on myself (group buffs tend to fade on others before they fade on me).<br />
<br />
I'm actually considering putting points into Natural Durability and Combat stability(think that's the one for damage avoidance).<br />
<br />
So in summary...do I go back and get Mental Clarity and then Cann5 and has anyone (ie shamans) put points into ND and Combat Stability.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Yes I did get spirit call because I really really wanted it :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&gt;&gt;do I go back and get Mental Clarity and then Cann5 <br />
<br />
Yes, without a doubt, it's a powerful ability.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;has anyone (ie shamans) put points into ND and Combat Stability.<br />
<br />
I have ND2, its a nice HP boost that isnt reliant on equipment and the importance of HP will be hammered home to you once you get Cann5. Have no experience of CS in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely get MC 3 and Cann v. Especially if you have torpor. I'd even go as far as to say go 100% aa exp till you do. The mana regen from cann v is great and really helps alot.<br />
<br />
As far as ND goes yes I have that and love it. More hps are always a good thing =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love can 5. <br />
<br />
Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I feel the same as you do, just with less AA currently :(  I only have 8 points total so far, and 4 of that is Spiritcall, so not even Baron yet.   I figured it would take me about 35 hours of solid playtime to hit canni 5 with how I was making exp in 61 with pure AA....   Somehow the time sink just doesn't seem worth it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">absolutley get canni5. Get it as soon as you hit 60 and or get torpor. Its a huge boost in power.</div></div><hr />
