<br />
Yah, I do realise that.  My comment &quot;Druids get upgrade to Bhi'li&quot; is sarcasm.<br />
<br />
However, it's a utility they had added (the +attack buff I'm specifically refering to) that we don't get.  I don't mind them getting it, but I happen to think an indoor version of Bhi'li is a natural upgrade for us that we didn't get ... and druids appear to have gotten!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why.  On average I'd prefer to have a druid over a cleric in LDoN.  DPS &amp; healing is a very good combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the druid class.  I think they make a fine addition to any group.  I even played one as a main to level 51.  But give a choice between a cleric and a druid in our LDoN group I’d snatch up the cleric as quickly as possible.  Nobody can beat a cleric when it comes to healing and that can be critical in the fast paced adventures of LDoN.  A cleric can also take more hits, thanks to wearing a tin can, than a druid can.  And if they don’t have to be medding and/or conserving their manna, clerics and put out a good amount of damage with both spells and that amazing summoned hammer they have that procs almost every other hit.</div></div><hr />

Really fellow shaman, don't worry about the darn druids - THEY are not our competiton to get into experience groups at level 65.  It's the chanters, bards and beastlords!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids ALWAYS had the greater group movement + attack than Bah Li.<br />
<br />
In fact, you might argue that Luclin Shaman Bah Li was a stolen Druid Ability.<br />
<br />
Originally:<br />
Druids had Pack Wolf Form which was Attack + movement + illusion<br />
Limit Outdoors Only<br />
Shaman had NO attack group spell.<br />
<br />
Luclin:<br />
Shaman got a Druid ability Attack + Movement, with lower attack but no annoying Illusion <br />
<br />
LDON just adds druids an indoor version.  Shaman should get an indoor bah li though with lower attack and no annoying illusion.<br />
<br />
Also stacking issues.  Bah Li stackks with Avatar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Blah Blah Blah.<br />
<br />
Tell me which melee would take that lame 56atk + sow instead of Ferine Avatar(140atk) + bah'li (10atk). Did I mention we have haste and slow? And if u were smart like me, you would be a troll that worship innoruuk with a clicky snare necklace.<br />
<br />
FA don't stack w/ whatever wolf crap druids cast.<br />
<br />
Keep whining, as I can see druids are inferior to shaman.<br />
<br />
Can a druids be main healer w/o a slower? doubt it.<br />
<br />
Can a shaman be main healer w/o a cleric/druid? Definitely, Quiescene owns all. Not to mention our massive mana regen skills.<br />
<br />
Shaman also provides 140atk to the melee via FA. <br />
As a 65shm I can keep the tank healed and FA all melee in any group. Provided I'm not elemental abled, so can't say much bout Tier 4 planes. But anything outside of Elementals it's cake. Main thing is have a pal/sk tank, get aggro on incoming and u can slow the **** before it even gets first hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As somebody pointed out, that spell has nothing to do with Bih'Li - it's a spell in the wolf form line.<br />
<br />
However:<br />
Druids ALWAYS had the greater group movement + attack than Bah Li.<br />
<br />
In fact, you might argue that Luclin Shaman Bah Li was a stolen Druid Ability.<br />
<br />
Movement speed is definitely nothing we 'stole' from druids. Shamans learn spirit of wolf before druids do (level 9 vs level 14). I think the thing that shamans get torqued off about is how many continuations of common spell lines that druids get, which shamans do not. Druids have group spirit of wolf (not Bih'Li - just plain old S.o.W.), spirit of eagle, more regens, better heals to name a few. A lot of us old timers remember the days when shamans and druids were exactly equivalent in healing, and shamans got spirit of wolf and regen earlier than druids learned them.<br />
<br />
By contrast, shamans are better at curing disease and poison than druids (and clerics, for that matter). Our Blood of Nadox spell is a group version of Disinfecting Aura, only stronger. Druids and Clerics receive a single target version of that spell doing the same quest. The difference is - shamans have always been better at curing diseases and poisons. Druids have not always been better than us at movement, healing, or regen.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion; it doesnt bother me much. I have spirit of wolf for myself. Even better, I have my black furry moccasins for instant spirit of wolf. It would be handy to have a group spirit of wolf (the real one) for those people that ask for it - but I just tell them to ask the druid. I never have the stupid spell memmed and it's like 5 pages back in my spellbook.<br />
<br />
As for healing, let the druids be better at it. I dont really want to be as good as a cleric or druid because that's not the role I want to play in a group. It's much more fun and challenging being a crowd control specialist than it is standing around healing. Regens? Well, I'll keep replenishment and quiescence and be a happy camper, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yes shaman get movement spells before Druids in level terms.<br />
<br />
However, Movement + Attack spell in Expansion Terms was Still Druid before it was Shaman.  Druids had group wolf forms before Bah Li existed.  Shaman didnt get a spell that combined movement &amp; attack till Luclin.  Hence you could argue we stole a unique line from druids..   Course any shaman worth thier salt would say &quot;we should have had such a spell in first place&quot;  Same happened with Group Regrowth incidently.<br />
<br />
As for the healing discepency. Its been that way since level cap was introduced.  Hell I'd argue that until end of Luclin Shaman &gt; Druids healing.  Shaman had chloroblast + torpor vs Druids Natures Touch<br />
which ironically is the exact same ratio as chloroblast.  At this point the 2 classes each have thier own healing forte.  Druids are better direct healers.  Shaman are still more efficient healers in terms of HP per Mana spent ((eventually when AA are factored in))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;Same happened with Group Regrowth incidently.&quot;<br />
<br />
Should have been shaman and druid initially anyways.  Shaman have always had regen before druids.  I remember the whining that occured when that took place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">However, it's a utility they had added (the +attack buff I'm specifically refering to) that we don't get.<br />
<br />
What are your talking about? That's nothing new - wolf form has always added ATK. Furthermore, druids have a lot of utilities that we dont get and never have (snare, damage shields, et al). Who cares? I'm a shaman, not a druid. I have a lot of nice utilities that they dont get, and I'm pretty happy with 'em. I couldnt care less if they got an upgrade to Bih Li, wolf form, or Protection of the Holy Carrot.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not really. They're two entirely different spell lines (if you can even call Bih Lhi a line). Wolf form is an illusion, that also adds movement, vision, and ATK. Bih Lhi is just movement and ATK - two things that shamans had separately just as long as druids had wolf form. If we 'stole' anything from druids, it was bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As has been mentioned above, with Ferine Avatar this spell is obsolete.  Rangers also get the self only version of it.  Needless to say my ranger won't be getting that plus every other (useless) LDoN spell.<br />
<br />
What annoys me though is that random druids always seem to run around PoK and ninja cast that damn eagle line of spells on my group lately.</div></div><hr />

Fair point that druids always had attack buff combined with movement, however as I noted above sarcasim was involved ... that still does not change that an indoor version of Bhi'li is a natural upgrade for us, instead of ultravision on a movement buff spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">as far as spirit of cheetah goes its a worthless spell i could delete from my spellbook without ever missing it, but i dont cause some weird desire to make a complete spell book. If sony wanted to do us a favor they could make the Spirit of CHeetah and make it a self only 30 minute or what ever regular sow is long buff. still wont be faster than bard thats for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Isn't the real problem here that in the original vision for EQ there was a wide range of classes and races with very different playing styles.  Druids were orientated for outdoors soloers and ideal for casual players.<br />
<br />
With PoP (at least in intent) all characters were expected to group so the soloing druid had to be given more things they could contribute to a group.<br />
<br />
Now with LDoN EQ requires every character class to be able to contribute to a DPS-centric dungeon group or else be left absolutely out in the cold.  Shamans don't require much (if any alteration) to contribute effectively, but druids (as originally designed) were completely out of sync.  So druids have gotten a significant amount of upgrades, whilst shamans - err we have slow.</div></div><hr />

Huh?  I suppose good heals, good nukes, good DS, mana regen buffs, the best roots in the game, and other good buffs didnt make the druids already desirable to groups.<br />
<br />
The fact that druids now get not only the Shrew spells but ALSO an upgraded version with an attack buff was icing on the big fat ass cake that is druids.<br />
<br />
I like my shaman, but I am starting to get annoyed with all the bones that druids are getting tossed at them for every slight the druids imagine they see in every expansion.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, so we are basing other classes desirability in groups off of our own now, because 70% of the content in the current game is designed with ONE of our spells in mind.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I didnt get the memo.<br />
<br />
Yes, everyone wants a shaman in thier group.  We can make or break group in most areas because of slow/debuffs.  All the meatheads want us cause we can make their stats max out. weeeee<br />
<br />
My point was that druids already had access to the shrew line of spells.  WHY did they get another upgrade?  And more to the point, why did we NOT get the same upgrade?  I could give a rat's ass about the 30% speed increase; everyone I group with already has that from rs3.  But I DO like the attk buff and could find that usefull in my groups.</div></div><hr />

If we are considering why they get upgrades and we don't perhaps its correct to compare their desirability in groups with ours.</div></div><hr />
