<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been duo-ing in ME a lot with a 61 mage. We had a good run with loot yesterday with Seer (shard/rogue mask) and 4 arm dropped a (rogue belt).<br />
<br />
However since i am the puller i find that i am triggering a lot of the traps while trying to pull the mobs we want (4arms, Xi, scouts, and named stuff). Traps trigger crap which we do not need (mind burrowers, reanimated drudge, bats).<br />
<br />
Is there any way so avoid the traps? I have see inviz on but i am not sure what i am looking for. Shard campin is a pain. Any way to make it more efficient would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In some zones (like The Grey) the traps can be seen if you look carefully. The worm traps in the grey are like little jets of steam escaping fom the ground.<br />
<br />
Although I confess I've not noticed anything similar in ME, so maybe this doesn't help you.<br />
<br />
All I can think of is, be careful, and bring your pull back along the same route you took to get to it ... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think any of the traps are visible in ME like they are in the Grey. When I camped shards here I usually pulled and I think I know where you're running into trouble. All the traps that I have found are on the plain between the Scout camp near DSP and one closest to the Coterie camps, in fact there's at least one, if not more, traps right in the latter camp. To get those scouts without setting off any of the traps try pulling from up on the ridge behind the camp as far from the plain as possible. It's a pain, but I've had more luck getting shards from that camp than any of the others. <br />
<br />
You can probably skip the DSP camp as well. With just two of you pulling the 2 camps near Akheva and the one on the plain you should have enough to keep you busy. If not, there's always the camp near Umbral that doesn't have any traps near it either. Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In ME I know where they are and stay away from them, but I am sure you cannot see them.  Lev may work??<br />
<br />
Where are scouts at by UP and where do you set up camp when hunting there??  I really like ME would like to try there.  I assume it is less trainy then DSP area.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for all the responses. Levitate unfortunately does not work. I had lev on and still spring the traps.<br />
<br />
Jormal, you are right. I am pulling to the first vamp camp. It's a good place to pull since it is out of the way of most trains but i find in order to pull the fort area (4 arms and Xi) and the dsp scout camp i run into several traps. Most of my twinks are camped out at the first vamp camp but since they all have a pair of shrouded booties i should move on.<br />
<br />
I will try pulling the scouts from the plains area. I think it will be less contested than the dsp camp since other ppl pull from there after i do the hard work of breaking the camp. /grrrr<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pinepath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The trap mobs there used to annoy me too, until I became one with the traps, and decided to take advantage of them.<br />
<br />
The trap mobs tend to be higher level on average than the other stuff in the zone, L55-56 fairly often, so they are decent exp.  Most of the named camps can be pulled without running into traps, and when those are cleared, just head out randomly for more, and if something pops on you - free mob to kill.</div></div><hr />
