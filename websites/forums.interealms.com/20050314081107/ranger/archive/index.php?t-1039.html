<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I've been hooked on this game for the pass few days and i've picked up a few &quot;tricks&quot; that I think are pretty cool and I have a few questions I've been trying to place an answer on.<br />
<br />
<br />
First the question...<br />
<br />
I have yet to see anyone selling pack mules in the Multiplayer game.  I'm assuming that they just are not allowing party members in any form to be NPCs.  If anyone knows otherwise please feel free to share how they managed this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the mega cool trick I've found out.  I can't tell if this was game designed or if it is a bug... anyhow SPOILER WARNING so highlight the incoming text at your own risk.<br />
<br />
[COLOR=black]First by mousing over your character you can view the remaining duration of buffs or any summoned pets you have up.<br />
<br />
Second when using buff spells you can increase the timer that they last for by repeatedly casting the same buff on yourself or your target.  For instance Charged Fist in Nature magic... simply cast it upon yourself multiple times to have a duration lasting in the thousands of seconds.  <br />
<br />
My favorite way to handle this is when you come accross a mana fountain to stand in it and then do all your buffs up til you start losing mana.  This means the mana fountain has been drained for a time but now you have LONG lasting buffs.  Or start gathering all those mana potions you have been leaving behind after collecting about 6 or so do a full series of buff and use up the potions for something useful.<br />
<br />
Also warning... if you advance in Skill level of the magic type that your buff is in and you recast the buff it wipes the timer clean cause you are now casting a higher version of the buff[/COLOR]<br />
<br />
Anyhow that is what I have to offer... please post your own findings... <br />
If you want to know how I managed to have hidden text that you have to highlight just surround your spoiler with the &quot;QUOTE&quot; tags then surround them with the &quot;COLOR=black&quot; tags.</div></div><hr />

Working as designed. Development decided upon this for bandwidth performance reasons from what I read.<br />
<br />
One tip I can recommend is for archers. On single-player, set them to attack the strongest. Since they attack slow and then you gotta wait for the arrow to land (assuming they don't move) you should have em attack the strongest. This doesn't seem to create aggro problems.<br />
<br />
Donkey control - when your donkey gets attacked he will not go where you want him to. ie, you cant get him to run toward your tanks so they can take the heat off him. The mule will take about 2-3 steps toward where your clicked and then turn around. So click, let him move, pause it, click again, un pause, let him move, pause it, wash rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Also, for all you multi-player guys, read this thread for info on stat/character development:<br />

<br />
My question: Is there anyway to get the camera parallel to the ground? I don't like always having to have a top-down/isometric view.</div></div><hr />

My melee and ranged are about a solid 10 points ahead of my closest casting school.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made level 13 just last night.. what an addiction this will be!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually have my melee (main) character use a very limited amount of nature magic to get the charged fist self buff.  I found that it's almost the only time the buff would get used... and since the main has level 1 in it already, might as well burn his (otherwise unused) mana.<br />
<br />
Almost up to level 20 :-) (stupid mages lagging at 11-12)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe up to level 43 and cranking.. I'm playing in the Multiplayer only so I can't pick up hired guns but so far my brother and I as a tag team have managed quite nicely...<br />
<br />
from memory I think I'm<br />
39 melee<br />
41 ranged<br />
32 nature<br />
15 combat<br />
<br />
The reason I'm going to guess we are leveling faster is with only two of there we are getting a bigger chunk of the pie than if we had say a 6 man party splitting it 6 ways.<br />
<br />
EXP and STAT gain is directly tied to how much damage your doing with a various skill/stat combo btw so if you want your mages to catch up back off your fighters and let your mages do all the fighting...<br />
<br />
My favorite method of raising mage skills is to find a solo weak hitter (mosquito thingies work well) and pick a spell and just stand toe to toe using that spell on it.<br />
<br />
Also have your mages CONSTANTLY be using a pet... Pet damage feeds skill and stat gain VERY rapidly... its kinda like meleeing with your spell casting skill.</div></div><hr />

Just made it to the 4th town. That cave to get to the fourth town takes waaay too long to go through hehe.</div></div><hr />

How cool is that.  I think (off the top of my head hes like 7 melee, 3 combat magic, 0 nature magic, and 4 arhcery or something like that.<br />
<br />
I was wondering on nature magic users, how do there skill ups work?   I have one thats pretty much just a cleric, he zaps stuff sometimes, but his skill is stilling going up. But then i thought he if buffs and heals do skills ups ill just sit here and buff and buff and get my skill up.  Didnt work, but i did find the buff trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there a website for the game?</div></div><hr />

So far as I can see you only get credit for the buff if they don't have a buff already on them. Even then, its still small. Have them use heal and if you're high enough for it, use Flash as a secondary skill. From what I've seen so far, Ice Shard at lvl 12 is the best replacement for Flash as mobs get too quickly for other spells (ie Dancing Zap) to land and be effective. And like somebody said, get that pet out there. His damage will give your guy skill increase. <br />
<br />
My question though is for combat mages. Anybody use Summon Skeleton over Summon Jade Gargoyle? The Skellie walked too damned slow and never reached action in time to do anything.</div></div><hr />

there a website for the game? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm</div></div><hr />

<br />
This applies to any ranged pet.  Right now in my 60s I'm using Summon Spike Fiend (nature magic ranged guy) ALOT!<br />
<br />
He doesn't take damage well so I've got to keep him behind a ways if possible but his spikes do solid hits worth of damage.  Its continuing to raise my nature skill nicely while I've been using Circle of Fire or some such spell for tight situations and major healing as my second spell I keep up.<br />
<br />
Also use corpse transmutation for mana back on occasion.  Its really great starting out from a city where you fight things that leave corpses to use this in conjunction with buffs to buff up.  You cover ground and steadily increase your buffs as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So has anyone figured out how they determine your character level? The closest thing I can get to it is adding all of the ability points I've gotten (str, dex, int)  and it still only comes within a few of my actual level. I think when I last checked I was level 59 or something.</div></div><hr />
