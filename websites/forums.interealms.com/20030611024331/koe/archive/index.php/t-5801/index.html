<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Because of misunderstandings that frequently develop when Easterners and<br />
Californians cross states such as Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, or Missouri,<br />
those state's Tourism Councils have adopted a new policy. In an effort to<br />
help outsiders understand the rural Midwesterner's mind, the following list<br />
will<br />
be handed to each person as they enter the State.<br />
<br />
1. That slope-shouldered farm boy did more work before breakfast than you<br />
do all week at the gym.<br />
<br />
2. It's called a gravel road. No matter how slow you drive, you're going to<br />
get dust on your Navigator. I have a four wheel drive because I need it.<br />
Now, drive yours or get it out of my way!<br />
<br />
3. We all started hunting and fishing when we were seven years old.Yeah, we<br />
saw Bambi. We got over it.<br />
<br />
4. Any references to &quot;corn fed&quot; when talking about our women will get you<br />
whipped...by our women.<br />
<br />
5. Go ahead and bring your $600 Orvis Fly Rod.   Don't cry to us if a<br />
flathead breaks it off at the handle. We have<br />
a name for those little13-inch trout you fish for...bait.<br />
<br />
6. Pull your pants up. You look like an idiot.<br />
<br />
7. If that cell phone rings while a bunch of mallards are making their<br />
final approach, we will shoot it. You might hope you don't have it up to<br />
your ear at the time.<br />
<br />
8. That's right. Whiskey is only two bucks. We can buy a fifth for what you<br />
paid in the airport for one drink.<br />
<br />
9. No, there's no &quot;Vegetarian Special&quot; on the menu.   Order steak. Order it<br />
rare. Or, you can order the Chef's Salad<br />
and pick off the two pounds of ham and turkey. Yeah, we have sweet tea. It<br />
comes in a glass with two packets of sugar and a long spoon.<br />
<br />
10. You bring Coke into my house, it better be brown, wet, and served over<br />
ice.<br />
<br />
11. So you have a sixty-thousand dollar car. We're real impressed.  We have<br />
two quarter of a million dollar combines that we use two weeks a year.<br />
<br />
12. Let's get this straight. We have one stoplight in town. We stop when<br />
it's red. We may even stop when it's yellow.<br />
<br />
13. Our women hunt, fish, and drive trucks--because they want to.  So,<br />
you're a feminist. Isn't that cute.<br />
<br />
14. Yeah, we eat catfish, carp too--and turtle. You really want sushi and<br />
caviar? It's available at the bait shop.<br />
<br />
15. They are pigs. That's what they smell like. Get over it. Don't like it?<br />
Interstate 80 goes two ways--Interstate 35 goes the other two. Pick one and<br />
use it accordingly.<br />
<br />
16. The &quot;Opener&quot; refers to the first day of deer season. It's a religious<br />
holiday. You can get breakfast at the church.<br />
<br />
17. So every person in every pickup waves. It's called being<br />
friendly.  Understand the concept?<br />
<br />
18. Yeah, we have golf courses. Don't hit in the water hazards. It spooks<br />
the fish.<br />
<br />
19. That Highway Patrol Officer that just pulled you over for driving like<br />
an idiot...his name is &quot;Sir&quot;...no matter how old he is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah that is pretty accurate. Not sure about the rest of the Midwest states, but it pretty much describes most of the people in the part of Iowa I am from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great list!  Having been brought up in many of the mid-western states and currently residing in LA, CA, I got a good laugh out of this.  My favorites were the references to the cell phones, SUVs and feminists. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My list,<br />
<br />
1. I fly over Iowa so I dont have to call the women SIR.<br />
2. I fly over Iowa so I don't get bored<br />
3. I fly over Iowa cause there aint nothin there<br />
4. I fly over Iowa cause the women drive trucks hunt and fish.<br />
<br />
HEHE<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People are very surprised when they learn that Iowa actually has cities or that not everyone grows up on farms, not to mention there are many women who don't hunt and fish :). I am sure Serlina will agree with me on this. The area I am from has well over 150,000 people in it. We even have indoor plumbing and a Krispy Kreme!;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL  Zaythar  we do have indoor plumbing a BIG plus  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And a Krispy Kreme in Cedar Rapids too! :P Iowa City is as advanced as Davenport! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How could I forget the Krispy Kremes, Iowa is almost complete we have Krispy Kremes to take with us when we hunt and fish  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And I hear thar is a Stuckey's over yonder.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ROFL, Serlina, and Cane, we don't say &quot;over yonder&quot;, that is an Arkansas thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is worse than I thought then...<br />
<br />
On a plus note, try finding a decent place to kill bambi in California, I can't find one single place to hunt in this state that is public land... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valfaroth GoldenHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I grew up in a very small town (3000 people) in Iowa ....Did not work on a farm but i knew people who did...Iowa is a wonderful place to grow up....I have so many memories of when i was a kid, that every time i go back there a warm feeling surrounds me (sure its sappy...you don't have to believe it but it happens)...I just got back from a week there...It was 10 degrees vs. Florida's 60's-70's....and still i found myself walking around town just to see the old sights....almost nothing had changed...(wonder where that damn pizza place went to though)...Iowa may not have much of a nightlife....(none that i could find anyway in that small town) ...but as far as a place to grow up in, I can't think of any place I'd rather be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Valfaroth - - Thank you for saying Iowa isnt all that bad  :)  I also grew up in a small town in Iowa, heck president Hoover was even born in the town I grew up in,  and I said over and over I am moving to a BIG CITY when I am 18 and get out of this state - - - 10 years later Im still here, and now I have kids and they are being raised in a small Iowa town  :)  <br />
<br />
The list is still funny  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was born in Davenport (which has around a 100,000), and lived in a suburb called Blue Grass (about 3000 people) for a 6 years. Then we moved an hour north in a town called Bellevue, Iowa. It had about 5000 people. Then when I was 15, we moved back to Blue Grass. I have also lived in Fairfield(hated it) and Iowa City. Iowa is nice but it hasn't been good to Renalo and I, jobwise. We have had better luck in Illinois. Don't get me wrong, at times I do miss Iowa, my friends, and sometimes my family.:rolleyes: It was a good place to grow up, and that list just cracks me up because some of those things are what makes Iowa home :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yup, I can relate....even though when I was younger I was so happy to be out of Arkansas, now, looking back on how beautiful of a state it is....now I want that feeling again that I just can't get in cruddy Los Angeles...blech... too crowded, too much crime, to noisy, too hot....the list goes on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmmm  Zayther I will need to talk to you sometime - - Living in Fairfield and HATING it  !!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When I grew up there (Waverly, 8k people north of Waterloo) - drugs were pretty rare, and shunned by the kids.  Concepts like teamwork building (sports) were view favorably, and not just a way to pay for college, although that sure as heck would help if you were lucky because not many of us could afford better that state schools (nothing wrong with those either).<br />
<br />
The Honor Society meant something, and wasn't a ploy for publicity.  Somebody you didn't know well would offer you a ride home and you weren't afraid to take it.<br />
<br />
My grandfather took me fishing 10 or more times every summer, and I cherish those memories of him.  The local stores hung banners in the windows when I went to the State Championships for swimming.  My house wasn't ever locked, not once, the whole time while I was growing up, and nobody ever stole anything.<br />
<br />
I don't have religious faith, personally, but most people there do, and it's a very nice thing to see -- people are so nice to each other it's almost unfathomable to me after 13 years in New York City.<br />
<br />
That whole &quot;is this Heaven?  No, it's Iowa&quot; thing has become a catch phrase for hick jokes nationwide -- but you know what -- if there is a heaven, it could do a lot worse than to be just like the place and time I grew up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Very cool Jlove.  I'm going to have to get myself out to the midwest again.  I never really did like Oklahoma city where I lived for several years, but loved the state.  grew up on the lakes.  While I lived in Kansas city and St. louis, I would actually make the long drive about twice a month to OK because I loved Grand lake.  <br />
<br />
I had a lot of choices when it came to schools but ended up staying in Missouri because of the people there and an experience I had.  at 17 years old, making the cross country trip to Oklahoma I broke down in the middle of no where.  The tow truck operator that eventually picked me up took me to a mud duggers (sp?) competition, bought me food and introduced me to his family.  it really made an impression on me.  <br />
<br />
I like where i live now but I do miss the midwest an awful lot and its getting worse reading all ya'lls posts.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh and Cane, my two biggest peve's with LA are the traffic and the poodle like tall plants they call palm trees that were obviously imported here for the sole purpose of looking exotic in a sunset.  what other purpose do those things serve?  they don't really offer any shade, have really no space for birds to hang out, litter some kind of plant neck hair all over the place and tend to kill people when an earthquake hits.</div></div><hr />
