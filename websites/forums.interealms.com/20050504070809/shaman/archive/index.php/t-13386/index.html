<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">61 Troll Shaman and ????????<br />
Just got a 2nd account (mainly for trading) but would like to have a go at 2boxing. I have started an Iksar Monk but having read one or two threads on the subject perhaps a pally would be a better choice ?<br />
Anyway, any suggestions welcome and any ideas on how(and where) to PL (sorrry, fed up with doing the newbie thang:)) would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read more threads, there are a ton of them on the subject.  Thats my first suggestion.<br />
<br />
Pick an SK or Pally if you are going for a melee class.  Mage or Necro if you want a caster.  Choice is yours, any of the combinations listed can work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heya!<br />
I've been PLing a ranger up on my trader account, and I'm currently leveling him in seb to get the xp and the gems to finance the tradeskills needed for my 8th shawl.<br />
I'd go with SK or ranger for the snare alone, that's a really big help. I'm sure someone will link you a result from their search in one or two replies, so I won't go into details here.<br />
As for leveling spots, here's what I did:<br />
1-7 : do the local newbie grounds<br />
7-23 : Everyone's favourite, Paludal Caverns<br />
23-35ish : SolA, start on gobs and move to gnomes<br />
35ish to 45ish : CoM. You can probably continue here longer, but half the mobs in Seb are DB to him now and I needed the cash so I went there. <br />
If you're into some serious PL, hit the planes at 46. I may take him to PoJ at 50ish and make him earn his keep in diamonds etc. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SK is a great pick imo...some of the monk mitigation has been fixed recently but i am not sure to what extent...so dont give up on one of those just yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A good pally celestial healing herself and stunning the mob needs next to zero healing from me.  I also can't grab aggro off a good pally no matter how many dots I lay on... at level 64.  Particularly for 2 boxing, I think it'd be handy to be able to keep the mob stunned with the one box while that slow is still casting and you don't have the option of slapping a quick heal on with the shaman.<br />
<br />
I think I'd rather have a LoH and rez handy than FD and snare, but it probably depends on your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the general warrior shaman combo.<br />
<br />
whatever you do, go straight to SouthKarana at 24 and fight at the paw spires. you can easily clear every spawn, quick XP and good loot.<br />
<br />
when you get to 36 go directly to SOLB and fight at the window room. again, the exp is great and the loot is worth hanging around for too.<br />
<br />
once you get your 2nd box to about 40 you can easily pull the whole area from window to pool and around that area (a lot of spawns).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All good suggestions, I personally think 2 boxing a shaman with any casting class would be more headaches that its worth.  Straight melee classes are more &quot;Fire and Forget&quot; so you can concentrate on adding damage with the shaman.  If you have to switch screens and cast spells every 10 seconds, you will go nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Comparing an sk (FD and Snare) to Pally (rez) is a big choice.  Do you want to be able to FD on a bad pull and avoid a CR?  Do you not care about a CR, because you can rez yourself?  Just depends on how you want to spend your time.  If you are doing normal stuff, its whether you want to take an extra 5 min FD fixing a bad pull, or and extra 30 minutes doing a CR.  The choice is yours really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warrior or Rogue, I would lean towards a rogue.<br />
<br />
When you get either of those classes to your level, they will be actually useful on the raid, rather than another couple of gimp twinks that are there to look the worthless SK and pally crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pick a mage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm thinking the mage or the necro. Mage for focus items and pet weapons, necro for snare.  Alpha pet with 150dd proc is tight!  It could be a misconception, but I think the mage, necro pets tank just as well as a soso equipped warrior, but the dps of the pet is higher, especially without babysitting the tank class (aka casting all the quick dd's that a SK has).  Mage/Necro pets get aggro FAST without having to cast clinging darkness or stun a couple times at the beginning too.  That and the mage pets never complain about us Torporing them for heals, and forgetting to buff them.  Not having to cast a haste spell on the tank every 10 minutes alone is worth it!  If the tank dies, they can always recast another one.  If the sh** hits the fan, and you need to get out of there, cast Gate.  <br />
What about pulling.  This is a toss up.  If you are going strictly for max exp, then the shaman pulling works pretty well.  Malo on the pull, and then cast slow as the mob is coming to the group.  If you get really good at duo boxing a SK, then you could do zones duo style that you couldn't do without the feign death pull.  These are probably limited, and if that's the case you can always join a group and go from there.  First thing that comes to mind though is The Deep for farming your levitate spell.  I think a duo mage/shm could do that just as well though.<br />
<br />
If it were me, I would go Magician between the two caster classes.  If you want to get into a full group, magicians stack really well since all their damage is dd, and folks love the focus items.  But also, magicians are primo money makers.  Their summoned items become highly valuable later on.  10pp a pop on muzzles, fists of ixiblats, girdles for pets, naki rings.  Set him up overnight and watch the plats roll in.  Go to work, come back the next day... I'm assuming a good 100pp each night on average at least.  Hey - it adds up!<br />
2 cents<br />
ps - doh, now I want to duo box lol. Feeding sony $30/month...not gonna happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">....Gnome Magician.<br />
<br />
This is the combo I play.  Both are level 63 now.  If I had time they could both be 65 with unlimited AA.<br />
<br />
In my experience this combo excels over a shm/melee combo as the Mage pet tanks as well as a melee and the Mage gives you the nuking power of a wizard.  It's almost like 3 boxing for the price of 2.  <br />
<br />
Once the toons get to level 61 the Shaman pet can offtank (and add a bit of DPS) while the Mage pet becomes a tanking AND DPS king.  I actually didn't even use the Shaman pet with this combo until I hit 61.<br />
<br />
As far as ease of play it's a no brainer.  I &quot;play&quot; the Shaman and hotkey the Mage.  All you need is /assist Shaman, /pet attack, cast NUKE1, cast NUKE2, cast PETHEAL, etc.<br />
<br />
I have tried other combo's but this is the one that I've had the most fun playing.  My second favorite is Shaman/Monk, mostly for the pulling aspect.</div></div><hr />

Heh, I don't know about you, but when I think Paladin I think stun, not rez :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karverez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I duo w/ a necro all the time.  Never tried to 2 box it tho.  We crank out some exp.  I think it would be fun to try, just not enough cash for another pc, all the expansions, and such.  <br />
   On another note.  I think this is more of a pl for me.  I'm a lvl 54 sham btw..  I duo w/ my rl bro, who is a 63 mage...  He just wants someone to slow mobs for his pet to mame.  works well for the both of us I guess.  Just my imput.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the swift replies :)<br />
My monk is now level 20 and leveling nicely. I think Ill also try a Mage and Pally as well as the usual Cleric Rez bot.</div></div><hr />
