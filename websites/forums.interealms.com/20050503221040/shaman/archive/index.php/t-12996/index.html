<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DSP Hopper/Tribal caves, nice XP and pelts sell for decent cash (always go to the botom cave).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have LoY, Dulak's harbor might be fun.  I'd also give Echo caverns a try,  exp is great but not much loot.  Upside is your right there next to SH and Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I second the CoM option...  It's great exp, and not having to deal with any wanderers or runners is nice with a shammy/warrior duo.  I did 35-51+3aa on my warrior in CoM, and his total /played after that was about 3 days (including 1-35, but I'm not sure what the split was).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I third CoM, back by the castle I think you can get to 52 or so pretty quickly, added bonus of being able to bind melee there in case things get bad (although they shouldnt).  Above that I would definitely somewhere in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a warning, but I used to PL in CoM quite frequently prior to the pathing change in the last patch or so.  W/ the pathing change, several times now the PLee was aggroing the entire upper level of the zone resulting in a quick death and the shaman having to gate/run as well or be swarmed by mobs.  This happened at stables, courtyard and temple so far, so frequently that I've given up using CoM as a PL spot and headed to greener pastures.<br />
<br />
I'm a little worried how this is ganna affect epic hits because the pathing and aggro are so hosed as to make adds a near certainty no matter where you're fighting.<br />

Zoned in and worked our way back killing everything between us and the alley's/gazeebo's (including courtyard). Didn't notice any different agro than what I've seen in the past in those areas. Haven't checked stables or temple yet.</div></div><hr />

Good cash, and the best exp you'll find for him until 54 or so, when he can be effective in a duo in tier1 planes with your shammy.</div></div><hr />

I'll go back and check again in a few levels (sk at 38 now).  Originally took sk there at 30 and aggro radius was huge (no surprise), maybe that was the cause.  One thing I did notice was that the &quot;ghosts&quot; that would randomly appear on the first level weren't ghosts anymore- they definitely aggro'd me (L60 shaman) and not the L30 sk.  May just be my bad luck- I really liked CoM so I'll give it another go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yep CoM. my warrior has gone 38-48 there. Make some DS potions, have him pull a train. put his back to a wall, hit auto attack, heal everyonce and a while.<br />
Get the biggest 2hs you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I made an ogre warrior as barbie doll on a second account, got him to 54 by now.  I found for strict duo JPF gnoll caves are the best spot.  No adds, you pull with slow, and add dots to damage as required to have the ogre do 51% of damage. In the big cave the gnolls don't go lb till 58, so you have plenty of room to grow.  Also easily 300 - 500 pp per hour in drops.  Have your ogre collect the gnoll canines for faction, you get him non-KoS with human druids that way.</div></div><hr />

I tried this last night and got jumped by 3 gnolls at entrance to the caves ... what am I doing wrong .. or is this the wrong spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good call Shamu.  Jagged Pine gnolls are tight; I went from 54 to 58 there rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

Gnoll caves at top of map (north)<br />
<br />
You'll have to invis to run in.<br />
I find a good spot is the pit. After running in, take a right, then take the next right. You should drop into a pit. There'll be a gnoll in front of you, but he shouldn't aggro. Cast pet, buff and work your way in. you should beable to to single pull the whole way. <br />
At level 54 I had no problems soloing.<br />
remeber to use root, gnolls run when low on health</div></div><hr />
