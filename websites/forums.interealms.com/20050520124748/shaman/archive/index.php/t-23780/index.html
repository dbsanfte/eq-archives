<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I cancelled my accounts recently (again) after experiencing the WoW stress test.  It could be said that I didnt' want to sully my mind with EverQuest after playing a fantastic game like WoW.  Plus, I'm anticipating EQ2 within the next couple of months, and WoW (hopefully) within the couple of months after THAT.  <br />
<br />
My question is this.  I want to still like/love EQ like I used to.  I am also a VERY casual player nowadays.  I do two box a monk that I've put a lot of time and effort into so I would probably want to bring both accounts up to date with OOW.  Is it worth it, in your opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think SoE did a pretty dang good job with this expansion. From what I have seen it is very much geared towards the casual player. The task system is great for people that want to just mess around for a few without having to go LFG for hours. Leveling up is long and boring, but the aa are worth it in my opinion. Alot of neat stuff that I can't wait to try out. Also, it seems there is tons of very decent loot dropping off named that seem to pop fairly often, so it should be much easier to gear up without being in a &quot;raiding guild&quot;. All in all, I think its a great expansion so far, and it was well worth my money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just FYI. WoW will be out before EQ2. Im almost 100% positive on that. Im pulling that assumsion from the state of the beta for EQ2. WoW is ahead of EQ2 and has a projected release date for november. Thats not iron clad, but its been hinted at from legitimate sources.<br />
<br />
Just clarifying that for you.<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW, your sig fits perfectly in WoW ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
/sits backs and waits to see if OoW is worth it also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Omens is a good expansion.<br />
<br />
It's not the scale of Kunark, which is too bad, but that's a pretty high standard in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
Not nearly as fugged up as Gates was.  <br />
<br />
Ironically, I think Gates will have a lot of staying power though.  In the long run, people will like that expansion more and more.  I just can't believe, even still, how badly they fugged up it's release.  <br />
<br />
But yes, Omens is definitely worth the money imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lit I played a tauren shaman a bit but I'm tired of being a support class.  My &quot;main&quot; in the stress test was a human paladin, but I think I'm going to go Tauren warrior on release.<br />
<br />
Also Gart, et al., I remember folks praising GoD (which is a good expansion IMO) but then coming down to hate it later.  <br />
<br />
Meah I don't know.  Tough decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree with the positive on OoW<br />
<br />
I am not busting my fingers getting to level 70.  But I am almost 67.<br />
<br />
I am totally enjoying the Shaman 1.5 (thank you so much guys - rather than do instanced zones, when I get home, I come here, see what you have found out, and get in the game).  Also, hey Bethiana, it was fun meeting you for the first time last night in FG.  And here we thought we had found a new NPC ... good search on your part to let us know we were on the wrong track!<br />
<br />
WoS is downright fun.  Even going back to the sewers and just farming some spells had a better feel to it.  More relaxed .. more chatting ... reaped 3 nameds and 1 spell drop and 1 stone for turn-in spell.<br />
<br />
And when I get tired of all that,  I am working my alchemy again and a bit of jewelry.  Looking at the write-ups on the attunable augs makes me think my guild would drool over those.  <br />
<br />
I have two minds as to how long this new feeling will last.  But if you take it slow, work everything there is to work, and use this board as a reference to post your new encounters, and find new things to do, I think you just may well enjoy Norrath again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The few zones that I have played in so far have been fun.  WoS was nice steady pulling with nameds being rare but not 10 hours rare.<br />
<br />
Exp wasnt stellar, but was better than nothing especially with the loot and runes dropping.  Prolly will lower the rate of droppage like they always do but.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think OoW is one of their best expansions since Velious, and I loved Velious.  It seems like there is something for everyone.  Zones aren't too hard that casual shaman with 2k-3k unbuffed hp can't have fun, in fact I've been chatting with someone that is in that range and he's gotten more spells than I have so far, including a level 68 or 69 one.   Gear seems to be dropping quite well for them as well.<br />
<br />
We also raided a couple bigger mobs (the golem things in Walls of Slaughter).  Very challenging and fun, definately not your normal fights.  Loot was very good for the effort as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was one of the few who didn't care for Velious all that much.  I was a huge Kunark fan, and I like PoP believe it or not...  And I'd rank OOW 3rd behind those 2.  LDoN was a neat concept too that was pretty damn successful.<br />
<br />
Factioning and tradeskills are something I hate, so that's why I hated Velious.  LoY was just downright boring.  I haven't really gotten into GoD a whole lot... I've been real impressed with OOW so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The new zones are worth it. The new spells and AAs are worth it.<br />
<br />
But the task system is not as advertised and not worth it. It is not the solo content they were promising, it is simply a way to get people to explore underused zones and reward them with a smidge of exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lorianna, check your PMs!<br />
<br />
As for the subject of the thread: I think it's worth it, yes. I was expecting this to be another cluster**** expansion like GoD--which I actually liked at first because it was impossible and I had zones to myself with my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As long as it doesn't suffer the typical post-expansion drop-rate nerfs, overall reactions are, for once, positive. Biggest change: Wall of Slaughter sure is laggy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tentative thumbs up so far. The attunable tag means you don't have to waste half the loot, and may also be able to use some stuff that would normally rot for guild tribute.<br />
Zones seem a bit big and could become a lag fest, but then again you can just grab an instanced zone if it gets too bad.<br />
I was able to get use bane and anathema to full duration on a lot of mobs in City of Dranik.<br />
Downside is they were ALL only partially slowable.<br />
Upside is they didnt quad for 1k+ like KT so double pulls were not a death sentence.<br />
Named spawn rate is ok and I've rolled (and lost, blerg ) on 3 spells so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i would say at the moment it isnt worth it, however, once they fixed everything and prehaps tweak our spells (hopefully) then it might be. it is better than god, but i wouldnt put it better then kunark,luclin,pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">bit shizo here. I canceled all 3 of my accounts but have a copy of OoW inc a friend ordered and forgot (and quit).<br />
<br />
Even though I am really unhappy about GoD and the state of the Shaman class, I am looking forward to play in OoW. Even more since I have been able to take a look at another upcoming MMORPG which I may not talk about (loving NDAs 24/7).<br />
<br />
But well, level 70 does sound tempting ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have only good experiences with god so far. I think it will be the next in line of everyman's expansions.<br />
<br />
Zones are very nice but a bit HUGE. Exping in WoS with 85 ppl in zone can be strange rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">personally , i just waiting alittle bit longer, as some concerns about aa at 70 ( its takes 3 times as long in pop zone than at 65 apparently, though there could be places in oow? but i rather get it shorted before or comfirmed) and the spells not quite working correctly, and possible problems with epic quest or any quest or encounter that i am very sure will turn up. However, i am willing to say that its not that bad, but shaman as a whole still need some tweaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm having fun, but I'm pretty easy.  The neat thing I've noticed about OoW is you can have 65 people in a zone (Proving Grounds and WoS), and still not feel like you're stepping on anyone's toes.  The generous number of named helps break up the exp grind, and I now prefer leveling there over anywhere else.  That being said, *puke from all the regular exping*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like it alot so far.<br />
<br />
Leveling to 70 isnt fast or easy, I personally took a full week off work just to do that.  will take casual players a while and they can ejoy it while they go. <br />
<br />
for the number of zones there seems to be quite a bit of content. most of the zones are really big too WoS can easily support alot of people.<br />
<br />
IMO all the aa is really good, fairly priced and useful.  <br />
<br />
The augment making might actually make alchemy useful and profitable.<br />
<br />
proving grounds is fun and has many events for 6 or 54 ppl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well one thing is for certain, with the added AAs, levels, and spells from OoW:  many people who passed over GoD or only saw early zones will revisit it, and progress through it *very* easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well one thing is for certain, with the added AAs, levels, and spells from OoW: many people who passed over GoD or only saw early zones will revisit it, and progress through it *very* easily.<br />
<br />
Good for them.<br />
<br />
But you forgot to add that they will be able to successfully manage and navigate one expansion old content because of a CURRENT expansion.<br />
<br />
Something about that sorta strikes me as odd.<br />
<br />
Sure, when you got to 65 with 200 AA's Trak sorta became easy.  And prior, when you could Zerg Vox and Naggy with 60's, THEY were easy.  But for the most part, Kunark was doable DURING Kunark NOT because of the release of Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I see your point, and yes, I agree, it sux that we need to level in the &quot;next&quot; expansion in order to be adequate in the previous one.  It should never work that way.  However, at this point, the complaining about GoD has probably covered all the bases.  And did result in some re-tuning and other adjustments to both content and spells.<br />
<br />
Like most, I'll play in Omens for a while, and venture more into GoD, as I feel able.  So eventually, I will get my money's worth from both expansions.  But that's me, I was not ready for GoD, or even the elemental planes, when GoD was released.  Granted, the situation was  much worse for those that were ready to proceed to new content and could not.  That is a shame.  But there is no way to go back and change that now.  <br />
<br />
So I'll look forward and hope that SoE never screws up like that again.  If they do, then I'll have to do what I do every month, and decide whether I want to pay for another 30 days of playtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I like OOW. <br />
<br />
For lots of reasons, but here is one:<br />
Go to Wall of Slaughter and you can here &quot;/ooc Group needs slower&quot;<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Every expansion is how you make of it.  I personally still love GoD and thought that minus the problems at the start of it, have been very happy with it in all aspects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lit I played a tauren shaman a bit but I'm tired of being a support class.  My &quot;main&quot; in the stress test was a human paladin, but I think I'm going to go Tauren warrior on release.<br />

<br />
Meah I don't know.  Tough decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im thinking maybe hunter so far for my main, with a shaman as a soloing class. I just love shaman too much to not play, but i have to admit, im getting a lil weary of holding others together. Itll be nice to not be in that role for a lil while.  Maybe ...    I loves them shamanzes though ;)</div></div><hr />
