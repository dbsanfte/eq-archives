<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know or have a good write up on these trials? I know the first one is pretty straight forward, but I know nothing about the 2nd and 3rd. <br />
<br />
Also, without all the bitching, how usefull are Shamans in these? I know they're just third rate healers in the first one. Thanks in advance for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The second and third trials are easier than the first.  Shamans can function as secondary healers on all 3 trials as long as they are decently equipped (beneficial spell haste is a plus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, i haven't honestly tried to be the backup healer in the first one, mostly cause there is nothing that I want from there.. and for the most part no one wants to do the first one anyways.  <br />
<br />
However, I've been able to do function as a backup healer in the 2nd and 3rd one (I've done the third one alot of times.. thanks BiC piece not dropping).  Alot of these trials depends on who the people are you in your group and how competent they are.  For instance.. you can use a chanter as the puller/mezzer easily, however they need to be on the ball.  You are easily a better slower in here than any other class (meaning you can debuff the mobs faster and using balance of nihil slow quicker and easier than a chanter/beastlord can.. and with the mobs being pretty unforgiven it helps alot).<br />
<br />
I would say though that it all means nothing if you don't have the right people for it.  If you want to be the backup healer, than you'll have to do it with a solid hps/ac tank.  It might also be worthwhile to get some good solid dps too.  I completed the 2nd trial one time with one of my guilds best cleric as the main healer, but our dps was a mage, bard, paladin and warr.  Needless to say, our first attempt the mage died on the first priest at 99% (they spawn at 11%) and the cleric and I managed to keep the tanks alive and we wiped to the 2nd priest when he was at 1%.  Our second attempt the mage stayed alive and we won, but for these you will want to have at least two solid dps people.  Getting a cleric with a mana pool bigger than your would be best too of course.  Remember that these named fights are all just burn fests.  So, having a cleric with a 5k mana pool isn't going to cut it, especially if you are backup healing.  Blast healing can tear through your mana fast, and it's even worse for the cleric.  If you are healing, it will help alot to have Daluda's Mending.  Crits actually make a dent in the tanks hps.  <br />
<br />
The goal in the 2nd trial is to conserve yourself.  You need to kill two named priests, and you have to engage the 2nd one within 1 min of killing the first one or else he will be resurrected.  So, it's essential that you and the cleric get a good rotation worked out and aren't overlapping heals.<br />
<br />
In the third one, the first named that you come to is prob the hardest named in any trials.  He's even harder than the final named of trial 3.  At the end of trial 3 you come to three named archers - Flesh Hunters.  You can hide in the far room away from the first one until you are ready to engage.  Once you get started, you burn it down just like with any of the other ones..  This guy is rooted, as is the other two.  Once the first one is dead, then you can move into the area that he occupied and rest up.. waiting on mana and discs.   You do one mob at a time.  This trial is easier than the rest of them overall.  It's short, not much clearing and the final guys are pretty cake compared to the priests and the DD.  Oh.. you start at the entrance, and just clear the mobs down the hallway.  Don't go into any rooms until you go down the ramp.  Once down the ramp you clear out that room, and the final named archers will be there in the alcoves.<br />
<br />
Might I suggest that you stock up on some 10 charge Greater Elixir of Concentration (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14578) potions and bring them with you.  3 extra FT is not that much, but it will help alot in the long run in these trials. <br />
<br />
Oh, and quickly.. the 2nd trial you have to kill 2 priests.  Both are in the first room to the left just down the first hallway.  They are inactive until you kill the bolsters that surround them in their respective area of the room.  I think there are maybe four or five on each side.  They each have different characteristiscs that chance from trial to trial too.  Meaning, there are some that have a huge damage shield on it.  These I would only use your main tank or whatever to dmg.  Some are highly resistant to magic or poison or whatever (btw.. if you do use a pet in here.. watch him closely.. one time he got away from me an di wasn't payin attention.. and he ended up killing the last bolster and I got instantly summoned by the priest and smoked).  Anyways, once the very last bolster is killed.. the priests will be active and at 11% each.  Goal is to kill one, with getting it out of LoS with the 2nd one, so that you can leash the 2nd one and he won't come back to you.  Then just burn and start on the 2nd one without a min.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't match my experience. We've done the first trial several times and PA even more times with a less than 11k tank and a cleric and druid healing. Druid didn't even have thier new GoD heal for any of those runs. It's not easy but done properly it's definitely doable because we where consistantly winning it. If you had a time equiped tank with more hps/ac, avoidance and shielding I definitely think a shaman and cleric could keep them up against PA. <br />

We found the third trial to be the easiest too. It's the only one we beat on the first try. I don't how ever thing that the first named is harder than PA. Pa hits harder, proc stuns and uses the stupid swarm pets. Definitely hard mob in my book. The first named in the third trial can often be hasted tho which if it isn't dispelled can be a bit of a problem. <br />
<br />
I'd say the second trial is the easiest to farm the first named on simply because he's literally right at zone and you can kill him with out killing any other named. The third is still the easiest for a complete clear tho.</div></div><hr />

Well, the 2nd priest needs to stay in his cubby hole while you are killing the first one.  Usually when you start the fight, they both will charge you, and this is why you keep the tank and dps in the first priests area.  The trick is to immediately move the first priest as far NW (it's been a while, but you want to draw him to the left/front side of his area that he is in) as soon as he spawns.  This puts him out of line of sight of the second priest.  The 2nd one should agro to you when you first engage him, but hopefully ifyou get him out of line of sight, then he won't run back to hit your dps again.  Also, when you are doing this, you will want to get him leashed asap before you can really lay into him.  This is done basically by healing agro.  He will make a run at you of course, but if you set up the healers at max healing range, then he will leash back to his spawn point and hopefully not re-agro.  <br />
<br />
Now once that first one dies.  You can just sit there for a few secs and regain your composure and get ready to run over and engage the second one.  You have approx 1 min to get agro on him before he resurrects the first one (if he resurrects he will eventually go back to 11% health before you start to kill him).  It only needs to be engaged a min after the first, it doesn't need to be killed.</div></div><hr />

oh, come on now.  You either got really unlucky or have some really poor players in your group.<br />
<br />
I've killed the first named there about 15 times.  We started with our tank having 9.2k hp, now he has about 9500.  The first time we won, neither myself or the cleric had our GoD heals.  No elemental gear on anyone in the group.  Only myself and a cleric for healing.  It took us 3 tries up front to get it worked out and then we never lost after that.  It isn't easy and it's always a race to the finish that leaves myself and our cleric oom.<br />
<br />
I have max healing AA and the focus effect: Improved Healing IV.  The cleric has max healing AA and IH4 as well.<br />
<br />
We also killed the PA with a paladin (with no healing aa) as the second healer and me as DPS.  I did not cast a single heal just nuked and dotted him down (and got summoned for my troubles).  I've done the PA with a variety of groups, and have done him with a druid in the group as well.  I still did the healing and let him do the damage.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are certainly viable as a healer if you have done your healing AA and know how to time your heals so they land in between the lights from the cleric.</div></div><hr />

I've beaten the first named of trial 1 numerous times with a cleric/shaman combo healing my warrior. At the time my hp was in the 10-10.5k range. Any priest can serve as secondary healer, as long as they have the appropriate aa and mana reserve so that they dont go oom before the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did 1st trial with 11k war, clr, dru, monk, chanter, shm. <br />
2nd trial with war, clr, dru, monk, rng and shm.  Kept chanter outside for buffs.<br />
3rd trial, once we cleared everything with war, clr, clr, dru, mag, shm, I left trial and we added a wiz, since nameds are not slowable, and figured dps was key.<br />
<br />
Our group for the 1st trial is our regular group, and we found it to be the easiest. After trying everything we could think of for the other 2 trials we decided to add different people.  The 3rd trial was finally won after about 10 tries, and it took 2 tries with final grouping.  <br />
I guess which trial is &quot;easiest&quot; depends on your group makeup.</div></div><hr />
