<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm entertaining the idea of trying Spirit of Tawro in Umbral Plains duo with a 62 Mage. Anyone have any ideas on the feasability/tactics for this? I'm not expecting an easy fight of course, I'm looking for a challenge. Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know that this is possible for a shaman of my type of equipment.  I've done it several times with myself... or duoing with a rogue.  However, at your level (and assuming that you magelo is correct) it think that it would be next to impossible.  He wasn't that hard to slow for me, but even with all of that, I ran low on mana throughout the fight.  He summons so you will need to keep something on that can take and hold agro.  Your heals won't be able to keep up with the mage pet I don't think and unless the mage was great with chaining pets on top of another, I don't think that you two would be able to keep up with the mana regen.  this is just my honest opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'd be owned.  That's not a put-down, just a fact of where you're at lvl/gear/aa's at present.  Get to 65, some aa's and better gear before you even try.  If your guild/player friends are of similar level and equipment, it would probably take a full group, possibly two to take him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will do just fine with a mage.<br />
<br />
If you fight him in the cave just remember to keep him away from the walls. Just use your 10 second heal and forget about topor. Bring some ITU potions to get into the cave since you will need it to get past some of the aliens. I duo-ed with a necro down there and it was a yawn-fest.<br />
<br />
You can also pull him to the ME zoneline. If you have some of your twinks parked there they can loot the no drop stuff that would normally rot in the caves.<br />

<br />
Kariina, level 63 shm<br />
<br />
I don't think you looked at his Magelo, Kariina.  He's under 2k unbuffed.  He also does not have Torpor to keep on him and doggie (in between casts of Kragg's).  No mention if mage has epic or better pet.  <br />
<br />
No epic, no 61 doggie (says he's 60), no spirit call.  He does have 60 focus spell.  Sure, he'd most likely be going there with Virtue or symbol and Po9.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between 60 and 63 just in power.  This mob isn't a pushover.  There's nothing wrong with giving it a try (bind at the zone in), but I seriously doubt he's going to be able to handle the mob with a mage that's comparably equipped.  His stuff isn't bad, but it's nowhere near Valsuvious'.<br />
<br />
This mob was a tough fight for an experienced group outfitted in Velious armor (during Luclin era), which he has a piece or two of, but he's basically a reasonably equipped shaman of that era, not ornate or elementally equipped.<br />
<br />
You don't show a magelo, but I'd bet you're better equipped than he is, you probably have Torpor, epic, your spells to level, and some aa's to boot.  <br />
<br />
Give it a try Beafly, but be realistic.  If he beats you, try him in a few levels, when you're better equipped.  Can you and the mage handle the Moktors and Shadow Assassins in the zone?  The other aliens?  <br />
<br />
The only way I could see him pulling it off would be with a Tank class that can keep aggro, and keep him from being summoned.  Otherwise, he's going to be getting pounded after a summon, and unable to channel that 10 second heal.<br />
<br />
Your necro partner can flop to lose aggro, the mage can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First of all, ITU potions dont work versus the aliens. You can invis past all the skellies and aliens outside the cave fine (yes, the skellies dont see normal invis). Con every alien to make sure they cant see you, as sometimes the odd one does.<br />
<br />
Once you are in the cave, use assidious vision to check the first room for any see invis mobs. Sometimes a shaman type mob spawns and see-invis's the entire room. If so, come back another day, its really not worth the time or effort. After that room, you continue up and check the next for see invis. There is only 2 static spawns there, and a wanderer from the right hand path. Can kill these if one sees invis, just position them away from the wanderer so you dont have three.<br />
<br />
If neither see invis in that room, move into the right-hand tunnel. If the wanderer sees invis, engage him deep in the tunnel where you will get no adds. Make sure it is far enough down from the Swarmcaller though. <br />
<br />
After that, the Swarmcaller sees invis, have to kill him anyways. IF you struggle with him, gate out there and then to save a rather mushy CR.<br />
<br />
Then the ice tunnels. The mage aliens see invis, whereas the melee do not. If you are lucky, they will be all melee. The mage can check this with his eye, since Assidious Vision cant be used (cant acquire target before aggro)<br />
<br />
You will nearly always pull all 4 if they see invis, especially at your level. At 65, in partial-ornate, early PoP gear, I can just solo all 4, whatever combination of class they are. Requires tough dog and a stroke of luck sometimes on heals. If one sees invis, I wouldnt recomend pulling them. That is up to your discretion though, maybe 2 of you can do it I dont really know :)<br />
<br />
Now, Tawro. max hit is 350, triples, quads if dual wielding (I think, dont quote me). I usually pull with spirit call to get Malos and slow in. I know you dont have either of these, im just stating what I use to indicate what kind of buffer of time you need.<br />
<br />
I cant really give you any tactics. The way you duo him without Torpor will be completely different to the way I killed him at first (Level 62, no Malo, but just bought Torpor). He can do alot of damage annoyingly fast, and the odd interupt on either of your fragile selves will be the end of you. <br />
<br />
However, I am damn pleased to see someone wanting to give it a go. If you fail badly, leave it for a few levels and hope to get some spells. If you fail at 14% because of unlucky melee damage, try again. There is a difference between the two defeats :)<br />
<br />
Good luck if you try it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having just glanced at your Magelo, you were almost identically equipped at the time I first soloed him. Apart from I had my epic, which would help alot unfortunately. I had 40+ AA's banked as well, which probably helped me. You are not that far off, just need to acquire torpor,<br />
<br />
And as an afterthought, maybe try Yeldema and aim to be 70m and full health when she dies. Would be somewhat of a guide to mana-management for Tawro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Excellent Advice all.<br />
<br />
I picked up level 61 this weekend (yay new dogy!) and my current plan is to finish my epic (just killed BD this weekend), level to 62 and pick up Torpor and Canni V. Then I think me and my mage friend will give him a try. He is pretty well equiped and almost level 64 now (probably 65 by the time I finish the above).<br />
<br />
I've done the sneaky insertion techniques everyone described above on raids before, so I'm familiar with that.<br />
<br />
When I do give it a go, should I have mage unresistable debuff? Mala I think? Me Malosini? Then Slow? Try to slow outright?<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If mage mala's, no need to sinia him before slow.  Hit him with turgur's, and send in the pets/dot/nuke.  Fight will probably last long enough to require a second slow.  <br />
<br />
If you're nearly 62 already, I question the need and expense of purchasing torpor, when Q is close at hand, and probably at least double the cost.  If you're going to be staying at 62 for awhile getting aa's (I'd have done them at 60, actually, but too late now.), then it may be worth getting torpor.<br />
<br />
You're going to need to get some better ac/hp's to effectively mitigate the hits.  With your current gear, the mob can  do some serious damage to you in one-two rounds.  Be careful with canni, because if you get summoned after one, you're dead.  As a matter of fact, if you don't get your hp's up, you're likely to get aggro/summoned because of your low hp's after a canni.<br />
<br />
Hell, give him a go.  Have a necro or sk handy for a summon if it goes badly.  Good luck.  Personally, I'd get to 65, get all my spells, and then go kick his butt.  The two of you should be hitting Droga, IC, and Seb hard to farm loot for your upcoming spells (all definitely doable at present level and gear).  I'm wondering if you're hoping to get the WIS bracer off him as part of the reason for going after him?  He usually drops one of the Luclin bracers and a melee weapon.<br />
<br />
Again, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I'd get to 65, get all my spells, and then go kick his butt <br />
<br />
I think he is trying to do it pre-65 and maybe pre-Q, just for personal satisfaction. Pretty much any 65 shaman can solo Tawro with Q. Not all. but almost.<br />
<br />
You will be probably need to slow 3/4 times, not because of length of fight, purely to make sure you have 1 or 2 minutes breathing room where you can canna, or take unnecessary damage by accident, and you know slow fading isnt going to add to your troubles.<br />
<br />
Your plan seems pretty firm now, hope you manage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, I can use some upgrades from the encounter. I know my wrist items are the suck at the moment and one of the stamina bracers and one of the wisdom bracers would definately be upgrades. I would like to be able to do this pre-65 for personal satisfaction but it's not mandatory. Mostly, me and my mage buddy have been looking for good targets that we can duo to farm for bazaar sales. We learned very early on that if I can slow it and keep up on healing his pet, we can duo it. Targets like Tawro that are more difficult to get to are probably less farmed and might make a better profit in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

A few hours in Droga, Seb, Veksar, or IC would net you far more profit than taking out this guy.  If you're looking to boost your bank account, and regularly duo with this mage, you should be hitting these zones and cleaning up on pp.  The two of you could easily be making 10k + a day in Droga.  Camping Brogg for the Ranger bracer will bring you 10-15k on almost any server.<br />
<br />
The one nice thing about expansions is the fact that once crowded zones like Sebilis are damn near ghostowns now.  Hell, just doing the bugs in Seb (which is ridiculously easy) for about 8 hours netted about 8k in gems/loot (selling to vendor) plus 4 lammy's (at about 6-700pp/ea) one late night session.<br />
<br />
If you're after the bracers, go farm the loot elsewhere and buy them.  If you want to take out the mob, then have some fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The bugs in Seb were heavily nerfed to prevent platinum farming, 200pp an hour is approximately the net profit now, and thats if you are lucky :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was several months ago, so you may be correct (which is too bad, since the zone is usually empty now).  I still love Seb (even more so, now, since it's not crowded).  Disco is another option, then.  Brogg/lab isn't that far away, from disco.  <br />
<br />
Droga is definitely a shaman's or duo's friend, though, for farming. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll confirm that the bugs in OS no longer drop gems at any noticable rate.  That or the RNG gods hate me.  I whent down with a freind who used to farm this place often &quot;back in the day&quot;, and walked out of sebs with little more than the wish that I had spent the time in Veks, or farming silk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What you think, should I try it solo? O_O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, me and my mage buddy finally got around to trying this duo. Long after when I first wanted to try but oh well. We're both 65 now, me with 19 AA and him with bout 80 AA I think. I wanted to post some thoughts and tactics that we used to help everyone out.<br />
<br />
We actually had three in group, the third was my Enchanter Bot parked at the zone line she buffed us KEI and sat on her tush for the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Setup...<br />
<br />
Fully Buffed Mage Pet including a fresh Quiessence was pocketed.<br />
We both did standard self buffs except I picked up a Virtue in PoK for the pull.<br />
<br />
Getting to Tawro...<br />
<br />
This is often the hardest part of doing Tawro with a small riad force. There is a mix of mobs that can be passed with Invis versus Undead and Regular Invis in the way. In addition there is potentially the Swarmcaller who see's through both and if killed begins an event that will be a pain in the butt. We came up with what I will call an ingenious solution (though painfully simple). Mage parked himself outside the tunnels on the hill with a clear view of the entrance (IVU). I ran inside all the way to the Swarmcaller and agro'd him and any of the mobs that see through regular invis (IVU). I trained everything out of the tunnel and towards the zone line. When the mage saw the Swarmcaller clear the tunnel entrance he made a mad dash for the Tawro Setup spot in the tunnels (last corner before Tawro's room). When he arrived he simply CotH'd me to him. Done.<br />
<br />
Tawro Icequake...<br />
<br />
Chump. Dogdog is summoned, fully buffed medded back to full. Spellset as follows:<br />
<br />
Kragg<br />
Tnarg<br />
Q<br />
Malo<br />
Turgur<br />
CannIV<br />
Anathema<br />
GreaterImobilize (I soon found out was worthless on these guys)<br />
<br />
I pulled with Malo<br />
Mage Pet grabbed agro<br />
Mage Malosinia<br />
I slowed<br />
Mage did PetLayHands for first heal at 50pct.<br />
I Q Pet<br />
I Anathema Tawro<br />
I Q Pet<br />
I Anathema Tawro<br />
etc.<br />
Mage does his mage thing.<br />
Tawro Icequake Dies.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Tawro...<br />
<br />
Same Spell Set and tactics.<br />
<br />
I would note that I tossed in a few Tnarg's while fighting the spirit. The spirit can put down some spike dps even while slowed.<br />
<br />
We re-slowed and malosinia'd once at the 5 min mark. Tawro Dropped at just about 8 minutes. Mage held his swarm pets and dragon nuke pet till 20pct and Pet-Hold took care of the Enrage. I finished at 50m and didn't burn any mod rod. Mage finished at 5 manna with no mod rod burns as he was nuking hard at the end (note: we could have gotten 2 burns in durring the 8 minute fight).<br />
<br />
He dropped the pally sk axe, Cha bracer and the longsword of freedom. With my chanter still parked at the zone we were able to CotH a Bard from the guild in to loot the sword, sadly nobody able to loot the axe so I picked it up as a little momento.<br />
<br />
Things I would do different...<br />
<br />
Remove Kragg and Greater Imobilize from spellset and add Cripple and Tears.<br />
<br />
Replace the first anathema with Cripple and burn both mod rods durring the fight. Use the extra Manna to sneak some dps in with Tears. Prolly finish a little lower manna but who cares.<br />
<br />
I think the whole thing took under 2 hours. I think we can get it done in under an hour now that we know what we're doing. I think that a 8k-10k bracer and a nice sword for a guildie is well worth our time. This may be a farm spot after all.</div></div><hr />
