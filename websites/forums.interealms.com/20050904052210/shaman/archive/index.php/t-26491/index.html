<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if a game is too easy, the challenge fades quickly and folks move on. The trick is keeping a good balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ? Not that I can remember. But, speaking for myself, I did quit several games because they were too easy, some in the middle of playing, some after finishing them. And in some cases I deliberately made the game harder for myself. For example in Morrowind I forced myself to not use any of the ways to get nigh-infinite stats and stayed away from the potion-using melee fighter who will simply win every single encounter given enough potions. Extrapolating from that I can see myself quitting a game because my class is too powerful. In a MMORPG you do not really have the option of just playing a weaker class after all - if you do that you are simply a worse version of everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didnt ask if anyone quit because the game was too easy.  I said; &quot;if their class was too good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Balance is a myth.  The Dev's dont even know how to balance the game at this point.  If they &quot;balance&quot; this game right now, it would be so far from what you all have known you would quit in a heart beat.  Balance is relative.  Either you think your class is good or you don't.  And that leads to the question I asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">nope. i feel the shaman class is the best class in game right now and i'm having a blast!  :D</div></div><hr />

ROFL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Naw, ya don't quit.  You just go PVP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I didnt ask if anyone quit because the game was too easy.  I said; &quot;if their class was too good.&quot;<br />
If my class is much better then someone else's class then the game is much easier for me. If a game is too hard relative class power does not matter. If a game is too easy relative class power does not matter. No matter how you turn it, game difficulty and class power are directly linked, and thus (in a game with multiple classes) a class being &quot;too good&quot; is too.</div></div><hr />

OMG!  I could NEVER play a cleric.  Having to watch your mana so you can heal?  Honestly, I can't play any caster other than shaman, I hate having to med.  So I stick with hybrid or melee for alts.  (though I have a baby necro who seems promising)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a ****-hot cleric, actually, when I log on a guildie's character out of neccessity.  People just freak out while I'm at it, because even with the better spells, I heal like a shaman :P</div></div><hr />

I can only say, be careful what you ask for. If you play it long enough it may very well rival your enjoyment of shaman. Shaman and necro are the best 2 classes in EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I've played so many classes to 60+ necro/shaman by far the best. Only other one that on occasion can come close is enchanter though they regen mana to slow and can be boring at times if you can't crowd control.</div></div><hr />
