<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been 65 for months and months, and my piercing was maxed years ago, and my 1Hb was maxed last week, so now I'm working on my 2HB, just hitting whatever, and whereever I'm fighting, I've only got 30 points to go in 2HB.<br />
<br />
So, my thoughts turn to H2H, I tried un-equiping my weapons and using my hands :) a novel idea I know, but it doesn't work, the mobs all seem to be INVUNERABLE. Now, I wracked my brains, and had a flashback to killing wisps in EC at level 10, and they were invunerable too, seems I needed a magic weapon, so I wandered off to the Bazaar, and did a search for Shaman useable H2H weapons, and it came up blank, so I went to a couple of Spoiler sites, and got the same, no Shaman useable H2H weapons, so what do I do ?<br />
<br />
Has anyone else maxed thier H2H at level 65 ? What did you wield ? and what did you hit ?<br />
<br />
And don't tell me not to bother, you'd be wasting your breath, your talking to a Kitty who has 100 skill in ALL player languages :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know of any shaman usable h2h weapons but there is a small trick you should be able to use to level it up. I think you can still hit a beastlord pet with just barehanded attacks. So what you need to do is find a beastlord buddy with pet hold and get him to summon a pet, tell it to hold, and then duel him. Since his pet is on hold it regens at a rate equal to its non aggro rate which should be more than fast enough to offset any damage done by lowly shaman h2h damage. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, the only thing I see is to find a mob that is at least LB and does not require a magic attack to hit... not sure I can offer any advice on finding one of those though :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if I remember, you can hit magical monsters by equiping magic flagged gloves when equipping no weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have gotten mine to a whopping 22 or something by duelling a mage friend and beating (so to speak) on his pet.  Can do it with any pet class that who has pet hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blue mobs in natimbi aren't labeled as magic (at least some aren't) and you can use your bare fists on them. If you slow them, you will most likely outregen the damage they inflict on you if you're buffed with Replenishment.  Also, if your h2h is low, you won't injure them either and be able to beat on them a while.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a shaman h2h weapon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't recall off the top of my head (I'm at work, working hard here!). The cap on H2H for shaman is 75?<br />
<br />
I know I topped it out years ago tanking tigers in LOIO. It was much easier to do if you kept it up level by level as you leveled up, which I managed to do with all of my skills except 2hb, and eventually I wandered over to Lake Rathe and looted that shovel there with the fast attack delay, and used it to level the 2hb up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Furree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i raised defense by going to chardok i know. lots of blue mobs there that don't hit hard but i have no idea if they are magical or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if I remember, you can hit magical monsters by equiping magic flagged gloves when equipping no weapons.<br />
<br />
That was definitely correct a while ago, whether they changed it for no apparent reason I don't know.  It's why monks loved woven gloves so much - pre-Kunark era really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hurrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did HtoH the same way I did begging (dont laugh, needed for BIC quest, seriously).  I went to visiit my class trainer, and walked away an automatic expert.<br />
<br />
And I am about to get five more levels worth of guildmaster training points soon, that I have nothing to spend on.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">H2H skill cap for priest classes is 75. I think the magic gauntlets rule only applies to monks and probably beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Youichi....I would recommend PL'ing that Mage we both know to 65 and dueling her pet. 8)  I know she wouldn't mind dueling you. hehe..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">bards and monks get the magic from gloves, maybe bst as well but I doubt shaman do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I maxxed my hth years ago bro - just group with friends and litterally just fight with your bare hands - sure you won't do jack but you will max your skill - I did this back in early pom days ....Hell most of my friends got a kick out of hit - <br />
PS you can hit for 8 at times !!! well for a barb anyways ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Youichi....I would recommend PL'ing that Mage we both know to 65 and dueling her pet. 8)  I know she wouldn't mind dueling you. hehe..<br />
<br />
Hehe, Hi Herky.<br />
<br />
I might just do that, she can always summon me some pet-kits then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did the same as Hurrk and just went to the trainer and maxed there.  The cap is 75 and it will cost you bout 40 plat to max it if you care :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well this is how i rasied my hand to hand.<br />
<br />
1) go to ME ( or some place there are still light hitting blues)<br />
2) find one of them red ape dudes (gatherer prefurable)<br />
3) mem up slow, cripple, haste, VoB, torpor/Q, and anyother buff you need.<br />
4) slow gather then cripple him<br />
5) now preceed to try and kill him useing nothing but your fists. apply torpors when needed. bring some nodoz.<br />
<br />
and there you go max out at 75 skill and be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have max h2h and the skill cap is 75 at lvl 24, Max skill = 3 X (lvl +1).  I don't think I ever did more then 4 points of damage and I don't know of any h2h weapons that are equipable by shaman.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />
