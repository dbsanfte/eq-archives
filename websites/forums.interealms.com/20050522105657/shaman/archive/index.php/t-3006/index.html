<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use mine almost constantly while soloing at 60 still, and I probably will until I get canni5 and a copy of torpor<br />

<br />
I always end up playing very conservatively with my mana.  It's good because I am often called upon to do a lot of healing and other things in many situations my friends and I find ourselves in.  The JBB gives me free damage, both in terms of I don't have to use my mana and that I don't have to use up a spell slot for a nuke.<br />
<br />
I suggest trying it out before you decide it sucks.<br />
and it's 8 seconds for 263 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its 32DPS, thats far better then your melee is(probably atleast) and its FREE<br />
<br />
just slow, dot if you want, and click....<br />
<br />
Its pretty darn easy, and you can keep going, cause you dont run oom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still solo 90% of my time at 59... my JBB is still used A LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I solo, I use it at level 60.  I pull with slow, epic, pox, then bracer and wince and torpor until epic and/or pox drops, and reapply as needed.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group, I still use it, but much less often.  By the time I slow a mob, epic, wince up, and maybe torpor a caster or myself, the mob is almost dead.  I'll bracer maybe once per fight, or a few times if the mob is tough, like the Shik'Nar in FG I've been farming for shards.<br />
<br />
If I'm on a raid, I bag it and pull out a bracer that helps me with more AC and/or wis/mana and/or resists.  I don't bother bracering on most raids, as I'm too busy debuffing, assist healing, torporing, or buffing the resurrected.  I don't have time for some sissy bracer spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 58 I use it to solo in the Grey, will use it at 60 too... if you think of it DoT wise its damage per tick is greater than Pox of Bert, something like 170 - 190 damage per tick.. too lazy to do math, must...log...on...play...EQ....<br />

what lvl do most shammy finally turn in the JBB for another bracer ? im not even lvl 45 yet but 8secs for 280dmg doesnt seem too good to me, i have JBB in a bag and was wondering what lvl do most shaman stop using it? <br />
<br />
It's very simple.<br />
<br />
Get to 45, and then use it, and you'll see why we never give it up.<br />
<br />
I'm level 56 and use it constantly, and I don't plan on getting rid of it any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only reason I could see anyone changing them out is for resist gear, or a better bracer stat wise if they don't have time to JBB while grouping or raiding.  I would never change mine out while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with the poster above. Get 45 and use it a few times and see how amazing 263 dd every 8 seconds can be. I can't imagine giving up mine. Sure, in groups and on raids there are more appropriate bracers, but in general, the JBB is an awesome tool. Actually, even in pickup groups there will be plenty of opportunity to use it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">JBB?  Bah, I refuse to ever use a JBB.  It would damper my pride, and we can't have that, it's all I have.  I think I'll start buying up as many JBB's as I can and clicking the good old Destroy button on em.  That'll learn ya!  Besides, it would chafe my scales.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, JBB is a great item, and I've envied softies before after watching them solo with it.  BUT, it is in no way necessary.  I solo the same npcs as other shaman with JBB, and do it just as well.  I have yet to see a mob that a JBB shaman could solo that a non-JBB shaman couldn't.<br />
<br />
Besides, I find it much more entertaining to be a battle shaman and run in there getting my melee hits in.<br />
<br />
Hey Coraz, my first post as well. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm 60 with cannibalization and torpor and I use it all the time soloing.  Tend to bag it on raids if I need resists or extra hitpoints, or like in sleepers or kael, cold damage just doesn't do squat.  But I will never give it up, unless of course I get another right click damgae item with a higher dps, haha fat chace there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Solo at 57: Still use it all the time<br />
Grouped: Never have a spare 8 seconds to use it - got more important things to do<br />
Raids: Am normally the 4th or 5th shaman there so tend to nuke a lot, but I use my spell nukes rather than JBB to try and get some resonable damage output, so switch my JBB for a mage focus bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've never had a JBB (waaah!) but I was speaking to a friend recently, who said he stopped using his at about level 50. This amazed me, given what I read on these boards ... but I guess maybe it didn't suit his playing style or something. Each to their own, sadly he had already sold it when I asked him about it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If I really really need a resist boost I will bag it for a BD bracer.  Other than that you will have to pry it off my cold dead wrist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still use it all the time at 60. It helps when I am dual boxing with my rogue, easy to click and pay attention to the rogue. If I didn't have one I might actually have to pay more attention and use DOTs or something, the horror!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Torquil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I still wear it at 60, unless switching for resistance Gear.</div></div><hr />
