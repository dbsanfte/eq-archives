<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do YOU do to keep the grind fun.  I don't mean a 6 man Seb team pulling everything with flippers and trying to train yourself, I mean when you're out there with a Monk beating down Cheetahs in Scarlet Desert to feed the XP monstah.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Few of my favs:  <br />
<br />
<br />
1) New person I haven't met who's flirting with the Female Troll.  Firstly, I PRIDE myself on my green skin and finding the ugliest visage in the new graphics to go to Luna.  Secondly, I am well known as a crossdresser.  Have been since my first charecter (a wizard.. female was default, by the time I was done rolling her up I figured &quot;that took too long, I'll just play it female..how long could this game be?&quot;... 1.5 years later....) and I'm VERY vocal about being male.  Still, my favorite response to flirting is &quot;/em slaps %t with a male organ&quot;... works wonders..<br />
<br />
<br />
2) OOC goofing off.  This includes stupid Python quotes, even more Kevin Smith movie quotes and just making fun of mobs in general.<br />
<br />
3) Humor.  Absolute must.  Ever group with 5 other people and the only chantter you get out of them is &quot;hey what weps/armor/shield is that?&quot; or &quot;Inc.  Add. Mezzed Add. Clarity please&quot;....  for this I recommend a gnome.  If things REALLY go wrong you can play gnomeball.<br />
<br />

Anyways, just figured this would be a nice topic over &quot;Equipment/Torpor-Malo-Pox/Wis vs HP/Ac&quot;</div></div><hr />

Those open dragon raids provide entertainment on so many different levels - as long as you are at least a zone away.</div></div><hr />
