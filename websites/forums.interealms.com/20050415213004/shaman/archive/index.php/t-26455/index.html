<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have a 6 day stay of execution on panther / leopard.  What shall we do with that?<br />
<br />
This is the first of three polls gathering feedback.<br />
<br />
This poll asks about the relationship of the spell and its proc rate on pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure I understand this question. By &quot;spells&quot; do you mean the cast/recast?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think there is plenty of middle ground for both. I think a 15-20 per minute proc rate on pets and a 10-15 second recast would balance the spell quite reasonably. That would limit the number of targets you could Panther on a &quot;Channelburn&quot; to a liveable number, it would bring the DPS down a touch, especially in those &quot;mage-necro-shaman&quot; groups, but still keep the spell VERY usable, VERY strong, and VERY much a PITA to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure I understand this question. The whole issue is complex, as we have all discerned; and polling can be kind of simplistic.  What you can do with a 100-item questionnaire is different from what you can do with 3 multi-choice items, as well.<br />
<br />
My goal in this is to gather some basic statistical response from the shaman community.  With this particular question, it is to discern whether shamans feel that leopard / panther needs adjustment in terms of pet proc rate, in terms of the spells themselves, neither, or both.  <br />
<br />
It's clear that you think it's both, Blazz, with your suggestion that a good balance would be to add a 10 second recast and reduce the pet proc rate to 15-20.<br />
<br />
The polls are in place for five days.  I'll collate the information at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK thanks for clarifying. I like the poll ideas. I think we will actually get some positive feedback. <br />
<br />
The &quot;put it back the way it was&quot; people need to accept certain inalienable truths though. Prices will rise, Politicions will philander, and SOE will adjust this spell down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To be honest, I would much rather keep the pets procing the way they are, and add a 30 second recast time, then the other way around.  This way, I wont get burned out trying to keep this spell on a bunch of PCs, and I will be able to get the most out of Panther, due to us being able to send the pet right when the mob hits camp.<br />
<br />
If it is switched around, there will be no point in even summoning a pet, due to pets being unable to critical proc (25% less dps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">um, they've already announced how they're fixing pets.  This is a closed issue.  Pets have been changed, the proc buffs MEANT for pets have been adjusted, Leopard/Panther will stay however they are for players.  There's no further discussion on pets to be had.</div></div><hr />

Pets have been changed, the proc buffs MEANT for pets have been adjusted, Leopard/Panther will stay however they are for players.  There's no further discussion on pets to be had. They also have &quot;already announced&quot; how they are adding a 30 second refresh delay on the spells.  Do you feel that this also should be considered a closed issue, with no further discussion?<br />
<br />
/shrug, some people think that the issues are related, and could be evaluated together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">...but they're not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...but they're not.You are so brilliant writing one line dismissals of others, Brohg.<br />
<br />
I wish you would use your brilliance to write thoughtful interactions and creative ideas.  I bet you'd be good at it.  As it is, your disparagement of everyone else seemed fun the first couple of times I came across it, but it's been pretty boring for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But this issue doesn't require any creativity.  The pet proc rate was clearly unintended and unbalanced, and the fix was clear.  They announced that they are taking the appropriate corrective action.  Case closed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But this issue doesn't require any creativity.  The pet proc rate was clearly unintended and unbalanced, and the fix was clear.  They announced that they are taking the appropriate corrective action.  Case closed!Was the proc rate clearly unintended?  SOE does many things that appear to be unintentional, so saying something they did was unintended will never be a bad bet; yet many people supposed that a spell that had been on test for a while and then was brought live was brought live intentionally, as a way of strengthening shaman dps production.<br />
<br />
Was the proc rate clearly unbalanced?  Many people think it was unbalanced, many people disagree about that.  That's specifically the issue many people were debating on these boards until yesterday's explosion.  Many people are not presently convinced that changing the pet proc rate is the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
Was the fix clear?  According to SOE it was not; several factors intertwined and it was apparently not immediately obvious to them how to adjust this without breaking how other pet procs function.<br />
<br />
Are they taking the appropriate corrective action?  They have announced in the patch message on test that they are changing the proc rate; but presumably since it is on test they might decide to do something different.<br />
<br />
So.  You assert that all these things are 'clearly' the case.  But all of them are matters for debate.<br />
<br />
Case closed?  No.  It's your mind that's closed, not the case.</div></div><hr />
