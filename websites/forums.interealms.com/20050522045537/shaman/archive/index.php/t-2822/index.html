<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed that torpor only snares our farward movement, but not to the side. So if you want to move turn 90 degrees and move to the side where you want and you won't be snared.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed this or is it just my imagination?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup, strafing seems unaffected. Torpor also doesn't affect movement rate at all while swimming.</div></div><hr />

Just so you know, there have been incidents where people have been harassed by GM's while Strafing to affect movement speeds, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This also works when encumbered.  I've often used strafe for 99% of my movement while super-encumbered.  As long as it is possible for you to move forward, you can full-speed strafe.  <br />
<br />
Also works with the fungi staff.  :)</div></div><hr />

PUH-LEASE. Guides maybe, GMs no. I'll personally send paypal cash of $10.00 to anyone banned for strafing. Utter bulls'hit, but your heart is in the right place. ;)</div></div><hr />

If that is the case, approximately 40% of the population on my server needs banning as they always strafe/run to increase run speed in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guys, I'm not saying it's right, or that it happens daily, but it HAS happened... there was a stunt where a Knight almost got banned by a GM at an Event because the Guide had Luclin Models off and the Knight had his AA Skill Selos Speed Horse.   The GM thought he was movement sploiting because on his screen a Paladin was zooming around at Selos Speed.   Guides can do the dumbest things at times.<br />
<br />
We have one guide on Torv (well, had before they began to rotate), who sits in Kedge all the time because /petition text is hard to see, so she likes to sit in Kedge where it's dark and you can see it better.  Yes, she has no idea how to alter text colours.<br />

Yes, I remember that story, it pissed me off so much I, like many people, e-mailed Verant about it.<br />
<br />
However, that's a little irrelevant from strafing to go a little bit faster.<br />
<br />
First of all, they were being watched by a GM anyway, and the guy was going Holy Steed speed while appearing to be running.<br />
<br />
Little different from strafing to avoid snare.  How would the guide know you still had the torpor icon on, anyway?<br />
<br />
Really no 100 percent way to catch that, heh.</div></div><hr />

That pally was one of the coolest guys I've never met!<br />
I loved his sig with the American Gothic painting parody with him and his horse.  Very funny haha ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Torpor heals 1200 dmg over 24 seconds, kinda noticeable when you have it on :D<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't think they'd really care.  Who the hell would report you for that?  Consider it like jaywalking and the most severe sanction I imagine would be a slap on the wrist.</div></div><hr />
