<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm killing the nobles and bards in HHK.  Camp is almost always open, always have kei, and I mow them down.  At 52, the exp is usually around 1% per kill, sometimes a kill doesn't move the exp bar enough to make it go up that 1%.  Am making about 25% every hour and a half.<br />
<br />
I've done the dulak thing...mobs hit harder, have more hp, give same exp per kill, and have higher resist rates (i've seen one slow bounce at the noble camp) than nobles and bards.<br />
<br />
I've killed elementals in Nadox, but I can't seem to target the elementals under the lava with F8 when I go diving.  In fact, I have to proximity agro them to pull them.  Not to mention, I seem completely dependent upon having aego to last if the named spawns.<br />
<br />
I tried PoP, but at 52, getting a group that lasts for any significant amount of time is tough, not to mention all that wasted time I sit there and have to pound out &quot;LFG&quot;<br />
<br />
Suggestions for a place where I would have a higher experience rate?  I have no jbb or epic.  I have about 2400 hp 850 ac self buffed, max 1hb and soulstealer.</div></div><hr />

If you're making 25% in hour and a half soloing, I would never leave. In my opinion, that's fantastic solo xp, you won't find better anywhere. Even grouping in the planes you'd be lucky to get that. I actually never tried doing those guards, because the few times I made the journey, they were camped, so I never bothered too much to go back. So, someone who has done them might have a better idea if there is a better spot. <br />
<br />
Anyway, other places to solo. The best place at 52 in my opinion, would be the gnoll caves in jaggedpine. Invis, keep making rights until you fall through, static spawn spots (maybe 15 minute repop), plenty of gnolls to take out, and single pull too. Also, you could probably solo the trash in PoJ, be careful lots of adds. You could also do archers/scounds in Echo (and make some decent pp too), ice giants in EF (permacamped though), Scarlet Desert (the revenants).....I know there's a few more popular solo spots, can't think of them at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, mind posting a magelo? You mention 2400 hp's self buffed, just curious as to what you have to get that (I think I might get to 2k with self buffs, at 57 with average gear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL - you don't even mention da loot.<br />
<br />
I loved HHK - could sell (at great prices) right in the zone, to the enc vendor.  could bank if I wanted too, but it irritated others when I had to train to the zone to get the banker to quit hitting me.<br />
<br />
and at those levels 25% REGULAR exp per 90 mins is awesome.  You will probably be able to keep that pace up, too, by killing faster as you gain levels (and don't forget the noble up on the third floor).<br />
<br />
you don't mention it, so I will - bear form or a horse is most helpful here.  then ya don't even need the kei.<br />
<br />
at 55 you will be about ready to move to Katta - another great outdoor zone made ot order for the solo shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">alot of people have mentioned dott'ing the mobs and then medding, but if your skills are max'd already and have decent gear, it's actually a lot easier to just melee them to death after you slow, and once you have a bit of downtime, just to stoic yourself.  with kei, i do both.<br />
<br />
magelo is the main one...others are things i was fooling around with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nadox elementals are still my favorite- can net about 30-40 percent in a hour with just a kei and alpha dog. no group has ever come close. I group for fun and adventure and for social reasons. Learned alot of good shaman skills there too because of the named corpse spawn also. Fyi I'm pulling all 5 elementals and one of the trolls in a spawn cycle at level 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty sure it's agreed that for whatever reason, HHK is the best exp in the game for those lvls.  The ZEM is amazing. Sell at the enchanter on the bottom floor, and bank if you need to downstairs.  I usually just killed the banker when they aggrod - it will pop back in a couple minutes and is much better than training the zone all over the place.<br />
<br />
I think they start turning light blue around 56?  I moved on to the bears/wolves/griffons out in Jagged Pine for 1 more level - amazing exp as well.  but the very next lvl they greened out and I had to start hunting the gnolls (which is also pretty good).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i stayed there till 55 great great exp nowhere else is better that i have found they give 2%per kill up to lvl 50(barb shammy) and 1% after that and after like 53 i think exp per kill slows down majorly but it just gets easier and easier so the kills just keep coming in. i never do camp if i dont have bards/nobles both. and at 55 even though most of the time they are dblues i just put my AAexp to 100% and just mowed through them nonstop(no horse so i always had kei and mana was never a problem) and at 55 with new pet and just using ebolt and slowing them i could clear nobles and bards and come out on full mana before they started spawning and the money is also great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">quit being a wuss and sit down and grind, it's gonna take a while<br />
<br />
that's what PC has done to us =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HHK is amazing.  That being said, when I lvled my sham there, it was a constant battle with SKs, druids, Necros and Bsts who would try to jump my camp when I found it open.  Oh yeah I forgot, there are no camps in EQ.  I would clear the 2nd floor: Bards, Isabella, the 2 nobles.  Then hit 3rd floor for the single noble, who was about a 40 % spawn rate I would say, then haul butt down to the 1st floor for Boshinko.  I would pull with slow, sitting on my horse and chain cast JBB while alpha pet chewed them down, I did this before stoicism was ingame and it was still easy as all hell.  I always pulled to the centre room on 2nd floor, where 1 lonely guard spawned.  Would dot if I was running high on mana from canni-dancing,  At lvl 53 I stopped and farmed 23 AAs for canni 5.  My record was an AA in 2.5 hrs solo there.  Occasionally I would let some low lvl player in the 40s or so leach exp of me for comapny as the camp got boring after 23 AAs and 6 lvls.  The mobs were all but light blue at 55, but they were so trivial by then it was still decent exp.  Thats my experience in HHK, and killing their was kind of fun strictly from a roll playing aspect as my shaman was an ogre.  Hehehe I also got lvl 57 I think off of Freeport Militia guards as a larf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nearly 54 now...and yeah, the people trying to take that camp over is more of an annoyance really than a threat.  one ebolt is more than enough to outdamage them.  once had a pally and sk, both 52ish, come in, and for 30 minutes, try and take everyspawn.  one ebolt, send dog, and i just let them do the rest of the work for me.  was actually pretty nice, we really ripped through the spawns.  was sad when they finally gave up.<br />
<br />
as far as cranking out 23 aa in there...how long did that take you?  i think i would crack if i was there that long, listening to all the new players shout and grapple with each other in /ooc, not to mention the boredom of one camp.<br />
<br />
oh, and i finally got my spiritstone of the banished.  had looked for nearly 2 weeks in the bazaar, and auctioning in bazaar chat, but nobody was selling.  broke down and started /ooc for grandmaster potters, and within a few hours, found a good cleric who would make one for me for only 250-300 plat.  kind of shocked me since everybody told me they were running 2k.  gave him 500, and haven't looked back.  should really help out when i head to katta to farm guards.  bind in katta, gate to nektolus forest for kei refresh.  can't recommend it enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as for the 23 AAs I cranked out there, all I can say is thank god for thr MP3 player</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">so if i wanted to grind aa, would it be faster to do it in hhk or in katta off guards?  and if it would be better in hhk, what lvl would i get the best aa exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At lvl 52 the occaisional noble was light blue, and I could pull them all solo I think, 53 a few more were light blue but the exp still flew, 54 would be too late to catch the prime Exp range I think.  As many other post on this sight say lvling is way more important than AAs till you get 65.  At 65 it is possible to get an AA an hour in a good group, in a good spot, but if you like to solo and have the patience, HHK is pretty much unbeatable.  I tried Catta too, at 56 but decided grouping in Tier 1 and 2 PoP was faster Exp.</div></div><hr />

There are 8 that I know of, and I supsect there is a ninth as well I just could never get that far and be ready for the respawn. I hunted there off and on from about 48 to 55. At 55 they start to go LB on you. Still a great AA camp though.</div></div><hr />

You are referring to AA right? No way mobs that LB out around 55 would give you 30-40% in one hour of regular. Hell I even doubt anywhere in the game you can get that kind of regular xp.</div></div><hr />

spirocs at 49 &gt; all other exp in the game. i got 49 to 51 in 2.5 hours<br />
<br />
as for low to mid 50's, there are a few spots you can get a 40% an hour. pod at 52 can get around that if your group is right. same goes for pos at 55 or so (im 58 and can grind out about 30% an hour there with the right people)</div></div><hr />

no sir, 100% exp. Went there  earlier in the day to see what the exp would be like at 53 and found that I could still do about 8-9% exp per spawn cycle, approx 3 spawn cycles per hour. Thats pulling all 5 elementals and 1-2 trolls per cycle. Thats using an alpha dog/beta shaman btw.  There isnt a spot anywhere in Norrath I've found that gives better yield than that though. Possibly a high quality group in tier 1, but I've yet to see it.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting all-</div></div><hr />

no way- thanks for that little nugget. will be interesting to see how much exp I could do on pure elementals.</div></div><hr />

boat form oasis to TD. The big tower lookin things are full of them. Also little small village section like the chick village in SK. Its a pretty well known spot for druids. I never thought it would yeiled good exp so I never tried. I'm interested to know how much exp mod TD is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">head out to Timorous Deep to the main island (the one where both boats dock, near the ogre camp) from the ogre camp go around the big mountains in the middle of the island and you'll see a giant treehouse full of spirocs. they range from (im guessing) low to upper 40's. they're just any other solo mob except for the provens... they hit harder and faster and BS. an ebolt and a pet oughta do em in... train 2-3 even, u should be fine</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried and tested this. I was able to pull all 8 elementals before respawn. I'll post a guide for this at will be useful to other shamans. On my server there is always a group pulling both sides of the bridge so its rare when you can steal some trolls, but its no matter if you can pull 8 elementals :)<br />
<br />
update: at level 54 all 8 elementals will yeild 5-6% exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So what are the recommended levels for soloing each of the boats from Right to Left?  I'm 57 ... can I still get decent solo XP off the boats?  Should I be on Oceancrasher or Windscorn?<br />
<br />
Or should I be soloing somewhere else at 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">from what i remember (this is only based on hear-say, no loy here so cant check it out myself), lady d is good for 57.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could clear stormwave at 50 or 51, and all but 2 on Lady D at 54, and the lower deck of dandolak. At 56+ with new pet and bane I would imagine keeping dandy clear should be easy, but thats just a guess. With a new dog I know I could keep lady D clear. <br />
<br />
The difference in exp seems small between the boats from dandy to stormwave. Not sure about oceancrasher and windscorn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">at 55-56, dando is pretty easy.  you should be able to keep the spawns cleared.  mobs on ocean crasher have more hp, hit harder, and land their hits more often, so they are a bit tougher.  they're also spaced a little more closely together.</div></div><hr />
