<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning on upgrading my pc in the next month or so.<br />
<br />
I've got two thoughts <br />
<br />
Get an Athlon 64bit 3000 or get an Athlon XP 3200 (barton)<br />
<br />
The 64 bit chip seems like the way to go but does EQ work with it? are there any problems with getting the thing to work with Windows XP? I think I'm right in saying that at the moment the 64bit side of the chip wouldn't get used as Widows XP doesn't support it directly.<br />
<br />
The xp 3200 would be a similar speed pc and I know there will be no problems getting that set up. Plus it will be cheaper than the 64bit setup.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info/thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The performance of the 64 bit ship will only get better with future software upgrades, while the barton core is a dead horse running on nitrogen oxide injection.  Go for the 64 bit system, it's much more future proof.  Building and installing is just the same as any other mainstream system, won't notice a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I put together a new machine about a year ago using AMD's 64 bit cpu, and have not had any problems with EQ at all.<br />
<br />
I use a 754 socket 3200+ cpu, with biostar's IDEQ small form factor case and motherboard, and Nvidia's 5600 video card and have been totally happy with it.  No problems with EQ (well not problems that are related to my hardware, Sony's software patches are buggy no matter what hardware you have :) )<br />
<br />
The 64 bit athelon CPU's have many advantages over both older althelon cpus, and their intel rivals.<br />
<br />
A good comparison of AMD's 64 bit CUP's, their older CPU's and Intel's older line up of CPU's and their new &quot;extreme edition&quot; chipsets is here<br />

<br />
The only issue I ran into when building my new machine is the memory.  Be sure to use name brand registered RAM.  (I was cheap and bought a gig of generic stuff, worked fine in either of my two athelon 1800 boxes, but not in my new computer, but that is talked about in the article).<br />
<br />
Generally AMD’s 64 bit CPU’s run 32 bit software faster than their 32-bit rivials, and once 64 bit software becomes the norm, AMD’s 64 bit CPU’s will provide even better performance.<br />
<br />
eddited to add<br />
<br />
the xp 3200 will is not similar to the 64 bit 3200+ in terms of performance, even though their core speeds are the same.  On board memory cotrol ensure that the 64 CPU is significantly faster than the older style CPU's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice guys.<br />
<br />
That link is really really interesting Tormac.</div></div><hr />
