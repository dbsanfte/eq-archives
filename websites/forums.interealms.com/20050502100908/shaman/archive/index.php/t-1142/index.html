<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya everone,<br />
<br />
Well im new here, but ive been reading the posts for awhile, to learn new tricks etc.  Anyway, when i twinked my shammy i gave it mostly wis.  Now im coming around to see that AC/HP is potentially more important.  Now to get AC up, a good defense is a must.  <br />
Now the way i see it, i dont want to be standing out infront of a mob thats wailing on me while im not doing any damage, so i was thinking about getting 1/2 HB up so i can hit back, and hit back strong.<br />
<br />
A Melee shaman is always impressive, expecially if that shaman can out damage the mob toe to toe(slowed mob of course :)).  At the moment i deal 20 damage max w/ my spinechill, and if i go up to a mob i get dominated, so im forced to root rotting while soloing.<br />
<br />
Should i get 1hb and 2hb up to deal some more damage?  i have a centi hammer and a groaning mace btw, so i have decent weapons for both stat.<br />
<br />
thanks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just recently &quot;saw the light&quot; of weapon skills other than piercing.<br />
<br />
With my Slime Coated Harpoon I was hitting for 20's max. When I switched to a Dark Ember (1HB) I now average 25-27 damage per swing (I max at 30). My 1HB is in the 90's right now, so I still miss a Fair amount but it is definitely worthwhile. Make sure you are hasted when you are swinging :) Of course, mathematically I'm not sure if the slower 1HB is equal to the faster Piercer but it sure is fun to smack things around!!<br />
<br />
Once I get my 1HB up to a respectable level, I plan on working 2HB.<br />
<br />
If you are working on Defense, consider fighting a &quot;soft&quot; mob that is unslowed. More hits on you = more chances to raise defense. Personally, I've never had a problem keeping defense maxed as I usually solo after I gain a new level until my melee skills are maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 58 my pierce is at 195 and offense is 197...both almost maxed. Last night in fungus grove I put on every buff I had to up attack, had str maxed, rage on, etc. The ranger partner I was with gave be one of his buffs that added 54 points of attack. This made my attack around 1010 which I belvieve is about equivalent to a level 45 warrior. I missed the shrooms alot, roughly half the time in fact. Max hit with epic for around 85 damage, though half that was common. <br />
<br />
The point? Having weapon skills maxed is a good thing. Its a nice bit of additional damage between casts. But its never gonna be a main source of damage once you get past a certain level. <br />
<br />
However, it rocks for killing mass greens (for faction, bone chips, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, one hand bash is worth keeping up, but dont expect to out melee even a slowed mob  - not as you go up in levels.  <br />
<br />
2 hb was once the big deal for shaman, as the piercers stunk for both wis and damage.  Kunark changed that, and the epic sealed the deal.  There are some real good 2hb for damage, but you give up wis and ac in the shield slot (and hp, most likely).<br />
<br />
The thing to remember is, that it is much easier to get weapon skills (and defense/offense) up as you level.  Trying to catch them up later is tough - you just dont take enough swings to get the increases, and increases are much harder to come by afte 100 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just got me a nice 2hb yesterday, Heavy stone great hammer (28/41), and I had to try my new favorit spot. The seafuries in oot, so I took the boat over and started to buff me up, pulled a seafurie with slow and started to whack him together with dogdog, my hits was around 50 dmg.<br />
The problem was I didnt hit that much, need to tarin my 2hb much more (about 85 now).<br />
<br />
I found it to take the same time do kill them with plague/e-bolt as plague/2hb. I needed to med some more when p/e since I used more mana but the fight was faster. I could both time kill 2 mobs in the time alacrity hold.<br />
<br />
The outcoming:  I like my new friend ;), when I get 2hb maxed im sure this will be a faster way to kill  (atleast seafuries...) and if you dont have defense maxed this is a good way to to max it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kristis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*cough* 1hb -Righteousness- 20/22 1HB +stats +combat proc = 6second stun and 100DD.<br />
<br />
With Dragonborn Sash and Celerity. I can out melee my JBB.<br />
Fun on raids when you done debuffing Uber_mob_001.<br />
<br />
Hey, on Vindi i chocked up over 3k melee RAR (without rabid bear form)<br />
well untill MA went down and I procced 3 times in a row, boy he hated that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, since I got an REIF I find it impossible to work on 1HB or 2HB.  It's like an addiction.  2HB is in the 180's and 1HB is in the 130's and they are both likely to stay there.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I recently got my 200th defense point, so I'm finally maxed!  Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree with kristis, righteousness is awesome and makes meleeing a good source of damage and adds more than the root rot method.  Especially when duoing with a rogue, the stun makes it guaranteed backstab and the aggro built by it keeps the mob on the shammy.<br />
And it is very possible with righteousness to out damage mobs with the 100 pt dd proc. :P  ie i get 2 procs in a row, thats 200 pts not counting the melee damage and he hasnt done any to me in 6-12 sec.<br />
A good 1hb that i used and still use when needed is the jmans stick, its fairly quik at 24 delay and tash is always nice soloing or a grp without an enchanter to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BAh! How many player will be wielding Righteousness? 5% atmost<br />
<br />
Most shamns will never get their paws on a weapon that good(<br />
<br />
I have played troll barb ogre and vashir shaman, ogre is lvl 52, and is cleraly the best race if u want to tank alot with your shaman: downside is they take alot of exp to lvl up, and the graphics are crap- just look at the legs on ogres!<br />
<br />
I played the ogre with only moderate twinkage, and so feel able to comment on weapons for the ave shammy.<br />
<br />
1st off shammys are poor untill lvl 30- the 20s are nightmare, you have to be well equiped to tank stuff pre 30.  However at 29 Quikness starts to change things, and ofcourse at 34 u get the pet dot to annoy the mob from behind.<br />
<br />
Velious was poor for shammy wapon choice :(  verant seem determined to cripple shammys with regard to solo power- they see us as team players only[wich is understandable but frustrating]<br />
main velious weapons-<br />
tooth from iceclad 932<br />
rygor spear    10 28<br />
spear winter 8 27?  81 dd cold proc<br />
<br />
dark ember  13 32 <br />
vesm      7 22  suky druid weapon lol<br />
hmmm thats it (   crap choice eh<br />
<br />
ok so 50+ folk can get the 2 spears from KD<br />
<br />
12 19 woot!<br />
13 30 hmmm<br />
<br />
Again 70% of players arent able to go fight in Dragon Necroplis to get the 11 22 stuff.<br />
<br />
cont below</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cont...<br />
<br />
OK  lvl 34+ raises shammy solo power , as we all know!, although personally i found that pet waste of mana, bUT shock of poison IS a nice spell! and enstill  scourge too i think!!<br />
<br />
For melle in the 30s we have to rely on kiting till 37+<br />
<br />
Cos this lvl is PROC lvl for many weapons, and its procs that make melee feasable optin for shaman imho[ and slow of course]<br />
<br />
at 37 -  spinechill   40 dam ?<br />
            yak mave 75  dam<br />
           ? sp winter    81 dam<br />
            ? dark ember   14 dd fire dam<br />
            ringed mace of the yak  ?   this a myth weapon?<br />
<br />
ofcourse proce depend on dex! and add an element of luck to the situation, therefore a balance between dam ratio and proc dam has to be considered.<br />
So Mace of the yakasha is the weapon of chice 9 24 75dd magic based proc&gt; useful in velious vs cold reisit creatures, pls got finy graphica the proc :)<br />
[i will coment on luclin drops below]<br />
