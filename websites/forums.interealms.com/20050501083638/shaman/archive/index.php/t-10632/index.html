<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to encourage all Shamans, Enchanters, Druids, Necromancers, and anyone else who feels negatively impacted by the Affliction Focus effect nerfs to let SOE know how you feel in the following way.<br />
<br />
Follow the directions below to cancel your pre-order for Legacy of Ykesha: <br />
<br />
1. Visit Station Store (https://store.station.sony.com/index.jsp)<br />
2. Go to Billing Info and sign in<br />
3. View your Current Pre-orders<br />
4. Click the “Cancel” button (you will receive a cancellation email)<br />
<br />
Frankly, I was not too excited about an expansion with no high level content anyway.<br />
<br />
We have made gear choices for almost nine months only to have the rug jerked out from underneath us on ALL focus affects for debuff/charm/fear/snare/root spells.<br />
<br />
If SOE believes that the high savings on mana and casting time were too good on these Affliction focus items, then they can do something like this:<br />
<br />
Create an NPC in a readily accessible zone that will exchange any and all Affliction Focus Items for replacement items with a new focus effect. The new Focus effect should work on all detrimental spells (not just DoTs), but possibly at a lower level of mana/casting time/duration enhancement. Other stats, etc. should be the same.<br />
<br />
I would find this an acceptable compromise solution, and would re-instate my Legacy of Ykesha Preorder when this happens.<br />
<br />
I realize that a change like this takes significantly more time to program than a simple nerf to all Affliction focus items. Since it was okay to let Affliction focus items incorrectly affect debuffs for nine months, please restore these items to thier previous function until the above programming is complete. Then, please announce the change in the appropriate patch message.<br />
<br />
If a nerf to these items is warranted, then please take the time to implement the nerf in a way that is less disruptive to your playerbase.<br />
<br />
I would like to demonstrate how seriously we feel about this issue, so please post below if you are in agreement (and have canceled your LoY preorder over this issue).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mridule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't play a shaman (Ranger main) but I sent the following feedback email to sony to try and help out:<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Recently the developers changed the AE focus items to not work with certain spells after allowing this error to remain in the game for roughly nine months. I do not play a shaman or enchanter but as an avid tradeskiller you can not make sudden changes like this and expect people to continue playing your game. <br />
<br />
Many players who spent large amounts of their online pp and effort obtain items have overnight seen the value of these items reduce to a faction of their original value. I think players understand that all items decrease in value over time as new expansions come out and more items drop from mobs. Gradual item inflation most people can handle. This new sudden change is extremely frustrating, not only for the people who have the items but also the people that make the items or helped those players quest for the items. I am not a potter but if I was I would feel horrible right now for all my customers who recently bought a Ceramic Skull of Decay. After the change to the tinkered gauze press (which I sold before the change) I know how they feel.<br />
<br />
I understand that mistakes do happen sometimes and need to be corrected to maintain the integrity of the game. In fact I am in favor of this even when it hurts me. But making the change after waiting nine months?  Nobody would play a game where expensive items are randomly removed from their characters and that is basically what this is. What about the integrity of your players accounts? <br />
<br />
Also to omit this change in the patch message is insulting to the player base. How can you remember that an oven was repositioned in some random city and not remember something that greatly alters game play for so many people? You knew very well that people would see this change immediately and not be happy about it.<br />

if you havent pre-ordered it  , DO IT NOW , then cancel it. The numers will show , trust me ive swam in the corp world for a while . They like to see people coming to their product , but it leaves a bigger impression when they LEAVE.<br />

Play time is getting slain anyway, might as well take that as an opportunity to register my protest against the fading sun that they have made Shaman. How fun it is to watch Druids, Wizards and Enchanters solo, while I need to beg for a group to back folks up. Enough is enough.<br />

To be honest, because their pre-order system was so screwed up, misleading, and buggy (it timed out for both systems and never confirmed my order) I was never even sure that I ordered it in the first place.<br />

<br />

<br />
You mean to tell me you didn't bother trying to find out what the focus effects did? It would have taken ~30 seconds to look up the spell in any number of places, and anyone who looked would have seen the following:<br />
<br />
Spell: Extended Affliction IV, 1: Increase Spell Duration by 20%, 2: Limit: Max Level(65), 3: Limit: Spell<br />
             Type(Detrimental only), 4: Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec), 5: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed), Mana: 0,<br />
             Classes: None, Casting: 0, Recast: 0, Target: Self, Beneficial, Duration: 3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0<br />
             mins @L65, Range: 100, Source: Live - 02/04, URL: http://lucy.fnord.net/s/AA2z<br />
<br />
here's the important piece<br />
<br />
5: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)<br />
<br />
yes, it sucks that it got fixed and no longer works on debuffs, and I've said as much to the various people who might give a damn. But screaming 'NERF' when it was blatantly obvious that it wasn't supposed to work on debuffs in the first place is just *shrug* whiney and dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">they had WAY too long to figure that out.  if it was a true oops, i would have expected something 3-4 patches after foci were added.  <br />
<br />
done, i've cancellend LoY too x2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Done.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are doing the same from what I hear.  This could get ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Nobody *knew* this was broken. Hell, it makes no sense for it to be broken before (useful) and working correctly now (useless).<br />
<br />
1) Why would there be no focus effects for debuffs?<br />
<br />
2) Why would SOE even bother to make a focus for speeding up the casting time for DoTs only?<br />
<br />
3) An affliction is anything bad that sticks to your enemy. &quot;Hitpoints Allowed&quot; does not mean the same as &quot;Only Allowed for Spells that Remove Hit Points&quot; to me. To me, it means &quot;Affliction Spells that Remove Hit Points are Also Allowed&quot;.<br />
<br />
4) They were working on this in JUNE of 2002. There were a few patches where it changed, and then it has been left alone for 9 months. <br />
<br />
Almost everyone assumed and believed that it was working as intended. There was absolutely no information forthcoming from the developers to contradict this. After 9 months and no information to the contrary, it becomes a NERF, not a FIX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Quote from the other thread, but an appliciable opener.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my mind tho, shaman are just caught up in the nerf bat swung against chanters and charm. With an AH4 items and buffs, CoD dropped from a 5.0 second to 2.8 second cast time. That's a huge deal and a huge difference. Likely, since so many are concerned with enchanters' ability to for example monopolize BoT minibosses solo, this was aimed at them. The problem is that we were hit as well.<br />
<br />
We weren't &quot;hit with a nerfbat aimed at enchanters.&quot;  A bug that we have all been exploiting has been corrected.  We were warned months ago that it wasn't intended and would be fixed.<br />
<br />
We got comfortable with it and used it.  Then they changed it and OMG W3 R NURF3D.  Even though that was not the intended use of the Affliction Haste Focus, but the Spell Haste Focus.<br />
<br />
I see people asking if it's the newbie's fault that just got in the game.  No, it's my fault, your fault, the fault of anyone who Didn't warn them.<br />
<br />
Cancel your LoY pre-order if you want *shrug* I've still got mine in because I want the expansion, the Frogs, the bank, etc.  and refuse to do childish, kneejerk reactions to something I knew was coming for months.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it wasn't the goal, and VI truly has a problem with Affliction XXX affecting debuffs, I am totally at a bleeping loss -- although I grant them they did warn us, sorta :/ <br />
<br />
They told us flat out that it wasn't supposed to affect non dots, so i don't understand why you are at a loss.  90% of the reason I got my circlet and my wristguard was for slows, and I knew it was coming, I used it while I could.  Now that they are not used for that, I'm not going to bitch because we used something that was too good for a purpose it wasn't intended for.<br />
<br />
Last night was the first time I was truly embarrassed to be a shaman, and in the Shaman Crucible channel :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Rignack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm right with atarak.  I don't think I ever saw a post here that said:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hay the focus effects are broken on these. Its and giving me a benefit I shouldn't have.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Based on the description alone you should have relized that they were not working as intended and should have loved it while it was broke.  Maybe you should be gripping more of the fact that it too so long to fix rather then it being fixed and your exploit is gone.  Just be thankful that you had the benefits this long and it's not like the end of the world is coming because you have to go back to the normal casting time or get the correct items to cast faster.<br />
<br />
I really find it amusing that some that are doing posts are not even 60 and can't cast Malo in the first place.  Malosini in the second place is a pretty fast cast time and if those that are under 60 are freaking out now, you may as well quit then see what it is like casting malo.   For those that are bitching about slow cast times well start casting sooner I guess, or you know what here is a thought: Maybe get an extended range item so you can cast sooner on incoming or don't have to run as far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">If you read the spell info it says &quot;detrimental spells&quot;  then goes on to list all the stuff about it, nowhere does it say that it is limited to dots.   they warned us? i never saw it, not saying they didn't -- I kinda feel blindsided here.<br />
<br />
Wanna roleplay, use of words?<br />
<br />
ok, extended affliction seems like anything that afflicts a target, like maybe a Plague of Insects?  /gosh  Someone who is crippled is: guess what?  AFFLICTED with a spell that causes them to be crippled!<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
To the poster right above me, i'm all upset about EXTENDED AFFLICTION mostly as I only have a coldain bracer for affliction items.  If I had known about this before I would not have passed on that other HoT wristband.  You see, i could be wearing 2 HoT wristbands now, but i'm not becuase I choose to wear the coldain one because of the effect.  The effect is more or less worthless because I group for exp and often the length of my roots and slows is the difference between the group living and dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Use of words:<br />
<br />
There are two main classes of spells in this game, beneficial and detrimental.  These are each broken into various classes, instant, Over time, etc.  There are also added limitations, such as excluded complete heal, excluded complete healing, limitation: hitpoints.<br />
<br />
The Dev team specifically said either on the Dev corner(rolls eyes) or at the Fan faire it was an unintended use for the afflicition focus and was supposed to be limited to DoT spells only.<br />
<br />
I agree that dots should be upgraded if the Dev's truly think they are under powered.  Maybe give them the same % to crit and shorten length of spell(normal length and damage otherwise).<br />
<br />
By words, I would agree but gameplay mechanics and roleyplay do not mix.</div></div><hr />

no, I'm saying that if you're going to piss whine and moan about something, pick a subject that wasn't known to be broken by anyone who spent more than 5 seconds checking out what the spell did.</div></div><hr />

Fact is, there is plenty of reason for the rest of us to feel like we had the rug pulled out. <br />

Hell, they even included Foci4 with PoP.  How freaking stupid do you have to be to miss it if it was truely bugged?  Face it, you people who see this as &quot;expected&quot; are full of crap.  And yes, they know about this the whole time.  Do you honeslty think that someone didnt /bug this a loooong time ago?<br />

You guys might have a valid point if you assume SOE didnt know about it until just now.  But you cant honestly say that because you have no way of knowing.   Where as at least, the rest of us have logic on our side.  <br />

So save us the attitude and ignore the rest of us if you dont agree.  Because the Majority of the Shaman feel like SOE took us for a ride.</div></div><hr />

That's blatantly obvious?  Not only is it data from a spoiler site that is in no way, shape, or form supported or endorsed by VI, but that description is by no means user friendly.  I've been consulting Lucy for a while now about various things and didn't understand that bit till this brouhaha.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please see the below:<br />
<br />
The Dev team specifically said either on the Dev corner(rolls eyes) or at the Fan faire it was an unintended use for the afflicition focus and was supposed to be limited to DoT spells only. <br />
<br />
I read my patch/news messages and was pretty sure you read the fan faire posts.</div></div><hr />

I'm sick of SOE and I cancelled LOY to let them know I was angry.  They are slowly losing my business anyway.  At one point, I had 3 accounts, all enabled up to Velious.  I let one of the accounts lapse, and just hung onto my shaman and enchanter accounts and enabled both of them for Luclin.  When PoP came out, I didn't bother to buy the expansion for my second account, and now with LOY, I don't expect to buy it at all.<br />

How the fook are we supposed to know &quot;working as intended&quot; from intentional change? It started that these items worked on all debuffs, dots, roots and mez...they said they were changing it..then a month later it changed back.<br />
<br />
Oh wait &quot;some&quot; developer at &quot;some&quot; fan faire said it wasn't right, must be carved in stone then? Just like Lady D promised an increase in the number of quests, events and BotBs..or Abashi and Absor that there would not be any more unannounced changes, or at the Boston FF that GM's would not be removed from the servers, or that they were really going to go back through and retune all the luclin encounters since the MR3 nerf, or maybe it was the same developer who said they would look into giving shaman buffs that were actually usefull or would stack, etc....<br />

They have turned over most of their staff and reversed their stance on numerous longstanding sore issues over this period. It is reasonable for us to believe that after 9 months of NOTHING on this issue, that a philosophical change had occurred somewhere along the way and that Affliction Foci were really meant for all Afflictions (not just DoTs)!<br />

It was a bug that actually made sense, the same way removing str/dex from spectral returns makes sense.  Affliction haste on dots?  Practically useless.  Affliction extension on dots?  Useless for dots of short duration.  I'll admit, affliciton efficiency is still reasonably handy, but the other two are JUNK.<br />

This is the straw that broke the camels back.  I dont expect them to unnerf anything.  Frankly at this point I dont care.<br />

They did a diservice to the community with this little stunt.  I am tired of it and I choose not to be a part of a game or subscribe to a company that employs such tactics or policies.<br />
<br />
Its the same with every nerf....this is just an extreme example.  They let somthing like this go and ride the fence untill one day they decide to make up their minds.<br />
<br />
Its not fair play and its not any fun.  I quit and I am happy to be done with it.<br />
<br />
Let me remind everyone WHY they put focus items into the game in the first place.  It was for caster balance.  Melee characters were getting drops that made them far more powerfull than any ability or spell.  Caster drops before focus items were insignificant.  Focus effects were designed to fix that inbalance.<br />
<br />
Now there is no focus effect worth a dam for enchanters and arguably for Shamans.  Especially at the high end game unless you are in a top tier guild.<br />
<br />
Not to mention of course the time and effort everyone put into the items before the &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
I cry foul and I quit.  See ya in another game.<br />

Guys if this one nerf has upset you don't you think that Necro's would be more affected by this than us? <br />
- Uhm...necros have debuffs that they use on every mob? News to me! The only effect this has on necros is on their undead mez/slow/charm. This nerf/fix/whatever doesn't affect necros in the slightest compared to shamans/enchanters.<br />
<br />
Our DoT's are still useful and always will be.<br />
- DoTs are great for soloing. That's about it. When you group you can use poison DoTs ... if you want to tank also. And if you want to waste mana and efficiency use disease DoTs on mobs that die under one minute. And in boss encounters, I dare you to use one single poison DoT, not to stack them, just use ONE SINGLE or of course use disease DoTs so people laugh at your pathetic DPS.<br />
<br />
 You are whining about something that seems senseless to me. That is just my 2cp tho.<br />

Throw out the bottle of 'clueless' pills and do the 30 seconds of research it takes to know and understand the spells available to your class.<br />

So, you are saying that I have no business playing EQ without examining everything, even if it is working just like it looks like it is supposed to?

 I agree with many people that this was intended to &quot;fix&quot; the enchanter/COD issue.  The fact that this could have been fixed by omitting charm spells from the effect much the way CH is omitted from effects makes this entire thing senseless.  Why NOT have slows, mezzing etc be effected? <br />
<br />
 Even if I were high enough level to use COD, I'm not much of a charming style enchanter.  I find it outrageous that entire populations of enchanters, shamans, druids, necromancers were affected by short sightedness on VI's part. <br />

 To allow people to spend thousands of plat on items to purchase or make these once valuable items for 9 months with little if any warning of a &quot;fix&quot; shows at utter lack of caring on the part of Verant.  As I said on my site, nice to see the &quot;knee jerk&quot; reactions are alive and well. I had actually begun to think a few weeks back that those days were over. <br />
<br />
 I will not be ordering LOY. I had serious issues with PoP, and this is just too much. <br />
<br />
 Since VI does visit this board, I sincerely hope you are able to get the attention of people who can make a difference and have things made right.  Too bad they didn't have the decency to address enchanters directly in any form on any board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the people pointing out how the tagline of &quot;Hitpoints allowed&quot; should have let us know this was coming, let me give you some logic.<br />
<br />
Prior to the patch, that tagline was not there. Thus, thinking laterally here, that would mean that it was placed there by the patch two days ago. Thus it wasn't &quot;always there&quot;. Which would clue you in that no, you had no prior warning, either. Basicly, you should also be telling us that the aquatic haunt potion *never* required fish scales, because Lucy says it doesn't a day after the change.<br />
<br />
Did that sink in, or were you busy trying to gnaw the wad of dried gum off the underside of your computer desk? If so, let me reiterate.<br />
<br />
That tagline is new. Miss Cleo might have had a clue it was coming, but you're not a hefty black woman with a bad Jamaican accent. At least, I'm pretty sure you aren't, you never really know.<br />
<br />
The conclusion? Atarak, Evel, you lot are smug bottom-feeders attempting to elevate people's opinion of your mental abilities by twisting the obvious. Thankfully, the vast majority of us are capable of realizing that you're the kind of people that give mentally retarded school janitors a bad name.<br />
<br />
Please, go elsewhere to dispense your wisdom, perhaps at the Ranger board where they seem to accept any acid-brained hobo opinion of how things work. The rest of you mild-mannered Shaman... Well, keep trucking, pardon my flaming.<br />

If you want to discuss the issue, there is already a place to do it.

Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Evel and Atarak,<br />
<br />
Let me ask you something.  You two keep harping on the term &quot;damage over time&quot; which I agreed was quite clear.  No one is going to dispute with you on the definition of English words here.  We are not kindergarden kids here harping on the meaning of English words.<br />
<br />
However, let's assume everyone reading this board has some form of intelligence and can practise lateral thinking.<br />
<br />
There are two possibilities here:<br />
<br />
(1) SOE keeps using the wrong term &quot;damage over time&quot; spells when they actually meant to include malo, slow and such spells.  <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
(2) They really only intended to include &quot;DAMAGE over time&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they :<br />
<br />
(1) let it remained that manner for 9 months;<br />
(2) keep introducing new items that also behave in the same manner;<br />
(3) send out mixed signals, e.g. 19 Nov Patch<br />
<br />
which would you conclude?<br />
<br />
Do you conclude that (1) SOE devt. team is a bunch of lazy and insensitive *******s who would leave something so important unattended or that perhaps (2) they have been using the wrong term conveniently?<br />
<br />
Now we have to see whether (1) or (2) is true.<br />
<br />
Assuming if they do not want to change back the affliction foci items, perhaps they can reduce the casting time of Malos and Turgurs?<br />
<br />
For all the supposedly 'improvements' to the game, shamans are now only good for buffing and debuffing in the high end game.  Well ok, since that is what we are good at, for what's worth and for our self-worth, many of us put in lots of efforts and pp to 'enhance' our debuffing capabilities.<br />
<br />
And after 9 months of evidence, we dished out pp and time to get affliction foci items.  What do we get?<br />
<br />
In the world of adults, when there is a major dispute and both parties go to court, you think the court of law will play with words like you do?  Evidence and circumstances will still be the deciding factors.<br />
<br />
9 months, 1 expansion, many new items to support that affliction foci items should work with any detrimental spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">I consider myself very knowledgeable about the nuances of the shaman class and the game in general. I read this board and many others religiously, and I search Lucy regularly for upcoming changes.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I did not see this change coming.<br />
<br />
I recall the patch messages from last year. I remember them saying that Affliction Foci should only be for DoTs and making that change in a patch. I also remember people making some very persuasive arguements right after that change, arguing that Affliction Foci should clearly affect debuffs by their very name, and noting that debuffs had no appropriate foci after the change.<br />
<br />
I recall the change being undone in the VERY next patch. I recall people posting questions here and other places many times asking, in effect,  &quot;Is this a bug or a feature?&quot;<br />
<br />
With no response and patch after patch after patch with no change, I finally concluded that SOE had seen reason and had decided that debuffing classes should have some useful Foci.<br />
<br />
How could I possibly guess that the reality of the situation was that they left such a major bug alone for 9 months?</div></div><hr />

Atarak ... I imagine since you do research daily to keep up with the changes to your class that you are undoubtably aware of the following:<br />
<br />
1. VI actively states that using the spdat as a source of information is against their policy.<br />
<br />
2. VI has stated that the contents of the spdat file are not to be used to reflect the actual contents of the game.  They have gone so far as to place erroneous data in the spdat file to confuse people.<br />
<br />
3. The spdat &quot;interpreter&quot; you see at Lucy is simply one persons interpretation of the data contained in the spdat file.  What this means is anything you read there is the association that persons &quot;guess&quot; about what the data in the spdat file means rather than a direct association.  Granted, it is generally a pretty good interpretation but it has been wrong in the past and will be wrong in the future.<br />
<br />
4. Since you seem to be very good at interpreting the spdat file and you fully support what is stated on the Lucy site ... I have a quick question for you regarding one of my focus items ..<br />
<br />
Accursed Extension:<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Invunerability excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Min Duration(24.0 sec) <br />
7:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />

I was just wondering when they were going to enable the usage of my Accursed Extension item for all the cleric spells.  I mean clearly from slot descriptions 4 and 5 this focus item was mean to be used with healing spells coupled of course with the slot 7 description implying that spells which grant HP should be affected.<br />

- domination: lull/harm/mez/charm/blur (mind control/mind affecting - ie domination haste, efficiecy, extension etc.)<br />
<br />
And if you're worried about CoD, try making domination haste like 25 percent not 33.<br />

yeah, thats pretty clear to me, but then again, I'm not the one trying to make weak arguements about how just because they didn't fix it for 9 months I should expect it never to be fixed. Or how I'm going to quit EQ over whats really a pretty minor change.<br />

And no, I don't do quantum mechanics, I do WAN/LAN engineering, if you'd like a pretty decent explination of how BGP works, I'm your guy, if you want to know how neutrinos exist, ask Stephen Hawking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much at all yet but with the Enchanters doing the same thing and some adds from other classes, we could make it close to $10k loss.  That might get their attention.  <br />
<br />
Question is, how much will it actually take to get someone to question the nerf?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Now isn't that a shame, how will we all get by now that wanko has quit for the 20th time. Gimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
At least he is trying to do something that helps the entire shaman class. When was the last your uber-highness did that?</div></div><hr />

Quitting, is, obviously, the way to go to help the class, yessirree, boy, that'll show em, they should be cowering in their shoes any moment now and come running pleading with you all to please stay and boy are we so sorry we ever had the audacity to fix broken focus objects.<br />
<br />
I said it before, and I'll say it again:<br />
<br />
wankers.<br />

Come down off your little pity fest and get on with life, at this point I'd almost be ashamed of Sony if they gave in and adjusted the focus items, just because it'd be giving in to you whiney muttonheads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Lind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">Shame on SOE!  Turgur's and Malos were barely holding up to start with, these spells needed to be made cheaper and faster, even with my far greater manaregen and larger manapool I can't compensate anymore for how bad these spells are without the affliction foci.  I really can't see casting Turgur's ever again without my AE/H4 items working on it, sure with SCM3 and a solusek item it costs a fraction of what it used to and with a mage ring and cleric buff it casts faster than it ever used to and my manaregen is so high now I don't even have to bother with cani anymore anyway, and I get far far more XP per mob I cast it on than ever before too, but lets face it, Malos and Turgur's are useless without the affliction focus working on them!  Clearly underpowered and in desperate need of even further boosting!<br />
 <br />
  How about you just cancel LoY because it sucks and they should give you features like the extra bank space and better UI because you pay them a monthly fee.  Packageing it with some other unrelated material to force you to pay them extra is pretty damn low.</div></div><hr />

Sure let me pull both of those outta my back pocket. I can at some point get SCM3. I will never ever be able to get a solusek item, doubt most people in the game ever will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Just cancelled my preorder.<br />
<br />
After the patch, I was confused at my circlet of the falinkan (hard work questing - 33% spell haste on afflicions, woot) not functioning on slows, malosini, malo, cripple.. all the spells I use as a grouping shaman....<br />
<br />
I have hardly played since the bug was introduced, waiting for it to be fixed.....<br />
<br />
Played a bit again, was appalled by all my usefull spells now taking an extra 33% of time to cast. All the fun in playing my shaman was lost there and then.<br />
<br />
So, I /bug reported it... Waited 2 patches... Nothing changed... Re-read the patch messages, found nothing.<br />
<br />
Petitioned and asked for clarification. Was told to /bug it or report it on the bug address found on the everquest.com website. Did.<br />
<br />
Nother patch. Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Then I read this board and find the reason for all this. Something they &quot;didnt fix&quot; NINE MONTHS AGO? What the hell? My shaman wasn't even IN EXISTENCE back then. I made a hell of a lot of gear decisions, and many of them were affliction focus related. All useless now. WHAT WILL THEY NERF NEXT???<br />
<br />
Grouping shamans are shafted.<br />

Wish I'd had a chance to try the AH items. I REALLY enjoyed my EA bracer. The 4 hours I spent questing it isn't much of a loss. But if you add that to the hundreds of hours of timesinking I've invested over the years only to get shafted by poor customer service or pisspoor game design or abysmally poor code... I've just had enough.</div></div><hr />
