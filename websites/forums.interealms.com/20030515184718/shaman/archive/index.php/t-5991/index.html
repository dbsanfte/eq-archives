I was thinking an Earring of Twisted Leaves, and not sure about new legs. How hard would it be to get Thurg legs at 49? Like would anyone even need me? Any other improvements would be apprceciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No offense, but you COULD NOT have picked a worse possible name for this thread. I (Maybe some others as well) dislike equipment help threads where people just ask for general help. BTW, Jinheim, wheres that search buttom pick?<br />
<br />
**The search button is your friend**<br />
<br />
It's late, I'll help you with this thread tomorrow, but please (for future referense) don't be so general about item upgrades. Pick a certain slot and do a little research. I'm glad to help those who first help themselves :).<br />
<br />
Sorry about rambling, it's late and I'm pooped :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice gear for a lvl 49.  Esp the JBB and JBBP. :)<br />
<br />
Buy a pair of Engraved Velium Leggings, and some sort of CT earring.  Do the POTC quest.<br />
<br />
And search the forums. Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where can I pick up that polished mithril mask?  That thing looks dope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 things...<br />
<br />
1.I think you should look at upgrades in:<br />
   a.REIF<br />
   b.Neck PIece...Imbued Ivory Collar?<br />
   c.Face...Crystal Spider eyes?<br />
   d.Cloak...Northman Imbued?<br />
<br />
and 2....<br />
For God Sakes...if you're going to open up his post, and all other equipment posts Garf, don't negatively comment...I'm SOOOOO<br />
tired of having this community bash people for asking a question. WHO CARES if it's been asked a million times. There are so few brand new topics/questions being asked, yet people comment all the time. <br />
<br />
GIVE EQUIPMENT POSTS A BREAK. I do use the SEARCH function, as well as others here I'm sure...a lot of time, the items there are OUT of range...WAY out of range. That's why people ask what they can upgrade...Not &quot;What's the best equipment I should get&quot; but rather &quot;What should I upgrade?&quot; He's asking for improvements to his profile...as little help...a few ideas. Having someone suggest a few items would take far less time than weeding through other posts JUST LIKE THIS ONE where there's an S-LOAD of complaining about how you should use the search button...BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH...<br />
<br />
HELP. That's all we're askin' for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ribak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent a lot of time researching gear recently as I needed to sort out my own shamans' things.  There are many good posts on this forum but nothing worked better than actually sitting down in the bazaar and comparing gear/prices/what people recommended to see what was actually worth buying.  There are a couple of great pieces out there that I don't see mentioned very often and hence I managed to pick them up pretty cheaply.  All in all I would suggest :<br />
<br />
Belt : Chitinous belt (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28728) - I managed to pick one of these up for 700pp which considering the stat increase over the turmoil skin belt was pretty good.<br />
<br />
Legs : Brown chitin leggings (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28729) - You lose 1 point of AC versus the Rygorr legs but you gain +25HP, +25 mana and +4 wisdom which is worthy trade off to my mind.<br />
<br />
Hands : Shissar scaled gauntlets (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=6428) - Losing 2 points of AC this time for +40HP, +40 mana and +5 wisdom.  Again a worthy tradeoff imo.  Prior to these I was wearing crystal chitin gauntlets (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25290) so in my own swap I took an 8 point hit on AC for the HP, mana and wisdom.  I considered that in my mid 20s the stats would be more useful than the raw AC though as 40HP was 2-3 hits :)<br />
<br />
Fingers : Shadel bandit ring (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28708) - This is basically an upgraded version of the staple velium fire wedding ring.  Same AC, 10 less HP for the sake of 55 more mana and Summoning haste III.  I've seen them for sale on AB at around 1.5k-2k so they are somewhat more pricey but well worth it imo.<br />
<br />
Face : Crystal spider eyes (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25282) - As suggested above these are pretty much standard for this slot now going by other peoples magelos that I saw.  You can't argue with +hp and +mana along with some wisdom.<br />
<br />
Neck : Ivory imbued collar (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=3099) - These are insanely cheap at the moment and very good for the money.  I've regularly seen multiple versions of them for sale at the same time and so the competition has been pushing the price down drastically as everyone tried to undercut each other.  Got mine for 200pp I think.<br />
<br />
Ear : Earring of twisted leaves (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=5813) or Earring of the solstice (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28771) - The twisted leaves is a minor upgrade to the ones you have at the moment but it does have a right click scale of the wolf that works at level 50 so should be quite useful for you.  Got mine for something like 750pp, not sure if that was too much although the price has gone back up to ~1500pp since then it seems.  Earring of the solstice full multi-quest kits go for 10k (eek) so this is a bit pricey for one slot but extremely nice :)<br />
<br />
Weapon : REIF (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25059) - This would let you put the howling harpoon in the ranged slot as well as being a damn good weapon in its own right.  Procs at level 35 I understand so it would be great for you prior to the epic.<br />
<br />
I've yet to find decent upgrades for the head and arms that don't cost the earth unfortunately.  Jaundiced bone seems to do the trick for helping the raw AC that you lose in other slots when looking for other stats so I'm content with that in mine for the time being.  Perhaps other people will be able to suggest something there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Polished Mithril Mask drops off Magus fire giant in SolB if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Epic for main, Artificers cloak is nice though pricey, Gladiator legs often go to twinks on arena raids you might be able to blagg your way onto a raid for faction and the legs, Iksar BP or ideally Fungi, Ob Death shroud,  coldain gloves or the ones from VL, not sure on bracer but must be better than RMB, Ivory imbued collar or even the one from mino elder, do the totemic helm quest till thurg head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, thanks for the replies. Sorry bout this, but I haven't played in 2 months, and not sure what upgrades i really needed. But thanks to the people who helped.<br />
<br />
First, collar, i have one in the bank, i used it for resists, ill swap it out if its better then.<br />
Im a troll, no imbued northmans/artficiers for me. <br />
The JBBP went from a week of hard work.(I got a white dragon pelt from vox, went through a week of faction work, and then i traded cloak for RBB and RBB for JBBP) And JBB took me from 34-46 to save up for.<br />
Im thinking that my legs are 1st priorty? Cause Rygorr is kinda bad imo. Should i shot for gladitor? Or just buy some brown chiten?<br />
Ive been looking for a Earring of Twisted Leaves, but haven't seen any being sold. And PotC Ill do in a couple of levels once i get the rest of my gear worked out.<br />
And yes, polished mith mask frops in SolB off of Magus. I don't nuke much, cept with JBB, so Ill probably get spider eyes.<br />
The rest, ill probably be making those changes over then next couple of weeks (seafuries=good money :D).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mask, I would do Elysian Deathmask<br />
Head, Barbed Rubicite coif is awesome - if you need more wiz go with Wyvern Hide. They are cheap enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry about not responding like I said I would :(. My mother got pnemonia(sp) and I was at the hospital till 4 in the morning. I just got up and I'm glad to see you've already got help from the elders :).</div></div><hr />

Wow!  What server are you on?  I wrote all these down to see if I could get any of them  when I got home as I now have ~1k pp, more than I have ever had:) .  All of this stuff is 3-5 times more on my server than on yours, apparently.  The ring alone was 5K pp.  Fascinating how prices vary from server to server.</div></div><hr />
