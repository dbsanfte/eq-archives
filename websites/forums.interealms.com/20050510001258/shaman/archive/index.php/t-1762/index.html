<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>innerrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ive got a lvl 54 monk and just bought another account to start a shaman to plvl up to lvl 54 so i can dual-comp em. I have access to lvl 60 paladin, a lvl 52 bard, and the lvl 54 monk(can only play 2 of them + the shaman at the same time tho), and am wondering if anyone has ever powerleveled a shaman before, and where they did it and what methods they used.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">have a melee class (your monk) beat the crap out of it down to a sliver, then mem blur / mez it with your chanter, then have your shaman nuke it to get full exp.  Not sure, but I think chanter mem blur could possibly be substituted with a cleric w/ atone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suppose if you really want to PL.... um... you will REALLY miss out on learning a shaman. Much like enchanters, we have MANY spells, and really, much to learn as far as tactics. PL'ing a shaman is not recommended, but if you MUST, just use your monk to beat down a red creature, FD, and finish. <br />
<br />
Be warned, you need to max that defense, as well as offense and any weapon skills you feel you need to use (most would just say *all of them*)<br />
<br />
Leveling a shaman without PL'ing is fairly quick *anyway*, I have around 120 levels worth myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ooo FD... I betcha that works...  Sounds too perfect for PLing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When using a monk to PL you would have to FD before the mob turned to run.  If you don't FD before the critter runs the Shammy wont get the exp.</div></div><hr />
