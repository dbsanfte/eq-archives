<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I the only one that is slightly confused by peoples response to this?  Most of the threads were people almost foaming at the mouth with curses and crying because there was new armor, but wouldnt be there long.  <br />
<br />
The new stuff is hardly different from the current top end (1492 point) armors availible, save that they were availible at all the camps.  While they will be patched out soon, you can still get them (I suppose) and yet people would rather bitch and complain about the mistake than running to get them while they can.  <br />
<br />
Silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think its fairly obvious that all SOE is doing here is removing the extreme time-sink of having to max &quot;credit&quot; in specific camps to gear up, thus shortening the overall time required to obtain decent gear via LDoN. This will help a lot of people once it goes live. I am sure its somehting that will be added in-between now and OoW as &quot;something positive to do&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The stats are slightly different ... I believe the chain bracer, for example, has extra strength, agility and dexterity as opposed to the Incorporeal bracer. No HP in the difference, to my knowledge, but better stats for the Rangers and Rogues of the world (heh, my guild leader purchased the Incorporeal bracer the night before ... and then saw the Rage bracer, lol, he was not a happy camper). Someone told me last night this was a response to the outcry over all the +CHA on the LDON equipment. True or no, I can't say as though I'm really interested in most of the new armor. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In his next post in that thread he says they'll be available again after they're finalized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nothing ever goes away in EQ.  Remember when they introduced those &quot;temporary&quot; zones, Sol C and Chardok B??  They're still up and running!  I wouldnt worry about them changing this, the armor will be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In case anyone missed it, one of the posts by an SoE developer/CSR said they are pulling these from the vendors with the next update and stats may change when they go live...so, I'd be wary of buying them now  ;)  (if they are even still there.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think this would be a good thing...if they are available in all zones.  I think they could keep the current top end stuff, but make it available in all zones.  We are lucky.  EF is really easy to get groups in.  I'm trying to outfit my monk and it is like pulling teeth to get anyone to there to get his leather armour.  From what I have seen, EF, EC and Nro are the easiest by far for me to get groups in.  Maybe it is different on different servers, but the leather one is the hardest by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok let me just verfy this, you need to have 1492 (or whatever) in at least one camp in order to see these items, but because they are nonspecific you can buy them even if you already spent points from that camp.<br />
e.g. I earn a buttload of points in Miraguls for armor and spend it on the BP, I now have 50 points left in Mira but my total points is say 3000 combined from all camps. I could spend my points on this new armor til I was broke? (or at least didnt have enough to buy anymore?)<br />
thats how it looks to me just want to be sure. my Chanter has 800ish points total, so I really dont know how this is working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Something Sony never thought about...<br />
<br />
The caster top end stuff is in BB.  The chain in EF.  The plate in Tak/Nro.  People want to do adventures in the zones where their armor is at, and are reluctant to do them in others, unless there's something there they want.<br />
<br />
Couldn't they see that all this would do is divide people up so they don't want to group or do adventures in zones that don't benefit them?  Why can't they just have the damn stuff require a certain # of adventure points REGARDLESS of where you do them?<br />
<br />
That would make the most sense.  Obviously more than Sony has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok let me just verfy this, you need to have 1492 (or whatever) in at least one camp in order to see these items, but because they are nonspecific you can buy them even if you already spent points from that camp.<br />

<br />
That's the way I understand it.  HOWEVER - SoE has already stated they may change the armor when it is officially released.  So, you may spend 1492 points on something that becomes crap in a few months when OoW goes live...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok let me just verfy this, you need to have 1492 (or whatever) in at least one camp in order to see these items, but because they are nonspecific you can buy them even if you already spent points from that camp.<br />

<br />
OK back to basic LDoN 101 - Points are points. It does not matter where you earn them, you may spend them anywhere. Points are points. <br />
<br />
Buying power at the various camps is based on the amount of points EARNED at that specific camp. However, the points themselves may be earned anywhere. <br />
<br />
Example: You do 30 runs in EF and have 1500 points and Buying Power. You spend it all in EF on a BP. Then you go to N Ro and do 30 runs, now you hav 1500 points and 1500 buying power in EF and N Ro. You may now use those points to go back to EF and buy something, or buy something in N Ro. You do not need to spend the points you earn at the camp you earned them. Points are points.<br />
<br />
Now that we have this explained, what this new stuff is basically doing is making armor ~= to the &quot;top&quot; (for shaman, EF, plate, N Ro, etc) in other camps. Therefore, I dont have to get 1500 &quot;buying power&quot; in EF to buy top armor, I can buy it in EC since I have more than enough &quot;buying power&quot; there already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This should have been done 6 months ago. LDON brought a lot of people back but then some gave up once it became clear about the time sink of trying to get points in less popular themes.</div></div><hr />

Hang on a minute. Whoa there<br />
<br />
You could do the above in the old system!<br />
<br />
Once you have earned, say, 1492 points in Miraguls, and purchased your shiny new Incorporeal greaves of the Spectre, you could then spend your points from all the other themes on Miragul specific armor - you dont have to earn another 1492 points in Miraguls all over again. Once you have &quot;opened&quot; that theme, all theme points can be used in it. <br />
<br />
It is rather a common misconception that you have to use Gukta points to but Gukta gear, Tak points for Tak gear, etc. If you believe that, it is easy to get frustrated by earning points in &quot;useless&quot; themes, but once you realise that this is not the case, any LDoN is a good LDoN!<br />
<br />
I currently have 2 pieces of Incorporeal &amp; 2 Dark Mire. Alost up to getting Aug3 piece for BP - FT2 or Regen5 - oooh; decisions decisions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unless you really really want a piece of gear from Miragul. In order to buy it, you do need to earn the &quot;buying power&quot; from Miragul. If all your friends would prefer Takish or MM, you'll never be able to buy your Miragul gear, no matter how many points you earn in Takish or MM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted Gloriana, but what sort of &quot;friends&quot; are they if they do not acknowledge that you are helping them, so they should also help you? Personally, I have opened the dungeons I really need so I make a point of asking my real friends what dungeons they need, so if I win the /random 500 to choose the theme, I will pick their preference. I know that they did the same for me when I needed 2 or 3 more wins in Miraguls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That is the point, once you unlock your zone, you can adventure anywhere.  The problem is unlocking it.  I have 1500+ in EF and in EC, so I'm pretty much set for the stuff i want.  I can adventure anywhere, just need points.  For my monk though, he only has ~800 points in lguk but has 1800 points total.  He can't buy his good monk armour yet because he still has to grind out another 700 points there.  That is the problem, nobody wants to go there..and I don't blame them.<br />
<br />
One other problem is that not all zones are the same.  Some are inherently easier than others..and faster.  So if the open up all the stuff for all zones, then a few zones will have EVERYONE and nobody will do lguk and so sony feels sad...booooohhoooooo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anybody know how many wins to max out all the themes?<br />
<br />
I am 74-0 in EC (Max) and 78-2 in NRO (77 Maxes).<br />
<br />
EC is by FAR the easiest IMO and if you're looking to do a hard - this is the place to cut your teeth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">[QUOTE='Faern']Anybody know how many wins to max out all the themes?[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Ruj - 76 wins <br />
Takish - 78 wins <br />
Guk - 72 wins <br />
Miraguls - 68 wins <br />
Mistmoore - 76 wins <br />
<br />
Not my numbers, heh, just crossed from a link on my guild boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sounds like an intentional &quot;goof&quot; to keep people interested.  Kind of like sampling out unreleased products into the marketplace in order to drum up enthusiasm for your entire product line.  The company I work for has done this with liquor for years to great effect. :p<br />
<br />
I would honestly watch for more things of this nature with the pushback of the expansion.</div></div><hr />
