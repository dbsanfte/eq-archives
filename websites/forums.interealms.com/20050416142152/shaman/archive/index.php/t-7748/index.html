<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anytime I try to log on my main now, I get booted to server select screen, right at the point where I should be loading up into zone ready to play.<br />
<br />
  Zone is Plane of Disease.  I have tried repatching the files after deleting them, and even uninstalled/reinstalled PoP completely.<br />
<br />
  I can log in other characters perfectly fine, so it is not a UI problem, since my Bazaar mule is using the same UI (though not the same windows up).<br />
<br />
  I was running around just fine with my Main, but when I zoned into PoDisease, I was booted.  Since then I have been unable to log him in at all.<br />
<br />
  Oddly enough, same thing is happening to my roomate, but I know the zone isn't down since people are in there when I /who all to check.<br />
<br />
<br />
  So far, GMs have been totally worthless for help.   Have petitioned and sent e-mail.  Gotten a few guides to respond so far, and &quot;escalate&quot; my petition.   It is still in the queue, and the one night I was told 2 GMs were working the lines and I should be handled within 30 minutes, I was left dry for 4 hours....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyone have any further clues on what more I can do?   Main toon is really the only one for me, I don't care for alts one bit :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just to make sure... all your toons use the SAME UI as a default?<br />
<br />
I have a tweaked one for my shaman, then default for the rest.  Have you tried logging in to that account from a different computer?<br />
<br />
Don't know what else to try.  Its likely to be a server problem (ie in Verants hands), but I'd try the above just to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, change the GUI to &quot;default&quot; in your .ini file, just to be sure. <br />
<br />
You can try going into chat and asking a GM for help there as well. They might be able to give you a world kick if the problem is on their end.</div></div><hr />
