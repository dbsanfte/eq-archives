<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greymane shadowbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at level 27 at the moment with 190 wis.  With canni I am now thinking of switching to HP/AC items.  Should I start now or wait a few more levels?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i started at 24 =-)<br />
<br />
at 29 it really becomes a good idea to switch over, cause we get a pretty decent slow, and haste, so you can work on melee skills and defense =-)<br />
<br />
before that level it doesnt make much a difference, youll be root-rotting mainly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should be AC/HP as early as possible to max defense and because the mana-to-wis ratio is ludicrous at the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greymane shadowbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am normally grouped with a monk and we keep Defense maxed each level.  In this case should I still switch to AC/HP?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, if your twinking you shouldnt really AC/HP from the getgo, cause if your ac is 200+ at level 5, then nothing is gonna touch you...<br />
<br />
I had a friend who had to delete his old war for some reason, restarted, put all his stuff on the new one, and at lvl 9, max offense, 16 defense...not good for a warrior ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oops I mean Wis-to-Mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd suggest at 39.  Thats when you get the new L39 slow, which when combined w/ high AC lets you tank mobs while your poison/disease/puppy kills it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Switch now.  190 wis is doing exactly nothing for you, whereas the extra ac and hp you would get by swapping out all the druid gear will markedly enhance your (and your monk friends) survivability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">190 wis is doing something... It's helping him gain most skills, especially the casting skills helluva lot faster. It doesn't give too much mana though. I'd advice switching now too. But don't overdo it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think once you have regen and canna you should switch.  More HP for more canna potential.  More AC to get beat on less.  Less wisdom isn't a big deal because you make your own mana.<br />
<br />
A side note:<br />
<br />
Good place to catch up defense if it has fallen behind is in Echo Caverns.  Go at 30th and solo Needlites.  They will be dark blue to you (light at 31) and smack so fast, even when slowed you will see your defense shoot up.  Make sure you slow them to pull tho, they hit fast, tho not really hard.  Probably the fastest swinging mob I've seen.  (At that level that is)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go all AC/hps, you will lack in the caster aspect, having more fizzles, less skill ups, and a small mana pool that might limit your effectiveness for some situations.  You might get a rep as a bad shaman who doesn't even have the mana for a larger than normal fight.  <br />
<br />
If you go all wis you will turn yourself into an int caster with no snare and spells that are slower casting than any other caster in the game.  Basically you might as well reroll as an enchanter with fast spells that do more if you're going to play that way.  People won't comment so much when you die in 3 seconds if you're an enchanter.  They will if you're a shaman tho, and you'll get a reputation for being a pansy.  <br />
Not only this, but at lvl 30 mobs get another level of difficulty.  They hit harder, you need about 700 ac to negate a lvl 30 mob's attacks.  <br />
<br />
I better give my guide to levels and AC again.  Reminder: these numbers are based on the amount of AC you need to avoid or reduce the majority of a mob's attacks against you, in effect buying yourself more time to either avoid the mob or kill it.  <br />
<br />
lvl 30 mobs = 700 ac.<br />
lvl 35 mobs = 750-800 ac.<br />
lvl 40 mobs = 850 ac<br />
lvl 45 mobs = 950 ac.<br />
lvl 50 mobs = 1000-1100 ac. <br />
lvl 55 mobs = 1200 ac<br />
<br />
If you can come reasonably close to those ac numbers for the level of mob you are fighting, you will notice a large difference in how often and how hard they hit you.  Keep in mind that the levels given are MOB LEVELS and not player levels.  I was hunting mostly lvl 35 critters when I was lvl 35-40.  I was hunting lvl 40 critters when I was 45-50.  I've been hunting lvl 45 critters from lvl 51 to level 60.  Of course there were a few lvl 50 critters in there, and still are more than ever really.  So that's why people say if you can get to 1000-1100 ac, you are set for general hunting.  It's cause normal exp mobs are nicely foiled by that level of AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone have any hard numbers on the relationship between wisdom and fizzle rate?  I would hypothesize that it is based only on your casting skill and/or level and not on your Wisdom.  Skillups on casting disciples are definitely affected, but I have doubts about fizzles.<br />
<br />
Yes, I *am* too lazy to test this myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you go all AC/hps, you will lack in the caster aspect, having more fizzles, less skill ups, and a small mana pool that might limit your effectiveness for some situations.  <br />
<br />
I just wanted to comment that I went the AC/HP route from level one. My Wisdom is currently at 110. I have never had any difficulty keeping all of my casting and melee skills maxed at each level and I rarely fizzle. Casting spells go up very fast regardless of your wisdom (they may go up faster with a higher wis - but what's the point? Sit and chain cast spells if you are worried about your skill level). <br />
<br />
As for the mana pool, I rarely go OOM - and each time I did it was in an over-pull situation. If you are smart with your mana, and fight mobs appropriate to your capabilities, you will rarely go OOM.<br />
<br />
More AC = less chance of getting hit and you will get hit. Our slows generate a lot of aggro and it is nice to see a mob missing more often than hitting. The hitpoints are a nice cushion that allow you to absorb some damage and (once you get canni) quickly replenish your mana bar.<br />
<br />
I just don't see the value in wisdom, unless you are going to do a tradeskill :) , but that is ME.<br />
<br />
Everyone has their own opinions on this - my advice is play around with your equipment and see which route serves YOU better. You may enjoy being a caster with 250 wisdom OR you may like standing toe-to-toe with a mob taking hits like a tank OR you might end up somewhere in between. Good equipment is cheap enough nowadays that you can afford the luxury of tinkering with your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm trying to remember the specifics . . . it was an article on castersrealm a while back . . prolly 8 months I'm guessing.  <br />
There was a base amount of fizzles modified by casting skill and the greater of int or wis.  But wis by itself couldn't account for the fizzles.  It was like partially responsible for it.  The greater component was the casting skill and level of the spell and such.  But wiz/int played a very definite role according to a formula I've forgotten.  It was fairly simple tho.  bleh.<br />
<br />
sometime when you're naked try casting a bunch of spells, the highest level spell you can cast over and over . . perhaps acumen would work.  I know I experience far more fizzles when I'm naked than when I'm clothed.  <br />
<br />
Still, shaman is one of the only class I know of that can easily solo a blue con while naked.  If a necro had bone chips I'd say they could do that too.   And get it dead in under 3 minutes. <br />
I did that unbuffed once too just for ****s and giggles.  That made it a bit harder tho.</div></div><hr />

190 wis is doing something... It's helping him gain most skills, especially the casting skills helluva lot faster. It doesn't give too much mana though. I'd advice switching now too. But don't overdo it... <br />
<br />
So he's maxing Alteration 1/3rd of the way through the level instead of 3/4 of the way through?  C'mon, there is no way that raising casting skills faster or an extra 200 mana is anywhere near as valuable as the extra ac he's giving up.  We're talking 600 ac vs 800, not 1300 vs 1500...<br />
<br />
On a related note, I don't think it's possible to overdo ac at 27 unless you have a sugar-daddy main or very, very generous friends.</div></div><hr />
