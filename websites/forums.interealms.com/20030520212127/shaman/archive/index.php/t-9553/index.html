<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yoshy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So Ive decided to start a shammy, to mess around with when my Monk gets boring, Ive decided on a Barbarian, and Put the points into Sta and Wis making him have 105 of each, I figure that sounds good but if I should change that let me know.  Im going to play him to around mabey 20ish without twinking or PL to somewhat get a feel for the class and let him get his skills, then Im going to give him 5k to spend, what would yall reccomend me getting for him with that, not including a BP(he will use my monks fungi) Im on prexus server if it matters.<br />
My final question would be concerning what stats to go for, AC, HP and Wis ar the mains i assume, so should I do my best to max out my wis, or do like say a necro and have decent wis but go more for hps and not worry about having maxed wis.  <br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go for the latter - more hp.  Shaman and necros can always turn hp into mana, plus, the more hp you have, the longer you survive.  The only times I really come close to having problems with mana is when I have to buff a whole lot of people at once.  But, during the raids when I'm debuffing or just in exp groups, mana is no problem whatsoever.<br />
<br />
As far as equipment is concerned, 5k isn't a whole lot to spend if you want to get some nice gear all around.  One thing that comes to mind, though, are some velium fire wedding rings, or even a shadel bandit ring which has a nice blend of hp/AC/mana/resists.  At any level, however, hp are the way to go, so concentrate more on gear that has that, or a nice mixture between hp and wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Without twinking, you'll be short of mana for those early levels, don't get frustrated.  Wisdom is the least important of those three stats, I've made it to 60 and my wis is only 153 and has never been higher.  Playing your shaman to lvl 20 won't give him much a feel, he's a average healer and his buffs don't do much, it's not until 40s and early 50s that you really appreciate the power of slow (even though your main is quite aware of the difference).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yoshy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So I guess I will reroll him and put the points into stamina instead, I wasnt looking to make him have the best equipment, I figure the fungi would be enough, im gunna try and do some noob quest mabey some of the totemic parts(only the good ones) so I will see what happens.....What weapon should I get him, I was thinking like Spine Chill Spear or something for starters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would rerole and put the points into wisdom.  When wisdom is maxed then I would go stamina.<br />
<br />
You do need to get your wisdom into the 120 160 range to have a comfortable mana resurve and if your base wisdom is higher it gives you more options on which equipment to select.<br />
<br />
Only at the extreem upper end of the game will you run into a problem where wisdom is dripping from all your armor and you you have still not maxed our stamina.<br />
<br />
If you start with a good base wisdom then the journey is not so hard even if you are 0.001 % less then optimal when you get to the end.<br />
<br />
HP is not the be all and end all at lower levels.  At level 24 you get the first of the canni spells wich allows you to convert hp into mana at about a 2 to 1 ratio so you can think of half your health as a mana reserve.<br />
<br />
At lower level...  pre cann V...  ac &gt; hp == wis.   Haveing a high ac will do you a lot more good then having a large health pool without little protection.<br />
<br />
How eficient you are will depend on damage mitigation / avoidance and mana and health regen rate.  The size of either the health or mana pool has zero impact on efficancy,  only on safty.  With a fungi you health regen will be fantastic.<br />
<br />
Frankly,  I see no reason not to spend the 5k if you are going to twink with a fungy.  If you want to know haw a shaman feels at low levels then forget the tunic...  it will distort the experiance in a far greater way then any 5k worth of other gear so you will not acheive your stated goal.<br />
<br />
Also,  If you love a shaman then the low levels are fun....  else it is a trial.<br />
<br />
With your resourses I would have my shaman consentrate on mele skills.  I keep 1hb, 2hb and pierce all maxed and make sure that both defense and offense are maxed each level.  That is what I would do anyway, but a lot of people neglect this aspect of the shaman.  Casting skills can be raised at will by simply meming spells of the apropriate type and casting over and over again to gain skill ups.   Boring but very duable and safe.<br />
<br />
5k gear...  <br />
<br />
6 ac / 65 hp rings<br />
lots of Jaundiced Bone armor for the ac... hands, arms, boots, helm.<br />
black saphire electrum ears.<br />
<br />
lots of items with good ac then hp or mana or wis or stam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
