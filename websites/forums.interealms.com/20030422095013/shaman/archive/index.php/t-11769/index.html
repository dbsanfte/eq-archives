<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which is overall better to have? I currently wear the Hierophant's Cloak and I like the nice HP and Mana stats. I have an EB item already, but the AC &amp; resists on the Lodizal Shell Shield are nice. I'm thinking of getting the Lodizal Shell Shield...but should I just keep the Heiro Cloak? <br />

IMO at least, tough to beat 75hp/75mana with stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Both are very nice. In order to state the obvious, I will list the advantages of both :)<br />
<br />
Lodi - Great WIS boost, great resists, good AC, EB.<br />
<br />
Heiro - Awesome pure HP boost, mana too - some nice stat adds.<br />
<br />
For you it is a tough choice - you have plenty of HP and mana items already, and either one would compliment your gear well.<br />
<br />
Personally though, I would go for the Lodizal shell...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hiero, hands down IMO.  Especially since it looks like you already have one.  It's nice to have a good enduring breath item (instead of swapping in a statless earring/necklace), but not worth giving up almost 90 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have neither but am fased with the same choice.  I am thinking I will go LSS because of the Resists and ac and effect but I could realy use the hp boost.  I will be replacing a 20ac 40hp back slot item and that is going to hurt but the resists will help me quite a bit in HoT and I dont have an EB item.  Also I hate the poor ac on the hero cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll suggest a cheaper alternative. Wire Meshed Drapes sell for 5k-8k on Rodcet Nife. It has the same wis/hps/mana as a hierophant but 4 less ac along with 1-2 missing stats (str or dex maybe.. whatever it is you wont miss it). It has +15pr/cr over the hiero which doesn't have saves at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, hiero/wire mesh is hands down better than lodi.  Only time I use lodi is for tradeskilling, to raise my wis, and in rare cases when I absolutely need the saves.  Since wire mesh is about 5-10k cheaper plus has the same important stats as hiero(less ac, more resist), I'd go wire mesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the Lodizal Shell Shield in my back slot, and think it will remain there for now.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cloak is better than shield for day to day stuff.  Shield is better for mobs that AoE.  I still use the shield in my back slot until I can get a good upgrade.  Cloak is out of my price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hoeju</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I swapped out my Lodi for a Hiero a few months ago and never looked back.  I just recently sold the Lodi because I just wasn't swapping it back in that much anymore.  Lodizal shields are extremely overrated at 65 especially considering it has no pure mana or hps.  I barely use resist gear any more.  Swapping in a Stone of Moridd or something seems to get the job done now that resist buffs are so much better and Bards have such nice songs.<br />
<br />
Hiero all the way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the advice and suggestions.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to stay with Heiro for now.<br />
If I happen to kill Lodizal one day then I'll get the Shield and use it for resists &amp; Enduring Breath when appropriate. <br />
<br />
First I've heard of Wire Mesh. I'll check it out as well. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
