<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I have my tear and just want to kill Rak since its hard for me to get together raids for my shaman epic right now with PoP and other regular guild stuff going on. Im done with epic right up to high scale kirn part so if im correct I would be skipping kirns ring and Nehs diary right?<br />
<br />
So what should I bring my TS faction to in order to get this done? I have heard rumors that you can have too much faction and that can ruin the quest. I was just going to do the woe/eny part until i maxxed out. How much faction do i actually need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you cannot have too much faction. max it and then do the tear. You will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had ally long before I should, and the quest still worked for me fine.<br />
<br />
Just do a bunch of extra ghiosk book turn ins, some woe &amp; envy &amp; marr's promise turn ins, and some starter gem turn ins, until you get maximum - and I do mean maximum - ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok Kirn just ate my icon and i did the whole deal all proper like!  So if indeed maxing out faction works I'll go that route.  If they want us to play the game 'as intended' they should make sure it works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sorry to hear you lost your icon.<br />
<br />
Did you kill anything on truespirit faction previously? Or help... is it sk or necros who give a bad truespirit hit if you help them with their epics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, so let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
If you get max faction you can skip the Kirn and Neh fights?<br />
<br />
So all I need is the Iksar child's tear and Ally, then do turn in for Rak, kill him, take scale to spirit and SoF is mine?<br />
<br />
Just checking because my guild isnt exactly uber and any ease that can taken on this quest would be nice.  I'm still gonna have to hit fear everyweek for 6months probably though.  btw, how long it take most you to get your tear?  <br />
<br />
Yea, I know I asked alot of questions.  I'm a troll, forgive me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, at least of the start of October, you could skip Kirn and Neh. No, it's not recommended. It may be fixed at any time and if you have problems and complain, you'll be SoL.<br />
<br />
Yes, all you need is MAX ally, the tear, kill rak, turn in scale.<br />
<br />
If your guild can do fear, they can do the hole. Really. Honest. The hole is just a long grind down, depending on how cautious your pullers are. I've done the hole six times in the past two months, and yeah, it's boring, but it's not that deadly. <br />
<br />
As for Fear, you've got the following issues:<br />
<br />
1) whether your guild kills on the same cycle as the golems are on (IE, 3 days after they were killed last)<br />
2) how many other shamans want the tear<br />
3) how many other guilds are camping fear.<br />
<br />
With PoP out, your chances of getting fear to yourself are much better nowadays. Hitting it &quot;everyweek&quot; for 6 months isn't the answer.... it's strategy. Find out when fright dread and terror went down last, count 3 days, go then. Otherwise you'll just be doing fear raids with no golems. Or plan to go on the night after a patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not so sure fear will be that available once people in the 60+ guilds get around to wanting some cash/gems.  Fear and Hate may become ultra-high-level farm zones.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if the farming guild is willing to let you loot, that could turn to your advantage, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But is farming hate and fear really worth it? The xp isn't really there, the gems drop is better in Seb, and the armour in fear and hate is only good for turning in for a sliver of xp.<br />
<br />
Although I agree with Twoflower - sometimes the best strategy is to ask, when you see another guild in fear, if they need the tear and if the golems are up. That's how I got mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hole part was one of the most fun parts of the epic I have done so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea you can skip those parts if you want to... Then you will lose your scale when you try to turn in... Then you can cry about how the quest is bugged and petition and maybe get your tear back... Or you can just do it right the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fear isnt worth camping for gems at all, there are far better and easier spots that give much better cash loot.</div></div><hr />
