<br />
I'm re-organizing my spellbook from it's current aplha order and am taking suggestions for a new method. So, how do you have your spellbook organized?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About 100 threads around on this if you search =P<br />
<br />
That said, I generally only use the first 6 pages:<br />
1/2 buffs.<br />
3/4 heals, cures, minor buffs (sow/billy/group acumen), etc.<br />
5/6 damage / debuffs.  Slow, malos, dots, dd's, pet.<br />
On 7/8 I have resist buffs and some other stuff that's very rarely used (blood of nadox, levitation, everlasting breath).<br />
<br />
Seems to work well for me, I can find any spell pretty quick, and if it's an older spell I need for some reason, there's always the menus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Page 1: Stuff I always use, in the order that I put them on my spell gems (well, usually): Q, Turgurs, Tnarg's, Malo, Petrifying Earth, Invis, Gate, Canni IV.<br />
<br />
Page 2: Frequent buffs and their group versions: Acumen, Agi, Sta, Focus.<br />
<br />
Page 3: Other buffs: SLTW, Talisman of Alacrity, Group/Single replenishment, Cha, VotB, SoW/Billy<br />
<br />
Page 4: Offense. True Spirit, Ultor/Blood of Saryrn, Tears of Saryrn, Velium Strike, Pox, Bane, Whatever our highest level poison nuke is...I never use it, and can't even remember the name :P<br />
<br />
Page 5: Resists/Cures. RGC, Abolish Disease, Disinfecting Aura, Resist Magic/Cold/Fire, Talisman of the Tribunal<br />
<br />
Page 6: Summoned/Utility: Summon Companion, Spirit Pouch (need to get rid of this one, I can make GM trophy bags which are vastly better), Summon Food/Drink. Levitate/Enduring Breath, Bind Affinity<br />
<br />
Page 7/8: Random stuff...Imbue war/disease/ivory (still need justice), assidious vision, form of the great bear, talisman of the diaku, malicious decay, cloud of grummus, annul magic, and some others I don't remember.<br />
<br />
Page 9/10: All my best sub-51 buffs for whenever I feel like taking pity on a newbie and buffing them to the gills.<br />
<br />
11+, all old retired spells are organized by spell level, one spell level per page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Organized by how often I use the spells with the most used ones in front.<br />
<br />
1/2 Things like root, sow/bih'li, kraggs, stoicism acumen, Turgurs, cripple<br />
<br />
3/4 buffs, pet<br />
<br />
5/6 Dots, nukes<br />
<br />
7/8 other utility: shrink, grow etc.<br />
<br />
Spells that I no longer use are in the back from pages 36ish to 50.  I have those organized by type.  All STR spells grouped together, all HP together.  I also have those organized by level starting with low at the top of the page and later ones at the bottom.  Makes buffing younger characters much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why use the spellbook now with the convenient menu pop-up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luvli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play at least one of each type of caster, so I kind of made like a universal template of sorts to prevent myself from loosing any more of my mind  :rolleyes:   Not all pages get used on each character, and sometimes I have to do some smoodging around, but it works well for me and that's all that really matters  :D <br />
<br />
This is my shaman set-up with a bit of my general thrown in:<br />
<br />
1 - heals/regens<br />
2 - sow/shrink - utility buffs (this is usually my &quot;buffs for all&quot; page, but kinda hard as a shammy  ;) )<br />
3/4 - buffs, group &amp; singles (3 is usually personal buffs and 4 is usually ds &amp;/or snare of some sort)<br />
5/6 - eb, lev, bind, flash of light - specific utility stuff <br />
7 - DDs/Debuffs<br />
8 - AoEs/Debuffs<br />
9 - DoTs<br />
10 - Pet stuffies<br />
11 - Invis/See Invis type stuffies<br />
12/13 - Gate (Personal Gates for old world on porters)<br />
14/15 - Resists, group &amp; singles<br />
(20-21 - Group Gates for Old World on porters)<br />
(22-25 - Single &amp; Group Gates for newer stuff on porters, single next to group)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree walruss<br />
<br />
I used to have a very orderly spellbook..but since drop down menus i flip it open to an open space and scribe, i dont pay much attention to it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">another /agree with Walruss<br />
<br />
In fact since the patch I don't think I've opened my spellbook once except to scribe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And I personally can't stand the drop down menus. Cumbersome, slow, and innaccurate. I'll keep my spellbook, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">page 1 debuffs (malos , sinia , md , cripple) + pet / acumen, invis  <br />
page 2 cani gate shrinks grow root  <br />
3 heals <br />
4 utility's  sow , remove cure, bo nadox etc  <br />
4 hastes , slows <br />
5 dd's / dots  <br />
6 -7 all my buffs  votb focues sta agi avatar's <br />
8 resists   <br />
9 imbues includeing all mass imbues &lt;3 the diety restriction bugs $$$$$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Walruss<br />
<br />
I've only opened my spellbook to scribe &amp; any new spells will go in the first empty slot I can find. Geese I hated spellbook maintenance that was a total requirement for shammys before the drop down menus that are just so fast &amp; easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigrr7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I keep my most used spells on the first 4 pages, moving older ones to the back and keeping the best more accessable.. Past that, I use the drop down menus so I really don't care.<br />
<br />
Edit: I see the menu as being better than the book for one reason.. If i need to change a spell when I'm being beat on, there's no better way.  Time the melee round, click the menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I haven't used the spellbook to find spells since the menus were added.<br />
<br />
For common spell sets there's load/store.  For rarely cast spells, the menus are faster than the book anyway.</div></div><hr />
