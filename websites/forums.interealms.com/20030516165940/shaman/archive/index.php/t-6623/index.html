<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Japheth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I need help understanding the benifits of +Mana items vs. +WIS items for a starting Barbarian Shaman.  If I have about 2000pp what would be a good setup inclucing weapon, shield, and gear.  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firstly, Shaman use wisdom not int.... so forget about int items :)<br />
At lower levels you get little benefit from extra wisdom - so you may find mana items more beneficial. Perhaps more effective are focus items though.<br />
<br />
I would suggest getting a cougar claw earring and mammoth hide cloak (100pp and 300pp, depending on server) for focus effects.<br />
<br />
A spine chill spear (350pp) makes a good weapon, not sure when it starts to proc though. If you are a barbarian look at the tribunal necklace quest. You can do it at a very low level and it summons a nice hammer to get you past the first newbie areas.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield (1k) is very nice and will last you a long time (I use one at 55) - but would put a big dent in your finances. Charred Guardian Shield and Clay Guardian shield are alternatives, depends how much you want to spend.<br />
<br />
Jaundiced bone armour has great AC and is very useful at 45 when the effects come into play. The common  pieces are 300-400pp each. If you want to pay less, totemic is worth considering.<br />
<br />
Something or other bone bracelet is good too - can't remember the exact one I think there's polished and chipped versions.<br />
<br />
Once you reach the middle levels don't worry so much about mana items. Go for regen, AC and HP, and then worry about wisdom after that.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Japheth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right now I have alot of Ry`Gorr armor, a Slime coated harpoon, and a Chitin Shell Shield.  I couldn't decide on boots, belt, shoulders, neck, and back.  I have about another 1k to spend.  I am thinking of trading the shield for one of those sarnak cerimonial shields that are so nice.  should i look for +wis stuff or +mana stuff for the rest?  thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try for items that have mana and hp or wis and sta.  They will be of more use than +cha or +int items.  If you dont have a neck item or finger items yet, you can pick up decent stuff in the bazaar for well under 1k.  Perhaps see if you can get any leather or blackened alloy items so you have something in your inventory slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can usually pick up the Ivory Imbued Earring rather cheap (depending on server-lots of chanters on Karana didnt even know they existed for a long time), they are very nice wis gear with nice ac for ear slots. Also Spider Fur...the belt in particular kicks much A$$ and is pretty cheap as lots of people farm AA in Velks and loot these pretty commonly.<br />
It sounds as though so far your doing pretty well with your choices, boots are a hard thing for shaman, there are very few choices that are both cheap and good....I was stuck using JB for a long time till I managed to get my Velious stuff....as a cheap alternative, Rygor or Totemic will do OK as will anything that has either hit points or mana that is in your budget.<br />
Someone needs to start a thread for a listing of cheap lots of bang for the buck gear.....look at my Magleo, when i get time i will post a cheap and easy profile...(and when magleo is back up, seems to be fubar at the moment)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Japheth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, last night I worked on my Shaman in Everfrost Peaks and got him from Level 5 to level 9.  It took about 4 hours but <br />
boy was it worth it when I finally got my SoW spell.  I was surprised to see that the Shaman guild only sold 4 of the 11 <br />
spells for a level 9 shaman.  Where should I go for the rest of my spells?  I a still lacking Flash of Light which I haven't <br />
been able to find since level 1 and I have yet to find Sicken, a level 5 spell.  So tonight I will be on a search for the rest of <br />
my spells through level 9.   Ok, I got off the original topic for this thread.    As you might have already read from my original<br />
post at the top of this I was asking about the difference between having extra WIS equipment vs. having alot of + MANA<br />
items for a low level Shaman.  I already have nearly a  full set of Ry`Gorr armor which consists of the chest, legs, gloves, <br />
armguards, and both bracers.  I decided for the rest of my gear I was going to focus on + MANA equipment.  After filling<br />
the rest of my slots I was able to gain another 165 mana which made a huge difference.  Now, I must warn you if you decide<br />
to do this as well and are under level 8 and can't meditate you better be patient because with all this extra mana gear it took<br />
close to 30 minutes to med full.  I am wondering if anyone can tell me around what level should I start getting rid of my <br />
+MANA gear and start replacing them with +WIS items?   Also, as far as my weapon and shield goes, Right now I am using<br />
a Slime Covered Harpoon and a Chitin Shield.  I think at my level the SCH is much better than the Jade Chokidai Prod because <br />
it has lower delay and +mana instead of the +wis that the Prod has.  Also, as far as a shield goes I was thinking about buying<br />
a Sarnak Battle Shield but then I saw that the Ry`Gorr Oracle Shield has +50 mana and +5 wis and wondered if I would be better<br />
off with the Ry'Gorr shield.  That is all I have for now.  Please let me know what you think and if you agree or disagree with what<br />
I said.  I might check out that mangelo website tonight and post a link so you guys can get an idea on what I am talking about.<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Equip what you have fun with, if you die alot, then perhaps something needs adjusting. Die with mana? Your HP/AC is too low, die because you're oom? Mana/wis might be an issue.<br />
<br />
Theres plently of time at higher levels to min-max everything, by the time youre level 24 your character undergoes a major playstyle change, thats a good time to start evaluating your equipment again, in the meantime have some fun levelling up!</div></div><hr />
