Maybe at 60+, but not below. Unless there's a level limit on the focus effect items, it will come in very handy.</div></div><hr />

Most of my time is spend debuffing and healing, but with dots I can cast 2 spells after I slow and then move on to other things and still contribute 5K to the downing of the beastie.  Sure 5K isnt much, but its enough for me to feel usefull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do we know for certain that curse counters are lower agro than poison counters?  Because its a realtively new category of spells (introduced in Luclin and not given to PC's till LDoN) Im thinking that they are going to be horribly out of whack for the first few months.  It remains to be seen, but I have the feeling that if anything they will be on par with poison dots for agro generation.  Pure speculation at this point, but an intersting idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see this &quot;DoTs are obsolete&quot; stuff all the time, and I don't get it.  In full XP groups, unless I'm playing healer, I almost always toss on a Blood of Saryrn.  In smaller 2-3 man groups, I may toss a BoU or Pox.  There are also plenty of boss mobs where I break out the DoTs and provide considerable DPS... last night on one of the Vex Thal named, I kept Epic+BoU+Pox+BoS+BoN on the mob pretty much constantly after I got it slowed, which sure can't have hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bos= 535 mana/2240 damage<br />
<br />
With mana preservation items/aa, imp damage item two velium strikes cost the same, and do an average of  2072, assuming you don't have scf. If everything went right you could max out at around 4620 damage from that same mana you spent on the dot...only faster, and most importantly - less aggro.<br />
<br />
That is why dots are obsolete. If you still don't get it I cannot help you.<br />
<br />
As for your named fight, it seems like all you are doing is dots. You are doing a little over 800/tick assuming you kept them all up and going well. You could surpass that with rains. You're also making aggro like a madman...see above aggro information for dd's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With mana preservation items/aa, imp damage item two velium strikes cost the same, and do an average of  2072, assuming you don't have scf.

Bzzzt.  Thanks for playing but you gotta compare apples to apples, not rotten apples to apples.  And does it truly matter if you generate a little more aggro, as long as you don't top the hate list and the tank doesn't die?  Nope, not one bit.  And if the tank DOES die?  You're still going to be near the top of the hate list or want to be at the top if there's no one else to tank so the cleric can get out and be able to rez.  What does death mean in EQ at 65?  Not a whole lot.<br />

As others have said in the past, stop trying to game the game and instead play the game and have fun and let others play how they want to play so they can have fun too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The mana difference is still slight, even with all the mana pres you can get..and the return is still the same or better with less aggro with nukes. It's  also not a little more aggro, it is assloads more aggro to dot.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you do want aggro dots are the way to go. Why you would want that shamu I have no idea. Roll a sk/pally, if you think you should be tanking &quot;all day&quot; for a group.</div></div><hr />

I looked on Lucy and can't see anything. Admittedly it would be nice because the amount of dps poison dots do correlated with their aggro is absurd.

<br />
Hmm, dots are obsolete? How do you keep aggro when you're tanking without the dots? Malos, slow, BoS and BoN, and I can tank BoT all day with everyone else nuking their heart out.<br />
<br />
Dots are much too mana inefficient to use as a means to hold agro especially in a chain pulling group. If you have to Malos, Slow and DoT every mob on every pull with no breaks inbetween then you will run OOM pretty fast even with Canni5.<br />
<br />
Our BEST agro holding spell is Blinding Luminance. It is fast casting, low mana and you will NEVER lose agro as long as you stand in close proximity to the mob. The only catch is that if you ever move out of range of melee then the mob will run away as if feared and could cause a nasty train. Oh and I have used Blinding Luminance many times to gain instant agro and maintain it in BoT if the MT has died. Or for tanking in general while waiting for a tank or tank is LD. I have even used it to tank 2 mobs at the one time like an AE taunt.<br />

<br />
leaving me more time to canni, heal, slow, rebuff, yada yada, and to more dmg is ok with me.<br />
<br />
its situational too sometimes its high pr/dr and so i go cold.<br />
<br />
overall prefer the dots, and the new LDoN curse will just enforce this for me.</div></div><hr />

QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Why use Velium Strike to compare?  Lets use Tears of Saryn. (cast time 6secs,  650X3 (1950 total )  W/O foci. 1950   Now if you have aa's for crits (still no foci) more then one wave can crit for 1k+ easy (I do it all the time).  I do on average 2500 to 3000k per single cast.<br />
<br />
Less aggro,Faster damage,  More damage even with partial resisits(still PR based like Blood).<br />
<br />
Now when I solo, root + rot is the way to go, no contest.  <br />
Groups DD rains. Less mana for more damage, less to heal me due to lower aggro vs Dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">personally i prefer my dot's just cuz its one cast. blood of saryn (cast time: 5.7sec, 2240 dmg w/o foci) does more dmg than a cast of velium strike (casting time: 7.8sec, 925dmg maybe less with partial resist).<br />
<br />
<br />
Velium strike is half the mana, and can hit for over 2300 with imp damage and scf. <br />
<br />
Now I don't know about you, but most of the time I have mana and time to spare after the heals, slows, and debuffs. Instant damage+less mana+less aggro = chain casting for 3-4 times the damage of just tossing on that dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The best way to do the most damage fast is Tears of Saryrn.  Yes, you get one resist on average.  Yes, from a pure damage:mana standpoint, it winds up a little worse than velium strike with an imp damage item (only cause a wave gets resisted).  But I find it is easier to do one cast of this before the mob dies than to do two velium strikes.  From dmg:mana perspective, Tears on average lands a little over 2 waves per cast, so it's (gut feeling) 1400ish base (ignoring crits) dmg on average per 450 mana, or about the same base ratio as velium strike.  (Imp dmg cold item tilts the balance in favor of velium strike, although it's slower).  Tears of saryrn is good burst damage, and has a chance to land all 3 waves (when it can be great).<br />
<br />
As for dots, they're still the best damage:mana ratio BY FAR.  The poster who says 2x velium strike = a BoS is only correct if the dot doesn't run to its full duration (often typical in xp groups).  A fair comparison would be vengeance of eternity (30% to dot) vs. wrath of eci (35% to cold)+ crit aa.  Since the foci dmg is random, it's 15.5 on avg to the dot, 17.5avg+whatever from aa (not sure of the number granted by scm3+fom, let's say 20%) or so to the nuke.  Even assuming you crit 20% of the time on the vel strike (prolly a way high number, but picked it to emphasize how big a gap there is), that is 925*1.375 = 1271 dmg for 300 mana, or dmg:mana of 4.24.  BoS is 2240*1.155 = 2587 dmg, divided by 535 = 4.83 dmg:mana.  If you don't talk in the world of uber time gear and instead compare burning affliction iv vs. anger of e'ci (20% vs. 23%), the dot still comes out with the edge.<br />
<br />
I did not even consider the fact that there are higher mana preservation items specific to dots (conservation of bertoxxulus, affliction efficiency iv) that further increase this gap.<br />
<br />
(Although there is the problem of the rarity of the affliction foci versus damage foci (an itemization issue that needs addressing)).<br />
<br />
So, assuming the dot runs full course, it's a way more efficient way to do damage than any of our nukes.<br />
<br />
I'm just too lazy to deal with aggro and remembering to cast the dot at beginning of fight every time, so I fall into the 2x vel strike or 1x tears of saryrn (depending on resists of what I'm fighting) camp of shammies when xp'ing.<br />

<br />
long long long time ago, lots of agro is calculate from poison/disease counter, if you are old player, you should know every high level sk cast their lvl9/15 disease dot for agro, and shaman's best agro spell is unresistable disease debuff/disease dot , poison was same agro as now<br />
<br />
then VI want add disease counter to slow spell, this was very very bad change and take them few months to fixed, because it add massive agro to our slow, they try fixed it few time but still fail, they end up make disease counter have zero agro -- this mean our disease debuff have same agro as dispell/malo now, also disease dot almost never agro now, also mean nerf to SK<br />
<br />
well, now they still havn't change agro on poison counter, I think because chanter's Tash's line use poison counter to calculate agro and they don't want waste time to adjust tash's line like they did to our slow agro<br />
<br />
now for curse, as you see there are zero reason to make agro from it since damage from each tick of dot have it own agro already</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only..you can't stack your own dots, so in a group when you have to do all your damage in 50 seconds it is much better to nuke twice than put 1 dot on(and after your slow and debuff it won't last the full time anyway). In other words, yes dots are efficient if you are root rot soloing, but no, they suck compared to dd in exp groups. <br />
<br />
Rains are well and good as long as the mob doesn't move...which makes them a little less versatile than straight nukes for exp groups.</div></div><hr />

Don't confuse the poor shammy shamu... Some people just don't get how useful DoTs are and miss the big picture.</div></div><hr />
