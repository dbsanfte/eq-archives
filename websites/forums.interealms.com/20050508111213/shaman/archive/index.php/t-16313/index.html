<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walor_Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what reasons people picked to play a Shaman. I picked a Shaman because I didn't like playing a Warrior anymore so I made a Cleric and then I didn't enjoy sit, heal, sit, heal, heal heal, sit, heal, heal, /yell, /yell, /g %T attacking me!, DIE, Loading Please Wait..., Swearing in real life. So I made a Shaman and have loved every moment of it...except the dieing..which don't happen too often.<br />

<br />
In Beta 3 I started playing EQ, I made a **RANGER**!!!  An aviak chick dissuaded from making the worst mistake in the game *ducks the rangers' arrows*  After getting my butt kicked over and over by aviak chicks, I decided to make a druid....well....that went ok until I lost my corpse to the brownies at level 7 (no /corpse command yet, so lost a couple levels trying to get it back and finally gave up). <br />
<br />
I made a shaman after that and stuck with that class choice in the final, and never looked back.  So in closing. A big thanks to the aviaks of butcherblock and the brownies of lesser fay for saving me from making a wood elf ranger and a wood elf druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started playing a barbarian shaman after my husband gave up on his to prove that I could do something that he couldn't.<br />
<br />
I love my shammie, but even if I didn't, I may have foced myself to play her until she reached 65 out of shear pride!<br />
<br />
It was however the motivating factor not to give up on my shaman and to stay in Halas as long as possible because my husband gave up at around level 5 *grins*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My first toon way back when was a wizard.  At level 8, I declared SoW the best spell in the game. Period.  Shamans got it at level 9 a full FIVE LEVELS before druids.  Shamans could heal also, which was pretty important to me since I was sick of dying in Blackburrow so often.  Plus the picture and description on Castersrealm made them look tough and durable, a semi hybrid if you will.  I was sold and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chose shaman because they got SOW at level 9 and I figured I would be lucky to play long enough to even get that.  But if I did, at least I could run around and see the world before quitting.  As it turned out....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had been playing about 2 months before Luclin came out, tired a few classes and never really feel in love with one. <br />
<br />
Day luclin came out everyone in my play group made a kitty. Two already made BL's so I looked at the remaining classes and the only one that interested me was Shaman. I completely feel in love with the class and still enjoy playing it more then any other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always liked the class, had a few as alts but never really leveled one up. A friend of mine quit and gave me his acct with a 54 warrior and a 51 shammy. I tryed douing the warrior with my druid but I ended up using way to much mana healing. Then I tryed my ranger with my shammy and really haven't looked back, adding in my druid again when I got a second comp and also adding in another retired friends necro acct. The only class of the 4 i would really consider soloing with is the shammy, just because they can handle the heat and I understand the class alot better than say my necro. I've considered changing out each of my other toons but have never even considered changing the shaman out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Started my Shaman on day one of Everquest.<br />
<br />
Didn't know anything about any of the classes. I just wanted to be able to be able to melee and heal myself.<br />
<br />
The Shaman has changed quite a bit over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I first made a troll shaman, and I started him because I wanted to do more as a cleric, clerics are so limited in abilities, and I personally find shamen a more veristile caster.  So when PoP came out, I sold my cleric, and outfitted a vah shir shaman, fell in love with him and the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ranger loved the guy til the hellish 50's, just couldn't grind it out til archery and EQ<br />
<br />
one day while trying to decide which class to be a shaman I was grouped with (lvl 53) slowed a mob, the mob hardly was hitting me and I thought now that is POWER!<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
wanted to be able to buff noobs<br />
wanted to be able to root adds and park them<br />
wanted to be able to slow - wowowow<br />
wanted to be able to sow<br />
wanted to be able to gate<br />
wanted a pet<br />
thought a jbb was the coolest toy<br />
<br />
wanted to be able to crawl thru a dungeon and kill mobs on the way to the boss and then kill the boss<br />
<br />
hoping I can do this at 62, with spells - and aa<br />
<br />
If any of the higher lvl shaman's are reading this and I'm wrong please correct me now lol<br />
<br />
I was never worried about soloing for exp per se, more being able to take on named dragons and mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I came back mid-luclin after quitting mid-velious.  I had given my monk to a friend so her husband could have a high level character to play alongside her.  The account ended up with another person in my guild who was a walking penis.  Luckily, his cousin is a hella nice guy, and had an account with a 51 shaman on it sitting around.  He loaned it to me, and I got to 55 and got a lot better gear (cept the fungi and jbb that I came with).<br />
<br />
Eventually, the penis and his cousin both quit EQ.  Penis decided to sell my old account instead of giving it back to me.  His cousin felt bad for me, and after taking the jbb/fungi off the shaman, let me have the account.<br />
<br />
I had another account, that I bought (bought from scratch, as in boxes from the store, not ebay) to return with, which I had a 47 bard and 45 paladin on.  I was thinking of PLing one of them up with Gwain, but my group of friends had no shaman, but we did have both a bard and paladin already.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Welp, my story is akin to Stolas. I had a Shaman that my sister used to play but I never really got into her (she was only 35). But, I geared her up and pumped up her baking skill just to keep her around. Then, probably my dearest friend in EQ quit (or took an indefinite leave of absence). Her favorite character was her Shaman, Amorae. So, in honor of her (and because I still hope she decides to play again), I equipped Amorae as best I could and now I'm levelling her. It's still her account (she pays for it, I'm just the &quot;babysitter&quot; or fairy godmother) and Amorae is HER (as far as I'm concerned) so I try my best to play her to the best of my (and the class's) ability. Originally I was only going to log her on every now and then (her owner's been gone for 2 whole years now) but with new expansions and such coming out, I felt the need to make sure she was kept up to date (spell and gear-wise).<br />
<br />
What's great is how well the Shaman class complements my melee (Rogue and Ranger). So it isn't much of a stretch for me to duo them. Took me 3 weeks of researching (as if I were cramming for finals) before I felt comfortable enough to play her. But I've come to love the class's versatility (not druid-like versatility. More like Bard versatility). I figure I'll play her as long as I can while still needling her mommy to play again  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mines pathetic really =( Boyfriend and I took a break from EQ shortly after PoP came out (were playing Necro, &amp; Mage) When we decided to come back my boyfriend had always wanted to play a Monk, so that left me needing to play something that would duo well with a Monk. <br />
I would have rather played an Enchanter *ducks* although I love my Shaman now, if only I could change my race =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was just getting started in EQ.  My friend told me to make a human warrior to help me learn the game, because its an easy class to play.  This was a mistake.  Warriors are probably the WORST class to start with, because they are so mindnumbingly boring to play, especially at low levels.  I got sick of it around level 9 and wanted to make a new character.<br />
<br />
My friend said: &quot;Shamans are cool, they have the best buffs.  I saw this shaman dueling in gfay and no one could beat him because he buffed himself and his pet so well that they just couldn't be hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then went on to tell me that shamans are a hybrid class that use both int and wis, so I put 15 in to both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Main reason was I wanted to dot things and sit down, watching mobs die.<br />
<br />
I didn't find out about the importance of shaman slow til I was hunting recusos in Maru Seru and a more experienced player taught me more about the importance of being a shaman.</div></div><hr />

hells ya! same here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Being a casual player with rarely more than 1 hour to play a day, I chose the shaman class.<br />
Shamans are able to solo well, but at the same time be welcome in groups if i ever have more than a few hours to play.<br />
This is something no other class could offer at the time I started (late 2001).<br />
I played a necro and a SK before, but the necro could only solo at the time and the SK didn't excel at either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used to play EQ at my friends house when the game first came out.  I played a mage and was always hanging around blackburrow. Everytime I got the oppurtunity I grouped with a shaman and killed at the snake ledge.  I always envied their ability to tank, melee, heal, and even nuke!  <br />
<br />
As soon as I got EQ for myself, I immediately rolled a barb shaman and haven't looked back since.  And blackburrow is still my favorite dungeon for all my toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Around the time of Velious I started hanging out with a friend who played EQ.  I immediately fell in love with the original troll models (which I thought looked like Santa Claus crossbred with Gremlins) and they had regen.  Tried warrior, got bored.  Picked shaman because I felt that SK was kind of a cheesy concept (oooooooh, look at me, I'm the antipaladin, evil evil evil).  Enjoyed it immensely, still do, although I really miss being able to stomp around the swamp like I own the place.  A pox on the person who came up with the idea of kicking the Trolls out of Grobb.  I enjoyed the simplistic, brutal and violent design of the city.  Neriak is a terrible, terrible place for a Shaman to grow up in without PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I had been playing EQ for about 2 years jumping between classes to play. I didnt really have a main and was pretty bored with the game. a RL friend wanted to start some chars on VZ so he rolled an iksar necro and I rolled an iksar shaman. well I got it to about level 14 and went crazy and sold everything on all my chars on brell to make a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">After playing a wizard from day 1(for me, about when Luclin cam out) for nearly a year, I decided to make an alt to play around with. I had always been impressed by what a well played shaman was capable of. So I rolled up a shaman, and decided on ogre simply for a change. As my main and my only other alt were &quot;good&quot; races. Played around a bit, but never got far, level 7 or 8 I believe. <br />
<br />
I then took a break from EQ for a bit, and upon returning I saw that the guild I was in had lost a lot of people, and was in need of a shaman bad(although also needed one befor my break too). So I picked up the shaman again and &quot;twinked&quot; him out the best I could, and really started to enjoy the class. So I found this place, and started doing research so that I could be the best possible shaman I could be.<br />
<br />
That brings me to now, still working on levels, still learning every day, but enjoying it the whole time. Kinda feel bad for my wizzy though, as hes not had any serious play time in a long while, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Exactly the same as Tauran cept i think i got to level 14 with the wizard before i decided SoW was necessary. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Started playing EQ in July of 99, after playing a text rpg for about 3 years (Dragonrealms). I had always liked rangers in most roleplaying games, but when I made a wood elf ranger in EQ, he was just too wimpy - not to mention I couldnt see squat in Greater Faydark. <br />
<br />
So, I thought druid sounded interesting - a non-fighting type of ranger with the same types of magic, only more powerful. I made a human druid and got him up to level 15 on Innoruuk. Back in those days, the servers werent very stable and I would get disconnected several times every time I played. So, my brother and I and a friend we'd met on Innoruuk decided to try a different server with less people. E'ci was the lowest population server, so that's where we went. I thought I was making such a huge mistake deleting my level 15! druid and starting over, but Innoruuk was just unplayable for me.<br />
<br />
On E'ci, I made Rathelon - a barbarian warrior. I played him up to level 8 and was hanging out with another barbarian warrior in the newbie grounds when I learned that shamans got Spirit of Wolf at level 9. Having played a druid to level 15, I knew how nice that spell was, so I decided I would try shaman. I gave my patchwork armor and sewing kit to my brother to hold for me and rerolled Rathelon as a shaman and he's been my main for the last 4 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I started playing a war in December of 01 and about a month later I made a shaman, leveled him to 14, stalled out and went back to my war. Met my good buddy Woeccan, supershaman extraordinaire and we teamed up, my war and his shaman. Went through alot of levels and always noticed that with him around, I could beat down about anything, if he had to go /afk or log, I just typed /gems and got busy until he got back. One day he shows up with a alt ranger and I decide my 14 shaman can help him get a few levels so I logged him in. Got his ranger a few levels and decided since he pretty PLd my war so well (he called it a team, now that I know what a shaman can really do, it was a PL that we both got xp for), I could gain a few levels while he was on vacation and help him even more. Once I learned just how powerful and how much fun a shaman can be, I never went back. His ranger turned into a trackbot and my shaman is now past my war in not even half the time played. Shaman own all, best class around by far.<br />
<br />
BTW, since I am in a war zone atm and can't play, Woe, if your out there and reading this, Hiyas bud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Began playing a druid in June-July 99 because i was playing a druid in a ongoing AD&amp;D campain. Got him up too lvl 49, that was before Kunark. Then i had to scrap him too get my exams done. Deleted him simply, were totaly addicted at the time, so that was the only way.<br />
<br />
After i finished my final excam and got my Bach, got myself a job. Came home one evening and didnt have anything too do. Were looking through old comp games and came by EQ.<br />
<br />
Thought about the fun times i had and decided to go for it again. This time with a bit more controll over my addiction :)<br />
<br />
Why Shaman? Well i still remeber the first time i saw 2 barberian at Felwith when i came running with my 6 lvl druid for a safe haven. I was soo impressed with their size. They looked so damn cool with their tattoos.<br />
<br />
Why Shaman, easy, was addicted to SoW since my Druid.<br />
<br />
Today im happy i had a break in EQ so i could choose to play another profession. Shaman simply rocks my world!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I originally played a ranger, and loved it. I also had an enchanter alt, and had played a few chars at low levels but not really got on with them. (I chat too much to like playing a bard well, I don't like not having spells with pure melees, etc).<br />
<br />
I started shaman when my ranger was about 20. Mostly because of seeing a shaman friend play(Vendredi, long since quit EQ but I still miss him). It looked different and versatile, and I hadn't played a healer before. I started Kianor one quiet Saturday morning when no-one I knew was around, levelled him to around 4 and didn't play him for a while.<br />
<br />
He might have remained another forgotten baby alt except that a friend got me a mug with &quot;SOW PLZ&quot; on it, and told me I could have it when I got to the level to cast SoW... He was thinking of my ranger, but I figured it was easier to level Kianor from 4 to 9 than Ben from 30 to 39. :)<br />
<br />
I started to get into the character and playing him regularly as an alt, at first mostly solo when I couldn't find a group with the ranger, and later on, I'd group with a couple of nutty ranger friends around his level.<br />
<br />
Kianor was around 45, and still very much an alt when my guild split in half, with all the solid raiders leaving to form a raiding guild. This was a couple of months after Luclin came out, and my ranger was 60. When the dust settled, I was the highest level active shaman in the guild, and finding that I was attending more raids on the shaman than the ranger, I started levelling him seriously. Around about level 54, I switched mains, outfitted him more seriously (stealing some gear from the ranger), and haven't really looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SoW<br />
<br />
lvl 9 spell, still one of the best spells in the game.  And shaman get it 1st.<br />
<br />
Now 65 levels and 200ish AA later I still use sow (from my blad fur boots admittedly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">my brother had bought eq for me for christmas and he was already a shaman. this was right when kunark came out. dropped me off in gfay, said good luck. i had no clue what i was doing. didnt have my spells until around lvl 10. he he was so fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gothra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I simply love the troll model and I hate begging (or paying) for SOW.<br />

However I was pretty clueless about the class - and thinking its a tank class with SOW...I put my starting points into Str and Dex  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I picked a shaman because I thought hmm what class would be the best farmer in a dungeon, and the answer I came up with was shaman. Also shamans are wanted in groups, and have the ability to solo. Which was good at lower lvls when you could not find a group knowing you are not totally helpless at soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I picked a Shaman because I wanted to play a healer. And the Tribunal suited me for roleplaying reasons. First choice was a halfling Cleric, but he drowned after a LD after 5 minutes play time. My luck I say! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I wanted to be able to cast major spells and still beat on stuff.  When I found out that shaman get a pet dog, I was sold.  Racewise, I made a half-ogre fighter in AD&amp;D after someone wrote up a ruleset for them in Dragon magazine, and I haven't really enjoyed roleplaying anything that wasn't ogre-ish, ogre-esque, or at least ogrelike in some way since then.    Call me easily amused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">started a shaman on a friend's account 3 months after release.  In july '99, when I had a suitable comp, I got my own account, Fumeden was born, and no other class has been as much fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I had lots of different characters.  My first main was a ranger that I got to level 12.  I had a wizard to level 8, a SK to level 8, a cleric to level 10, and I got Twoflower to level 4.  Then I quit EQ because none of my RL friends were around to play with me (they all levelled much faster than me) and I had a new baby coming.<br />
<br />
So fast forward a year, my wife gets tired of watching TV every night while I play computer games, and I just can't force myself to watch TV, so she decides to try gaming.  I dust off my Everquest, reactivate my account, and voila, my characters are all still there after 9 months.<br />
<br />
She wants something simple, so she creates a warrior.  Another RL friend joins us and starts a wizard.  I look at that combo and decide that I had better be a healer.  I knew that shaman get SOW at level 9, other buffs for melee, AND heals... so why not?<br />
<br />
And the rest is history.<br />
<br />
My highest level alt now is a level 47 druid.  Druids are fun, especially dualboxed with a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I chose shaman to compliment my RL freinds character choices. They had a few melee chars , but no healing power in the stable nor any buffing characters. <br />
<br />
    Rolled Ohaern up in december of 99 along with a few other characters to lock in the name choices I wanted. Ohaern made it to 14 before we all realized we were going to need a cleric, as there were several shamans playing on our normal playtimes - but the server seemed to be cleric lite. I unfortunately lost the /random  ( a proud tradition I still continue - my dice indeed sucketh ! ) and ended up going cleric as a main and shelving Ohaern as a project to be continued later....<br />
<br />
    Fast forward to the druid whinefest resulting in clerical CH being pimped out to Druids and nerfed from 10k max heal down to 7.5k max heal  and Shamans getting a slight increase in the healing power available. The decision was made. No more would the shackles of the CH chain  be 'roun my ankle. Revived Ohaern from his SoW whore status the day druid CH went live. Havent looked back since, nor have  I ever had as much fun with any other class. I can solo , I can group - I can trio with an SK /Rog combo for hella aa xp , life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>MaryieneD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I had started a human paladin back in December of 2000.  I loved playing her and still do.  I started a barbarian shaman alt and got her to level 5, but really didn't play her much...until my daughter started playing and made a wood elf warrior.  I thought it would be fun to play my shaman and level up with her warrior a bit so that she would have a healer, buffer, and can't live without SoW.  I pretty much stopped playing her for a while after I hit level 50.  My daughter had outleveled me during her summer break.<br />
<br />
I've had so much fun with the shaman with the incredible things that can be done with them.  It is such a versatile class.  While leveling my paladin to 65, I was grouped with a shaman in the guild almost daily.  Meanwhile, Mary started farming OOT for about 6 AA points at level 51 at various times to get Seafoam for the pally's smithing.  (I seriously wasn't considering getting run 3 until Quag Maelstorm was after me and SoW dropped and wasn't memmed).<br />

Recently, I've started playing my shaman again.  My daughter has a chanter, shaman friend has a ranger.  We've recently found out that is a really interesting combination and have been doing up OS and Veksar with a couple other players here and there.  I've pretty much decided to level her more and see how far I can get without venturing too far into the Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">First char I made was a HE Wizard.  From what I read somewhere wizards were tough at low levels but became some sorta super badasses at very high levels...  Well, after about 8 levels or so I decided that there was no way in hell they could become super badass enough to compensate for what wusses they were at that level.  So I started over as a big mean ogre shaman that I miss to this day, Mgubgub.<br />
<br />
As fate would have it though.  The RL friend that got me to switch from MUDs to EQ had just started an Iksar Necro.  I'd gotten my Ogre up to lvl 9 and once I got that taste of my very own SoW available all the time I couldn't let it go.  So I started over as an Iksar Shaman and never looked back.  FoB, Kurns Tower, the Sarnak Fort, Dalnir, Droga... I fell in love with Kunark and my shaman and just couldn't bring myself to start a twink when I could keep levelling up my shaman and see new dungeons.  So now my friend has a half dozen characters from level 30-51 after 3+ years on playing EQ and I have my one level 65 uber shaman.  I wouldn't change a thing about it either ;)</div></div><hr />

wanted to make a rogue, but liked the ogre walking animation too much.<br />
and since none of my RL friends played a shaman i made one :)<br />

today i am happy that i made a shaman, cause i am shaman by heart.<br />
even tho i am cursing all the time about ppl begging for buffes every 2min i still love to be a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Started my Shaman off when EQ cam out of Beta.<br />
1st ever char was a warrior who made it to about lvl 10 but all that sitting forever after a fight soon gave him up.<br />
<br />
Got him to level 29 which in them days was quite uber :)<br />
Took a 2 year break from EQ came back and started a Necro.<br />
Got the necro to 56 but couldnt stand the solo grind.<br />
Took over my shaman again got him to 34 (Still wearing Blood Stained Tunic and banded).Thought this is going to cost me a fortune to upgrade him especially as id put all his starting stats in strength (Hey we were all new and didnt know better)<br />
Rerolled him and have now got my new improved shaman to 62 and since I restarted him have not made any other twinks so there seems to be something about the class that i love.<br />

I knew nothing else about the game at the time.  Nobody even knew what spells did back then.  Heck, we didn't know that we HAD dots until about level 8 when someone came across the dot vender in the tundra of Everfrost.  Even then, we didn't know what they did except, &quot;boy they sure don't like tainted breath....&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Friends finally convinced me to give EQ a try in Dec99 and I was big into d&amp;d for a long time and a wood elf assassin was my favorite character so I made a wood elf rogue.  I didnt realize it was supposed to be a social game so I leveld him up solo to about 16 (back in the extremely underpowered days of rogues) before I realized it was just too much downtime inbetween solo fights and I started grouping a little.  Met some shaman in groups and that was it for me, scrapped the rogue in January 2000 and started a shaman so I could solo, they had just way too much utility for me to ignore, had no clue what slow was at the time or for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hm, 3.5 years ago started with a high elf wizard and had a horrible time.  Almost quit the game.  Friends convinced me to reconsider and play an iksar monk (kunark came out right when I got sick of my wiz).  So I did, actually had fun with him, and played him to 40-something.  Monks got powerful about this time (except my un-twinked ass), and started attracting all kinds of d00dz to the class, and pretty soon people were stereotyping me as one also, almost all unprovoked.  Couldn't take it no more, and fell in love with the concept of the ranger class.  So gutted my monk, made a ranger, and worked real hard on him for a year or so.  Lost my job, guild was doing real bad at the time, I got burnt so I quit... and gave my account to a friend.<br />
<br />
8 months later my job-story was stable again and I was back on my feet and looking to get back into the game.  Was thinking I couldn't get my ranger/monk back, so I created a new EQ account, and did a lot of Web research on the different classes.  Shaman slow and utility appealed to me greatly, and I had known a few awesome shaman friends in my previous life, and just had a real good feeling about the class.<br />
<br />
Created Poguk.  Got him to level 30 untwinked before my friend approached me about taking my ranger account back.  I was pretty happy (my ranger was 54 at the time), so now I had 2 accounts.  Got back into my ranger for awhile, got his epic and got him to upper-50s when I was bestowed leadership of my guild, and we lost all of our high-level shamans.... and we had a lot of high-level rangers.<br />
<br />
So I dusted off Poguk, remembering how much fun I was having with him before I got my ranger back, and suddenly realized what I had been missing for months.<br />
<br />
He's now 63 and epic'd, and I wish I had found the shaman class first....  I just didn't know about them, ya know?<br />
<br />
I still love my ranger, and I still break out my monk occasionally.... and I even got a wizard to 55 in my spare-time (tee-hee), but I consider my shaman to be my favorite character for a lot of reasons:<br />
<br />
- Group-desirability<br />
- Everybody loves a buffer :)<br />
- Slow is just awesome<br />
- DoTs are so strong<br />
- Debuffing<br />
- The bear look!<br />
- Love the epic<br />
- Great spells from level 50 all the way thru to 65<br />
- Great AA options<br />
- Love my level 58 dogdog!<br />
<br />
I just love being in a group and someone says &quot;damn i can't see a thing&quot; or &quot;damn i'm poisoned&quot; or &quot;damn my stamina bar is gone&quot; or &quot;crap! we got 3 mobs on us!&quot;...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I used to go to a friends place and watch him play this cool ass game that he called EQ back in the summer of 2000.  He was an Erudite Enchanter and watching him mez stuff in HHK was just fun to watch.<br />
<br />
I started a WE ranger on his acct to play with.  Didnt know what I was doing and made her female AND put her points into Int.  Played the ranger to about level 14 and wanted to try something different.  Made a Necro and a mage during that time.  <br />
<br />
Then I moved, and didnt have reliable access to the net for 9 months.  When I did get good access, I remembered the fun I had with EQ.  Started playing the ranger again, and leveled up to 17.  And got bored.<br />
<br />
So one saturday morning I was staring at the character selection screen and liked the way Barb models looked.  I knew I didnt want to play a warrior, and rogue didnt really interest me, so the other only option was Shaman.  I wasnt framiliar with the class at all, but since it was really just a time filler character, I decided to try it.<br />
<br />
Named him Thorzion, and had a blast with him.  In one day I got him up to level 11, which back then (juuust before Velious came out) was a neat thing.  Before long I had met some great friends and had a solid group and the rest is history.<br />
<br />
Thor's leveling has been considerable slower than that first fatefull day.  Still only 62 after 3 years of play.  But Ive had fun taking in the sights and smelling those roses....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ever since EQ came out, I was intrigued by it.  I remember picking up the box in some computer store and really digging the packaging, but I was just too cheap to pay 50 bucks for a game AND pay a monthly fee.<br />
<br />
My boyfriend (who is always good about noticing stuff like this) gets me a copy of EQ for my birthday in Aug of 99.  We were supposed to go to a Ren Fest that day...well, that didn't happen :)<br />
<br />
I started a WE ranger first, because I'd always liked the archer in Diablo.  I logged in for the first time and promptly ran off the side of Kelethin and died - time in game - approximately 7 seconds.<br />
<br />
I played the ranger for a few days, always lost, didn't know what a zone was and could NEVER find my body under that city.  After a little bit of internet research, I found out that at level FOUR bards get a song to locate corpses, never lose a corpse again!!<br />
<br />
So, I started a WE bard and played her to around level 12.  My boyfriend and I had one account and one computer and he had started an erudite enchanter as well.  After a couple of months, we realized we both enjoyed the game, so we bought a second account (with a plan to buy a second computer sometime in the future).<br />
<br />
I liked the bard, but I wanted to interact more directly with other players.  I also hated being lost and wanted bind/gate.  Since John's enchanter was almost level 15 and it would be much too hard for him to start over (!! ha), during Thanksgiving of 99 I started a high elf cleric and a barbarian shaman on the second account.<br />
<br />
I played the bard, cleric and shaman off and on until all three were level 20.  We bought our second computer and I had to decide which character I wanted to focus on.  Just for vanity, it was tough because I loved the high elf cleric models, but clerics were just SO BORING.  I really liked the shaman, loved the utility.  Of course, that that time I was still meleeing with my uber GWC and had no idea what slow was, but I still loved the class.<br />
<br />
Kunark came out when we were level 30 or so, it was still the very best expansion.  My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to fall in with a regular group (shaman, enchanter, monk, monk, bard) and we spent our time exploring dungeons, it was a great time.<br />
<br />
So, today...the bard is still level 21.  I got the cleric to level 29 during a leveling slump in the 50s and the shaman is level 65 with 160+ AA.  I have a handful of nicely dressed sub level 10 twinks, but no desire to play any other class.  John retired at level 58 (early Velious), he's still the only person I know who actually quit cold turkey and never played again.<br />
<br />
I've twinked out his enchanter and leveled him to 59...I really want to level him to 60 so I can have a KEI machine, but I just can't stand to play any other class :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well -- my original real everquest character was a druid... About 8 months before kunark he had just about everything including all of the trade skills and factions high enough they threw parties when he entered towns...  There was just nothing for him to do -- so I sold him...<br />
<br />
Then kunark came out and I decided to give it a whirl.  My old server had switched to a different provider(that whole something net thing back then) and I had horrible performance connecting to it...  so I checked the other servers and only a few of them gave me satisfactory performance ...  I chose the roleplaying server of the time which was Fenin-Ro (too bad firiona wasnt around back then -- I love the idea of all of the no-drop items being droppable) and made an iksar to take full advantage of the new expansion...<br />
<br />
As for classes -- I really did NOT want a NON Sotw class...  I also wanted something at least somewhat different from my old dru so I went shaman.  <br />
<br />
I retired at level 54 in vellious when they did the patch where iksar racial penalties no longer spread to groups(level 54 was AWFULLY LONG back then and that 20% increase in the time to level was just too much) -- in addition they did the whole healing nerf thing and they made ebay sales illegal -- all in the same timeframe...  So I retired again -- giving away all of my stuff since you couldnt sell it anymore...<br />
<br />
I came back about 2 months ago...  I had very little coin so I worked at that first...  Eventually I managed to get myself an above average set of equipment and focused a bit more on levelling ... I am now 58th which is still lower than 54th was when I left...(when I left 54th was probably the equivalent of 63rd now only it took a lot longer to get)....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Groller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">My first true character (as opposed to all those halted attempts at a char and getting oneself lost in their home city or whatnot) was a halfling ranger.  At first, I thought, hey this could be cool.<br />
<br />
Until I started stalling out around 28th level, so close and yet so far from SOW.  <br />
<br />
After much frustration, i decided that I needed to check out another class.  Going through the guild listing, I noticed a stark lack of shamen.  And so Groller was born.<br />
<br />
Of course, between 2 guild mergers, there's been a ton of shamen, especially ones higher level than mine.  But I'm still sorta the primary alchemist, and getting others hooked into it a little more.  The sheer versatility is amazing, and the spellset commands have made spell switching a LOT less irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">It's odd, I had never really felt an affinity towards &quot;priest&quot; type classes. Through all the D&amp;D and Shadowrun sessions, the countless MUDs, I only ever played one priest.<br />
<br />
About three years ago, an old MUD friend of mine told me to get EQ. I resisted as any good MUD player does but finally relented. Per his instructions, I created a Barbarian Shaman on Lanys (that's what he was playing). She was left behind because I simply couldn't stand being a Barbarian (and some moron kept following me around) but Shaman was the only class I knew (hehe, I got to level 6) so when I recreated a character, it was the logical choice. <br />
<br />
Being a Shaman was my introduction to EQ. I didn't know about slowing or canni-dancing or that we got a pet. All I knew was that playing one (in lizard form) felt right. <br />
<br />
I've taken a break here and there, even managed to level a Rogue to 60 but I always end up back with a Shaman of some sort. It simply fits me, no real way to explain it other then that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Klimdab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">When I first started playing eq, I made a halfling druid. I ran him with my girlfriends halfling warrior and we had a lot of fun with these two. As I got into the 50s with my druid my gf was telling me how much she loved playing her monk and that I should make a character to run with her. I knew exactly what class to make... Shaman was it. I had once seen a lvl 60 monk and shaman at the gate of chardok tearing thru everything and I knew then there was great power in that duo. Well as we lvled I grew to love my shaman more and more and my love for the druid declined each day. Got the druid to 63 and got really burned out with him. The day chardok b came out I was 55 and that was the day my shaman became my main and I have never looked back. Now being lvl 64 its so much easier having a slower at all times (that was our biggest problem before, never had a slower). So now I run with my girlfriends warrior and monk, life as a shaman is so much better.</div></div><hr />

Bought the $9.99 crack in a box version of EQ, loaded on my puter to see what all the fuss was.  Made a human pally that dropped me in Freeport.  After wandering around in Freeport for about an hour getting lost over and over, finally went out to the newbie zone and got killed over and over.  Thought &quot;this game sucks ass but I'll give it one more chance&quot;... made a barbarian shaman, went into everfrost, didn't get nearly as lost, and 2 years later, still stay far away from Freeport since I can't find my way around there without a map.  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I first started playing in aug of 99 ..... man its been a while :)<br />
created Locodraco (highelf paladin) and played him to 51 ....<br />
then avout the time of velious I started my second char ....<br />
Locoiguanna (lezzard monkey!)and played him till 45......<br />
then last year i revisted an old shaman i had made a Barb shammy named frostoak and played him to about 22-3 I hated being night blind <br />
so i rerolled him as a Kittyrat and thus was born Frostpaw Icytail currently lv 61 and holding was going to go to 65 but with Ldon and the lvs that are groupable I've decided to keep him at that lv due to the lv range of my guild (been with them off and on sience oct 99  :eek: ) but oh man 62 is sooooo close  :) <br />
but its been a fun ride the paladin was fun for a while but its a pain getting a group , the monk is still fun but the shaman beats em all  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Same as Rorgg.<br />

My friends were playing either elves (which I despise) or cute little female chars.<br />
<br />
I wanted something as far away from that as possible, so I chose Oger.  Only had 3 classes to pick from, so I picked Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My main originally was a monk.  The reason for the monk was that I could ignore gear and still end up with the best weapons in the game.  <br />
<br />
Kunark comes out.  My monk is soloing in Overthere, mostly fear kiting and bumming SoW from a shaman fighting near by.  I get a tell: &quot;Want to partner?&quot;  Sure, what the heck.<br />
<br />
And proceeded to mow through everthing.<br />
<br />
Wow!<br />
<br />
Askaa started as a twink.  I gave him enough cash to do smithing and made banded, then had him make the Imbued Cabilis Scale stuff by the time he was 20.  He and a wizard were alts to the monk, but I found myself more and more playing the alts because it was a lot easier to be anti-social with them than with the monk (i.e., log on, kill a few things, no worries about a group, log off).  <br />
<br />
The monk stalled out at 55 almost 2 years ago.  The wizard is 63 and the shaman is 61.  Either one could kill anything the monk could kill 5 to 10 levels sooner with less risk and less downtime.  Either one can get a group easier.  And if there is an excess of shaman around, there is NEVER too many wizards.</div></div><hr />

But got me set up and on my way to freeport safely. (Great thanks to those two, can't believe I forgot their names /sigh).<br />

Anyways got to freeport to meet the co-worker who got me into the game so we could group together, he decides to play another character and I have a string of horrible luck with my monk (died to poison more often that I care to think about).<br />

I got bored one night and created Sownow (fully expecting a name change) was going to level hi mto 9 and sit him in EC/WF selling sow. Well I got jack and squat in that endevor co I played with him a bit ad plateaued about lvl 18 still not really know much about the game as i like to solo a lot.<br />
<br />
then I created a bard played him for about 4 months and got him to 35 and a full set of lambent (man I felt uber) and then groups started petering out. left game for 6 months and came back and tried the bard and realized I want to chat and dont want cramps after 3 hours of twisting each night.<br />
So I came  back to Sownow and now with a greater understanding of the game I zoomed sownow to 35 in a few weeks (no pl involved) <br />

It's been 3 almost 4 years now Sownow is 65 adn 40 AA's and i wouldnt think of playing anything else.<br />

I wanted to be just like him... so I made a barbarian shaman.  When kunark came out, I wanted to be an Iksar, but still liked being a shaman.  And so Slurm was hatched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I first started playing Everquest on the Rathe in May/June of 2000 after being talked into by a RL friend of mine.  I started by trying a druid, which I abandoned after 5 levels, then made human monk which got to all of 12th level, an Erudite Wizzie that made it to level 8, before settling on a half-elf Pally that made it to an amazing 15th level.  Then I quit the game (shortly before Velious was released) and didn't come back until Luclin came out.  When I came back, I started a wood elf Ranger which I twinked with all the gear the paladin had that was usable before deleting the pally.  The ranger made it all the way to level 33 and was the toon that was my main when I joined my guild.  The ranger, however, was a pain at that level since groups were hard to come by and I wasn't great at soloing with him.  So I started a DE Necro which was the first toon I really LOVED.  I soloed that Necro all the way up to 53.  <br />
<br />
Then, one day they took down the Rathe for maintenance and I went to play with some other friends on the Zeb server (this was just before the release of PoP).  I was in the mood for something different, so I tried a barb shaman for 2 reasons.. 1) it was a good race and I was tired of being KoS all over and 2) it could cast from level 1 whereas the BL class didn't cast till level 9.  I got that shaman to all of level 5 in the few hours that the Rathe was down, but it didn't matter much, because I was hooked.  The next day on the Rathe I started a Barb Shaman alt and twinked him up.  I haven't looked back since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">ahh.. good times.<br />
<br />
I always use to play role playing games, and everytime that I did it, I would create a warrior and use him.  I love the warrior class in every other game, so when I stared EQ it was the natural first choice.  I played him for a few weeks until I realized the suckiness of them.  I mean, I hated the fact that I had to rely on other people to keep me alive.  At level 6 i couldn't even solo anything anymore, so it really sucked.  I hated being in EC or wherever and looking through all the classes that were there hoping that I could find someone that could sow/buff me (ahhh. the memories of sitting there and asking every class tryin to figure out who could and who couldn't buff).  One day while I was in oasis at level 17, this shaman asked me if I wanted to duo with him.  I did and he just amazed me that he could melee better than me (i had really crappy weapons and he was hitting harder, although not faster), he could sow and buff me, and he could also heal me.  I ended up playing the warrior to level 23 and got basically stuck in Loio with no one around to sow me and I was too scared to make the run back to FV (damn spiders).  Right around that time a girlfriend came into my life and I quit playing.<br />
<br />
Fast forward 6 months later, bunch of RL friends started playing, girlfriend is gone, I created a shaman on another server with them and I haven't looked back.  I love playing him so much that in about 1 1/2 years I just finally created an alt to play around with and I still haven't done much with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I started EQ shortly after Velious. Before EQ I was Freeform RPing on AOL with my sisters, keeping up on my writing skills and such, before the d00ds started invading it. My sister moved on, and after a while she started telling me about this fun new game called Everquest. I didn't want an addiction, nor did I want to pay $50 for a game. So I told her if the price ever dropped, I'd pick it up.<br />
<br />
Well, next week they introduced EQ Classic for $10. Yay! :\<br />
<br />
I made a Helven Warrior and wound up in Kelethin. I wanted to beat things up and see in the dark. Well, he makes it to level 10 after about 20 CRs. I was bored. I scrapped him. I started a Helven Paladin. Now *this* kicked ass. Leveled him up to 60 playing with my sister, her husband (that she met in our first guild), and one of our old friends she brought into the game as well. Well, her husband 4-boxed Chanter, Monk, Druid, and Necro. He'd sit one out of group when my sister wanted to play her Bard with her Cleric.<br />
<br />
He sucked at slowing.<br />
<br />
After my gajillionth death to his not seeing the resist on the screen, I got fed up and decided to make a slower of my own to handle this problem. I fixed up my old writing PC and tried to decide on Chanter or Shaman. Chanter was tempting for the mind-candy, but I wanted someone who could last if I needed to focus on the Paladin ... and thus I made Tripoldi Vondahbrah, my personal buffbot and slower. <br />
<br />
I've been slowly leveling her up and learning the intricacies of the class, until I decided to start joining her up with the Paladin. Now she's making a rush to 62 so she can replace him as my main in our guild ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>DoTheMonkDance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">in 99 started a ranger and got to lvl 15. Then i realized i was never going to go far with a ranger *ducks* so i started a druid in 2000 =) (btw this was before there were DROOIDS all over the place) got to 50 and spent 2000-2001 helping my friends get into the game and enjoy it unlike i did and said hey i need my life back so i took a break until 2003 and started my necro/34 monk/46 and due to the fact that i get antisocial started a shammy on a 2nd account (that isnt being power leveled, just good ol' homegrown) to assist my necro and monk. I love the power that the experienced shammy has, i honestly would take a shaman who knows what they are doing in a group over a cleric anyday. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Freecare_Spiritwise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">My first toon was a HE wizard. I didn't know anything about the game and didn't have any friends, so I decided to just solo. At about lvl 20 I realized that I was tired of getting killed every day because I couldn't outrun the mobs, and I was sick of begging for sow's.<br />
<br />
All I wanted was my own sow. I didn't care about anything else really, so I rolled a shaman because they got it at lvl 9. Unlike my wizard, who nobody wanted to group with, everyone wanted to group with my shaman. I made some great friends and never looked back.<br />
<br />
So it was just dumb luck that I created probably the best class in the game. People talk about class envy and class balancing but I know of at least 10 people who created shaman because they saw what mine can do.<br />
<br />
Now I'm lvl 62 and it's still every bit as fun as when I started. Still no topor (have malo), but at least now my wizzy has and endless supply of sow potions to solo with!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The first time I played EQ, back pre-expansions, I was a necro. I chose a necro then because I could solo (limited play time then, not so much now) and because necros were often looked for to help with CR's back in the days when you often didn't know the zone you were in.<br />
<br />
When I came back, I recreated a necro, and was doing quite well, but no one needed me to locate their corpse. I could solo no problem, but I couldn't help out the average random person like I used to. Then a friend came to buff me and pull Dervs for me. He showed up with his 54 Troll Shaman, and my Necro has only had about 5 hours play time since.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love helping people, and the shaman lets me do that. I've spent entire days wandering around casting heals on people at 30% with their opponent still up around 70%. Or buffing in the tunnels, or doing CR's (as long as they could tell me where it was...couldn't locate them any more).<br />
<br />
Plus, I could still solo...better than before, really, since my heals weren't dependant on something nearby to kill.<br />
<br />
Of course, being a shaman means I always have a group if I want, as well...but so does having a good guild. I do *not* do pick up groups. Every time I do, I regret it, so I just *don't* anymore. If no one in my guild or alliance shows up to group, I'll just solo, thanks.<br />

Rolled my Shaman and have loved it ever since.  I picked a Barbarian because my first toon was an Ogre and I wanted a good character to just be able to visit different places.  I chose Shaman because I wanted someone that was great solo and in groups.</div></div><hr />

I played a pure caster, and was tired of not being able to melee, I played a pure melee, and was tired of not being able to cast.  I played pure healers, and was bored with &quot;just buffing/healing&quot;...<br />

At that time, all I was really concerned about how the models looked, and I didn't like any of them but the Iksars, so what was the only Iksar class with SoW? A Shaman.  So, I made one and liked it pretty well.  I actually put all my starting points into everything but WIS, though... XD Hey, I was a newb.  Anyway, I got that shaman to 28 and the lack of a mana pool was just too much.  Got way too hard, so I restarted him.  Now, I've got him to 52, though now, he lacks HP and AC. XD Too poor to upgrade, too... Still, he's one of two chars (Other is a 26 Iksar BST.) and my favorite of them both.  Sure, I've tried other classes (Got that first Monk to 38 and gave up on her... She was horrible.) but none of them compared to my good ol' Shaman. I just hope I can get him to 65 one day...</div></div><hr />

There wasn't alot of information available yet- May 99- but I saw a class that could do all sorts of stuff : Haste, Heal, Damage, buff etc. Looked like ti would complement the warrior nicely. The Stat buffs were huge compared to the known bonuses available on equipment. Plus I got armor and 2h weapons, regen and the Frenzy line. I kinda thought I'd be some battle priest- buff the fighters up, haste them, and then be able to berzerk and wade into battle with them. Kinda a battle priest if you would. <br />
Didn't quite work out that way.<br />
<br />
While the versitility of the Shaman and Smert's status still makes him my main sink of my limited playing time, but my SK runs second. <br />
<br />
Oh and I chose troll because it was supposed to be harder, but the Regen looked like a really cool trade off. Plus I loved the bit in the manual about a wall of regerating green flesh bearing down on someone. <br />

I started eq the first month or 2 it came out and started a rogue, as I was conviced (back then of all things) that I could be the most damage dealing class in the game.  After getting him to level 40 the grind of non stop grouping, grouping, crossing my fingers for a good freaking group I retired cold turkey from the game for about 2 years (RL issues, missed the game horribly). After getting back into gaming (loved FFX), and getting into mainstream I wanted back in.<br />
<br />
With the pain of begging for a sow everywhere I went, and having to beg to get into groups all the time I *had* to have a class that could solo from 1-65, and solo well. I was sick of dieing every night also. The rogue was painful no doubt.  I spent alot of time researching when I finally found this message board and fell in love with the shamans.<br />
<br />
I've soloed almost every level, and grouped when I felt like getting my social fix. Love it, just love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I had a 55 Warrior who was going nowhere fast. Not able to earn money for upgrades, guild apathetic about helping with raids for drops, not wanted in groups because as we well know they can't hold aggro. So I decided to make a tradeskill alt to make him some cultural armor hoping it would help me down the right path. I looked at the best class/race combination for smithing and came across Ogre Shaman. High starting Str, plus our own buffs made it a natural. Also I'm on FV and was in an evil only guild at the time which made it even more natural.<br />
Well, I made the mistake of actually playing him for a while (initially just to get high enough to imbue jade for smithing), and fell in love with the class. How liberating to be able to gate out of bad places, sow yourself for traveling, and solo whenever you want. I'm now 55 with 6 AA's and the warrior is stricktly a means of farming green mobs for tradeskill drops (having no mana to run out of IS and advantage there).<br />
I've played a Ranger, 2 Druids, Monk, and baby Necro and Bard. Shaman in IMHO the best class out there.</div></div><hr />

But anyway the ONLY ability that ever made me excited was a 51 shaman slow .. its amazing to see a mob going from hitting like a mac truck to like an cleric =)  My shaman' s ability to make the impossible possible is an amazing thing.  <br />
<br />
I have played a necro, rogue, monk, cleric, warrior, wiz all past 50 ... they were all fun .. but I wish that I had picked shaman a long time ago.  There is nothing about a shaman that I dont like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Jenoah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I havent been playing all that long, a little over a month.  But I started with a half-elf ranger and dumped him when he got to lvl 4 cause I got so bored (not to mention I knew nothing of the game).  Then I searched thru the classes and found an SK which I thought was INSANE!  So I made a DE SK.  Leveling was painfully slow, even with a group at lower lvl's.  That is until I reached lvl 9 and got my spells.  Then I started having fun with the SK.  Around that time a Troll Shaman took me into Lavastorm and taught me the ways of being an SK.  Convinced I was the best tank ever, I headed over the PC and found a few groups to play with.  Well after I reached lvl 17, I decided that I hated being beaten up on and depending on someone to heal me.  When things got hairy, everyone either gated out or ran.  I was usually the first to die and retrieving a corpse in PC is hell.  And going solo is such a slllloooooowwwww way to lvl up when you're sitting around waiting for yourself to heal.<br />
<br />
So again I searched thru the classes and remembered that Troll Shaman with all the buffs, slows, and SOW!! Ok, this would be my next class.  I chose a barbarian cause if I ran out of mana I could just beat the mob to death.  I was amazed at how quickly I lvl'd Jenoah.  And going solo is great! All I have to do is root and DoT and sit while I regain mana.  Then before the root fades, I'll slow and beat the hell out of the mob.  If things get too scary I either gate or run away.<br />
<br />
I think I'm just ramabling now but I just wanted to say that my Shaman has become my main toon.  I'll still play the SK when I feel like letting out some fustration, but I enjoy the Shaman a whole lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Basically, when I started playing, I created 3 or so other characters before my shaman. I'd make a character, go out into the newbie zone, and try to kill stuff. Well, I could not kill a single mob with any of the first ones, I kept getting my ass handed to me (almost quit the game even I was so frustrated lol). So I made my shaman, and I finally was able to take a few down. So, I kept him, got used to him, started to like him, and he's still my main character, and in fact have never bothered to level any other class past 30 or so. The main reason for that though is I am on FV, where you can only have one character, and I really didn't feel like starting on a new server, and I liked the RP atmosphere and the no drop rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I played a necro, bard, pally and a shammy into their 20's before I settled on the shammy. Sow was the main reason back then. I really liked the necro but didn't want to camp Najena for the jboots. Bard speed was great but twisting songs was hard on my wrists. It was all about speed for me back then.

I didn't mind playing a support class, so I agreed to play a healer in the duo.  Which one, was the question.  Cleric.... hmmm too one-dimensional, and my friend was playing a warrior, so I realized we would need some more utility than a cleric could offer.  Druid... cool... I could heal, SoW, port, etc.  I played the druid up until level 9... we went into the Qeynos sewers... that's when I found my best nuke at that level only worked outdoors.  Well, I like dungeon crawls, so that was out of the question.  I made Harwel and deleted the druid.  Best. Move. Ever. :D<br />
<br />
Honestly I've found I enjoy playing Bards more... but between carpal tunnel syndrome, the inability to socialize, and the better functionality of shamans in a duo or small group, shaman almost always wins the &quot;what character do I play today&quot; contest.</div></div><hr />

Turned out our guild was suddenly very short on shamans so switched to Popu primarily and ground out to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I started playing EQ in July of '99. My first character that I really played in earnest was a Barbarian Shaman. I had two friends that bought EverQuest around the same time I did and we all decided we wanted to be Barbarians. One went Warrior, another chose Rogue, so I decided I'd be a Shaman since it was the only class we didn't have.<br />
<br />
I leveled that Shaman up to 19 generally enjoyed playing him. I loved being able to solo with DoTs and I could tank fairly well, so I was pretty happy. Then for some crazy reason I went through a long phase of trying out melee characters - I went through a Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, and back to Rogue again. I liked none of them nearly as much as I liked playing my Shaman, but while trying those melee classes out, I learned the value of having extra HP. So I started a new Shaman, this time as an Ogre, and I've been happy ever since. I'll never go back to playing anything else. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Well, I started playing Everquest right at it's release - And those of us who did also know what a pain THAT was :).<br />
<br />
About 2 - 2.5 years ago, I left the game and only recently came back a few months ago.<br />
<br />
But when I had started, I had literally played EVERY class.  My first was a monk - and wow was that boring. :)  I thought, &quot;Hey, i'm a martial artist in real life, i'll be a monk, it'll be cool!&quot; - wrong. :)    (Monks are great classes now, but they had problems back then, and face it - The 'special moves' are STILL as boring as watching a rock erode)<br />
<br />
Monk didn't last long... Ranger about to level 23.  But a GM changed my name, and since I was attached to that name, I went in a slump and gave up.  Yadda yadda ..<br />
<br />
Shaman was the very last class I picked.  Why?  I dont know.  I guess I looked at the description (Because there weren't many sites with good information around then, and lets face it - most of it was wrong.).  They were a healing class, but not as good as clerics.. damage spells, but not as good as ANY of the pure casters..   I figured them to be a 3rd rate class at best and dismissed them until the very end.<br />
<br />
Boy was I wrong!<br />
<br />
I started a barbarian shaman because I didn't want the hassle of getting killed everywhere, and back then they had the best wisdom (Currently with POK there is so little stigma to being evil that it's sad, really.  The benefits you got were SUPPOSED to be offset big time.. but thats another rant.)<br />
<br />
I remember now knowing what the DOTs were :D  That was great, heh.  Everfrost was an awesome zone, I remember, and I didn't hardly ever leave it.  Mammoths fell before my might.  I could heal, I could root.  SOW! Good gods, being able to cast sow myself even NOW is almost essential.  I have my alts, but it still gets frustrating not having it in the spellbook. (Yeah, now i can buy/make sow potions, but it's not the same.)<br />
<br />
The Shaman didn't last too long, because I was getting frustrated about being outleveled by EVERYONE, and when the server Brell Serilis came about, I moved to there and started anew, as Barnabas (If anyone from there would actually remember, which I doubt), and I got all the way to level 54 before RL time constraints became too great and I quit, just before the release of Velious.<br />
<br />
Now, after coming back from that after 3 years, so much has changed it's sick.  I read up on the Beastlord, and being the only class I knew nothing about, decided to jump right in.  It seemed to be a class that acted just like how I played my Shaman - melee with pet support and utility.  And thats true, but there is a LOT of differences.   Inevitably, I re-made a Shaman and i'm currently level 35 and rising (very slowly, I might add)<br />
<br />
I rolled up on Fironia Vie because, well I like roleplaying (It happens every so often... More often then other servers, at least), and the loot code seemed great for me.  I'm not a hardcore player and I doubt i'll be in many raids.  I like the idea of having the option to buy what I want.  It means I dont have to powergame and sacrifice my life again, like what happened to my old Shaman. :)<br />
<br />
Well thats about it, really.  <br />

<br />
My Shaman is my reason to be anti-social.  I made him an Iksar so I could roleplay him that way, and still now I do very little grouping with him.  He is probably one of the biggest reasons I still play this game, since I can always be doing SOMETHING with him.  I don't have to wait for a group to take pity on the Warrior and invite him to come along.<br />

I read the whole book that came with the game before I made a character. Battlepriest that had decent melee and spells sounded great, and had to be a Barbarian because of Tribunal and Justice uncompromised by subjective concepts of &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;. Abividad was my main for over a year and soloing up I became addicted to &quot;In Teh Face&quot; tanking for dogdog. Well I didn't get to do that so much anymore, and combined with the fact that our small guild had about 25% of it's members as Shaman led to my creating a Warrior. It's great to be able to say that I can tank big bad mobs, but I also know that it's really a team effort that's letting me do that. I get no bigger feeling of acomplishment personally in the game than taking that train of 4 and turning it to kittens with slow and saving the day(OMG I have a power complex or something *LOL*).

The shaman &quot;story&quot; just captured my imagination and continues to do so. I did not end up being the big roleplayer I thought I would be, but I still love the concept behind my character. I wanted to be a good race who occasionally did &quot;evil&quot; things, but was generally trying her best to make her way into the world and do what was right. I wanted to be misunderstood, a little dark, a little gruff, kind of quiet and...grave. I admit I did misunderstand how faction works; I thought as a shaman I would be welcome in the evil cities, but found out quickly it doesn't work quite that way :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I started a WE ranger 3.5 years ago and played him almost exclusively up until about 6 months ago.  He is level 65, 90-ish AA, and well equipped.  I was in a raiding guild that raided pretty much every night.  One day I looked around and decided that I just wasn't having fun anymore.  Sure, I could raid, and raid, and raid, and maybe get an upgrade that had a couple extra stats than something I was already wearing, but raiding was getting old.  My best EQ friends (2 from RL as well) were not even in my guild, so I could rarely group with them.  I looked around at my &quot;friends&quot; in my guild and realized that they aren't really friends.  We were just together in order to advance.  I was nothing more than DPS to the great majority of them.  At this point I felt that there was nothing more in the game for my ranger, so I pretty much quit playing him.  Something that I couldn't have previously imagined, giving up my ranger, happened overnight and it felt right.<br />
<br />
Over the years, I had alts, but none made it over level 30.  There was a warrior, rogue, druid, mage, and necro.  I looked at them and didn't have any real desire to play any of them.  I looked into other games, tried a few, but none really held my interest for more than a couple weeks.  At this point, one of my RL friends set aside his high-level cleric, and started over with a paladin.  I decided to make a new character and group with him.  My thoughts were either an enchanter, shaman, or cleric.  Honestly, I couldn't stand the idea of doing nothing but heal (cleric), nor did I like the fragility of an enchanter, so shaman was the logical choice.<br />
<br />
Both his paladin and my shaman were twinked and we knew how to play the game.  We had a blast crawling through dungeons and holding camps that back in the day took a full group and higher level than us to do.  Occasionally, we would add a 3rd or 4th to our group, usually other friends.  EQ was fun again.<br />
<br />
About 2 months ago, work got really crazy for my friend, and he stopped playing.  Also, he now has a baby on the way and he decided to quit EQ.  Actually, he now rarely has any time to play anything.  However, I have really enjoyed playing a shaman and I am not ready to call it quits on him.  He made it to level 56 without even trying to level, it was just that fun.  The shaman can take almost any situation or group that would fail, and make it succeed.  <br />
<br />
Since my pally friend stopped playing, I have mostly solo'ed, but the solo game is so dang boring.  So now and then I put up an LFG tag, and do pickup groups.  Almost all the invites are for LDoN with a few in PoP tier1, since nobody does dungeons anymore.  Heh, actually, few people that I have met in pickup groups have the SKILLS to do dungeons.  Occasionlly, I will run across a gem, but most are complete idiots.  I don't mean to sound like an ass, but its true.  For example, there was a cleric that thought it was more mana efficent to chain stun a mob than to CH the tank, and then wonder why he got aggro on every other mob and had no mana.  There was the paladin that tanked with a mace/shield and no spells and wondered why he couldn't keep aggro. When I politely asked him to stun for aggro, he said he had no mana unless he had c3.  I could go on with countless other examples, but there is no point.<br />
<br />
I am sorry that this post got so long, but you got me thinking. :)  Anyway, shamans are so much fun because of their utility and staying power.  I discovered the class late in the game, but I love it.  Hehe, actually, it is a similar play style to that of a ranger, which also brings a ton of utility, just in a different way.  On a side note, if you are in a family guild on Povar that has experienced players that like to group together, but has no desire to become a raiding guild, send me a tell please.  My shaman needs a home.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Started in August '99 with a dwarf paladin, got him to lvl 9 or so before i discovered how to use LoH. First time I used LoH I completely healed the mob i was fighting - and I got wasted naturally<br />
<br />
Gave up on him in disgust and realised I wanted SoW for those situations and discovered shamans got the spell at level 9. Race, that was easy - I wanted to be an 800 lb, 12 foot tall creature that could sprint around overtaking everything else :)<br />
<br />
Didn't even know about slow until I hit my mid 20's, the lower level slows didn't seem to do much at all :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Tribe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I started a shaman because shaman are just like the Druid+100AA that I had. Except that shaman aren't broken and are actually usefull in groups. Charm Nerfs, ZEM nerfs, Group EXP bonuses, killed druids in the face.<br />
<br />
PoF Group:<br />
tank: can somene stun this healer pls!<br />
rogue: um no one here can...<br />
you tell the group: druid, can't you use your stun on these things?<br />
druid: no, they are too high level<br />
you tell the group: that figures<br />

There was this tall Barbarian there who saved my life, after that he buffed me.. I felt like a god, my HPs, str and other stats all hit the roof. <br />
He was level 49 which was insane at that time, only a few people had hit level 50 at that point. I started a shaman the next day. I enjoyed buffing people, and making em go wow!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Started playing the week EQ came out. Wanted to play a troll because I love playing the bad guy and the underdog. Im a long time roleplayer and I have always had a love for the spiritual based classes in games and hence it was the most natural choice for me. Troll Shaman.<br />
Like many who started with this class...I have never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Shaman are the tank mage of EQ.  We get the armor, we get the heals, we got so so melee, we can dot, sow, got a pet, petburn.<br />
<br />
Only things we are missing is the deathtouch/lure dots = true curse, mana steal dots, spirit dance (necros have it, we should as witch doctor).<br />
<br />
Other then that, shaman are superior we can do it all, almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I had started with a Warrior but was tired on depending on everyone else. I wanted some good casting abilities and be able to still fight and take a beating if I had to. I also needed a class that I could solo with if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I wanted to be a barbarian like my two friends who started playing at the same time. Shaman seemed the most fun :) Spells and stuff :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Sangori Sanspeur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">In the fall of 2000 my husband and his friend had started an Erudite enchanter and paladin and had run them over to Everfrost after a few levels.  They finally convinced me to try playing EQ, so I sat down at the computer to ponder my character.<br />
<br />
Watching over my husband's shoulder I absolutely loved the idea of playing a big, hulking, 6 foot + tall barbarian female since I'm the complete opposite in real life.  I started a warrior and realized after about 5 minutes of watching newbie shamans tear through twice as many mobs as me and nuking and healing that I had chosen the wrong class.  I made Sangori a few minutes later and she's been my main since.<br />
<br />
I have alts that are always a nice change of pace now and again, but my shaman is really what has kept me playing Everquest through the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Started with a kitty warrior about a year ago.  Got to level 12 and got really frustrated, as I knew no one and solo'd.  For an untwinked level 12 warrior that means engage at full health, kill with about 25% hp left, then sit for 10 minutes to heal.<br />
<br />
Ugh.<br />
<br />
A RL friend was also playing (he got me into the game) and had a shaman, so I tried it, since I could ask him advice.<br />
<br />
Never looked back.<br />
<br />
Now he asks me for advice.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">I think my first toon was a mage. I rememer sitting in BB and i was gettign around the teens i think when i grouped with a caster that has this huge staff with a big knot on the end of it, i mean it seemed massive. Anyway, he was hitting with big numberws and was healing and casting spells. I thought he was the uberist of the uber.<br />
<br />
 65 levels later i still do my best to play like that shaman i met in BB. A casting meleer lol. Kinda hard at 65, but i still try when i can. See that was what kept me in the shaman, i could cast and be chilled or i can stand up and lay the smack down. The day they change me being able to play that still, whether its uber efficent , number one best shaman way or not, ill hang up my bearskin hat cap.<br />
<br />
Also, i have always has a real life attraction to the spirit realm,indians,enlightenment and shamanistic things, so it just seems to fit me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I started My shaman Because two of my friends started a Rogue and a Warrior. My first character was a Mage. and the esperience turned me off playing Int casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Started playing spring/summer last year.  Initially played a half elf paladin, because I always play paladins.  Had a pair of friends, a druid and a beastlord that I regularly grouped with.  I had no idea at the time just how good a combo that is (I do now :D).  All I knew at the time, was that it seemed like I was the drag on the group.  Either of the two could outfight me anytime.  Add to that it took forever for me to run anywhere (at least till I bought pop) and forever to get back from there, and the writing was on the wall.<br />
So, I cycled through a number of characters on other servers, until I was ready to choose a 'permanent' class.  Was a very close call between monk and shaman.  But the shaman won out mainly because of sow and gate.  That and I didn't have enough plat to make a monk :D<br />
So, Cyrenn the shaman was created april of this year, and is now 62.  He's stalled at the moment, while I play with my monk alt.  Went with vah shir because all the shamans seemed to be barbarians.  Of course, every shaman since that time has been made a cat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Honestly?  I wanted to play a caster-type, and I wanted to be an Ogre.<br />
<br />
That was pretty much the entirety of the thought process behind it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly my thought process too. Never before had I seen a gam where I could play an ogre!  But I wanted to cast, too. So shaman it was!<br />
<br />
I did ogre shaman in phase 4, and then again when I finally quit UO totally in October of 1999. Made another Ogre shaman, Gruog.<br />
<br />
I played only ogre shaman through level 24 (right when shaman peter out some) and started a &quot;twink&quot; dwarf pally. (twink = bronze armor and fine steel weapons back then!)  I was fighting with him and kept getting stunned all the time. I was like &quot;*** dorfs suck&quot;.  But I started reading and everyone gets stunned. But I never had as an Ogre because of the frontal immunity, and since i only had played ogres till then I didnt know any better !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Maerrec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Well, back in the Summer of '03 I decided to finally get into EverQuest because I had a few friends who played it, my best friend played a Cleric and I used to watch him play, but never got really interested because playing a Cleric looked boring to no end. Then he told me there were many other classes... :-\<br />
<br />
So I was looking at two classes, Beasty and Shaman. I didn't want to play a Beasty because I remember the old television show &quot;Beast Master&quot; and that guy always seemed on the feminine side to me, and I heard that Shamans get SoW before Beasties, so thats it. Found CastersRealm, and in turn found this place... I've been reading these forums religiously since I found them about 4 months ago, but never posted. Finally made 57 on my Shaman today and haven't looked back... so very very glad I didn't choose Bst.<br />
<br />
Reasons why I wouldn't ever play another class:<br />
<br />
Cause if the (insert idiot puller here) grabs too many Mobs, I don't panic even though everyone else is.<br />
<br />
Cause if I do have to panic and get out ASAP, I got my SoW!! :)<br />
<br />
Soloed half my epic :-\<br />
<br />
I'm always doing something, whether Canni-ing or re-rooting/rotting parked mob or slowing new mob or saving MH's arse or ect, ect, ect<br />
<br />
Can grind through dungeons by my loansome and then take the boss.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Ogres can only be SKs, Shamans, or Warriors.  Shaman get a cool doggie pet.  That was pretty much the entirety of the decision-making process for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">My main is a necro, got into a group once with a shaman who was not only slowing but was the main healer as well.  Middle of the fight, the warrior went LD, I figured we'd wait for him to get back before resuming pulling, no way!  Shaman stepped in and started tanking too.  Blew me away to say the least.  Now he was in the best guild on my server but I was nonetheless impressed enough to start a shaman as an alt.  Got her to level 30 and realized the things I could do if I could hydra her with my necro.  My friend had just quit EQ and gave me his account, started up a Barb shaman and whenever I have time hydra the both of them.  <br />
<br />
If I were to give up my necro and play another class exclusively, it would be a shaman no doubt.</div></div><hr />
