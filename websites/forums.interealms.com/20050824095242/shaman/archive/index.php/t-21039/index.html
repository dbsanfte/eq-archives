<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thats just stupid to nerf items that have been in the game for that long. ANd as far as sow potions go, thats gonna ruin the market for em since mostly they are used by people twinking. Guess they wanna make shaman's even more useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">After they actually nerf the items (when the required level takes effect), no one will be able to argue that anyone on the dev team is actually competent anymore.<br />
<br />
Of all the stupid nerfs I've seen since I've started playing, I think the SOW potion nerf will be the lamest.  Next thing you know, they will add a recommended level to fungi tunic and the regen effect will scale from 0-15 (the code to do this is in the game right now btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The description is all that has changed, the items HAVE NOT CHANGED. There are no new required levels.<br />
<br />
You people who are whining can stop now.<br />
<br />
They added the effect level to the description of all items with effects. They messed up by calling it a &quot;required level&quot; since a lot of effect levels are not the required level. This info has been available in Lucy for a long time, it's just been added to the description in game.<br />
<br />
As far as SoW potions, the effect level &quot;25&quot; is irrelevant. I just checked again today, SoW potions are based on the level of the drinker as always. At level 1, they add 30% run speed and last a piddly 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />
