<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess im only posting this just because, but anyways, i was wondering what should i do with my cash next<br />
<br />
My magelo(also in sig): http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=371719<br />
<br />
Anyway, i was considering a horsie, i could probably farm up a decent bit of cash in HHK, just killing every gaurd i see(or doing bards nobles), and selling to the in zone merchant on mage faction.  I was also considering a few minor upgrades, or just saving for 60 spells flat out, but was thinking about getting the horse now, because i can always sell it back for a small loss.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.. a few questions about horses.  I heard that if you have ALL luclin models off, you can use the horse, and still get the same standing med effect, while still being able to run at sow speed.  Is this true?  Does this include vah shir models?  Can you duck out of spells if its like this, or still unable to duck, like on a horse normally?<br />
<br />
So, if anyone has answers to those questions, and or gear upgrade suggestions, i'd love to hear them.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Replace sentry bracer with Coldain Military Bracer (quest - dead easy)<br />
<br />
Replace spider fur belt with Chitinous Belt<br />
<br />
Replace one ring with Shadel Bandit (group in FG or buy)<br />
<br />
Replace Tattered Mantle with Elder wolf hide (camp in HSM or buy)<br />
<br />
Replace ivory earring with Earring of purity or cleansing, or if plenty cash, earring of solstice<br />
<br />
There will be those who disagree with me, but IMO at level 55 the Ikky BP is getting to its use by date, I suggest selling it and upgrading to full fungi, or just a good AC / stats BP (phase spider carapace, or similar) - or camp KD arena for Runecrafters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been meaning to get the Coldain Bracer actually.  I did do everything up to the final turn in with my guildmate, but then he quit the game before we were able to get the brood mother up, and i havent gotten around to it since, lol.<br />
<br />
Will change the belt i think, I am needing much more wis, though i do like the HP.<br />
<br />
Been meaning to get the Shadel sooner or later.<br />
<br />
HSM = ?  howling stones?  That would be a nice upgrade though i think.<br />
<br />
No cash for solstice at the moment.  Im going to snatch the first purity/cleansing earring i see at an acceptable price.<br />
<br />
Next BP upgrade will be a vindi if im lucky enough/in high enough standing with the Guild :)  Too bad we generally farm vindi on tuesday's, when my play time is next to nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply Weyalan :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, HSM = Hollow Shade Moor (maybe Hollowshade Moor) on Luclin. This Wolfhide is an easy camp - dropping of a named wolf that spawns in the cave on the East side of the zone. It can be combined with camping the Ceremonial Smudging Stick, which drops off the grimling chief on the south side of the zone, which is even easier, but long and dull.<br />
<br />
Just a quiet word to consider on the earring of purity versus earring of cleansing....If I recall correctly, all the Velious quest legs (Thurgy, KD, Skyshrine) all have a right clickable &quot;abolish disease&quot; on them - so you may wish to get the cure poison earring and let your legs do the walking....The earrings are not that hard to get if you are on a blue server - drop in Cardok, however, im on a red server, and it is quite hard for my non-uber guild to zerg Chardok and hold it for long enough to get em heh heh.</div></div><hr />
