<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tired a full on ambush/backstab build, using a level 57 dagger, 87 damage, not much higher you can get.<br />
<br />
<br />
I specced back within a matter of a couple hours. Good lord they are weak in pve, and with the exception of casters in certain situations, they are weak in pvp as well. I was using the best dagger I could get, an 87 damage level 57 dagger, had all the + to crit and so forth, damage was just awful.<br />
<br />
Yes, a cold blooded ambush is nice, on cloth casters. But an average non-crit backstab is less than an average SS with mace. A crit backstab is more, but not terribly much more. I lose the mace stun, I lose alot of damage in the off hand, I lose 5% dodge and parry from the combat tree. I lose blade fury and adrenaline rush, very overlooked skills for burst ass kicking.<br />
<br />
On mobs that I usually can kill 5-10 of before needing a rest, lower level crap, I found I was resting after 2 or 3, because after the initial jump, I fought like a damn sissy. I would get a nice spike against a cloth caster using all my tricks, up to like 600 or so dps, but normal fights were about 50-100 dps lower than my combat build, I simply cannot hit hard doing 35-60 damage from the off hand and whimpy 150-200 hits main hand.<br />
<br />
There is a reason I so totally own rogues I fight most of the time, I didn't realize how weak overall in straight up fighting dagger rogues were. yes, against a wounded target or a caster, they may get a quicker, cleaner kill, but against high armor targets, or me, there just is no comparison at all. A 60 rogue the other night got the jump on me several times, and each time I sent him packing or he had to vanish. he got me right after I rezzed once, no problem, but facing a warrior or paladin with sissy little pinprick hits? uh uh.<br />
<br />
Combat all the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah I cant get away from using maces and I'm not even quite into the good stuff yet. Rogues sure can take it personal when you dont have a dagger. You dont use dagger? y?you can't backstab!!!<br />
<br />
I'm like screw it i enjoy seeing the bigger damage come past while normal fighting with sini. I've already found Kindey Punch saving me when i get attacked by a mob with lower than i should health. By that i mean keeping it stunned and doing swing to swing more damage.<br />
<br />
I will admit you've influenced my thinking Mill with my rogue. I have tried to keep an open mind before I decide on weapon specialization but I find myself putting my maces back in all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shilzah,<br />
<br />
after the initial cold blood ambush or evis, I still have good hps left, they hit for 100-250, I return a hit for 250-450. Blade fury is 20% haste as well as hitting a nearby enemy, and AR means unlimited energy for 15 seconds. I usually stun several times a fight. If they vanish on you, move.<br />
<br />
In pve, I am often an off tank in our groups, and I have noticed, the rogues I group with that are also level 60, the highest hps I have seen was 3600, most are 3100-3200 and that hurts you in pvp. Cannot bandage or potion when you are dead, and cannot remain alive through a good stun session without hps.<br />
<br />
I am not 100% combat, for now, I didn't get the improved evis and aggression and malice with my last respec, I got improved sap because it is a huge help in dungeons. Eventually I will get those back, but I still am much more powerful in most cases than an average rogue. I can fight warriors straight up and unless they retaliate, I can usually kick their butts. I lost a little crit % and evis and ss damage but it is still very good.<br />
<br />
And to think I am in ghetto gear, using a level 48 mainhand mace and 50 off hehe, nothing from BRD or above, but we are getting there.<br />
<br />
<br />
try daggers out, try maces out, it really is a personal preference, I give up the ability to kill casters quickly, and gank hurt people as quickly, but I am a fantastic anti-rogue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good looking build, more or less what I started out at, for now, I need the improved sap, in dungeons it is tough for us because of our group make up, no mages, so I am primary crowd control. of course I went mace spec and no backstab stuff. not going to specialize in daggers for the 5% crit chance? Would think that would be a biggie for a dagger user, my crit% chance is a whopping 10% right now.<br />
<br />
but when eventually we shift more towards pvp, full on combat again with the assasin tree more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Given that in solo PVE my paladin plays like an 18 wheeler trying to race at Daytona, I've rerolled to rogue as well. Given the incessant complaining about paladins I was pleasantly surprised to find the rogue 50x the better class and way more fun to play as well.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm currently working on a backstab build so I find what you're saying interesting.  Since I'm on PVE server I'm going max dps- I will sacrifice anything and everything to achieve this.  I always thought getting all the backstab talents would wind up as the highest dps.  Also, I will be using weapon switch macros to do ss/evis using a high damage sword/mace while using dagger for ambush/stabs. Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? I could not care less about stuns or anything related to PVP- I want the big numbers, max dps, my enemy waiting to be looted and skinned ASAP.<br />
<br />
Any more advice given my desire?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just to clarify, are you talking exclusively about a rogue who's going to spend a lot of time soloing/tanking?  Do you think the backstab-dagger-rogue is a fitting build for someone who never tanks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've went pure maces / combat from day one (55 now) and I still laugh at dagger rogues.  Here's another thing:  You can easily macro weaponswapping and tie it to abilites so that you can still backstab if you want to.  Or ambush if that's your thing.  But the dps of SS and the stuns maces bring is exceptional.  The *only* downside of going with maces is you really need slow, high dmg weapons to reap the rewards, and that really renders poisons a lot less effective than they are for faster weapons, where landing is a percentage of your swings.<br />
<br />
Note, I still do swap in the dagger and BS in situations.  Such as when SS / maces pulls agro from the tank.  Then BS is like a step down in dps and sometimes easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
Basically, the way it's done (and I'll post the real text when I get home if there is interest) is you have 2 steps to, say, your backstab macro:<br />
<br />
1)  Backstab<br />
2)  Swap weapons<br />
<br />
So when you are finding yourself wanting to bs.  you tap that twice, first tap 'fails' BS cause you don't have a dagger, but step 2 gives you the dagger.  Tap 2 performs the BS and puts the mace back in main hand.  (Until they put more / better pause functionality in macros, that's the best I could do.)<br />
<br />
Extend this to gouge, ambush, etc and you can really go without losing the fun of daggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use a dagger main hand, sword/dagger in the off. I know you can use macros to autoswap but I haven't really bothered to try it. The reason I stick with daggers is that my build gives me steady dps for tanking, with huge  increases if I'm partied. <br />
<br />
I understand Mill's point about maces being better for SS which is a combat rogues staple do to the instant strike. The reason I choose to use daggers is <br />
<br />
A) They are quicker, which allows for more interrupts, and applies poison at an increased rate. (I use instant / crippling)<br />
<br />
B) I don't have to sweat switching weapons in anticipation for a backstab opportunity. Say what you like, you can increase the frequency &amp; damage of backstab in ways you cannot with SS making it a better source of DPS, position allowing.<br />
<br />
The downside to daggers are that because they are in general quicker, they have a smaller damage range. This means that you will not get the same huge hits on Sinister Strike like you will get on a mace. <br />
<br />
Also daggers for whatever reason, are rare as hell. There are not as many available in the auction house at the higher levels in comparison to swords, maces, and axes (which we can't use). Most of the really good higher level daggers seem to be drops from instances and therefore are bind on pickup. I'm using a windowmaker at 51 that I bought at 42. <br />
<br />
The reason I didn't buy daggers specialization is because while it would be nice, the extra 5% crit chance doesn't make up for what I'd lose in the assasinate tree. Relentless Strikes for point generation and Lethality for extra crit damage are just too good to pass up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A) They are quicker, which allows for more interrupts, and applies poison at an increased rate. (I use instant / crippling)<br />
<br />
Cappi, off hand I would aggree, but, main hand, our attacks are instant. Ss, evis, etc, are all instant, I can swing as quick with a  slow mace as a fast dagger, for the most part. Delay means nothing, you want a heavy hitting weapon, period. Interupts? If you really have to worry about that, you are dead already. Casters do not ever cast anything but instants against me.<br />
<br />
I use bonesnapper, level 48 friggin mace, but 124 I think max damage. I have never, ever gotten my off hand weapon to run out of poison before my main hand, because of the instant strikes. Even using really low delay off hand daggers.<br />
<br />
The combat tree of course, with precision and duel wield, makes a ton of difference, I was disgusted with my damage without it.<br />
<br />
I literally, can kill anyone. The top people, full health, more often the not, I am going to win, and that is fighjting head to head no health loss. Only real weird thing is warriors that can use retaliate, ouch. Rogues? Seriously, 60 rogues are like eating a piece of bubble gum. Yummy, quick, can feel good after when you blow bubbles.<br />
<br />
Hps, hps win it all btw I think. Lots of stuff i can do, but not when I am dead with a 400 agility 3000  hp build. I figure it is like a lightweight going into the ring with me, a heavyweight, ya they may dance, look flashy, but one solid hit to the head, and my big ass is gonna beat em.<br />
<br />
Oh, I fairly often, have people go immune to my mace stun before they die. Think about that, 3 stuns in what, 15 seconds?<br />
<br />
<br />
And I truly suck at pvp, I cannot circle strafe or any jumping around, I go ram-headed into the battle and I kick their asses.<br />
<br />
<br />
On same level mobs, PL'n in SM, with full combat build, it is generally 400-450 dps, with half combat like now, 350-400, with ambush build, generally 350-400, but, much, much slower overall killing, because I have to use all the tools and prepare, gouge/backstab, etc. I also cannot kill 2-4 mobs at once nearly as fast or with the same health. I literally can kill 10 mobs in the same time/same healing as 3 mobs with backstab/dagger build. <br />
<br />
I cannot, however, kill a caster as quick, nor a hurt person. Although, nailed a 58 pally and a 57 rogue a while ago, they never came out of stun because of CS, KS, and mace stun. :) Man I talk alot.<br />

Do you think the backstab-dagger-rogue is a fitting build for someone who never tanks?<br />
Solo and group PVE, with emphasis on solo PVE as this will be an alt from my group MT paladin main. I want a class that's fun (#1 priority) and can earn exp/gold like it's going out of style.  My crew's rogue has 150g- my paladin has 4g and I got my horse for free.  It didn't take a lot of convincing to switch when we soloed next to each other and he was killing 3 mobs to my one with no downtime.<br />
<br />
Paladins are overpowered in PVE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dagger rogue simply kills fast on one mob, but takes more damage with multiples, and cannot sustain the dps. Combat kills a little slower(not much), but is much mroe able to mitigate damage, and sustain dps, and handle adds.<br />
<br />
hurt caster drinking a morning glory dew though? Ambush wrecks them indeed.<br />
<br />
iz, why the hell only 4 gold? what do you spend money on? Rogues have to buy poisons at least, and armor same as pallies.<br />
<br />
I got 220 gold from pl'n my shaman in SM so far, 680 more to go :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Every class has it's pros and cons, I can't believe what some people here expect their classes to do.  EQ was hugely imbalanced in PvE and worse in PvP, I find WoW much better and I think that nerf calls for any class are lame and childish.<br />
<br />
Paladins rightfully have the worst DPS, but the best surviveability.  Thier ability to shield a healer or in PvP to outlast almost any class is impressive, countering this with crappy DPS is balancing.  In EQ shaman were near the bottom of the DPS barrel because of all the diversity of skill sets we possessed and because slow WAS a killer.  Izmalis, I think you're being too pessimistic on your class, much like you were with EQ shaman and all the hardcore vs casual rants you went off on (even though some good points were made there).  On any given day in PvP I can take any class, or they can take me, no one class is untouchable.<br />
<br />
Mill and Iz, huge difference between a primary and a second char.  PLed chars will have more money because they usually have less to spend it on and because it's your second time through you know how to make cash faster/better and with a toon standing over you you'll waste less time and money on deaths (item decay) and score more drops.  I grouped with a guild shaman who was an alt from his 60 warlock and decked out in blue loot with a purple axe.  He didn't take any loot, only skinned the bodies and we moved through Dustwallow and were ahead on respawn.  In that time I scored more loot than I had in my previous instance.  2nd Chars will always find it easier to make and keep money. I mow through mobs often taking on 2 mobs 3 levels higher without much stress and I still don't have enough cash to buy my mount in two levels and I have spent a total of under 5g in the AH, mostly for alchemy recipies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">iz, why the hell only 4 gold? what do you spend money on?<br />
Like you I partake of the pain that is blacksmithing.  I have 3 plate wearers in my crew to equip- that was a lot of mithril.  I don't make much on instance runs since we typically put everything into a pot to buy everyone a horse. I also don't solo grind because it is so painful to solo that I can't even bear it.  Unlike my crew rogue, I don't have the option to kill Doan in SM about 50x making 1-2g a trip every 10 min either- granted this was just nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins rightfully have the worst DPS, but the best surviveability. Thier ability to shield a healer or in PvP to outlast almost any class is impressive, countering this with crappy DPS is balancing.<br />
And I don't disagree with this. The problem I have is that this game was pitched as solo friendly and it is- so long as you play a dps class.  Taking 3 times as long to kill the exact same mob is bad, but what makes it unbearable is that the paladin class in solo play is just flat out not fun.  Fun is my #1 objective.<br />
<br />
Here's a typical combat, prenerf SotC, in paladin solo PVE:<br />
/cast Seal of Crusader<br />
... wait 30 seconds...<br />
Repeat above. After 45 seconds of this I can loot the mob. Could I judge the mob with seals to do additional things? Yes, but none are necessary in solo PVE.  Could I use my AE to speed things up? Sure, but then I'll have downtime regenning the mana I used so I gain no time.<br />
<br />
Low dps is fine given paladin survivability. Low fun AND low dps is a dead class.<br />
<br />
And as for remembering my debates (not rants!) with people on raiders vs. nonraiders in EQ, just wait.  The storm is going to break soon in WoW, mark my words.  It will get brutal when they finish itemizing the raid content and people come to find out that all content is balanced assuming you have top end raid gear- just like in EQ. No surprise though given that the former EQ uber guilds are on the WoW development staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Back on topic- lay on me the highest possible dps rogue build. I want max dps- I will sacrifice every shred of defense for this. I don't care if one add = insta death if it means I get 10 more dps.<br />
<br />
Along that line, what are the best poisons to use, focused on damage? Again, this is PVE and I'm aiming to drop as much damage as the game allows.  Nothing is sacred in this build- I just want the highest dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">then go heavy in the assasin and sublety tree, get everything that enchances backstab and ambush, get cold blood and preperation.<br />
<br />
Poisons are touchy, I like instant, but often you need to use crippling or deadly for the snare and the dot.<br />
<br />
That would be for one target, one at a time.<br />
<br />
With ambush spec I could, on soft targets get in the 700's for dps per fight. Lower on armored, and crappy in a fight where I didn't get to open with ambush. This is level 38 mobs when I was level 60 though. With combat is it sustained 400-450 dps and adds are no problem.<br />
<br />
note, you will kill more monsters over time with less downtime using combat, if you indeed just want to level grind and get cash.<br />

************************************************<br />
<br />
This is a mix build that maxes out your backstab &amp; ambush damage - It's group centric with very strong sustained DPS. What it lacks are the activated abilities which give rogues their best burst DPS. Basically Ambush, then BS until a 5 point Eviserate. It's also not terribly solo friendly. <br />
<br />
As for poisons, I got crippling / instant all the way. Wound/Mind Numbing are far to situational, and Deadly screws up gouge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Basically, the way it's done (and I'll post the real text when I get home if there is interest) is you have 2 steps to, say, your backstab macro:<br />

<br />
Please post. I had trouble getting this macro to work. I run CTMod as my UI and tried to use some Cosmos AddOns as well but I can't seem to get them to show up. I just don't understand how the UI/macro mods work together well enough yet.  I really love the Cosmos /equip and /unequip commands, but I can't get them to work seeing as I don't use Cosmos.  Pity.</div></div><hr />

If you look for advice on message boards, you're going to get a lot of opinions (what else is it that everyone has one of...?), but what it comes down to, really, is perspective.<br />

I think you'll get your best ideas now that you've narrowed your focus down to solo PVE DPS.  High dps is FUN for a lot of us (myself included).  I picked my shaman talents for DPS and survivability, and am extremely happy with my build, tho there are those out there who'd say I'm gimpy indeed for not having the mana spring totem (cept I'm the only mana user in our regular group *grin).<br />
<br />
It sounds like daggers may have more use to a grouping, PvE, heavy-poison-usage rogue - whereas maces fill about every other niche.  I know that our rogue is our only reliable snare, so we absolutely rely on his poisons for runners (since the warrior can't ever remember to hamstring).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ugh, mana spring is a waste for a shammy in my opinion. Smidgeon of enhance, and hard elemental is good, and restoration to instant nature spell and a smidgeon of others is good too.<br />
<br />
5 minute cool down on manatide totem isn't it?<br />
<br />
Mainly speccin mine to NS to see what a chain lightning, followed by a shock, and then charge in with an instant CL would be like. CL can hit hard at level 60 especially on a  nice crit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One of the main reasons I went almost to the end in enhancement is the hard % bonus to all AC from gear.  I can't remember the exact percentage, but it's important to me, given the amount of time I spend tanking from heal aggro.<br />
<br />
Course, I might go elemental, were I PvP - given the emphasis on the quick kill.  Chain lightning is fun (and funny) on greens, but I haven't found a real use for that mana-sucker.  Hell, chain healing sees more use...  <br />
<br />
Earth shock, fire totem, dot, earth shock again, then heal myself while my opponent dies has been what's worked for me so far.  Average damage, but very sustainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Maybe in PvP mana spring sucks.<br />
In PvE it's very useful, especially if you are a restoration shaman.<br />
When you are in a group though, it's huge.<br />
Let's look at a restoration shaman at level 60:  For 185 mana (actually 205 minus 10% cuz of talents), everyone gets 12.5 mana per 2 seconds (6.25 mana per second due to talents) for 69 seconds (15% longer).  6.25 mana per second * 69 seconds = 431.25 mana regained....per group member.<br />
<br />
So, you are in an instance.  You get a pull of 2-3 mobs.  You slap down mana tide.  Up to all 5 group members get back 431 mana, at the cost of 185 mana to just the shaman.  If you have 5 casters in the group (maximum efficiency), you get 2156 total mana regenerated every 1.1 minutes, for the cost of 185 mana.  Oh, and unlike mana regen that comes from spirit, this mana regen works regardless if you are casting spells or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mana Tide on the other hand is huge:<br />
49 mana cost (54 - 10%)<br />
12 sec duration<br />
restores 240 mana every 3 seconds<br />
240 x 4 = 960 mana regained by all group members for 49 mana cost.<br />
<br />
Now, suppose you go into a long fight.<br />
You pop off mana spring at the start when people are first dumping their mana.<br />
After it goes away, and people's mana levels are dropping, you lay down mana tide for another ~1k mana regen.<br />
When it goes away, you put up the mana tide totem again for the ongoing mana regen.<br />
Throw in a paladin doing their mana regen blessing, and you have a *huge* amount of perpetual mana regen happening.<br />
Over a 1.5 minute fight, with mana spring and mana tide, you can give all group members about 1400 mana, for a net cost to the shaman of about 240 mana.<br />
I like those numbers.</div></div><hr />

Even without points into ICS, our close quarters Wing Clip is pretty darned effective at slowing the runners down. When fighting humanoids or other mob types known to run at low health, I always keep one or the other in reserve so it's ready to invoke when they start to flee.<br />

Warriors remembering anything? Come on! They're just meat shields. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just found this weapon swap macro (http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=110) - it is the bomb. My dps just took a huge boost.  I grind right now on non-aggro animals to get skinning up, so this is all I do:<br />
<br />
- start with dagger in main hand<br />
- run up and hit backstab<br />
- press the key I have bound to weaponswap to put higher dmg mace in mainhand<br />
- sinister strike<br />
- slice and dice<br />
- spam ss until dead a few secs later<br />
<br />
Now that my backstab crit % is over 40% at L17 this is insane. Damn this class is hilarious.  The mob is 1/3 dead before I get hit- outstanding. I can't wait to do this with ambush and add poisons into the mix.  If paladin was horrible because combat was too long, this is almost too short- I barely get to feel like I'm fighting before I'm right clicking the loot, lmao.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Here are the macros I make most use of.  This assumes you have your 16 slot backpack in the Right-hand most slot, and the weapon you want to swamp in the Top, Left slot of that backpack.<br />
<br />
/cast ambush(rank 5);<br />
/script PickupContainerItem(0, 1); PickupInventoryItem(16);<br />
<br />
/cast gouge(rank 4);<br />
/script PickupContainerItem(0, 1); PickupInventoryItem(16);<br />
<br />
/cast backstab(rank 7);<br />
/script PickupContainerItem(0, 1); PickupInventoryItem(16);<br />
<br />
There is a tiny bit of delay performing the swap, but not much, maybe 0.5 sec.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Dueling has 0 to do with pvp, nothing. I have yet to lose to a dagger rogue when I started at full health, I have had to run once, that is it. Killed probably 40-50 level 60 rogues in even equal combat.<br />
<br />
If they jump you though you are in trouble, that is what rogues do. The people who make the videos show no particular talent but for circle strafing, and they usually have god gear, whoopidy doo.<br />
