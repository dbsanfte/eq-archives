<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey All,<br />
<br />
So, at first I was hesitant to go to the new LoY zones, but at 4:20 A.M. on a Monday morning I decided what else did I have to do?  Anyhow, I don't have a JBB, Fungi, Horse, or Epic, but I still managed to take the mobs down pretty fast, and I got a percentage point every two kills on average.  All this while soloing, mainly with pet and bane, against the pirates of Dulak.  I came to the zone from Stonebrunt (get a port or go PoK to Paineel (really to Toxx, so go then to paineel) then to warrens, then stonebrunt) then gunthak, where I jumped in to the water and swam to a beach.  I used invis to get past the green junk, then zoned in to Dulak, where I dropped invis long enough to learn I wasn't wanted.<br />
<br />
However, that didn't deter me, and I set myself up on a pirate ship, at loc -300, -1850.  I dropped invis, summoned and buffed a pet, then got to work.  The mobs are mostly gnomes, humans, and trolls, and all drop parts which is nice because they can be used for our new illusion potions.  Also, they drop items good for project alpha.  1% xp per two kills on average, and decent coin loot (2-3 plat on average).  Also I got a blue diamond and some research peices.<br />
<br />
The one thing I did have that helped a lot (besides project alpha) was the extended C3 I got before coming.   Thanks to it I didn't have to cann or med too much, and I only spent mana on slows and Bane.  I also used a little on regen and celerity for my pet.  If I'd had a horse but no C3, I imagine it would have been about the same.  Likewise, if you had a partner or or an epic and JBB, you could probably do two ships at once, where as I could only comfortably handle one ship at a time.  Anyhow, check out this great new zone if you are 57 and have the time to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started in Dulak soloing around the shore area, mostly trying to get drunks for the quest drop, but also picking up the few dark blues for exp, and occasional other stuff as it agroed.<br />
<br />
Then I joined a couple of friends on the boat. <br />
<br />
These ships appear to be progressively more difficult as you go around, anticlockwise. Each one has a different name, and the crew are named for the boat. They all seem to have the chance to drop racial meat, a few plat, and maybe a harpoon or shiv (weapons that sell for around 3pp each). Occasional cash gems dropped, and we got a few diamonds and a blue diamond there too.<br />
<br />
I went to the first boat with a 48 ranger - with slow, pet, BoN, was dead easy. Most of the mobs were light blue, with a few dark blues.<br />
<br />
Later on, I rejoined the ranger (then 49) and a 52 beastlord, who had been duoing on the second boat. Again, more light blues than dark at 56, and pretty easy, so we all moved to the 3rd boat.<br />
<br />
The 3rd boat was all dark blue at 56, the 3 of us managed to pull everything, and were on the last mob on the boat when the first one repopped. With everything slowed, I still barely needed to heal at all, group regrowth was enough. I started to get a few more resists on slows though.<br />
<br />
We would have tried the 4th boat, but the ranger had to leave.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fun zone, I wandered around a bit last night.  Good source of meat, and some decent cash off the weapons.<br />
<br />
Beware the ship &quot;events&quot;, someone did one last night, a captain was /shouting to zone, and when it finished ... zone crash.  Someone else who popped back up same time as me said it'd happened 3 times so far.  I got rolled back about 20 minutes too, lost a lot of meat &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't want to seem like an arse here by telling everyone something they already know, but everything (I've seen) in Gunthak and Dulak's starts indifferent in bearform, found it to be easier than hoping invis holds on the run through Gunthak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, did something change about bearform?  Last I knew, it didn't have any sort of faction modifier associated with it, but then again, I haven't really used it in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only places I've really noticed a change in faction in bearform was in Shadowhaven and now the LoY zones. Didn't think that it had any faction change with the spell so I haven't been checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">does this include the undead? all of those still con KOS to me on the beach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It does yes =) everything on the beach (skeletons, troll zombies, scorpians, cant think of more hehe) is indifferent to me in bearform, even down to the troll guards are indifferent, while in bearform nothing in Gunthak has aggroed me. Oh yes as well I was doing a bit of looking around, in Jaggedpine the animals go from threatening to indifferent in bearform, and also everything in OT is the same way except the chickens. Surprised me that it changed the faction that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/bump <br />
<br />
Bearform changing faction now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Interesting I'll have to try this out, would make mapping SO much easier.</div></div><hr />
