<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have never played eq, I did alittle studying and I think a shaman is what I would like to play.  Im sure this has been asked before but humor a newb.   What would you reccomend as a starting race for a shaman?  What are the benefits to one race over another.  If there is a website that tells you that would be great to.  I think I read trolls are really good, one of the reasons is because they get some kinda snare type necklace or somthing?  Im very new as you can see.<br />

Thanks very much<br />

Seriously, this forum has about 10 bazillion threads on &quot;what class is the best shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
This thread will start it all over again, people will flame, and most will tell you to use the search button (you should).<br />
<br />
Seriously though - if you're new to EQ, you probably won't stick with your first class (never seems to happen) so just play whatever sounds cool.<br />
<br />
If you get serious about your shaman you'll find that if you sort out all the arguments, there's a reason to play any race, and in the end very little separtes a troll from an ogre, from a barb, from an iksar, and a Vah shir.<br />
<br />
Play what looks cool - and you'll find lots of info already on this board...<br />
<br />
GL and welcome to the Shaman class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no &quot;best&quot; race for a Shaman, let's clear that up now. <br />
Which race should you be is really up to you. Depends on the kind of player you are. <br />
All races have pros and cons.<br />
If you don't care about faction, Trolls might be the easiest to play. Regen, high str, sta, Slam, night vision, little downtime. Trolls get access to better toys.<br />
Same with Ogres....High str, sta, unstunnable from frontal attacks, alot of HP's. night vision.....No regen though. <br />
<br />
Iksars are kinda easy....as you don't HAVE to leave Kunark. You can level 1 - 60 near your home city of Cabilis. Regen, high starting wis, AC bonus....limited armor restrictions, low str, low sta, no Slam.<br />
<br />
If you DO care about faction then Barbarians seem to be the popular choice. High str, sta, Slam, good starting wis...no real negatives about Barbs except they are BLIND as a bat. Oh and Barb females are quite &quot;well equipped&quot; ! ( let you figure that one out)<br />
<br />
Don't know much about Vah Shir as I don't care for Luclin that much. They seem to be down the same road as Barbs except they get innate Safe Fall and Sneak (very handy). They can't wear the Fungi Tunic though. No Slam and they consume food twice as fast as everyone else. <br />
<br />
The choice of Shaman is really up to you, there is no &quot;best&quot; race..choose the one you'll have the most fun playing. At some point I think we all wished were another Shaman race at one time. But when I think overall I wouldn't want play any other race than Iksar because it suits me best. Pick what suits you and have fun with it. <br />
Shamans are awesome regardless of race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's right, Shaman are an awesome class regardless of race.<br />
<br />
I have solo'd my Shaman pretty much his entire career. Sure I have grabbed a few groups here and there, but 95% of my 52 levels were done solo.<br />
<br />
That's one of the main things that attract me to the Shaman, we can solo quite well and are also wanted in groups.<br />
<br />
I am glad I chose Troll, and I can tell you if I had to do it over I would pick Troll again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the right gear and training, a lvl 60 shaman is literally a walking fortress.<br />
<br />
Shaman can solo bigger mobs 1 on 1 than any other class in the game.<br />
<br />
Shaman get:<br />
<br />
Regen, heals, Speed Buffs, Pets, Stat Buffs, HP/AC Buffs, SoW, Mega DoTs, decent DD nukes, AE nukes, Self Wis Buff / illusion spells, Root, Mega slows, Mega Resist debuffs, Self Combat Melee buff line, self Cannibalize (HP/Mana convert line), Invis / See invis, sta regen, water breathing, Levitate, bind sight, and more.  Plus we can get an armor class and melee skill high enough to make sure we're able to stay alive long enough to stay in the fight through casting all that stuff.<br />
<br />
And with Alchemy we get nice Damageshields, invis-undead, teleports, and mana-regen.  So our damageshields/ivu/and TP spells cost a reagent.<br />
<br />
I commend you on choosing a shaman - I daresay shaman are the most self-sufficient and versatile class in the game.  In the end, race is minor.  I played an ogre shaman the first time around, simply for the Roleplay fun of being an ogre who wanted to live with the dwarves... which happened by the way ;)  The only things shaman don't get is a snare and a stun (at least they didn't used to).<br />
<br />
This time I'm playing a troll shaman.  I need to do that snare necklace quest, (which is the only way a shaman can snare to my knowledge).  But no matter what race, the class itself is phenominal.   When I restarted, there wasn't any other choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree with the basics of what the previous posters have said.  Race is a matter of taste.<br />
<br />
I figure as far as ease goes (faction=more/fewer available zones to hunt in) Barbarian&gt;VahShir&gt;Ogre&gt;Troll&gt;Iksar<br />
<br />
As far as strengths goes, the above list seems to work in reverse order.<br />
<br />
In the end, I figure it balances out pretty well, but to pick the race you want to play, you need to figure out what resources you have and what kind of a player you are.<br />
<br />
Personally I play a cookie-cutter barbarian shaman.  I increase my faction anywhere I can, I have access to most zones and can hunt pretty much anywhere I want too.  Most guards won't try to gang bang me when I run through their cities because of my faction.  My XP penalty for race isn't as steep as it is for a troll which suits me fine because I don't play as much anymore.  Barbies look great, have lots of armour/equipment choices, but the lack of ultravision used to be a real pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Troll is an excellent choice.  Would be my choice if I were to restart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people see faction this way...as in Trolls have &quot;BAD&quot; faction.<br />
<br />
I actually see it reversed, as in Trolls have &quot;good&quot; faction. I can bank in 6 cities (Grobb, Oggok, Neriak, Bazaar, Overthere, Thurgardin), and I am not really hindered on what I can and cannot kill...I just kill what I want.<br />
<br />
As a Troll, I can kill almost anything I want, and don't really have to worry about factions at all. I have never tried to &quot;fix&quot; any faction or &quot;work&quot; on any except Velious of course.<br />
<br />
To me, the &quot;bad&quot; faction of Trolls means that I have many many more choices of hunting areas. I kill the mobs you can't because you're worried about losing faction.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, this is different than the usual &quot;What race&quot; questions because he is _new to the game entirely_.<br />
<br />
As stated above, every race has their pro's and con's.  No matter what race you choose, you will eventualy be uber because you're a shaman ;)<br />
<br />
The troll snare necklace:  It's nice but it's not a game breaker.  Comes in handy from time to time but that's pretty much it.  More importantly why a troll is a good choice is they regen HPs faster and shaman can convert HPs to Mana starting at level 24.  You do pay for this ability by having an experience penalty.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you play a Barbarian or, if your computer can handle the graphics, Vah Shir.  The reason why is you don't have to worry about being KOS (Kill On Sight) everywhere you go.  You've got a lot to learn, one more thing to remember might be too much while learning the game.   Play that character for about 10 levels just to get the feel of the class, then cast SoW on yourself &amp; go wandering around.  Go near some of the &quot;dark race&quot; cities and watch the guards come busting after you.  The Ogres and Trolls have a lot of advantages (especially in Roleplaying) but you pay for that with people trying to kill you nearly everywhere.   You will also have a harder time getting cash when you sell junk because your charisma will be lower.<br />
<br />
Once you've played 10 or so levels with the light race, try playing with a dark race.  Put the ogre-smack on some frogs.  Watch your HPs climb as a Troll or Iksar.  Once you've figured out how Faction works, _then_ make your decision on what race you want.   My Barbarian is that race because I didn't know the game &amp; was suggested to avoid faction until I learned the game better and I still play him.  I also have a female Troll shaman that I play mainly for the roleplaying aspect.  The regen is just gravy on top :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The troll snare necklace: It's nice but it's not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
Total agreement here. I have had the Snare necklace since I was level 24 and I have used it quite a bit, but it is most definaley not a game breaker.<br />
<br />
I would say the two most defining &quot;equipment&quot; situations are:<br />
<br />
1. Iksar not being able to use JBB.<br />
2. Vah Shir not being able to use Fungi (till the vest at 51).<br />
<br />
Both these matter little if you are new and untwinked however.<br />
<br />
Choose what looks cooler to you! Player skill are really all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play a Troll Shaman (level 9) who worships Cazic.  Was this a mistake.  I think the fear necklaces I have access to are pretty nice.  Would you all suggest re-rolling JUST to get that necklace.  I keep telling myself its not a big deal, but everytime I ask about it people say 'reroll, the neecklace is great'.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question, I agree that playing a light race would be easier at first, but who  needs easy?  You've got 9 levels to get killed and have nothing negative come out of it, since you won't lose xp or have to retrieve your corpse.  <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

This time I'm playing a troll shaman. I need to do that snare necklace quest, (which is the only way a shaman can snare to my knowledge).<br />
<br />
Just to point out, spear of constriction from VP!  Procs ensnare, I love mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just to add my 2 cp. :<br />
<br />
For a new player out of the box, the game will be colored by what race you start out in. ..faction isn't such a big deal until you leave the newbie area.<br />
<br />
After 36 levels as a Human monk with 'Good' faction everywhere, I made a 'bad' Iksar shamaness and never looked back.  Faction is easy to learn (and easy to manipulate), and having to run away from the guards a few times gives the game a thrilling aspect.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the lowest levels..for the most fun-per-minute I think that I would recommend a character with regen. Little or no downtime is fun!  Trolls are the best choice for this..with Iksars being a close second.  I think trolls might be a better choice because you are in 'walking' distance of the major 'lightie' areas..giving you the option of working on 'lightie' factions or not.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Gloriana<br />
<br />
You can play your shaman for years and in the end, dispite constant debate, the shaman reaces all turn out to be very close in power.<br />
<br />
I would create one of each race that joo might be interested in and drive it around for a while.  The idea is to get the &quot;feal&quot; of the race and decide wich one you like the best. <br />
<br />
The only race that I recomend not to bother with is the Iksar.  They make great shaman but are excluded from using the Jaundiced Bone Bracer (JBB) wich is a very powerfull item.<br />
<br />
After you decide wich race come on back and post.  We can help you, depending on race, make good choices in distributing your initial character points.<br />
<br />
A few hours &quot;messing&quot; around can pay of big in the long run.  Pick the race that just feels right.<br />

<br />
That's not a fair statement.....there are plenty of high level Iksar Shaman who get along just fine without the JBB. There are plenty of non-Iksar Shaman without the JBB who do just as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
One thing to know about picking your race of Shaman is that, never let gear sway your decison one way or the other. JBB is a great and powerful tool, but is situational and can't be used until 45. Choose the race you think is the coolest...who cares whether you can wear a &quot;space ghost&quot; bracer or not ? Some non-Iksar races will never see a JBB. You say to avoid the Iksar because they can't wear a JBB. Wouldn't it be smart to say to those non-Iksar Shaman who will never get a JBB should have picked an Iksar instead ? <br />
<br />
That's not a fair statement, choose the race you think is the coolest..period !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>TnT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm a lvl 21 Iksar Shaman which is my first and only character that I started a few months ago.  Can't tell you about the other races, but can give you a few pros and cons of starting as an Iksar:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Fast Regen - at first when you are soloing it reduces downtime by a good amount, but later levels you'll end up waiting for mana until Cannabalize at level 24.<br />
Forage - although you do get summon food/drink early on it is nice not having to recast them everytime I log in and I rarely buy food.  In Warsliks Woods you can even forage Bixie Berry Pies :p<br />
Infravision - no need to carry anything special for seeing at night.<br />
Swimming - you start as a master swimmer and it's a great way to travel!<br />
Hunting - you can go from level 1-20 at Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower which is right next to where you start.  Scorpions give great XP and you can sell stacks of bone chips for money to high level necros.  Later on you can group with people or solo in Lake of Ill Omen and Warslik's Woods which are also right next to the Iksar home city.<br />
Quests - at level 20 you can start doing the Scaled Mystic quests which give really nice armor for that level.  Assuming you don't get twinked.  Really easy to start your epic quest.<br />
Look - Iksars look pretty cool, especially with the skull helmets<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Faction - no one likes you except other Iksars and player characters (well hopefully), but then again you really never need to leave Kunark until you are much higher level<br />
Quests - the Iksar Shaman Skull Quests are a pain in the ass for a crappy weapon, but once you start you gotta finish out of principles :)  Since you are KOS everywhere actually doing your epic quest is a little harder (or so I have heard)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mez played a Iksar Shaman to lvl 52 so I think I gave it a reasonable try.  Also played a Troll to lvl 35 and now my Ogre to 59.<br />
<br />
I don't recomed playing an Iksar because they can't use the JBB.  That is simply my evaluation of the situation.  Other people have different opinions.  If there was no JBB in the game then I would say Iksars are the best overall shaman race, but the JBB does exsist and it is a class defining item.<br />
<br />
Why do so meny iksars /cry about the JBB all the time?<br />
<br />
I bet that more high lvl iksar shaman have started over then all the rest of the races combined.  I don't know of a single high lvl shaman that has started over to play an iksar.<br />
<br />
Sorry if you don't think this evaluation is fair.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you really want to enjoy your first few months of EQ look at the Iksar, Barbarian, Troll, Ogre, and Cat models and pick whatever race you can see yourself playing.  Every race has good qualities and some take a little more learning than others to play.<br />
<br />
I would HIGHLY suggest you stay away from the race discussion posts on this forum because it will do nothing more than limit your choices before you have a chance to really experience what being new in EQ is.  Don't let someone else's bias rule your decision, just pick a race you like and play it.<br />
<br />
You might want to search this board for starting stat suggestions and I would prolly recommend starting on a newer server.  If you start on some old fogey server like Xegony you will just run into the army of overequipped, underleveled, &quot;n00bs&quot; that are managed by people who have already hit level 60 twice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey Aeydin,<br />
<br />
I encourage you not read the posts about races above. I have many opinions on which race makes the best Shaman but they are just opinions and opinions are like arseholes... everyone has one :P .<br />
<br />
I picked an Iksar Shaman as my first character simply because my friends who started playing EQ before me both picked Iksars (Monk and Necro) and said to me that if I started an Iksar we could play together easier. I did barely any research into what class to play but just saw that Shaman's could heal so picked it just for that reason. I had no idea that Shaman's are so powerful and in my opinion the best overall class in the game (thats why Verant hates us so).<br />
<br />
Don't listen to all this crap about an item called a JBB (Jaundiced Bone Bracer) that is supposedly the most powerful item for shamans (or its made out to be). Its an item that you equip in your wrist slot and his a clickable feature (mana free) that allows you to cast a spell that does 256 Direct Damage with a 9 second cast time. Sure theres no disputing it is a great item but by no means does it make one race more powerful than another. Iksars are the only race that cannot use this item if you hadn't already gathered from previous posts.<br />
<br />
Just pick a race that you like based on personal preference. A lot of people pick their race because of the way they look and I would have to say this is a good way to do it. Forget about starting stats and racial abilities and faction because if you play your shaman all the way to level 60 it makes very little difference at the end.<br />
<br />
When placing your starting points into your stats I would have to say the main one to boost would be Stamina. Place as much points as you can into Stamina and put the rest into Wisdom. Stamina is by far the hardest stat to get up and it directly affects your hit points which become vital at the end game. The only thing I regret about making my Iksar Shaman was placing my starting points in the wrong stats (I put some in dex, str and wis EEK).<br />
<br />
Now that you have made a shaman my best advice to you is to stick with it. Shaman's have patches where they become very tiresome to play with none being worse than levels 19-24. I absolutely hated my shaman during this time but if you stick with it being a shaman is very rewarding.<br />
<br />
Let me highlight the reasons why I believe Shamans are the best overall class in EQ. <br />
<br />
[1] We have a huge variety of spells at our discretion. We can enhance all melee stats, haste attack speed and boost hitpoints and AC for combat. We can increase movement speed, levitate and breathe underwater making us very durable. We have the second best Doting (Damage over Time) ability in the game making our damage output high if needed.<br />
<br />
[2] We can have Armour Class as good as a melee making us able to take considerable damage from mobs without dying (unlike all other casters).<br />
<br />
[3] We can debuff our opponents and lower all their melee stats and AC and slow their attacks up to 75%. <br />
<br />
[4] We can regain our mana (ability to cast spells) better than any other class. Necromancer's can regenerate their mana fast however we can swap hitpoint for mana as well and have other mana regenerating buffs on us unlike Necromancers.<br />
<br />
[5] We can make potions that allow us to use spells that are not in our spell book such as Damage Shields, Teleports and Mana Regeneration.<br />
<br />
[6] We can solo extremely well however are still very sort after in experience groups. Classes like Mages, Necromancers, Wizards and Druids that also have excellent soloing abilities fall into the trap that they are not wanted as much in experience groups. Shamans get the best of both worlds in that we can Solo extemely well but are still highly sort after in experience groups.<br />
<br />
[7] We are a key class on raids. Once again other classes which can solo well aren't considered key classes on raids however shamans are a key class in every facit of the game.<br />
<br />
[8] Verant hates us for being so powerful and constantly improves other classes but neglects shamans (this is good because it allows us to post nasty messages about Verant).<br />
<br />
So in conclusion play a shaman, love your shaman, be faithful to your shaman and in the end your shaman will reward you. Oh and have a look in the hunting guide section as there is an excellent post on how to play your shaman during different phases of his/her life.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Don't listen to all this crap about an item called a JBB (Jaundiced Bone Bracer) that is supposedly the most powerful item for shamans (or its made out to be). Sure theres no disputing it is a great item but by no means does it make one race more powerful than another<br />
It definatley makes one race more powerful that another. There is NO WAY anyone can convince me that: <br />
<br />
Shaman A at level 45 with a 263 mana-less DD is not more powerful that Shaman B at level 45 without it. Sorry I will never, ever believe that.<br />
<br />
I encourage you not read the posts about races above. I have many opinions on which race makes the best Shaman but they are just opinions<br />
You sure state alot of your opinions as you tell him not to listen to ours.<br />
<br />
Oh and its 263 and 8 seconds, just to be clear.<br />
<br />
Again, go with the race you like. But if, just if, future gear is important to you...look into the races a bit before you decide for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey Thual,<br />
<br />
If you didn't see it my post was talking about a shaman at level 60 which is what everyone aspires to reach. A JBB in no way limits any race to not reach level 60 and sure a JBB would increase the soloing ability of a lvl 45 character if soloing is what you prefer. Since shaman are wanted in groups however it makes no difference to whether you can get to 60 or not without a JBB. I have never seen any group say sorry Mr Shammy you cannot use a JBB so you are unwanted in our group ;) .<br />
<br />
At level 60 a JBB is really not that effective. Once you have Torpor the most efficient way of dishing damage is to DoT heavily and then use cannib/torpor combo to regain mana while the DoTs do their damage (and melee inbetween). I wouldn't waste 8secs trying to cast a 263DD spell on mobs that have 5-6k hps! Especially when it can be interupted easily due to the long cast time and/or worse fully/partially resisted. I would much rather be chain cannibilizing during that time. At 60 soloing shrooms in FG I can chain pull 2 shrooms at a time with no downtime. I have done this for upto 4 hours straight with no buffs other than my own and I have no FT devices, No Fungi, No JBB and No Cannib 5. All I use is Regrowth, Torpor, Cannib 4, VoB, Celerity, Epic DoT, BoN, Pox, Slow and my 55 pet spell. Now these are tools available to all shaman regardless of race.<br />
<br />
Would I exclude Iksars as a viable race for shamans just because between lvls 45 and 59 they cannot use a JBB? NO WAY! I coped just fine between those levels without a JBB ;)  . On the other hand if the JBB was usable between levels 19-24 (the worst levels for a shaman) then I would have seriously considered remaking my shammy a different race :D !<br />
<br />
There is no better race by level 60. All have different strenghts and weaknesses but when it boils down to it 1 piece of equipment is NOT the difference. Spells &gt; than all equipment and since all level 60 shaman can cast the same spells regardless of race then thats all that matters.<br />

I hate it when people imply that a non iksar shaman dings 46 and a JBB magically grafts to the wrist.  I never had much money in the game, and didn't even dream of a JBB. I just kept leveling, having fun and at level 57 a guildmate gifted me a JBB which I do love and still use.<br />
<br />
I made it from 46 to 57 just fine without it, really.  <br />
<br />
I know some people are really good traders and manage to save to get a JBB before they ding 46, but I really think those people are the exception and broke people like me are a lot more typical.  <br />
<br />
I still think you should play any race that looks fun to you.  I'm a barbarian that can wear the JBB, I still think troll snare necklace is cool or an iksar's innate regen.  Heck, after trying to do trades in SH with terrible faction all weekend, I'm pretty darn jealous of kitty sneak (not to mention that witch in EC that wouldnt sell me scent of marr!!)!  All races have pluses, all races have minuses, all shaman are fun.</div></div><hr />

What happened to your UBER signature in your post above?????<br />

Now if Iksars couldn't get signatures like yours I would definately not make one :D :D :D :D !<br />

<br />
Didn't see you mention anything about level 60 in your post, must have over looked it. Sorry. Of course its not as effective at 60 as 45.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way. I use a REIF. I will use a REIF until I get my Epic. Will the REIF be much use AFTER I get my Epic? Nope. But during the 53 levels BEFORE I get my Epic was I better served by using a REIF than a Rusty Spear? Of course I was.<br />
<br />
We outgrow gear as we level, at 45 my JBB made me a God. I could solo without losing more than one bubble of health or mana. But, even now at 52 it is lagging behind a bit.<br />
<br />

<br />
I did not imply that at all. Of course not everyone has a JBB at 45.<br />
<br />
I stand by my statment, however. Any Shaman of any race with a 263 dd mana-free at level 45 is more powerful than one without it. Iksar or not.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My first piece of advice would be not to play.  If you must, it's your first character.  Play what you want.  There are a ton of small differences between the races, power-gaming wise, and (as you have seen) no shortage of opinions about which package of goodies is better at what level with what equipment.<br />
<br />
Forget all that.<br />
<br />
Play what you want.  They are all viable and the differences are not that big.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you will not become a degenerate evercrack addict like everyone here (myself included) in which case you will never really care about these differences ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thual, your post still implies that JBB usable races HAVE a JBB at 45.<br />
<br />
Any Shaman of any race with a 263 dd mana-free at level 45 is more powerful than one without it.<br />
<br />
*IF* the shaman has a JBB at 45. I still maintain that it is NOT the norm for JBB usable shaman to have one at 45.  Heck, at 45 I spent 1.5K on a mammoth cloak and thought I was doing GREAT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Thual, your post still implies that JBB usable races HAVE a JBB at 45.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Ok, I really don't see how I am implying anything, but let me make it clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF&quot; a Shaman has &quot;an item&quot; that allows him to cast a mana-free damage spell at any level, he is generally more powerful than a shaman of the same level that &quot;does not have&quot; said item.<br />
<br />
That's it, no implication at all. <br />
<br />
99.9% of Babarians, Trolls, Ogres and Vah Shir won't have a JBB to use when they hit 45.<br />
<br />
100% of Iksar won't have a JBB to use when they hit 45.<br />
<br />
At level 60 a JBB is really not that effective. Once you have Torpor the most efficient way of dishing damage<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Hmm...seems to me some people make the same generalizations that you think I am making.<br />
<br />
Many many level 60 Shamans DON'T have Torpor, as we well know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">nono.. first poster was right.. leave now, you don't want to play this game<br />
<br />
Go play Morrowind, Dungeon siege, medal of honour,GTA3, Jedi Knight, neverwinter nights.. then come back when EQ2 is out.. <br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I am sure things will change tonight when I ding 60 and scribe Torpor but right now at 59 I get all my damage output, either solo or duo, with the JBB.  100%.  I don't even mem BoN because every time I cast it it costs me down time.<br />
<br />
Iskar Q:  Why do you gripe all the time about not having a JBB and then tell new people that it does not matter if joo have one or not?<br />
<br />
Iksar Q: How meny of you where once post 50 Barbarian, Ogre or Troll shaman and decided that Iksar was so great you just had to start over?<br />
<br />
All Shaman are Great.<br />
All Shaman with JBB are Greater.<br />
All Shaman with Torpor are Greater Still.<br />
All Shaman with Torpor and JBB are Even Better.<br />
<br />
If you chose a play stile that minimizes the effectiveness of the JBB then it is easy to claim that is has no impact.  JBB is situational but you can easily choose the situations in which it is great.  If you can't have a JBB then those options are not available and your character is less flexable and more limited.<br />
<br />
Are Iksar shaman Great?  YES!<br />
Are Iksar shaman as great as JBB shaman in some situations? YES!<br />
In all Situations? NO!!!<br />
<br />
Aeydin is no normal newb.  He found this shaman board and asked for opinions about what shaman race to play.  Opinions are like bum holes but he wanted to do some scratch and sniff.  The JBB is one of the most important considerations in which race to pick.  If not, we would not argue about it all the time.  <br />
<br />
My opinion (dont care if all have one and they stink),  from close personal experiance (Radag was a lvl 52 Iksar Shaman) is that I would play any other race over an Iksar because of JBB.  If Iksars could use the JBB I would play Iksar over any other race.<br />
<br />
*burp*<br />
<br />
Gerka da OGRE!!!  59 Shaman with  JBB....  60 tonight with TORPOR.  26 days played.<br />
<br />
Radag the IKSAR!!!  52 Shaman without JBB.....  DELETED after 94 days played.<br />
<br />
Opinions are like bum holes but they dont all smell the same.</div></div><hr />
