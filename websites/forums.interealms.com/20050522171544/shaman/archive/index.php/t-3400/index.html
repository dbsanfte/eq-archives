<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">And I'm having a complete blast playing this classic once again.. This game is hands DOWN the best Online RPG ever.. There is simply no competition.. Most people can't get past its ancient graphics and rightfully so, but if you're looking for a nice casual game where people won't get upset if you need to log, this is the game for you! M59 has a great community and it's rebuilding daily.. Near Death Studios bought the rights to the game and have made some really cool changes and additions.. It's definitely a must play!<br />

Outstanding PvP and tons of great PvE.. Classic mud gone graphical, this game is the bomb.. I have to force myself constantly to put it down like it's brand new..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, if they cut the price in half, I would honestly consider it.  It would be especially nice if you wanted to play on an older machine or a slower connection, but at $11 a month?  Pfft.  My nostalgia factor is firmly entrenched around $5 to $6 a month :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am actively talking to them about turning back on the trial period and guest user access to the servers.. I said the same exact thing at first Than, seriously.. Ten minutes worth of playing later, I realized it was easily worth it.. If they reinstitute the guest user and the trial period, people will understand the greatness that is Meridian 59!  It's surprisingly fun, honestly, I have to pry myself away..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello, and welcome to 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">M59 was the best.  I was the first person to hit 100 hps on server 105, years ago, and man did I have a blast. tried it again on a russian server and it just was too ancient though.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was on 105 for 3 years mill would be interesting to know who ya played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very shortly after the game came out, played a character named Old Mill Marauder, had no clue what I was doing, pure melee. Later played Old Mill rerolled as a mage, and WRAITH, first person to get weapon/kraanan/qor/faren all to last level. Think Lummox was closest person to doing that at the time.<br />
<br />
Took a long break and when tried to come back, everyone was multi school master and perfect stats, and I think they upped hps to past 100, just was boring then.<br />
<br />
Oh, and our guild, Immortals, won the first tournament, was playing with three guys on speaker phone, Ferret, Soulblade, was great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes I remember Old mill...<br />
<br />
Hung around in Paddies so much you just could not believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, so for those of us who never played it, why is it so good?  I mean, DAOC was supposed to be good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Like I said above...<br />
<br />
Hello, and welcome to 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
M59 along with UO were the first (I think) genre of RPGs online.<br />
<br />
Was very cool way back then, now we are talking 6 years ago or so... M59 shut down (3do venture) about 3 years ago. 3do sold the source code of M59 to forget who and they ran some servers.<br />
<br />
If you want to step back 6-7 years in time and play then hey knock yourself out. It was very very fun in its day. This is pretty much a pure PvP game. ANd man where there some great server wars. But the graphics technology very out of date. It is almost 2d with depth perseption (can I say that?) hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nope, Old Mill never hung around town man, I was doing one thing and one thing only, killing pkers or fighting in guild wars. And I whupped ass. Unless one of my buddies used him while I was away, couldnt stand people who sit around and talk all the time, game was about action, just love the death screams too.<br />
<br />
I didnt play much at all though after the expansion with the little sprite things, the new zone, vale of sorrows or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill<br />
<br />
<br />
Targar, who were you on 105?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brahma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with you Ooga.<br />
<br />
M59 might be outdated graphically, but for anyone interested in gameplay value as opposed to looking at pretty graphics, M59 is hands down the best. It may be 6 years old, but it's STILL lightyears ahead of games like EQ, DAoC, etc. when it comes to game design.<br />
<br />
If NDS had the financial backing to do Meridian 59 II, with modern graphics/size/scope..  and maybe a few additional features, it'd totally blow EQ out of the water.<br />
<br />
what's so great about it?<br />
a REAL guild system, not just another chat channel. complete with guild halls, guild treasury/vault, guild status levels (that do more than just let you invite other people :p) etc. etc. It rivals DAoC's guild system from what I've seen of DAoC.<br />
<br />
customizeable 'chat channels'. you make your own, you can customize your 'tell/send' handle with colors and ascii char's, it's not a 'graphical font' so you can actually cut and paste stuff, oh.. and this was a standard feature when the game came out, not a patch 3 years afterwards.<br />
<br />
your char is based on skills that you improve by using them... there is no 'class' and there are no 'levels'. <br />
There are several 'schools' that you can improve in, but there is no preset defining role that you have to play/are stuck with.<br />
<br />
you don't have to worry about dieing because you accidently agro'd to many mobs.. if you run away.. you can actually run away.. (sarcasm)*boggle*(/sarcasm) :p  most of the time you die from mobs because you gamble on whether you can kill it before it kills you, and you loose ;)<br />
<br />
It's true PvP if you want to get involved in that (I still don't understand people who complain about getting PK'd.. if you don't open your big fat mouth and talk @$#%@ you really don't have much to worry about)<br />
<br />
and many other things:<br />
It's played in a window.. that you can minimize! (what? that's possible?)<br />
Guildwars<br />
the assassins game<br />
faction wars<br />
the whole good/vs evil thing (Ao3's and SoTH's)<br />
rentable/customizeable rooms with storage<br />
questy stuff<br />
tournaments<br />
probably other stuff I'm not thinking about<br />
<br />
anyway... sure, if you not gonna play because you have a 100 Ghz processor and 5 billion megs of ram and a Gforce500 video card and can't possibly play anything that doesn't have photo quality graphics... *shrug* but if you're at all interested in playing a game that's actually fun, it's deffinately worth takeing a look at.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I've wasted 300-400 days played in EQ, and I will probably continue to do so for quite a while, but it's obvious that the m59 designers had a clue when they were making it, whereas Verant obviously wanted to get a product on the market to make money without giving much thought to what a MMORPG should/could be.<br />
<br />
P.S. Shea - server 101, beta -&gt; the day 3DO pulled the plug -&gt; NDS resurection (101 again).<br />
P.S.S and yeah m59 was the first 3D (doom quality) orpg, it predated UO by at least a year or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thing i really liked was the small server pop and broadcast messages, everyone knew everyone else and when somone was killin, was a rush to try and head them off, was some serious palm sweating action.<br />
<br />
**SoAndSo was just murdered in cold blood***<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">M59 along with UO were the first (I think) genre of RPGs online. <br />
<br />
Pfft. Yserbius predates M59 by two years. It also cost $3 an hour to play! wuwu~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brahma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't remember yserbius being first person perspective in a 3d environment (though granted m59 wasn't TRUE 3d... quake came out later) ;)<br />
<br />
and that siera games network (It was siera wasn't it?) for 3$ an hour? geeeeesh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Targar, who were you on 105? <br />
<br />
First char.. I forget...<br />
<br />
2nd Char... RazorsEdge<br />
<br />
3rd Char....Phoenix<br />
<br />
4th and last char...Spade<br />
Qor Grand<br />
Faren Grand<br />
WC Mast<br />
Karran Mast<br />
<br />
God I loved sporeburst lol<br />
<br />
And yes 90% of the time you were either in Paddies or you had run to CV to kill the ghost.:p<br />
<br />
<br />
Was in a guild with Lord Byron for awhile then left there and formed up with Taos and crew.<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
what's so great about it?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ya it has some very fun features, but for it to be revamped, all of those bugs would have to be fixed.. you know like breaking into other's guild halls etc.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
the assassins game..<br />
<br />
Haha ya this always keeps you on your toes, you are either getting PK'ed or you are 2 hits down on your dagger.<br />
<br />
the whole good/vs evil thing (Ao3's and SoTH's) <br />
<br />
One of the funnest things really. Sure sucked first time queen was killed and everyone stuff showed up in Tos adv hall for whoever to pickup.. risk vs reward I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Still think you talking about a different person, I used to rank on one of my guildmates Powerslave for standing in familiars all the time.<br />
<br />
I was hunting pkers, all the time, viper, rathengar, Merry Jayne, you name it.<br />
<br />
Lord Byron rings a bell, cant say your characters do, how late did you start playin?<br />
<br />
people I remember:<br />
Warblade<br />
Lummox<br />
Attitude<br />
Ferret<br />
Bib Fortuna<br />
the jewels(Azurite, Jewel, Malachite, etc.)<br />
Brakthar the war mage<br />
Jax Fech<br />
Fumousinator<br />
Snakehead<br />
Shike<br />
<br />
could go on but this was the people I dealt with most of the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was a hoot of a time, I missed the whole evil vs god thing, whatever that was, moved to CA briefly and stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
All that stuff is fixed now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hehe even Azurite remembered me,<br />
<br />
I took an 8 month break from EQ last year and played M59 on 109 and 106 for a about 2 months for nastalgia's sake...Azurite was on 109 as well.<br />
<br />
Not sure about these new servers the guy mentioned above. But both of those I mentioned were just PK and god built haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">QOR DONT CARE BABY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Alik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I cannot believe Mill forgot to mention me.  I was Alik Whitemoon/Drell Noquar/Kain Noquar/Kain Dracul on 105.  I was there since a Nov 96.<br />
<br />
Yes, Mill was the first to hit a 100.  I thought he was a god until I showed everyone in the Court how to kick ass without using Qor.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I would go back to M59 if they did a major overhaul on the gfx and world size.  I miss the game alot.  All I did was hunt pkers, and you cannot do that much now.<br />
