I am glad to see they have their priorities strait.   :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well by posting on one classes'  board they automatically piss off 13 others.<br />
<br />
However, as one with a 61 Monk, I do think Monk's need some tweaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You also have to remember that we're stuck with Brenlo as our shmuck... I mean... community relations representative.  He's in charge of shaman issues right now.  Can we trade him for Ash please? :)</div></div><hr />

I think monks are more broken than us as a class.<br />
Whereas we're mostly broken high end monks pretty much broken 1-65.<br />
But there again im sure SoE have more than enough resources to just look at more than 1 class at a time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What's up with those &quot;look at Class_X, they get so much more attention&quot;-threads lately, Warbear? Necros, Monks, whatever.<br />
<br />
I don't gave any negative rep bumps for that, incase you are wondering. But that attitude doesn't help much, when it comes to inter-class discussions or when you try to get several classes with different interests to voice their concerns together.<br />
<br />
Remember when we tried to present our proposal and got shot down pretty hard from some clerics on their board? With some of the most moronic, self-centered posts i ever forced myself to read. I really don't want shaman to be viewed like that from other classes.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.<br />
<br />
And no, we still can't shrink dogdog  :(.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You guys seem to be miss understanding me.   I am not talking about other classes being looked into.  Its more of the matter of attitude Sony has towards us, compaired to the rest of the classes.  For example = <br />
<br />
EQ rep. / Shaman board  = &quot; I will only talk to you guys if I have something important to say, simple as that &quot;<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=6967#M6967<br />
<br />
EQ rep. / monk board = &quot; it would be fun to start a chit chat thread so I can try and get to know you all a bit better. &quot;<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Monks&amp;message.id=1806#M1806<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what i mean.  All of the EQ reps. and Devs always keep their chat as short, simple, and broad as possible, when it comes to talking to Shaman.   <br />
While they want to know every other class personally, like they want to become best friends.  Am I the only one that sees this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The post to the monks is not brenlo, that is Ashlanne.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guys...  The three people posting on the eqlive boards have divided the classes amongst them. Some are approaching it differently than others. I do care that we have problems, but right now the biggest thing that bugs me is how we flame the good people (Ashlanne is a really great person just so you know) who are trying to do their job. <br />
<br />
You can argue with me that we've been broken so long and we have a right to flame on. I disagree, we are all people in this world. We are paying a whole 13 bucks a month... Two cups of coffee a day to play EQ. Yes we are paying money, but so is everyone else. There are lots of problems in EQ and the devs have to prioritize. I highly doubt that they don't care and want us all to suffer, they know that is not the way to make money. Come on folks, if you don't like it just quit, the less shammies there are the more i'll be wanted :-P  : :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I encourage you to look over the replies on the sony boards.<br />
<br />
99% of the answers are:<br />
a. I have answered that question here: &quot;insert url&quot;<br />
b. &quot;adjective&quot;, I will pass it along to the development team.<br />
c. The development team has told me that it is working as intended.<br />
d. This thread was locked.  Remember not to flame other players.<br />
<br />
Although it appears their community staff is more active.  I have yet to see any patch messages/in game changes which were a result of any of the player started threads.<br />
<br />
I whole heartidly expect Shaman's to be broken for the long term.  Any enhancements we may have been expecting are covered under the &quot;retuning of GoD&quot;.  Because obviously our concerns do not apply to the PoP endgame/LDoN Hard Raids, only in GoD.<br />
<br />
So relax, enjoy the ride, and when you start questioning the price of admission remember there are other amusement parks you can visit.  As for me I'm still enjoying the Whirl till you Hurl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sorta happy that one of mine got a &quot;Nice idea, I'll pass it on to the Devs&quot;  Small upgrade from &quot;adjective,&quot; bu gave a warm fuzzy for a little while at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im all for slamming someone, but atlest get your quotes right...damn.inclination, time is the quote. &quot; So please settle down and be patient.  When I have something important to add, I will. &quot; <br />
Brenlo<br />
  That was the afore mentioned post..He said that when &quot;He&quot; had something important to add he would post it...As much as I dislike mindless entities functioning from behind a veil of obscurity, theres not much one dude can do...We can scream at his slack ass all day long..Post thousands and thousands of post on how disgruntled we are, but untill some snot nosed sniveling little button pusher descides that sony is gonna change em, it wont happen..So untill then people are gonna vent, rant, rave, scream, wag fingers and blow gasgets untill it does get fixed..Its human, ita natural and its healthy..So live with it or quit the game..Stick to facts.</div></div><hr />
