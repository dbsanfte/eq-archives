<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I created a druid on the second box to port my shaman around, since I'm cheap and don't like to pay for ports, but I'm also fair and don't want to take em for free :)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, so far, I haven't really been PL'ing the druid as such, but rather have been buffing the crap out of him and then just killing stuff.  Last night though, I brought him up to paludal caverns and did the following:<br />
<br />
- buff level 14 druid with HoS, Guardian, STA, alacrity, and chloro<br />
- only buff on my 51 shaman is a drive by KEI I got from a friend<br />
- druid tosses 7 points of damage shield on himself and pulls a few red bandits<br />
- shaman heals druid as needed, generally taking agro from the unengaged mobs<br />
- has to channel heals through the little 1-2 point hits that low greens sometimes manage.<br />
<br />
Seems to be able to get the druid like 1-2 levels per hour at 14th.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for good methods to PL a druid with a shaman?  Also, I volunteered to PL my friend's 15 cleric at the same time, so if the presense of a cleric changes things, please suggest alternatives for when the cleric is around.<br />
<br />
I figured I'd go with a druid for porting instead of a wizard because they'd be easier to PL.   And I could then use the 2nd box druid to PL up alts on the first box :)  If anyone thinks a wizard would be a better choice, please feel free to give me tips on the best way for a shaman to PL a wizard too.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
go buy him that solists wand that drops in kurns. from lvl 12 on he can just chain nukes while you root the mob on yourself. at lvl 20+ he'll start outdamaging it with real nukes.<br />
<br />
plus your dogdog can chew the mobs down from half hp if you don't use any DS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I vote for a dru as port mule because, as Kazim mentioned, pl posibilites for the first account (can be handy). PL via DS also usually results in acceptable defence skill increases.<br />
<br />
At 14th I played near the hollowshade moor zone (with a 31 dru guardian angle), generally faster kills than bandits I think. Kurn's tower (in fob) is also a fun pl ground when no one is hunting there. (Till about 16/17th or there abouts)<br />
<br />
However, only wizards can translocate., ofcoruse.<br />
The addition of a clr does not change much I don't think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, druid snare is MUCH better, and as a TEAM, I think shaman/druid is better.  (Actually I think you should make a monk heheh but that's another story.)<br />
<br />
On PL'ing in general, reds are usually less efficient than just killing more blues and sometimes yellows.  The main reason is reds have too many hitpoints(which makes killing them slower and getting any notable effect from damage shields less likely), and both melee and spells land on them far less often than when you're just fighting blues.  This is what I've found when using my own shaman 60 and druid 54 to PL people.  <br />
<br />
Fighting blues will let you put off slowing and healing as long as possible, too, letting the druid's damage shield get more aggro on him, too.  That means more mobs dying simultaneously, increasing experience rate.  You will have to heal fast against yellows and reds, and then the mobs will be wasting their time aggroing you.  You'll get interrupts then when trying to heal, etc, and it is just not as efficient.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to target yourself when doing group buffs! ;)</div></div><hr />
