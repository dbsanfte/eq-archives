<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I 2-box a 54 shaman and 54 warrior.  Since level 50 I have been hunting in Dulak on the boats and have really enjoyed it.  However it is now get repetitious and I need some new scenery.  Do you have any suggestions?  I doubt I could handle any PoP area so I was wondering what areas you might suggest this duo go hunt?  Where would this duo of level 54s have hunted pre-PoP?<br />
<br />
Also I have some RL friends that group on Friday night every other week.  This Friday the group would be 54 shaman-54warrior-54ranger-52wizard-46druid.  I dont think this would be a good LDoN group so where do you think this group would have fun hunting?  We have been doing the higher level boats in Dulak but want to explore some new areas.</div></div><hr />

Spent a lot of time in the Grey getting 60, around the Ssra temple zonein - usually around back, since people training their way into Ssra were generally too uber to shout &quot;train&quot;.  Made a good chunk of change from the named drops - the shissar eye earring is a dang handy item - of course, back then, the shissar BP was one helluva nice upgrade for a warrior wearing Guardian BP.  *grin*<br />
<br />
If I were mid-50's, I'd be tempted to try out the changes to the Hole, Dragon Necropolis, and Siren's Grotto (I *think* they changed SG) - as the ZEM in those places should be very nice.<br />
<br />
Look up the Caller quest in Fungus Grove for your nites with the group, it's a whole heap of fun, and the perfect level for you guys, I'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They did change Sirens Grotto, but I never hunted there before so I don't know whats different now. All I do know is that they are VERY resistant, hit pretty hard, and there are many caster mobs. I probably would avoid that with your duo, maybe with a cleric added to your group it would be doable.<br />
Your duo could handle PoJ, just know that a puller under level 56 will get adds. The zone in area in Chardok is real good for your levels. I did it at 53 solo so you should have no problem. There is a roamer who comes all the way to the zone in wall, and at your levels you will get 2 on the first round of pulls (3 if roamer comes along). Just keep the camp broken and you will get 1 every cycle after that. The Hole starts to go LB at 54 but the XP is still pretty good. Try CoM, lots of DB's mixed in with some LB's near the castle. Since the change you can invis your way all the way to the bridge in front. Real good XP in there, plus Shammy epic drops if you don't already have.<br />
Lots of good stuff out there at 54, wait till you get closer to 60, its like hitting a wall. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">KC isn't too bad either, I normally go on the left moat everyone at that lvl is in pop. It isn't crowded anymore like it use to be. Mobs are easy compared to pop. Trains can happen fairly easy though. I duo'd with my monk there for awhile. I'm sure there are better places, but it's an option. Also PoD killing flies isn't bad, the low ones there they hit max for lie 170. No loot but decent experiance. Few rats around there but there alot tougher</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um...Old Sebilis.  Velketor's.  Old Seb. Velks. OS. VL. :P<br />
<br />
Need a cleric though - at least I think you might need one.  Tried shammy primary healer / druid primary healer in OS a couple times in the low - mid 50s.  Worked okay at zone in; zone in xp sucks tho :P.  Didn't work so well at cages or NG tho ;).<br />
<br />
After luclin launched, VL and OS were still pretty busy but not as, so I found myself fighting in Maiden's Eye far too frequently.  Somone mentioned The Grey, I loved the zone with guildies but it was such a pain gettin people there (omgz I can't breath I'll die!!!  If you take the time to fight there with EB for a bit you can get a damn necklace that lets you breathe.  I was highly annoyed as the xp was much better and so was the loot).  So back to OS &amp; VL for me it was :p.  Oh and occassionally Sonic Bats &amp; Bugs in Sol B with a warrior/cleric 2 boxer.<br />
<br />
This was all with my Rogue though, but hey its all xp ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kabsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Duoed most of lvl 55-61 with a beastlord in old world making nice pp<br />
