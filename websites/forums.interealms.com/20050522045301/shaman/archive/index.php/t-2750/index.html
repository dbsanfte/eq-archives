Soon as I ding 52 and get Regrowth I will spend a good amount of time upgrading my equipment. Something that I should have been working on all along... though level 54 and Cann III is tempting!!<br />
<br />
Would appreciate your opinions on equipment upgrades. Always considered camping low level items to be boring, and not worth the time, so the leveling urge continued...<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />

* shoulders - tattered mantle<br />
* rings - pair of velium fire opal<br />
* face - bone mask of the jarsath, enshrouded veil<br />
* JB boots, JB helm</div></div><hr />

Get into Kael Arena raids for main armor slot replacements; better and just as easy to get normally as Hate armor.<br />
Other suggestions;<br />
Jaundice Bone can be bought or gotten in drops from KC &amp; Seb for Head, Arms, Feet and Hands rather easily.<br />
<br />
Shield; SBS - get groups in Chardok, plus it's good XP<br />
<br />
Neck; Ivory Imbued Collar - again, Chardok.<br />
<br />
Belt; Fear - one raid tends to get you the Toad belt<br />
<br />
Legs; Jarsath Scale - no drop from KC, usually rot.  Down in the basement area.  Xp camp <br />
<br />
Shoulders; work on that shawl quest more, or get a Ranger and a couple friends and head to Trak's Teeth.  Pull the Hunter/Foragers until you get a Meditative Blanket.  Xp, but a bit slow as the puller has to find the mobs.<br />
<br />
Upgrade Rings to Velium Wedding Rings.  One day of HGs will give you the plat easily to buy them.<br />
<br />
Back &amp; Face - Artic Wyvern Hide; not too bad stuff for those slots.  Camp Artic Wyverns in CS to collect some hides to lower pirce.  Again, XP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Neck:  Another option is the Shrouded Medallion (AC 12, +25 Mana, +15 vs Magic, +5 vs Fire, +5 vs Cold, +5 Str) - drops in Maiden's Eye off Xi Xiau's- it's NO DROP, so you'll have to camp it, but it's fairly common.<br />
<br />
Neck (again):  You might want to think about a BA Medallion.  Stats aren't bad (ac 6, +5 wis, +5 int.) You'll also get &quot;Mana preservation II&quot;, which will cause all spells you cast under level 45 to cost 10% less.  This should also be pretty reasonably priced (few hundred PP, about the same as your chryso talisman.) <br />
<br />
Face:  Ditch the velium ruby veil and get an Arctic Wyvern Mask (AC 6, +5 Wis, +6 Cha, +3 vs Cold) - you might even make a few plat on this deal. You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask. <br />
<br />
Head:  Replace the ry-gorr with a JB helm.  Cheap and great AC.<br />
<br />
Feet:  JB boots.<br />
<br />
Wrist:  Swap out one of your bracers for a CBB (chipped bone bracelet). Same stats as the RMB (minus the 4 str) and you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; (25% less mana to cast any level 44 or lower DoT - I still use it for stacking VoS on top of EBolt.) If you swap out the RMB, you should even make a bit of cash on the swap. <br />
<br />
Shield:  Replace your charred guardian shield with a Clay Guardian Shield . You can probably break even on this one. You'll lose 9 WIS, but gain 15 raw AC and 50 HP - this is a good trade. A general ratio for deciding on equipment is 1 WIS = 1 AC = 10 HP- according to this the char guar is 19 points, the clay guar = 30 points. <br />
<br />
All of these changes shouldn't set you back much, and will give you a nice increase in stats.  :)<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When trying to upgrade gear do this:<br />
<br />
Look at your gear, pick out what you have that is best, what is average, and what blows.  Work on getting good gear for your slots that blow, will be the best way to improve your stats overall.  I know it sounds simple, but a lot of the advice above is telling you to do things that you just dont need to worry about till you fix some really crappy items.<br />
<br />
Ill do a breakdown 4u<br />
<br />
Earrings: These are about as good an earring as you can get easily on your own.<br />
<br />
Neck/Head: These item are fine for now.  Leave em<br />
<br />
Face:  You face slot really isnt that good, but... Most good face items cost more for what you get than if you spent the money on another slot.  So id leave what you have for now.<br />
<br />
Rings:  Ehh Id get another hp ring, its pretty cheap and although you need the wis, 55/65 hp is a lot for one item.  Get the wis from other slots.<br />
<br />
Symbol of Loyalty to Vox:  This needs to go more than an inlaw on December 26th.  Get another rmb if you cant get anything elese.<br />
<br />
Arms:  Those are ok for now, not a lot of good arms around.<br />
<br />
Hands:  Get coldain skin gloves, cheap and good stats.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  You must trash this.  Chokadi hide spaulders, hp/mana dragonwing mantles, or even tattered mantle are cheap and dont suck.<br />
<br />
BP:  Good bp's are hard, id just keep the rygor.  Can but iksar regen or barbed ringmail, forglok scale tunic is pretty good too.<br />
<br />
Back:  Best item you have probly, dont think about spending money on this, change other gear.<br />
<br />
Belt:  Your belt is fine, when you get more wis you can consider spider fur belt.<br />
<br />
Legs:  Ehh there arnt a lot of good legs.  Maybe do the kromrif military legs quest or try and get jarsith scale in kc.<br />
<br />
Spear/Shield/Range:  All Ok<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to totaly overhaul your gear, consider pog/thurg or maybe hate.  I just did tradeable or easy quest stuff.</div></div><hr />
