<br />
someone is paperhanging me.  they stole 5500 out of one of my bank accounts, now theyve done it again on another account.  does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this kind of ****?  im so ****ing livid right now im going to kill someone.  i'm going through the bank, fbi doesnt seem to eager to help, and the local PD financial crimes unit referred me back to the fbi nat'l fraud center.<br />
<br />
if you have any advice, please email me at mojokyn@san.rr.com.  thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've had your identity stolen. You need to contact all financial institutions you deal with and put a stop to transactions and a warning on your accounts. You need to contact the credit bureaus and make sure that you tell them they should place a security alert on your credit file and that no more accounts should be opened. Etc etc. <br />
<br />
Do a google search for &quot;identity theft&quot; lots of good advice out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Call the FBI and your local state Buerau.  Don't wait.  Do it now.<br />
<br />
The might be able to nab that bastages in the act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really don't know a whole lot, but Mojo, do banks insure against this kind of crap? If it is proven to not be you, do you get the money back or does it have to be gotten from the perp?<br />
<br />
Thats total crap, and wish you best of luck, can't believe law enforcement not being nice, I am sure if you turned your stereo up or had a keg party they would respond instantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

Should be simple for the bank to figure out where, how money was removed? Was account accessible from ATM card, or would somone have to physically go to the bank? If physically there, simple videotape would be easy, and can't imagine somone getting 5500 bucks out of an ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Proof of identity is the responsibility of the bank or vendor at which the debit/check-card is used.  I can't tell from what you said what type of fraud is involved, but unless it's someone doing it who is your wife or something, you can get all your money back.  Report your cards stolen immediately tho.  If it was a Visa Check Card the bandits used to steal 5k from your bank account, the vendors who accepted that card are liable for replacing the funds.  Contact the card company and the bank itself and tell it to stop payment, and stop payment on any checks you have out currently.  <br />
Credit protection that credit card companies sell you is a fraud in and of itself.  All the protection you can get is automatic under existing laws.  <br />
<br />
I've had a similar thing happen to me once.  One of my credit cards was stolen and the thieves began ordering stuff online.  I hadn't realized the card was gone until the bill came in the mail.  I called the card company and told them about it and they yoinked the money away from the vendors that sold the thieves whatever they were buying.  I never was bothered about it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They may have also gotten some checks. (Not sure if this was mentioned).<br />
<br />
I just read the book &quot;Catch me if you can&quot; (Now a movie starring Leonardo Di-something) about a guy who made a 5 year living doign exactly that. Only difference was he was stealing from Pan Am (Old Air carrier for you youngsters).<br />
<br />
Land's advice sounds 'spot on.' I advise checking your checks too.<br />
Color me naive - but the only way I can think he or she is doing this is they have a stack of your checks - make one out to them (the perp) then forge your signature.<br />
<br />
Once they get caught - hope they spend much time in jail where their a55 is a buffet for the hard core types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.) Tell all applicable companies about what's happening.  Most have resources to deal with this, they will flag your account.<br />
<br />
2.) Put holds on your credit cards, bank account, etc.  Vendors can confisgate a credit card that is being used on a locked account.  Get all new cards with new numbers.<br />
<br />
3.) Change all your passwords, code words, etc. on all your accounts.  Do you do internet banking?  If so, change your password asap.<br />
<br />
4.) Get a credit report, it will tell you whatever else is going on.  You may have had loans taken out in your name.  Your bank can help you get these.<br />
<br />
Having an identity stolen (if that's what happened) really sucks, and unfortunately you have to go after each robbery individually after it's resolved.  Get your Social Sec'y # taken off every piece of ID that you can.  Insurance cards, for instance, use your social.  Get that changed, it's totally unnecessary.<br />
<br />
A side thought...do you use PayPal?  They have a record of siphoning funds out of people's accounts.  Track the cash and find where its going, it may lead you somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most of what everyone has posted so far is good advice.  Hopefully this is just localized to your bank accounts.  But I would indeed put a hold on everything in case you did have your identity stolen.<br />
<br />
Get a look at your credit report, if the worst has happened you'll wanna start trying to get it fixed asap, as they are slow to make 'positive' changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nmok Soulblighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mojo, speaking from experience on this...had my identity stolen about 3 years ago, person bought a car and took out another 75k loan on my info, you need to immediately contact the 3 major credit reporting companys, EQuifax, EDS and Compuscore.  Give them your info, request a credit report from each...in GA you are allowed 1 free report a year from each....and also put on your report that any new loans, credit cards, etc. are to be verfied by a call to a number that you give.  This will take care of most problems with CC's but if you put IDENTITY STOLEN, VERIFY INFORMATION on your report they will lock it down fast and do more than cursory work on the verification.  I do feel for you, it will take atleast another 3 to 6 months for everything to pop up on your report if they did steal your identity, but it will be easy to get them if they continue to use your info.  If you need any more help, dont hesitate to contact me.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ack! Very sorry to hear this Mojo.<br />
<br />
I know you dont live in the same country as me but I can tell you that in Denmark you are not responsible for what people do with your credit card if its stolen. I am pretty sure that you must have something similar.<br />
<br />
All my best wishes that you get out of this situation SOON!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If this happened across a state line, doesn't that right there flag it as a federal offense? FBI should be kicking ass for you. Fraud is not a minor offense, person is in some serious deep crap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well i went to the bank today and raised some holy hell, and i managed to get my claims approved...so i got my $5750 back.  bad news is, who knows when it could happen again?  been doing a lot of research...thanks for all of your advice guys.  im still pissed but at least im not cleaned out anymore.<br />
<br />

I can understand wanting to ventalate whatever bastage is doing this to you Mojo .... grrrrrr.<br />

Nmok's offer of help is great and I would take him / her up on it.  Nothing like first hand experiance dealing with the same problem to help out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My wife had her purse stolen out of her van while picking the kids up at a daycare center.  We had around $11,000 in checking at the time.<br />
<br />
Timeline:<br />
5:00 PM -- Purse Stolen<br />
5:20 PM -- Big Screen TV at best buy on credit card $1400<br />
5:30 PM -- Computer at Office Max $1500<br />
5:40 PM -- Jewelry store on Credit Card $1200<br />
5:45 PM -- Realize purse is missing<br />
5:50 PM -- Credit Card Rejected by merchant at Target (AI algorithm)  Camera in Target catches image of thief, who looks at least marginally like wife<br />
6:10 PM -- Contact Credit Cards, Banks, etc, warn of problem.  Advise that we are leaving country for a 10-day cruise vacation.<br />
6:30 PM -- Bank places a notice on our account, is aware we are leaving country.<br />
7:00 PM -- Speak to police, they already have printout from Target camera<br />
7:00 AM next day -- leave<br />
4:00 PM next day -- get new credit cards delivered to cruise departure terminal in miami.<br />
next 10 days<br />
Thief's write 50+ $200 checks from OTHER accounts to OUR account, bring to drive up wind as cash-back-on-deposit transactions.  Thief gets $10,000+ in cash from drive up teller window.  Bank's are morons.<br />
next 3 months ...<br />
Spend HOURS and HOURS of time filling out affidavits to protect credit history.<br />
Check credit report periodically to make sure identity theft doesn't continue.<br />
<br />
In the end we lost a few hundred bucks a most, a HELL of a lot of piece of mind, and a LOT LOT LOT of time responding to bad check mail and filling out affidavits that the accout, etc, wasn't stolen.<br />
<br />
But our bank ate $10,000+ in losses, and the Merchants / Visa lost over $5,000 more in losses.  Nobody was ever caught.<br />
<br />
It really sucks ... close your accounts ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, I would recommend closing all accounts and reopening new ones. It sounds as though someone may have gotten ahold of info regarding your accounts somewhere and has progressed on from there. If you KNOW that you have at least those two accounts compromised, don't just get the money back. Also close those accounts that were compromised and open new ones. It won't hurt you to do that, and it can help. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Contact the 3 big credit bureau's and tell them you require a phone call for new credit accounts to be opened in your name.<br />
<br />
which would be um, equifax, experian and I forget the last one, maybe transunion.<br />
<br />
Then thieves can't open new credit cards/charge accounts for you, without the credit bureau's contacting you by phone.  It's a pain in the ass if you want to do &quot;90 days same as cash&quot; or that crap, because you can't unless you give the credit bureau's a cell phone number as your permanent phone number.<br />
<br />
It can be annoying at times but I had some small measure of identity theft a few years ago and I did this to help me get back my accounts back into MY CONTROL.<br />
<br />
You'll feel better if you do.<br />
<br />
Also, buy a damn paper shredder.  Shred everything, it's fun anyways.  <br />
<br />
Good luck Mojo, hope you get it straightened out.  When I got these bills for all this stuff charged on new accounts, I was furious and it was scary to see how easy it can be.  So I sympathize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My brother had about $700 stolen from him after he used his debit card at a local restaurant. He got it back but it was a horrible mess for a couple weeks. Another good advice is after about 6 months to a year, get another Credit report from all three of the Credit Reporting companies. Then another 6 months to a year get another one. Good luck Mojo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The 3 major Credit Bureas are Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.  I dealt with them quit a bit at my old job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Had my cc number stolen recently, also (as a result I do not shop on-line anymore).<br />
Reading this thread reminded me that I never checked with the three major creditors.<br />
Mayhap I should soon :/<br />
<br />
Anyway glad you were able to get it straightened out, Mojo.  I know the feeling all too well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There's something I've learned through a friend's experience.  You should worry about this when your post office mail sits in some sort of mailbox that isn't locked.  This is especially true for people living in apartment/condo complexes.<br />
<br />
Scam goes like this:<br />
1) you open a new account<br />
2) Bank sends you debit cards<br />
3) theif sees the cards/knows the cards are coming etc. and takes the envelope<br />
4) theif watches your mail for the next piece of mail from your bank - it is almost certain to be the pin number mailing confirmation.<br />
5) theif bleeds you dry.<br />
<br />
Happened to a friend of mine - she eventually learned that it was her brother in law.  They caught him on the video camera at an ATM - apparently they keep that footage stored somewhere...<br />
<br />
My advice?  Get a PO Box if your mail isn't secure - sometimes friends and family have mean streaks and you have no clue they exist....  Sad but true...<br />
<br />
Kongar<br />
<br />
PS Good luck Mojo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">bleh.  thanks for the support and advice, i really appreciate it.  finally got everything straightened out, put passwords on my bank accounts and fraud alerts with the credit bureaus (that i am going to renew on a regular basis), and have reports filed with the san diego police dept financial crimes unit.   this has seriously been one of the most distasteful events of my life, i wouldn't wish this on anyone.</div></div><hr />
