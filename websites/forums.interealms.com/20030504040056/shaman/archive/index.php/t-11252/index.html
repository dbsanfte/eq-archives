<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Acanthurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight I finally bought a spiritstone so I decided to change my bind point after a year or so having it set in the pot room.  With the POP book portals the fire pots are obsolete.  Only problem was when I tried to bind in FG I got the message that I couldn't establish an affinity there and should try a location near a city.  Is this a bug or has something changed with the spell?  I used to be able to bind anywhere but its been a long time since I've tried to change my bind spot.  Maybe its something tied to the FG zone.  Anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />
