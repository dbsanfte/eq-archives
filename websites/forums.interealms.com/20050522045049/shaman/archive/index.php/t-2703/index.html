<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted to say hello to my fellow shaman brethren. My lil kitty Vah shir shaman is my highest level character, and the one that has captured my attention the most. Currently level 51, on the E'Ci server, unguilded, and with a monk friend that I always group with.<br />
<br />
<br />
May the roads you travel be safe.<br />
<br />
And if not, let there be good loot on their corpses!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">welcome to the board!  I think your the 4'th E'ci shaman ive seen here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was wondering if anyone has any good hunting grounds or specific mobs to 'tank' in order to get my last few defensive points up at level 51?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi Zyran :)<br />
<br />
Welcome<br />
<br />
Go let da seafuries in OOT beat on joo.  Just tank them solo when joo monk friend is not on.  They have a fair chunk of HP for dare lvl but hit easy.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hello Zyran ;)<br />
I know a few E'Ci Shaman here, but they're lurkers ;P  Had 'em asking me about my sig picture on a raid the other day.  Never seen any of em post.  <br />
<br />
So if you're reading this you E'Ci shammies, say HI! :p<br />
<br />
I can't even remember where I hunted at 51.. hmm.. Velk's and Seb I think. But that was before Alt Ability and the return of the lvl 60s to the xp zones.  Now those zones are much higher.  <br />
KC, Hole entrance, GD Giants, Scarlet Desert is very nice xp in the low 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looking for a consistent stream of low dark blues to get your Defense skill up at 51?  I know it's not considered cool, but Dreadlands is a great place for you.  Slow a dark blue gorilla, dvorlag, or chicken... they don't hit that hard, they have low HP, and there are zones to run to if you get in trouble.  Of course, make sure you have your AGI and DEX buffed up (think AGI is the one used for defensive skill gains, but why not be safe and have 'em both buffed.. especially since HoS includes the DEX buff.)<br />
<br />
By the BW zone is a nice pullspot and normally not too crowded.  If DL is too crowded, just zone over and try the same thing with hornets in BW !!  :)<br />
<br />
Good hunting.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Soooooooo glad I maxed defense at 43 !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye I wish I had maxxed out defense earlier, but it was worse before! At around level 40-45 I gained 50-75 points of defense. Couldn't even begin to imagine how much time I would have to invest at level 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I only really started slowing till around 45 or so, and till then my defense was poopie.  It goes up quick though, and you can raise it several ways. <br />
<br />
a) Just tank/solo by having the mob slowed, yourself buffed with hps, ac and regen.<br />
<br />
b) Pick anything that's light blue, doesn't hit hard and use him as a sparring partner.  I've done this in kc at level 56 to raise my piercing with a drolvarg sentry :)  Even had a bard at one point help me out and play cantana for me <br />
<br />
b) Group up in a fast pace dungeon.  With lots of adds, you'll have to slow, and slow = big aggro.  Provided you don't die, all the aggro generated from slow should raise your defense pretty quickly.  Anyways, at 51, I'd recommend grouping in kc for that.  I started in Sebilis at level 53, and I honestly think you'd have a hard time trying to find a group there at 51.  Dunno about about velks, always hated it.</div></div><hr />
