Me and my gf both see multi coloured wolves (and other mobs) on the screen all the time. How do I get back my nice dog so I dont feel like I'm on acid any more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enkidu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">turning off texture caching fixed this issue for me. zones load a tad slower, but the speed saving with the caching wasn't worth the visual degredation. someone turned me on to this fix in my guild, but i'm sure it's posted somewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can leave texture caching on and just delete the current cache files (I think they have .txc extension?).  It will rebuild those files as you zone into each location so your first zone will be slower but after that you will be back up to speed.  If it happens again you'll have to delete the cache files again.  It happened to me twice (on all three computers in my house that are eq capable.).  I'm assuming there was a bug or that they changed the numbers of certain graphics.  Its stabalized for me now though and I have had to delete the cache files in a couple of months.</div></div><hr />
