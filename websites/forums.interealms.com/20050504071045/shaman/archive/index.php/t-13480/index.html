<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will soon be in an Ssra / NToV guild, and since I have some time to work on an alt before we start hitting those areas, I was wondering which alt I should work on leveling up to drag along. I can level up my wizard or rogue (or something else if there is a better idea) to help out. I was leaning towards a dps class, but am open to ideas, we have a good balance of all classes atm so I could pick pretty much anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rogues tend to be better in Velious, however a well AA'd and spelled wizard tends to be just as good in Ssra, and a LOT better in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wizard, because they are incredibly easy to two box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say Wizard, for the reason above.  Position Wizard, then press nuke macros to your heart's content.<br />
<br />
With a rogue, you have to worry about positioning, BS cycling, mob push and other things you don't need while 2-boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have a meleer the 2nd box will be the shaman.  You are too busy positioning and stuff on the meleer.  It's easy to reach over and hit a hotkey for the shammy.</div></div><hr />
