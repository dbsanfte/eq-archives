(If I don't have a max hit it's coz I never been hit by it)<br />
<br />
Va Dyn Khar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=13443) <br />
The First named you kill. Drops nothing but key to get into VT.<br />
<br />
Thall Va Xakra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8778) -- TVX, slowable, silence, ramps, max hit 900<br />
These are your first VT named. 3 day respawn. Very easy. AE Silence. After you enter VT there's a path north and south. It leads to these. Clear the wing before you pull because all the mobs there (28?) will assist whenever you aggro the named. The guards drop keys you need for further VT access.<br />
<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8776) -- Blob1, UNSLOWABLE, rooted, grav-flux, flurry, WARDERS, max hit 650<br />
From enterance go straight (west). You really can't miss him. Best spot to leave a CoH bot is in the &quot;nook&quot; behind. You will really want a CoH bot there.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Xin (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8788) -- DXX, ramps, slowable, max hit 1200<br />
From the door to Blob1 go North. Follow it around til you get to a big room. Stairs there take you to DXX. He's all alone. Guards got some keys you need.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Va (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8789) -- DVX, UNSLOWABLE, max hit 654<br />
Opposite of DXX. Go South from Blob1. These guards have to same keys as DXX.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Xin Thall (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8787) -- DXXT, UNSLOWABLE, WARDERS, rampage, silence<br />
From DXX or DXV just keep going around. Next big room has stairs to DXXT.<br />
<br />
Note: There are rooms on the north and south sides. There's one 4arm in each that patrols back and forth. This is the best spot to place a CoH mage (allowing you to skip from Blob1 to DXXT. This is a HUGE time saver). So far none of these 4arms have seen invis.<br />
<br />
Thall Va Kelun (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8817) -- TVK, ramp, quad 1000, slowable, WARDERS<br />
Port up from clicker behind DXXT (2 mobs there). Clear mobs toward the West. Always has two 'Thall' guards, but they suck so it's easier to just pull them all at once rather than splitting. Time is precious if you wanna be in bed before 4am.<br />
<br />
DO NOT CLICK THE THING NEXT TO TVK OMG!<br />
<br />
You only have to kill ONE of either TXD or DXVT. They share the same Warders.<br />
<br />
Thall Xundraux Diabo (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8816) -- TXD, UNSLOWABLE, WARDERS<br />
Go North from the TVK area. Some pulls here are pretty big. This is my personal choice of hardest mob in VT.<br />
<br />
Diabo Xi Va Temariel (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10400) -- DXVT, slowable, WARDERS, Blackwind (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2162&amp;source=Live), super gimp<br />
South from TVK area. Some of the pulls can get a little large but even with bad luck you shouldn't get anything worse than 3-4 Eom.<br />
<br />
The Porters behing DXVT/TXD click up to the room before Mini-Aten. There are generally 4 very angry high levels mobs here (Eom/Pli). So be ready. <br />
<br />
None of the mobs need splits and you don't need to hurry before respawn. Nice relaxing bit at the end of the day. This is Candy Land.  <br />
<br />
Va Xi Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8786) -- Mini-Aten, slowable, WARDERS, grav-flux<br />
<br />
DON'T CLICK THE THINGY! There's a secret wall behind it.<br />
<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8818) -- Blob2, slowable, grav-flux, max hit 1650<br />
There's two of these. One North and one South.<br />
<br />
Aten Ha Ra (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8815) -- AHR or Aten, slowable, AEs Word of Command (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2157&amp;source=Live) + Silence + grav-flux, ramps, max hit 1054<br />
<br />
Grats you completing VT<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that's all right, but most of it is from memory and past TVK I don't tend to pay much (if any) attention to what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
Could someone familiar with VT explain the additional keys possibly?<br />
I have the key to get in, but was not aware there were others required to see the whole zone.  How many others keys are there?  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Door keys, not needed for every person, just rogues and monks and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great write-up on Vex Thal.  One this she forgot to mention, make sure to brew a pot of coffee, cause if your guild is going to clear VT you're going to be there a while.  My guild has been very lucky the last few days.  Friday night we managed to get our raid force there for a full spawn and we cleared the zone.  Then Monday server repopped and we managed a full spawn minus Blob 1 which a HK guild took out before it got too late for them.  VT is a lot of fun, but is a LONG, intense raid.</div></div><hr />

Also,<br />
tonight was our first time in VT.  We parked a mage in Blob1 room, and then headed around and killed DXX.  The guide says to &quot;From DXX or DXV just keep going around. Next big room has stairs to DXXT&quot; - does this mean go back down the stairs and keep going around?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont remember the exact name of the keys but I think they are simply Palace Key (off Va Dyn Khar) and the Inner key (off Va Xakra; TVX guard).  The 1st floor of inner VT is basically a big circle with 3 towers (S, W, N), the West tower is the key to moving onward.  So Yes, go back down the stairs and continue to the west end of the zone.  <br />
<br />
One quick note, if you only have 1 COH mage, I would have him planted at the DXXT spot rather then Blob1 for a few reasons.  First, blob1 is 100% safe spot since its perma rooted, that means you can camp a cleric there and drag a mage up.  Or if you dont have a cleric/paladin/Necro to camp, you can flop a necro there, though it requires a few good rogues and/or bards.  Also add in the fack the Blob1 is sometimes killed by other guilds while the rest of VT is left up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok our trackers are reporting Thall Xundraux Diabo on track, so I am trying to have a rogue get to him.  He says he can get to the stairs where DXXT should be but there is a locked door that he can't open with any lock picking or the north wing key.   Is there anyway to get into this room so that we can click the port up to TVK and then go to TXD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The key to get to DXXT is called North Tower key, and it drops from the guards in either the North or South towers.  (DXX or DXV)  I'm not sure why it's called North Tower key, since it opens the west tower.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are four keys associated with Vex Thal:<br />
<br />
1) Scepter of Shadows - zone entry - shards, orb, rift, scepter frame... you know the one...  Every player needs this.<br />
<br />
2) Palace key - drops off the rock in the outer courtyard.  It opens the door to the Palace itself.  One person needs this to open the door for the raid<br />
<br />
3) North Wing Key - drops off the TVX guards.  Two guards each hold two keys.  Kill TVX, kill guards.  This key opens the door at the far end of the great hall (door opens to the ante-area of Blob1).  One person needs this key to open the door for the entire raid.<br />
<br />
4) North Tower Key - drops off of the guards in the rooms behind DXX and DXV.  Opens the door behind DXXT to give you access to the &quot;second&quot; floor.  One person needs the key to open the door for the entire raid.<br />
<br />
In addition to these, there are a number of locked doors throughout the zone.  Rogues must be around to open them - but no key necessary.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
As far as placing CoH/Rez bots... here's some ideas:<br />
<br />
1) Blob1 - rez or CoH bot.  Any of the cubbies behind Blob1 work.  Rogue is used to make CoH link or drag a CoHer to a rez bot.  Everyone gets summoned to the cubby and hugs the wall.<br />
<br />
2) DXXT - Camp a CoHer INVIS in the side rooms.  There is a *small* chance of a see invis mob being in the room... if there is, you're SOL.  I've only seen it once.  CoH bot logs in, rogue links and then watches MOB pathing.  When mob paths away, CoHer summons a bard playing invis song.  Bard continues to play during CoH process.  Full group is summoned up (take breaks in summoning when the MOB paths near) and then engages the pathing MOB.  Continue to CoH at will during the fight - raid kills the MOB eventually... everyone else is summoned.  Stay away from the door out of this room - DXXT may agro.  Engage DXXT and kill like normal.<br />
<br />
3) TXD/DXVT - It is possible to place a CoH bot near these.  It's more risky than the DXXT bot as you have a higher likelihood of see invis mobs - but when it works, it saves a bunch of time.  CoH bot is camped, rogue links, CoH raid from TVK kill spot.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you have these 3 bots placed, you can clear VT in just a couple of hours total - very easily.</div></div><hr />
