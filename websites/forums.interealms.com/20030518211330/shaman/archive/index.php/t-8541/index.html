<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We just attemped Trial of Exe to get some of my Guild through. i used AE Slow as usual and aggroed a relentless punisher. It appeared in the Trial room and began to beat on me. It was a 5. Mob and only thing i can imagine is that it got aggroed by AE Slow from a lower or upper level :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That never happened before to me and i used AE Slow a lot in there...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">must have been a bugged mob... the trial rooms arent physically close enough to each other for an AE spell to reach up/down/across to a different room as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />
