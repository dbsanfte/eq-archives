<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just have come back and started to play again, and been doing exp in valor and prior to being flagged soloing in some tier 1 zones.  am looking to buy a horse, and i've heard different things.  1 is to never buy below sow speed, the other is who cares you're just using it for mana regen buy the cheapest.  i'm not too rich atm, but was wondering what u guys thought about getting a horse.  thx.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy the cheapest.  If you want to run faster click off your horsey and click your sow boots.  Why spend all that money for something you get for free?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only 2 horses are worth considering at all :<br />
<br />
1)The cheap gluepot. Purchased soley for the standing mana-regen and no-sit-agro aspects. Click it off and use SoW for actual travel.<br />
<br />
2)The 100K+ horse. Purchased by the rich to gain faster travel in addition to the benefits of the gluepot.<br />
<br />
The other 2 models don't really provide any substantial benefits over the gluepot. Especially for a class that can cast SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bought the black gluepot.  Best thing i have ever bought.  With it I have no problems doing both Shaman and Healer roles in PoD CY groups.  W/o cleric that means room for mage or necro (my favorite friend now days, mana pump and grp heal).<br />
<br />
But be warned, stop buyinh halas meat pies or misty thicket picnics or whatever fine food you eat.  The horse eats them more then you will.  I just buy 100-160 Iron Rations at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cheapest brown and tan horses sell for 8400. White and black colors cost a little more.<br />
<br />
When LoY comes out, I'm buying a white horse and dyeing it purple. Just kidding. Maybe.</div></div><hr />
