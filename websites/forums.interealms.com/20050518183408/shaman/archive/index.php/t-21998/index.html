Thats not to bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It looks like they made the following changes:<br />
<br />
1. Quiescence; increased mana from 234 to 280 and increased the healing per tick from 350 to 420. This is pretty much the same mana/heal ratio, so the efficiency didn't change.<br />
<br />
2. Replenishment; increased the amount healed per tick from 25 to 40 hp. They didn't increase the mana cost of this spell.<br />
<br />
Nice changes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looks good overall :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hahaha I love how they denote which changes we asked for.  Thats like...LOOK GUYS WE DID WHAT YOU WANT GO US!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Makes BoT a very worthwhile upgrade to Q now, and the upgrade to Q itself is really nice. Now if we can just get Tnarg's and Daluda 's upgraded similarly....<br />
<br />
Overall the patch is really good, they've addressed issues they can pretty fast. Lets see if its stable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Honestly, 420 + 40 is significant, even in the 1K quad environment. I would still like to see us get a blast heal in the 1800-2000 range in OoW, and a fast nuke in the 1000-1200 range to be a bit more balanced, but this is a nice start, and a good &quot;omen&quot; pre-Omens, if you follow. OoW is where the real balancing process is going to have to be done. Who knows what 5 more levels will bring to the content we are complaining about now, and who knows what OoW content will have issues. Exactly as we are, I think at level 70, we are fairly effective, even in the Gates stuff thats an issue now (tanks will have more hps, more mitigation, more aa's available, we have nice +melee buffs on the board, etc). Time will tell if its TRULY enough. <br />
<br />
Its hella better than a sharp stick in the eye though. Bump up that OoW heal, give us a 720/tic Bane upgrade (lower than the necros, but higher than listed), and add a 975 FAST nuke, and I will be satisfied. <br />
<br />
Can't expect the farm, don't really want it, but those tiny things would be the bomb overall, considering where we were when we all started this mess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">-The drop rate has been increased for the following items in the Plane of Hate * <br />
The Shattered Emerald of Corruption <br />
Decrepit Hide <br />
Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth <br />
Essence of Vampire <br />
Eye of Innoruuk <br />
<br />
Boy, I know several guys, rangers in particular, who are just crying as they read this.  <br />
<br />
We raided Hate something like 50 times, and for one guy killed about 70 minibosses before a shattered emerald dropped.  Obviously with epic 2.0, these zones will become a zoo as folks curse, train and shout at other, but that's part of the fun too!<br />
<br />
I like the /stopcasting command.  Nice hotkey item.  Beats ducking.<br />
<br />
And I like the access to Hate change.  Pain relying on wizards.  Nobody raids Hate like they used to, plus Hate doesn't even exist like it used to.  <br />
<br />
The damage shield and HoT/Regen changes are clearly part of the priest class rebalancing, and were the most obviously broken abilities.  It's good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like the /stopcasting command.  Nice hotkey item.  Beats ducking.Not really, since you'd have to either type it or make a macro for it and I'm super tight on macro slots as it is.  Hitting duck twice for me is habit.  In fact, I keep screwing up with my new bard because that doesn't interrupt songs heh.<br />
<br />
Is it part of the design of mounts that we can't interupt our casting or was it a side effect of not being able to duck on a mount?  They obviously made it not work on mounts for a reason.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you can't hit a hotkey like that while you are casting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/stopcasting<br />
<br />
This can't be assigned to the keyboard, hotkeys (0-9) can't be used while spellcasting. It would have to be used with a mouse from the macros window where you define them. Or do they intend this to be used as part of a larger macro?<br />
<br />
I don't understand the /guidehelp command. Are they saying that guides don't read petitions anymore so they need a separate command? How are players supposed to know whether to use /guidehelp or /petition?<br />
<br />
&quot;-The Focus effect should now filter haste messages.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think they meant spell haste. And what about other effects that weren't filtered like Improved Healing IV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If BoT realy went up to 420 mana it makes it useless as a Can5 heal.

<br />
<br />
With new replenishment you pretty much don't need to heal yourself after canni5 unless your tanking (or have low hp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">-We have added a tome to the Plane of Knowledge to allow for faster travel to and from Gunthak. Enjoy. *<br />
<br />
<br />
Cool, that will save me about 5 minutes.  That should have been done 2 expansions ago, but oh well.  On the sad side, my wizard is gonna lose alot of money on this one, as SB ports were by far my most requested.  <br />
<br />
You can now access the Plane of Hate by talking to Relm M'Loch in the Plane of Tranquility and handing her a Fuligan Soulstone. *<br />
Hmm...this will make it much easier, but once again my wizard is going to lose some cash.  About once every few weeks I get asked to help port up raids, and generally made out like a bandit.  Although, proting up groups it is still much more economical to get awizard to port you, because from the way I read that it will take a stone for every person to use the new teleporter in PoK (whatcha wanna bet its a gnome  :)  )Good change though<br />
<br />
We have added a /stopcast command -- This command will not work when riding a horse. * <br />
I started cursing out loud when I read this.  Why the HELL would they add functionality like this when ducking is faster AND better.  Since you cant use hotkeys while casting, the only way to use this command is to type it out while the spell is casting.  If its a fast casting spell you are screwed because by the time you realize its the wrong spell or you dont want to cast it and get /spellstop typed I would bet its already fired.<br />
<br />
/spellstop ONLY makes sense for use on mounts where there is NO way to stop a cast except moving around and HOPING that you dont get a channeling check.  <br />
<br />
Oh well.  Good changes overall though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually I think that will be the main reason they introduced it - people channeling through duck.<br />
<br />
<br />
With new replenishment you pretty much don't need to heal yourself after canni5 unless your tanking (or have low hp).<br />
<br />
Even with good regen and replenishment you're only getting 100 HP per tick.  That's 2 min to fill back up, can you stand your HP that low for so long :) ?</div></div><hr />

Lol<br />
Hmm with these Hot Upgrades, not that anyone is likely thinking about it, but it could mean some more doable solos, perhaps some unthinkable ones. Certain Luclin mobs possibly. Kunark dragons is another possibility but I don't think we have the ability to effectively damage them although could have a long fight with solely pet damage.</div></div><hr />

I'm not too worried about Q overhealing canni4 now though...  One canni4 during its run and you've covered the extra mana and then some.  I think I can manage that.</div></div><hr />

The Raid leader can click on a player, and change that player's note in the edit box below the list. The note will show on all raid members' raid windows. *<br />

Not useless, just overhealing.  Making the ancient canny spell somewhat available would remedy that problem, though.  And you are 100% about torpor maybe being useful now, lol - who would have thought? Unless they upped the mana on that also.<br />

I can, question is can the cleric or druid in my group stand my hp being less than 95% for that long ;p<br />
<br />
My dilema now is: Do I mem BoT or Q?  Or Both?  I'd feel like a cleric if I had to mem both.  I might actually have to heal ppl! omg!  Plus, it'd be such a waste of a spell slot.  I could mem more important stuff like 8 sec nukes or dots when mobs can last for more than 10 sec.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">BoT will be a perfectly fine heal when combining with a Canni 5 and the new Canni. Should have you healed up from the Canni V and the 2 clicks of OOW Canni in before it runs out.<br />
I think Shamu's point is that the 420 mana for BoT makes Cannibilization FAR less economical. After all, you are using it to get mana back, not to get mana back, then use 70% of that mana to heal the hps loss from the Canni.<br />
<br />
What we need now is an AA that is self-only that will give us 300/tic for  6 tics. Of course, this would make ALL the mana from Cannibilization usable for spells now, LOL. <br />
<br />
Wait, I know LIFETAPS! heh</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I can't imagine why there isn't a way to stop casting on a mount (other than to /dismount; /duck).  It's like saying you can only wriggle your toes when you're standing up, but not on a mount.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Krohgre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Its not that the Q and BoT upgrades are too good for Canni5, its that Canni5 is showing its age.<br />
<br />
HP mudflation along with FT and Mana Regen abundance in PoP and now GoD has really marginalized Canni5.<br />
<br />
It was a massive AA when it was created.  Possibly overpowering at the time.<br />
<br />
Now its just old.  Get 7-8k in mana and its not even a bubble back.  Still great to use, just not anywhere what it was.<br />
<br />
If the AA was adjusted to increase or scale in OoW to maybe 2x what it is now or recast delay to half what it was now, then the Q and BoT would be right on track with it.<br />
<br />
Id certainly rather see expansion of Canni5 than spells that I have to click, can fizzle and take a spell slot.  I wont even mention how the AA is available to everyone and the spell, well at best a fraction of us will see it.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt hold my breath though.<br />
<br />
Great to see the HoT and regen changes though.  Hope its not SoE's answer to our &quot;healing problem&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">right now the lvl 68 oow canni is listed the same as the ancient canni.  If it stays that way, yes, then BoT will  be great again for mana regen.<br />
can5 + 4xcan6 = 4000dmg +2500mana - 420 mana + 7x630 heal = 2100 mana and healed in about 6 ticks. Leaving you 24 ticks to use that mana before repeat.<br />
Now all we need is that spell avaiable to the masses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I dunno, makes me wonder though what kinda regen we get from it if we hit can5, then BoT ourselves then hit the can4 macro a few times.<br />
<br />
Anyone that enjoys math wanna figure the numbers of<br />
<br />
Can5 + BoT + Can4 every 6 seconds ?<br />
Cannibalization: Decrease Hitpoints by 1924, Increase Mana by 1066 <br />
Cannibalize IV: Decrease Hitpoints by 148, Increase Mana by 82 cast 2.25, recast 3<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar 630 per tick, 4 ticks, 420 mana = 2520 healed<br />
<br />
So at just a glance, casting BoT right after Can5 you cannot &quot;spend&quot; enough hps at the 4 ticks that you will not &quot;overheal&quot;.<br />
<br />
Only choice is to Can5, then Can4 several times (2-4) before casting BoT and then Can4 at least 4 more times.<br />
<br />
So with 6 ticks to achieve this we're spending 6*148+1924 hps =2812 hps and 420 mana, and gaining 6*82+1066 = 1558 mana and 2520 hps, net loss over 6 ticks is 308 hps, easily accounted for with natural regen (for us trolls ;) ) and net gain in mana is 1138.<br />
<br />
I am not even touching the calculations when figuring in buff extensions, natural regen, flowing thought items etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone that enjoys math wanna figure the numbers of<br />
<br />
Can5 + BoT + Can4 every 6 seconds ?<br />
<br />
Net gains assuming 6ticks on Bot<br />
0 Can IV - 1856hp 646mana<br />
1 Can IV - 1708hp 728mana<br />
2 Can IV - 1560hp 810mana<br />
3 Can IV - 1412hp 892mana<br />
4 Can IV - 1264hp 974mana<br />
5 Can IV - 1116hp 1056mana<br />
6 Can IV - 968hp   1138mana<br />
<br />
If you use Q rather then BoT<br />
0 Can IV - 596hp	786mana<br />
1 Can IV - 448hp	868mana<br />
2 Can IV - 300hp	950mana<br />
3 Can IV - 152hp	1032mana<br />
4 Can IV - 4hp	1114mana<br />
5 Can IV - -144hp	1196mana<br />
6 Can IV - -292hp	1278mana<br />
<br />
If you keep regen up your net hp loss over 6 casts is only 52hp easily made up by normal regen. So using Q over BoT would give you a 250mana gain and leave you at the same place you started assuming you had fumm hp to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I used to do this when I first got Trushar, but it just got in the way.  Imagine having to canni *more* than you normally have to? I would hit Canni5, then canni4 till Trushar faded. Whatever the numbers turned out to be, it just wasn't worth the time.<br />

Thats because you have the option of replacing intelligent/efficient gameplay with a laissez-faire attitude because it doesnt really matter for you. I promise you that I am not at 80 % after hitting Canni 5.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I will always tend to focus my talks on the high end.  I cant really speak about the casual effects.  I am by no means trying to put anyone down by that statement.  But one thing is true, even though I might be 7-8k now, the casual person is about an expansion or two behind.  So they will be there soon enough.  So sooner or later, it will be a problem for all.  Just the way mudflation and game mechanics works.<br />
<br />
I liked the previous posters idea of Canni5 being a %.  It would scale well.  Could even make it an increasing AA type upgrade.  Sure high end people get more now, but as you grow, so does Canni5.  What I am not in favor at all of seeing is upgrades to canni via spells that are rare.  That is more limiting than any AAxp path.  Not to mention the use of a spell gem.<br />

Come on now.  We are listening but listening to you does not mean you will get everything you ask for. <br />
<br />
The ability to sit on a horse, while regenerating mana at sit speed and still be able to cast spells was never intended.  However as many of you bought mounts for just that reason, we have no plans to change it.  This does not mean that we are going to make it easier for you to just sit there on your mount like a mana battery though.  Mounts were intended to be a status symbol, hence the cost, and a travel augment.  Not a spell casting platform.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Interesting tidbit on a change to our non ancient Omens Canni:<br />
<br />
Changed 'Cast on you' message from &quot;You recall the pain and knowledge of your ancestors.&quot; to &quot;Ancestral spirits tear through your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the new message sucks.  I liked the old one a LOT better.<br />
<br />
And Giac, did you ACTUALLY propose disabling meditate on a horse?  They already stealth removed the leaping of my Drogmor, and if they removed my mana regen, i would REALLY want them to refund my 100k. <br />
<br />
Mana regen through cannibalize is a LOT better without having to dance, and I STILL dance in all indoor zones (including every LDoN)<br />
<br />
Putting mana regen instead of health regen on protection of the glades (Kunark, Druids' first mana regen spell, group hp buff and 6/tick mana regen) was a mistake that was chosen to be left as is, and was even improved upon later with Pot9.  I am absolutely sure of this because my good buddy sent a /feedback on it years ago when he found that the hp regen of skin like nature and nature skin went from 2, to 4, but then 0 on potg, and it was answered in one of the old eqstratics line reply dev posts that it was originally unintentional.<br />

How does an ancient ancestor &quot;tearing through&quot; my body gain me any mana?  I loved the old one because it not only sounds applicable and also, they don't NAME them cannibalize anymore, so we're not necessarily eating ourselves with this spell... sounds more like we're using the spirits, which makes sense (barring the fact that CANNI V is named Cannibalization, of course :)   )<br />
<br />
Also, if shaman get some nice improvements in omens, we could cast the old emote and recall the pain and knowledge of our GoD era, crucible posting ancestors! :)  In fact, I have a conspiracy theory that this is in fact why they changed it in the first place!  It fit just TOO well with the current situation.<br />

And for the record, I do NOT want spells to be interruptable on a mount.  At this point, that is the ONLY benefit to not being mounted.  Why should people on a mount get everything they get off and more?  Sure, there's the acceleration thing... but if you REALLY need to interrupt a spell you are casting in an emergency, you can simply dismount.  Yes, it's an inconvenience, but we've removed way too many inconveniences already, and I don't believe yelling about devs not listening, RIGHT AFTER we got upgrades to our regen and HoT's, is a good idea.  Let's at least thank them for looking at us, even if it is only a start... Brenlo has told us that it will be a slow steady process, so, even if people hate me for it, I'm all for giving him a little slack. <br />
<br />
If you're gonna get mad at someone in SoE, I wouldn't make it Brenlo.  He has to listen to ALL the classes, including those 2 percent of enchanters who whine about not bringing enough to a group and ask for additional spell lines (True Story, sorry that I don't have a link atm).<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I've just looked back through the spells, and it seems level 70 ancient canni still has the recall ancestors line.  So, if I'm able to slay 100 gods and combine their reagents and hand it in to trigger a boss mob and kill him with a raid force and pray he drops the SHAMAN ancient spell, I'll be able to see the emote line I like! (Just a guess on how they will be attained, itll prolly be harder than that...)</div></div><hr />

  I dont think anyone has realized yet that you have actually posted 3 times on this thread.  This means to me that you are looking at the feedback from the changes you made.  THANK YOU!!!!  It means you are paying attention to the customer base.<br />
<br />
 The changes are a very nice step in the right direction.  Something that has been missing from the shaman class in a long time.  I hope you see, from the majority of those posting, that we really do appreciate the effort you and the dev team are making.<br />
<br />
  Again thank you for listening and taking some steps in the right direction (at least from this shaman).<br />

I agree wholeheartedly.  Don't let a response on NOT upgrading something on, for example, horses, that have helped us more than intended from day one, stop you from realizing that many of us here truly, truly appreciate you looking into our issues.</div></div><hr />

/stopcast *** is this ****? 99.999999999999% of the people playing this game dont know how to activate a macro while casting spells, they are unaware you can intterupt a macro in progress and soe puts this retarded comand in game? <br />
hint remap your duck comand to another key <br />
<br />
Spell drops in God are now Pop style, a friend said this was a good idea, I pointed out that its not really a good idea since the kunark style spell drops that were in god were proven to be retarded back in KUNARK and that fixing them now is hardly a &quot;good&quot; idea, more like somone down there managed to put down the crack pipe for longer than it took to type in the code.<br />
<br />
new way into poh...Doesnt Inny have ANY say over who comes to his zone? you would think he would have killed that cleric vendor in neriak years ago once he found out the guy was selling to any and every tunare worshipping ranger who could sneak behind for the secret hand shake...still a needed change thanks to epic 2.0<br />
<br />
/guidehelp,   real bright move here guys, instead of making the /petition comand clear and easy to use and incorperating this into it you make it a separate comand...stupid people play your game, stop making things more complex when you should be SIMPLIFYING THINGS. if theres one thing SoE has never heard of its the K.I.S.S. principle.<br />

<br />
If 2K hps total then Lose 80%  (1600 Hps eaten) leaviing you at 200 hps and gaining 800 mana. But if at 8K hps lose 80 %  hps (6400 hps)and gain 3200 mana. <br />
<br />
Ahh well.<br />

change that to 70% and you are dead on, 80% means you would die every time there was an agro mob that could get its hands on you. beatutiful concept though. this would be a super nice change for CanV</div></div><hr />

I don't mind cannidancing when 5 is down, but at least make it worth the clicking IMO.<br />
<br />
On the down side, these changes enhance our soloing more than groups/raids.  In the end, it still doesn't make an impact on getting groups or stacking in raids.  And to me, that is what is wrong with our class right now.  But I will keep an open mind, because at least it isn't a nerf :)<br />

Seriously, I can't imagine why there isn't a way to stop casting on a mount (other than to /dismount; /duck).  It's like saying you can only wriggle your toes when you're standing up, but not on a mount.<br />

Its actually interesting thinking back to the summit meeting that we were both at and the conversations that were there. They've worked on a number of the items that came up at the small group session we were at with this patch.

This was covered a few weeks ago.  You went LD for whatever reason, went to server select screen, which is where you then got booted for inactivity.  It had nothing to do with the bazaar.<br />

1) HT and LoH are hotkeys and have long re-use time<br />
2) For spells u can interupt them.. u cant interupt hotkeys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">2) For spells u can interupt them.. u cant interupt hotkeys<br />
Sure you can, I interupt VP and Spirit Call all the time. Didnt you ever see that message &quot;Ability re-set&quot; or something?<br />
<br />
However, LoH and HT are INSTA-cast hot keys. They have no casttime whatsoever, therefore, are uninteruptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">thats what i was going to :P i didnt mean spells in it i meant like HT and LoH types</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">bleh blowing mana on a corpse while not up there with blowing ht/loh is still one of those annoying things that happens in eq with no real effect in game other than to irritate players, the fact that spells still attempt to go off on a dead mobs corpse indicate deliberate code to make it work like that, try casting on a player who zones out mid cast, you dont lose any mana for that.</div></div><hr />
