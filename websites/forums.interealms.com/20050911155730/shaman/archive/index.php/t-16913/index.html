<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pre 55 i found solo was un-comparible in exp. Now i am lvl 57 and solo has slowed down alot. in 56 it took 3-4 kills for 1% in katta, while not bad not great. <br />
<br />
So i decided to start grouping for a break. Get a LDoN group lvl range like 61-54 and let me tell you... the exp is great. Depending on full composition of the group i can make from 10% to 20% in a single LDoN event.<br />
<br />
Also been doing PoS with a few guilds ... 1% ever kill or 2 ... WHOA!<br />
<br />
Am i smoking crack to think Solo can't compare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoN seems to be unbeatable exp at any level I've tried it so far (except for the swarm kiting bard, that still wins solo).  That coupled with the grouping exp bonus changes they put in a couple (few?) months back, and I'd say that soloing is absolutely not an efficient way to get exp anymore.  Not for a shaman.  Mileage may vary by level, but I'm going to guess that this is the case from 50 on up, at the very least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vladislav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When was the last time you heard that solo was worth it? nowadays solo is only for the people who don't want to LFG or who are anti-social for whichever reason. PoP groups (or revamped old world zones) will always give you more exp than solo. Do PoV and you will never solo again if you can easily get groups.<br />
I suggest you go solo stuff while having LFG on and if some seemingly good group in a good spot comes along join them you will get more exp and will have a lot more fun doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for confirming guys.<br />
<br />
i have been enjoying the groups lately. stop thinking i am going crazy from sitting in katta by myself for a few hours aday. PoV, PoS, LDoN are all my new homes. hell most times loot is even better!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still solo, mostly for fun. When I want serious XP, I group. Even before the changes to group XP, grouping was better (with a good group). Yeah, you can solo those mobs, but a group can chain pull.<br />
<br />
I can solo tactics and get MAYBE 10-12 mobs an hour. With a group, it's more like 30-40 mobs an hour.<br />
<br />
Solo because you can...solo for the experience. Solo just for spite! But if you want an XP grind...group group group!<br />
<br />
And LDoN is like 80-85% AA xp for one adventure. And you can get that last 20% if you can talk your group into staying and slaughtering everything else in the last 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not worth it except when bored to lose too much /random, it's a good reason to enjoy solo  :D</div></div><hr />

If you can get in a pickup quickly somewhere that is in the groove already absolutely.<br />
<br />
But sometimes with all the setup time that a LDoN group can sometimes take, or possibly later on at night when groups thin out it can take a while to get things going in a decent group and keep them going. For that reason being able to hit the grind fast and keep moving with a decent solo spot can sometimes net better results when a good pickup just isnt happening.<br />
<br />
Of course I can see this changing at level 58 and above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At lvl 56 I can still get better exp. soloing for the most part. I imagine that will change in a few lvls though. So far compared with a LDoN grp from setup to loot split I can get about twice as much exp and loot soloing in the same amount of time. But if you always grp with the same people and have it down then I guess the setup and loot time would be virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
I guess the ideal thing is to be soloing and lfg at the same time in the Market channel or something. Stay soloing until grp is ready to meet at a camp then grp up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'm soloing in Skyfire at level 53, at 52 I was getting 1% per kill there (and its EASY) at 53 I'm getting 1% per every 2 kills.  So its not bad and the loot is fairly good.  35+ hours and still no Spirit of the Howler, but I've gotten approximately 15 other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I liked dulak back in the day...and JPF before that for 55 and lesser.  If i was going to recommend anything now..definitely LDON if you have it.  Even in the 60s its good exp really, although PoP tier3 zones are better.  I still consider 2-3 blues of reg exp at 65 per adventure pretty good, and i believe thats roughly 1/3 an aa point..maybe more.  I assume this all translates down and should be similar or better exp at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Dunno if its my level or class or both..but LFG for 5minutes usually nets me a group somewhere, and groups are usually less boring than solo.  I find bad groups the best kind of group..something to laugh with friends about later :)  Such as that cleric that Cheals at 85%.  Or druid that heals under the cleric instead of nuking--then says OOM and sits and gets beat on. fun~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've found LDoN exp pretty poor for my L 58 shaman. Typically, on full regular exp, I get anywhere from 5% - 10% of a level from an adventure. I don't think I've gotten more than 10% from any adventure in L 57 or 58. And that's typically a good two hours work, from the time I go LFG to the time we're done, since the lower level groups move slower than skilled L 65 groups. <br />
<br />
I can get 1% a kill in PoN solo, and kill a mob every 5 minutes or less (with KEI). That's FAR more exp than LDoN - well over 10% an hour. I can get similar exp, or better, if there's no setup/thumbtwiddling time, in a PoV group. <br />
<br />
All in all, I find LDoN exp very bad. But perhaps that's because I haven't generally been fortunate enough to find pickup groups with lots of higher level DPS classes. Since my shaman's my alt and thus lacks regular compatriots, I have to take the groups I can find. At least I've learned to keep solo'ing until the group is largely formed. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess I just don't care for soloing much even if I can do it...and I love LDoN!<br />
<br />
LDoN gives good, consistent xp - and it's usually easily accomplished with all kinds of groups providing you have a good plan and everybody does their part.<br />
<br />
With LDoN you also almost always get a decent split, chances for augs to drop, chances for items to drop from named, and adventure points to spend on spells, augs, and items (some of which aren't bad) - in addition to the steady xp.<br />
<br />
I rarely have to wait a long time for an LDoN group to form up...heck, I'll help recruit if I have to...and unless it's off hours or super bad luck strikes I usually get LDoN group offers fairly quickly when flagged.  If I flag myself /lfg specifically LDoN and head to EC/BB/NRo I usually have a group within 5-15 minutes.  Sometimes I'll get offers even when I'm not flagged!  I dunno if it's lack of shaman my level on Xev or just great luck.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
I think I'm in a sweet spot right now though...many folks in the high 40's to mid 50's seem to be doing LDoN.  It could slow down in a few levels if a lot of these folks opt for planes over LDoN...but then I see a lot of the same faces in the LDoN crowd in my level range and we all seem to love LDoN so it could be good for a long time.<br />

There are many nice people here. Don't be rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 55 and now 56, I find the combination of exp and plat great for LDoN adventures.  I get on average about 10-12% exp and 150pp per adventure.  Granted, I hate the /lfg and set up time, as it generally takes about 30-45 mins from log on to entry of LDoN zone, but that still is a decent trade off to me.  I'm not a rich toon, so 150pp is good for me, especially since I am working my tradeskills for shawl quest and some other things.  So I need the money.<br />
<br />
And there are times when I just want to immerse myself in the game and not deal with anyone else, so that is when I solo.  But, I really haven't done any exp soloing since I started back into the game.  I usually do Velk's and CC for the silks on AA exp when I do solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yea, solo at upper lvls just gets tougher and tougher, expecially when mobs hit so dang hard. I 2 box now with a monk, so that helps quite a bit. Before that, I would only solo for money, since you roll on all items and get all items. :) For exp grouping is a must. Even if it isn't as good exp sometimes, it is alot safer, rezzes are easier to get and almost all the time free. I always get bad luck with groups, the tank who goes afk every 5 minutes, the ldon group that &quot;isn't quite formed&quot; Or insist on having &quot;a balanced group&quot;. I always solo, with my lfg flag up, and wait for a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, there are many nice people here who post where to hunt efficantly... Why should they have to say what they already said a second time... It is like saying.. Hey u took all this effort to help me the first time... but I am too lazy... can u post it again... and again... and again<br />
<br />
Back to the subject. Been 65 for awhile now and this is what i have come to. If u want really good exp. you have to group. No ifs ands or butts. u can't compare to exp outside of the planes. AA exp still moves pretty nicely in Droga and places like it but not nearly as nice as BoT or HoH or PoV or PoS.<br />
<br />
If you want cash, soloing is the way to go. Sure u could get a drop in BoT worth 10k+ but odds are u won't. u will leave almost as empty handed as u came. In i dunno how many hours in BoT i have only gotten 2 Ornate armor pieces (leather boots and plate bracer... have yet to see any chain drop)... Though it did buy me Seventh.<br />
<br />
At 57-58 start to seek out PoI or Teir 2 planes groups for exp. You'll love it. Slowing can be iffy until 60 in Teir 2 planes tho. Once u hit 62 ur golden. T3 planes provide insane exp. but Note in BoT, i have never slow reliably without malo. Malo is ur best friend. and with it only adding 1 point of agro. why not use it!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Since I 2box (eqw) a paladin/shaman combo I don't technically &quot;solo&quot;.  With this combo, I have just about everything covered including rezs.  About the only complaint I have with this pair is the DPS is a little low.<br />
<br />
At level 59, I don't find soloing to be a waste of time.  I can get started faster, I can use the cash loots and I pull in a decent exp rate by myself... but groups do get exp faster.  I've settled on a solution that is a hybrid of the two.<br />
<br />
I generally try to pick a spot to solo that could also support a group.  Anytime someone in my guild asks for a spot to go, I volunteer where I'm at.<br />
<br />
When I finish grinding to 60, I may modify this approach by luring in a few guild mates to the exp group, and then drag them off to an ldon mission :)<br />

While technically not solo there is no comparision to the Exp I get. I get 1% exp per mob and I can kill non stop in the reaver area in CoM. As a bonus in about 2hrs I get around 400pp.</div></div><hr />
