Anyway, a guy in there wears 3 different EQ t-shirts and makes several refferences to the game.  In addition at his house he has a bunch of EQ posters.  I wonder how much they paid for that advertising.<br />
<br />
As for the movie, it had some funny parts but was kind of to long.</div></div><hr />

I remember some time ago that there when I went to see a movie and in the trailers advertising for a future movie that there was a large fat kid who wore two EQ shirts that looked like the original/kunark expansions art work with Fiona Vie on the front.  I couldn't stop laughing when I was that.</div></div><hr />
