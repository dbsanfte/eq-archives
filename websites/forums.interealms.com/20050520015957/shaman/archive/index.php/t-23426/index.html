Anyways, was browsing the Necro forums and saw this link. Goodbye video. One of the best EQ vids I've ever seen. For some reason, with all the change in EQ, and the problems (I perceive) right now, and my own thoughts of leaving someday (EQ2, Life, what'have'you'), the video really hit home.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">... any animals in zone surround the player and attempt to mount him.<br />
... used to happen any time I'd DoT or slow ... /curses lack of innovation with SoE devs and gets flamed by posters with stories of being wanted in BoT groups.</div></div><hr />
