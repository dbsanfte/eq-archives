<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well Litgruv is officaly retied as of today. I accidently ( or was it ) deleted the Sony folder when i was clearing space and frankly i cant see why i should re-install it. It has been nothing but a source of negitivity for a long time now and finaly its time to lay it to rest and move on. All things move in cycles and EQ's time is up IMHO. Time to move on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will be playing UT2k4 for a while i think, the demo is great and once i get truck out of the way, i think i might play CoH, not sure yet though, depends if they plan on making the game a tad deeper.<br />
<br />
So fare thee well Litgruv and im sorry Drogalog we never got that level 55 skelly illusion spell you wanted.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone on the crucilble that has given of themselves to help this place help others and i hope i gave something useful at times even if it wasnt technical break downs of HPS and DPS with mathmatical equations. Im sure im ill still be hanging around here for quite some time yet, so dont bother to get excited about me leaving  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess its time to join the elders outside this world known as norrath, to move out past the stars and into a new world where new life can form and grow.<br />

<br />
Just as an example of how much better the coders at Cryptic are vs the brain-damaged drunken imbecile monkeys at SOE are, guess which of the following takes place faster:<br />
<br />
1) Turn on computer from cold start, dial up (on 56k) to the internet, launch City of Heroes, go through the patcher, load game, enter game, and start kicking villian butt.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) Clicking the EQ icon with computer running and internet connection established, and waiting for the patcher to finish (with no patch to download) so you can get to the EULA page.<br />
<br />
If you answered #2, you'd be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesnt mean I am not gonna pick up a copy of COH though, although it will probably end up next to the copies of DAoC, and SWG, and AO, and all the other &quot;EQ Killers&quot; we have seen through the years.</div></div><hr />

I still don't understand how you can see if people gave you bad rep bumps and on what topics. Congrats on finally finishing the game Litgruv.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you click on the link for the bad or good rep, it shows you what they comment on. The onyl way to know who did it is to track the times the rep bump was made and use logic to figure out who it was or just just leave your name when you think a rep bump up or down is deserved. But it takes balls to leave your name, something that is lacking for some people around here i guess. ;)</div></div><hr />
