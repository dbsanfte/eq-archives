<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aelerix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
    Glad to be onboard.. hope the site stays open...:) <br />
<br />
<br />
    Anyway, I was wondering if anyone could help me with learning about how to take down Inny (or point me to an up to date Strategy Site) :)....<br />
<br />
    I have found a few sites and read a few posts here but alot of the information seems to be old and outdated....<br />
<br />
   My guild is fairly small and I am getting tired of killing mini after mini to try and get my epic :(  and was hoping to take down Inny... Unfortunatly, everyone in the guild has different opinions on how hard he is and are reluctant to try...<br />
  <br />
    Some say has a DT some say he doesnt.<br />
<br />
     Some say he has a strong grav flux with a large dispell. But some say Levitation can reduce the effect of the grav flux...<br />
<br />
     Some say he has 40khps some say 400khps...<br />
<br />
<br />
    Our guild has a couple of 60 clerics, a 60 Wizard, a 60 Ranger, several 58/59 Tanks and a bunch of 55+'s (shammy included)... we can easily fill out 3 full groups of 55+ and with help from friends we could have 4 or 5.   <br />
<br />
    I'm not looking for anyone to give away any &quot;guild&quot; secrets.. but to just point a poor ranger (I'm the only ranger in the guild :) ) in the right direction... I would like not to have to Clear all of Hate and then be creamed by Inny  :(.... Also, if anyone know the best route to get to him without clearing the entire zone.. that would be appreciated..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I led our guilds first Inny killing back when I was dragging them up to hate every few days in search of my emerald so...I suppose I qualify :)<br />
<br />
First there are two keys to killing Inny. One Slow him and keep him that way. Debuff the crap out of him and then get him slowed. 2nd keep him positioned away from the walls and towards the side of his room where his room is. Otherwise things heal through wall and he just won't die.<br />
<br />
He doesn't DT. he has a Gflux aoe that strips buffs. It's annoying as heck. But you get used to it. He has I'm guessing 150kish of hitpoints. It sometimes seems like more however because he'll get a random heal or the gfluxes really reduces melee damage.<br />
<br />
I used to camp a cleric out when I first tried him. Respawns take awhile on the 2nd floor so it's pretty safe. Although Inny takes forever to reset if you fail. [ok it seems like forever]<br />
<br />
I've seen him done with 18 folks. We typically have 30-40. Everyone likes to kill him :)<br />
<br />
As far as getting to him goes. Get to the 2nd floor and clear out as you move along west to the wall, then follow the wall up and around as you clear stuff until you reach his &quot;house&quot; then clear up the ramp and setup in the hallway outside his room/hall area. That is probably the safest bet. It typically takes a 4-6 hours to clear to him unless you have done it alot.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Most of his loot isn't that great these days, but it's still killing a god so i always enjoy it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aelerix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tae,<br />
   Thanks for the information :) :).  Looks like I need to bring in a few friends to help out if I want to go for Inny but I think we should be okay... Last night we cleared a path to his door step pretty easily :) with just 2 groups .... (too bad he was not up).. hehe.<br />
<br />
  If possible is there anyway anyone can give me a list of which Mini's can drop the Emerald.  <br />
<br />
  I keep insisting to the guild that any mini can drop the item but many insist not all can...<br />
<br />
   The biggest one in question is the MAESTRO of Rancor (many insist he is not a mini :( )<br />
<br />
    The list I have is:<br />
            Ashenbone Broodmother<br />
            Avatar of Abhorrance<br />
            Grandmaster Rital<br />
            Lord of Ire<br />
            Lord of Loating<br />
            Master of Spite <br />
            Mistress of Scorn<br />
            Magi P'Tasa<br />
           <br />
<br />
       There is also the Corruptor of Life, but I am pretty sure he is not a mini :).. since he is 60.. hehe<br />
<br />
        If I am missing any or if some of the above don't drop the stone I would appreciate that info..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aandaas Verdemu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maestro can and does drop the stone, more often than the others in fact, or at least from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bring a 60 shaman, preferably a 57+ enc, and ideally a 55+ bard. All together, these three can get inny's mr to drop through the floor and make him very easy to slow, cripple, etc<br />
<br />
From there, yeah, just work out positioning to compensate for the grav flux and stuff. He takes awhile to die, but once debuffed a ton he has very little damage output.<br />
<br />
note, a lot of heals that you might see inny getting are from necros or SKs.. these are pretty meaningless. They do add up over time, but it's nothing to fret about. If you see him being chealed though, time to move him lots ;)<br />
<br />
Aim for stability. Once you get that down, a debuffed Inny should fall without much effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been a while since I've done an Inny fight so I don't recall the fight too clearly, but I did find an old e-mail I sent someone in another guild explaining what we did to kill him.  Maybe this will give you some ideas.  Innoruuk is a lot easier than you'd think he'd be, if you got a sound strategy.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello there!  Gonna outline a brief plan for how we figured out how to fight Inny.  We did this with 29 people, but probably would have gotten<br />
away with 24 since we've been raiding together as Unleashed since February now, so we've had some time to get used to everyone else's quirks.<br />
<br />
Okay, first of all, Inny is a wizzy.  He'll g-flux the raid like mad. That's part of what makes this fight so much fun!  Second is that he also debuffs like mad.  EVERYONE-- and I mean EVERYONE-- will be stripped by the time he's dead.  If you want to be buffed for as long as possible, hit point-wise, bury Aego in slot number 15. Not that this will do you much good after the first minute or two of the fight, especially if you're the main tank.  Inny also has a one-target knockback spell that I believe also debuffs.  So not only can you be knocked up and down, you can also be knocked back and forth and side to side.  Bring the motion<br />
sickness pills if you're susceptible...<br />
<br />
Second of all, be prepared for a long fight.  It took us 11 minutes to kill him.  One of the chanters and shamans' main tasks was to respeed<br />
the melees periodically to keep up the damage production.  We also had a magician on hand that we kept busy non-stop summoning mod rods [Note: As of Wednesday this part of the tactic no longer works];  he only paid attention to the fight long enough to sic his pet on Inny.  I'm told FU uses a CH rotation on Inny, but we got away without one.  You can also perform battle rezzes during the fight quite easily because of this-- we did this for the lead-chanter so she could re-debuff Inny<br />
again before taking another dirt nap.  Inny hits for a maximum of 400 or so on a level 60 warrior, and I'm not sure if he quads or not.  I don't<br />
think so, because our main tank was mocking Inny for being a wuss in shouts, so it was obvious he wasn't really worried after we got him<br />
slowed.  But don't quote me on that. [Additional note: a decently-equipped level 60 SK works great for a tank, too!]<br />
<br />
Third:  Yep, Inny can be slowed.  I'm not exactly sure what debuffs were needed to make those slows stick (if any at all), because we played it better safe than sorry and had a level 60 shaman and level 60 enchanter do their worst, but slows stick to him like newbie beggars at the bank.  Heck, even my Earthcall proc stuck to him for a while before it got overwritten!  Also, guild leader was periodically reminding shamans, druids, and necromancers to re-dot him, so I assume those spells stuck on him.  Sorry, I don't know what resists he's weak on, as I was too busy paying attention to Inny to notice what the wizards were casting.<br />
<br />
Fourth:  Setting up the fight.  Once you're on the second floor, you can pretty much invis up and sneak past a lot of the mobs on that floor until you're on the zone wall closest to the entrance of Inny's house. Inny's on the second floor of his house, and because of g-flux and that knockback spell, it's best to fight him in an enclosed space.  Park the raid party on that zone wall and send in a FD puller to clear the first and second floor mobs in Inny's house, leaving ONLY Innoruuk alive in the house.  Once everything else is dead (and if Inny is still set in his spawn point-- if not, give him some time to reset), move the entire<br />
raid party into the house and up the stairs to the second floor.  We parked the raid in the corner room before the hall that leads to Inny's room.<br />

M is the main tank.  We had him park in the corner and pin Inny's left shoulder to the wall marked 1.  We tried to keep Inny facing the wall marked 2 at all times, since we discovered that the single-target knockback spell he has knocks you back from the direction Innoruuk (not you) is facing.  If we couldn't keep Inny facing wall 2, then we did our best to make sure he was facing ANY direction but the entrance marked 3, so we could keep him in the room and on the main tank.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />
