<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I finally bought Talisman of the Cat for 50pp. It took a week of browsing the bazaar on a daily basis because on Karana most peeps are trying to sell it for 1500+pp if you can believe that crap. It's not like it's rare, I'd see at least 4 copies of it and Brute being sold. Brute sells for 50-200pp and is far more useful than Cat. <br />
<br />
Any other servers have the same pricing problems? I'm just glad somebody wised up and sold it for 50pp, because that's all it's worth to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lucky you....been looking for it for weeks for sale and have yet to find it at any price. Personally wouldn't pay more than 150 for it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Karana, as some have previously posted, has some of the most wacked prices you'll see.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
lvl 64 shm spell Talisman of Diaku........... 30kpp What a deal!!!!<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I didn't check, but I even think it was a shaman trying to sell it, what the hell was he thinking!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">some fool has been trying to sell talisman of the raptor for 35k in the bazaar....<br />
<br />
price recently dropped to 15k...<br />
<br />
rotfl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think people believe one of two things about shaman spells:<br />
<br />
1.  Torpor and Malo are rare and extremely valuable, therefore all shaman spells are rare and extremely valuable.<br />
<br />
2.  Some Shaman will overpay for Torpor and Malo, therefore all Shaman will overpay for all their spells.  <br />
<br />
I, for one, refuse to pay 5k for Greater Bear Form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Replenishment is 215pp or so from Mystic Abomin?  I see people on my server trying to sell it for 1k-2k.  Even low level spells that normally cost 10-20pp for hundreds of plat.<br />
But, like the man said, &quot;There's a sucker born every minute&quot;. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've seen Malosini in the Bazaar regularly 2-5k.  Once it was up to 10k.  <br />
<br />
See, it drops from juggs, and shaman can use it, so it must be super valuable!  Oh wait, it's vendor sold for what, 10pp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">here are some of the dandies on Ay Ro the last 2 months ive seen<br />
raptor: 1 for 25k 1 for 24k<br />
great bear: 20k<br />
khuras 40k<br />
focus of spirit: 20k<br />
<br />
now khuras is about 5k bear about 1k and focus 1k hell focus of soul is about 2k on our server. people see shaman lvl 55+ and think they can get insane money. oh yeah lvl 59 cha spell (vendor) 19k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I ended up getting Talisman of the Cat for about 30.  I had to watch the Bazaar for close to two weeks before I found it for that though.  Everyone tries to sell it for 500+.<br />
<br />
I made a bit of pocket change buying a few copies of Malosini from FV and selling them in the Bazaar.  Nothing like the 500-700 though; I sell them for about 150-200.  I guess people see the ones for 500 and 700 and think, &quot;oh wow, 200, what a deal.&quot;  I doubt any shamans bought the spells.  Most of them probably know that you can buy it in FV for cheap.  In any event, I only keep one copy at a time.  I figure if it doesn't sell, I can just scribe it in a day or two when I make 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still cant get over the person determined to sell Shrink for 5000pp on AB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">some people have no idea what spells should be priced at, and my server is just like yours. I bought my Talisman of the Brute at level 50 ahead of time for I think 40 platinum, while I've seen other Talismans (not daiku and over 60+ ones) attempting to be sold at ridiculously high prices in the thousands or even tens of thousands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Things used to piss me off pretty badly in this game, but this is the new high...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Duurg has it right, you see some wacked out prices on Karana...guy was trying to sell Malo a few weeks ago for 120k and was firm on the price.<br />
Other times you will see Avatar for 25k and I personally saw Tali of the Cat for 5k /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Talisman of the Cat and Brute usually sell for around 250-1k all the time on Brell.  heheh.. raptor.. usually someone trying to get 15k for it.. ;p.  Malo.. one copy for sale at 100k and haven't seen torpor in close to 2 or 3 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">on saryrn, ive seen talisman of the cat usually for 3-5k, theres no way im gonna spend that much for agi.. luckily 2 days ago i was farming juggs with a guildie group and it dropped for me :D  was hoping for tirgirs to drop too but wasnt that lucky, tirgirs has been going for 8-10k on my server.   i did pick up a undead dragon sinew off the juggs, so time to hit droga :) <br />
<br />
oh and the only malo i seen on my server for the last 2 months was 80k, about 4ppl constnatly auctioning to buy torpor but nobody has had it for sale for as long as i can remember :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see some idiots sell Malosini for 30k. Yes, that's right, the vendor sold spell which doesn't cost anything. But these shmucks try to rob shaman on every step. I see on Bazaar Khura's Mending on sale soem 10k. Ha! It's on sale in NEXT ZONE for 5+pp. Again, some idiot's try to rob the shaman.<br />
<br />
The problem with the prices is - shamans themselves created it. If no one would buy Malo and Torpor for such crazy prices, the damn greedy apes couldn't sell it then for this. When you're 60+ already, it means that you have done damn well so far WITHOUT Malo or Torpor. Sure, these spells DO make life easier, but these spells are NOT crucial. Mala sells for 25+pp on Bazaar, drops like rain - well, dang it, make mages work then and cast it. What, did they get the spell only for filling in the blanks in the book?<br />
<br />
Don't pay such crazy prices for the spells, let them be stuck with it. They definately will not suddenly go out and make a shaman char just to use those 2 lvl 60 spells. They'll be just stuck with these and we'll just laugh in their face over the price. In the end, they wont have much anything else to do with it anyway other then put the reasonable price, which would be between 5pp-200pp, I'd say, heh.<br />
<br />
Just ignore those greedy ones, you'll probably have better luck getting Malos and Quiessence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The guy who was selling Diaku for 25k or whatever it was probably got this spell from a shaman friend after he was discusted with what spell he got in return.  <br />
<br />
The friend asked what level was it... The shaman replies 64.  <br />
<br />
The friend sees money signs flash through his head, then asks the shaman what does it do.  Its a group str buff the shaman replies.<br />
<br />
More money signs flash through the friends head... oh oh everybody loves strength.<br />
<br />
Little does the newbie know that it isnt worth 2 beans kinda the same when I won talisman of raptor on a gore raid.  I felt swindled.<br />
