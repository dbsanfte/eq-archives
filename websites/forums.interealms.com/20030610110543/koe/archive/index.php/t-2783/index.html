<br />
I am friend of Canelek's.  I found a humorous movie of Canelek in one of my Everquest screenshots folders.  Watch the movie first and then read the following text :).<br />
Canelek's Movie (http://www.geocities.com/zaythar/Dancing_Cane.swf) <br />
<br />
<br />
In case any of you are not aware, Canelek has a terrible habit of falling asleep at the keyboard.  If he ever says he is tired, tell him to go IMMEDIATELY!<br />
<br />
This movie was made after a night of fighting in Frontier Mountains.  Canelek said he was tired but we convinced him to stay a few more fights.  Well, shortly after this, Canelek stopped fighting and just stood there.  After several minutes of no response, we figured he fell asleep at the keyboard.  We all tried hailing him, trading to him, poking him, anything to maybe force him to go linkdead.  Then we decided to start casting spells on him, hoping the noise would wake him.  Well, it worked, sort of.  He must woke up enough to move his finger onto the arrow key.  Canelek then proceeded to spin in circles for about 20 minutes.  We no longer could fight we were laughing so hard.  We all even lined up next to him and spun in circles along with him.  After finally drying our eyes and composing ourselves, one of our friends logged out and contacted one of his gm friends to have Cane booted.<br />
<br />
I have many more stories of him falling asleep but I figured I embarassed him enough today. ;)</div></div><hr />
