Me + Jbb @ ____ = xp<br />
<br />
Question is, where do I head for some solo xp?<br />
<br />
My defense is sub-par (157 of 200), I'd like to raise it. <br />
<br />
I'm spoiled from xp in HHK, however I've found it less than sufficient as most spawns are light blue, and insanity is approaching from living there a few levels. I'm nervous to try Katta, never been there and it sounds rather difficult. <br />
<br />
Grouping has proved worthless thus far in the game, a blue per several hours vice several blues per hour xp solo makes the choice rather simple. Maybe I've just had bad groups or something but nonstop pulling and lots of work just isn't worth it, I figured the game would encourage grouping w/ a noticeable bonus, as it stands the people who can solo level faster. However many have said the Planes in PoP are nice, I could give that another try. I went to PoN in a 8 person raid / group and was utterly disgusted; several hours of work for like 2%. -  whereas like three kills gave me more in HHK at 54.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, sorry for the ramble / rant.<br />
I &lt;3 Crucible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I went to PoD the other day with some guildies and got about 10% regular XP per hour there.<br />
<br />
Not as good as HHK mind you, but certainly not a blue an hour either. . .<br />

And you get to talk to real people!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Raid exp SUCKS compared to group exp.  VI Doesnt want people putting their alts in their raid groups and getting the same exp as a normal group.    Go to POP in a normal group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I started soloing in katta at 52 when I realized HHK was pretty much perma camped on my server.  It isn't to difficult if you have kei up and get slow off.  I did the shorty spawns behind the bank area.  You start off by rooting one and slowing the other on inc.  Get the other slowed because root doesn't last to long.  Basically you do ghetto cc so you fight one at a time until both are dead.  I stopped going to katta because it got boring, and you get comparable exp if not better in some PoP zones and camps.  Last night a group of friends and I made about 12-14 percent of a level per hour.</div></div><hr />
