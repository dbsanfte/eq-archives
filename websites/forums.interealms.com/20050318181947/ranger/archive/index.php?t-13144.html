I, of course want one as do many rangers on Veeshan...<br />
Therefore, if your guild or group of friends is doing the quest please send me a /tell in game and maybe we can work something out. Main reason is - due to playing time and raiding, the rangers in our guild do not have the ability to hit PoF,PoH, and PoS in order to obtain these neccessary 3 items unless its at a specific time. So if you have access to these planes and your guild does them still, maybe we can work out a deal where we (Sean,Me,Kaleic and Dalinar) can come in, help you kill/clear/etc... and loot the needed item and/or pay for it via plat/items/love letters from Sean etc..<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated on this - Thanks in advance.<br />
Plus - the more help we can get the easier I think it will be for others to get this arrow since it might become routine for a lot of people =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since Dracoliche isnt dropping anything , either the quest isnt a quest just backstory, there is another dracoliche mob in pop somewhere or the quest isnt live yet. <br />
<br />
draco has been killed quite a few times sinec pop went live and he hasnt dropped anything related to this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zouqoa</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be the spawned Dracoliche from the Cazic-Thule quest, if it involved Draoliche at all.</div></div><hr />

We still pop into all 3 old world planes from time to time so it shouldnt be a problem.<br />
<br />
Sylvos...shoot me a tell in game I think we have a Old planes hat trick planned sometime next week.</div></div><hr />
