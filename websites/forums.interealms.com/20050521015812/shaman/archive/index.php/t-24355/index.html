<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, here's the interesting thing (at least to me), the spell ratios:<br />
<br />
Nukes:<br />
<br />
GoD:  925/1550 = ~0.60<br />
OoW: 1272/2132 = ~0.60<br />
<br />
Heals:<br />
<br />
GoD:  1550/2100 = ~0.73<br />
OoW: 1785/2420 = ~0.73<br />
<br />
The ratio doesn't change.. but the raw amount difference does.  Others have posted about the cleric/druid/shm ratio before, and that is well known.  What I think is happening, is since SOE is so completely fixated on maintaining the ratio, they are ignoring the raw number difference.  Like GoD, in OoW, the raw amount we are able to heal or damage is slipping in comparison to Druids.  And in terms of healing, even more so with clerics.<br />
<br />
I'm sure most of you know this quite well, but I hadn't run any numbers for OoW yet, and was just surprised to see us now only 88% of the healers we used to be, and 73% of the nukers we used to be compared to druids back in GoD.<br />
<br />
edit: too sleepy to include our hots or curse dots in the mix to see if we caught up overall.  might be that our fast heal+hot can heal as much as druids, not sure.  I'll look at it tomorrow.  But regardless, when time is tight, nukes rule, when dmg is coming fast, quick heals rule.</div></div><hr />

Theres nothing wrong with my 92 pickup either.  Sure, it could use a tune up, and the paint is peeling, and it doesnt get nearly the milage out  of a tank of gas that it used to, but theres really nothing wrong with it.  I cant haul heavy things with it anymore, but its great for light loads and groceries.<br />
<br />
The class still has some issues that need attention.  I wont pretend that OOW hasnt been a pretty good expansion for shaman on the surface, but the underlying issues havent gone away yet.  Healing parities are one of the larger issues that still needs attention.  Fights sometimes last long enough to get the full effect from Bane, but EQ has moved to a more nuke-centric format of gameplay; our nukes havent kept up.</div></div><hr />

have to agree.  all this talk about straight numerical assessment drops out play style, which makes up a big difference.  we wear heavier armor than druids, have better melee caps than both other healers (200's rather than 100/150's), generally have more raw HP (large race advantage).<br />
<br />
my last shaman, a 64/75aa epic troll shaman, was quite the FIERCE tank mezzer in BoT/CoD/HoH in groups without a dedicated mezzer.  stick a druid in front of a secondary target and watch the cloud of blood appear, lmao.  clerics, being a plate class, can also do this, but you dont want a cleric to be tank mezzing while casting a 8-10 sec CH.  this is one of the reasons my shaman actually went with the LT proc aug on his epic from MM ldon.  it was pretty hilarious having a standing regen of 41 (with replen, regen3, innate, etc.) with the 50hp lifetap to suppliment it.<br />
<br />
yes, point for point, we kind of suck compared to druid/cleric, but i'd not exchange the pure kickass toughness we have for their flimsy/whimpy combat utility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, raw numerical differences are not all that important.  Sure, if you tack on zero's, they look huge, but if the percentages are the same, so is the net effect.  If the percentages are the same, it takes a shaman 2x as many fast heals as a cleric to heal a tank, regardless of the raw differences (everything else equal, including crits).  This is true of damage spells, etc.  A wizard can do probably 3x our damage in a nuke (ignoring other factors like crits for a sec) (corona flare vs. ice age).  SoE ties the mob hp to damage output of characters on average.  So it would take us 3x as many nukes as a wizard.  Again, the raw numbers don't matter so much as the percentages.<br />
<br />
Don't misunderstand--I still think we need work, but this is not the argument to advance--it's inherently flawed.<br />

Hahahahaha, really. What percentage of the mob's hp do you carve off with your melee damage anyway (not counting procs)? Is it even over 1 percent? I think Curse of the Sprits out-damages my melee on most mobs, even if it doesn't go full duration.</div></div><hr />

Erm, Frynque?  You do know that all wis casters get the same base hp, right?  On sta capped people, race doesn't matter.  Sure, druids have leather, and may be a little lower in AC, but clerics have plate and are higher in AC.  Every one of the priest classes has the same damage mitigation abilities as we do.  Raid buffed/tribute/leadership, etc, I buff to 11k-ish hp now--but so do some of the clerics and druids in my guild.  They aren't any weaker in survivability on mobs than we are, given equivalent equipment.  The real difference is that at mid-range (versus high end), many clerics and druids are sacrificing hp for mana, and we sacrifice mana pools for hp.  That's not really true at the high end.<br />
<br />
We're not any more a &quot;fierce&quot; tank than either of the other 2 classes.<br />

<br />
I am doing this mainly for fun, I think that the dots (when not resisted) are doing a lot more.<br />
<br />
However I honestly think Sony should look at this. They gave us Rabid Bear. They even gave us hastened rabidity. Then we got the Talisman with a very decent ratio on it. Let's get some parses done and maybe then we could get a tweak on RB's effectiveness. <br />
<br />
I don't think we should be out-meleeing the melee. But i think for 10 mins out of 2 hours we should be doing as well as rogues of a tier down from us in gear levels...<br />
<br />
Oh and btw a DoT proc on Bear is pointless. Make it a nuke please.</div></div><hr />

I take a similar approach as you in groups, and have the 75 Liftetap aug from MPG on my Talisman for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Yes it would be lovely if we were tweaked, but not at the expense of our ability to mez with root and tanking.<br />
<br />
I have always envisaged the shaman of being &quot;tough as old boots&quot;...I think that's what defines us as a class. We don't die easily and we rarely have to run.</div></div><hr />

Though it could be wrong I have been told we are not on the same mitigation table as other priest classes. Shaman are on the same mitigation as other chain classes, clerics are on the same mitigation as the Int casters and I'm not sure which one the druids are on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
arguing from 1% of the population doesnt create a solid argument.  at the high end, even enchanters can tank mobs under some situations.  does that mean we're broken?  no.  does that mean that maybe the skew at the high end is off?  probably.  all i know, with my last shaman toon, with pre-elemental (mostly self smithed hurricane/tae ew/night terror armor) gear, i was tank mezzing mobs that chewed up druids and gave alot of clerics a real fright, and that was without sacreficing mana for HP.  wis was my highest stat at 247 unbuffed (no ench buffs) with epic.  i'm sure with elemental and above gear thats probably laughable nowadays, but saying that the class as a whole is broken is absurd.  arguably, we have at every junction, needed some play balance, but i think that comes from being an older class.  warriors, monks, and paladins/sk's have all had similar balancing issues.  but at no point were they broken either.<br />
<br />
personally, having played the class on and off over 4 years, i'd have to say there are more pressing concerns for shaman than mewling over slow mitigation or underpowered pets.  sheesh, our pet has always been second class to almost everyone elses, even going back to velious era.  i have to agree with some of the points about our melee though.  it would be nice to see them bolster our &quot;war priest&quot; ethos a bit.  maybe put us on a combat table that would adjust our max dmg (without raising our caps).  occasionally breaking 100 on a 1hander shot would be nice, and doing it consistantly with a 2hander would be pretty nifty.  or maybe a double attack with a low cap (say 125 or 150).  obviously these would have to be measured against non-dual wielding classes like SK/pal for balance, but i'm sure it could be done with &quot;judicious&quot; skill caps.  also adding a combat crit AA, but only allowing 1 rank (make it a single rank tier3 AA, rather than a tier2 AA).  these are pure speculation and only given as &quot;for instance&quot;, feel free to poo-poo the idea or offer your own considerations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Winter's Frost and Velium Strike are not GoD spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
I meant during the GoD expansion, these represented the best nukes available to dru/shm.  Wasn't implying we received them then.  <br />
<br />
Chut:<br />
&quot;Honestly, raw numerical differences are not all that important. Sure, if you tack on zero's, they look huge, but if the percentages are the same, so is the net effect&quot;<br />
<br />
I know you are right, but something isn't adding up in my head.  Help me figure it out:)<br />
<br />
Theoretically you are right.  Say if my heal were always, no matter what, 50% of a druids.  That would mean I would always, no matter what, just have to cast 2 heals to equal a druids.... simple enough.<br />
<br />
However, what feels off to me, is the raw hp difference changing over time in relation to player hp and mob dps.  Let me explain.. and please point out if I'm being dumb hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
GoD mob dps 800, Shaman heal for 550 less than druid per cast<br />
Oow mob dps 1000, Shaman heal for 635 less than druid per cast<br />
<br />
The raw mob dps has gone up, but our raw hp healed has gone down (relative to a druid).  Doesn't that mean, relative to a druid, that our ability to keep pace with a mobs dps has lowered?<br />
<br />
Gah, I'm giving myself a headache.  Ok, look at it this way.<br />
<br />
Say a druid healed for 5,000 hp per second<br />
And a shaman healed for 2,500 hp per second<br />
50% ratio, 2500 hp diff per second<br />
Mobs during this time have 3500 dps (or 1.4 times what a shaman can heal)<br />
<br />
next expansion...<br />
<br />
Druid heals for 10,000 hp per second<br />
And a shaman healed for 5,000 hp per second<br />
50% ratio, 5,000 hp diff per second<br />
Mobs during this time have 7000 dps (1.4 times what a shaman can heal)<br />
<br />
That would be ok.  Thats fair I think.<br />
<br />
But, what I think has happened, is that the mob dps from pop to god to oow hasn't kept in relation to our heal.  <br />
<br />
Its more like this occured:<br />
<br />
Say a druid healed for 5,000 hp per second<br />
And a shaman healed for 2,500 hp per second<br />
50% ratio, 2500 hp diff per second<br />
Mobs during this time have 2000 dps <br />
<br />
next expansion...<br />
<br />
Druid heals for 10,000 hp per second<br />
And a shaman healed for 5,000 hp per second<br />
50% ratio, 5,000 hp diff per second<br />
Mobs during this time have 7000 dps <br />
<br />
So, while our ratio to druids stayed the same, the mob dps spiked up over what we can heal, but still under what a druid can heal.  <br />
<br />
Now, its isn't a pure dps argument, but combined with slow, thats what I think happened.  Mob dps +nerfs to debuffs put the average mob dps over a shaman's ability, but under a druids ability.  <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Ratio wise, same as ever.<br />
Raw HP healed per second has gone down relative to druid<br />
Raw HP dished out per second by mobs has gone up past our healing point&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
I guess I believe that it is time to re-think the ratio's between priests, giving that our ability to nerf a mobs dps has dropped drastically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Now you're discussing something else entirely, Ung.  Your issue really isn't class balance with respect to percentages.  As long as percentages aren't changed, the classes remain generally in their prior state of balance.<br />
<br />
As you noted, the problem is that game changes and content changes make revisiting the healing percentages every once in a while a good idea.<br />
<br />
SoE has been firmly wedded to the 100/64/47 percentages since GoD came out.  They've stuck through those percentages through slow mitigation, 30 second fights in GoD, 600% increases or more in dps, etc.  They have consistently refused to so much as discuss the healing percentages.  Any mention of them is soundly ignored.  (This can pretty much be laid at the feet of the same ****tard that won't make our pet dual wield--Rytan the Asslord).<br />
<br />
The thing is, SoE sets the bar on the dps versus healing (of a cleric).  Druid and shaman healing fall out mathematically.<br />
<br />
There are other factors that add some meaning to your argument--but it's not a percentage issue.  We are healing the same percentage as we have been.<br />
<br />
The pinch you are probably noticing is a factor of several things (imo, of course!  Agree/disagree as ya like, it's just my opinion).<br />
<br />
1) There is (or at least was) a significant 'overheal' component for cleric--and to a lesser extent, druid--heals.  Their heals (fast and slow) were typically large enough, and mobs' relative dps were slow enough that their heals seldom hit for full.  Thus, their heals had a 'overheal' component above and beyond full hp.<br />
<br />
Now let's vastly increase mob dps.  With the volatility of hit point variances during a fight, now most druid heals hit for full, and many cleric heals hit for full.  Shaman heals, on the other hand, were almost ALWAYS hitting for full BEFORE then dps change.  We have no overheal component to cushion the changes.<br />
<br />
Result: our healing is disproportionately whacked compared to cleric or druid healing despite the consistent percentages.  Rytan is not smart enough to understand this fact, btw, or at least chooses to ignore it so he can justify screwing us over as usual.<br />
<br />
Making the game more difficult for the specialist classes is a guaranteed screwing of the generalist classes--we can't keep up.<br />
<br />
2) Length of fights.  This was a HUGE problem in GoD, especially pre-tuning.  30 seconds fights, usually 8 of which were getting the mob slow, meant that shaman did jack for damage mitigation and did jack for dps.  Jack for healing is, of course, obvious.<br />
<br />
Post-tuning, with 45 seconds fights, it was better--not good, but better.<br />
<br />
OoW actually helps us some.  Mobs live 1 minute or so in solid groups.  We can slow and, to some extent, DoT.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that fights vary per expansion, per group, etc.  Who do you tune against?  The uberest of uber crowds and work down?  (probably best--you can measure the highest end more easily than a nebulous 'average' shaman).  What kind of equipment do you put on the rest of the group (affecting dps and hence length of fight).<br />
<br />
Shaman healing should be a percentage based on length of fight--we have to slow, then catch up on heals, then average heal over the rest of the fight.  Some may argue that we shouldn't be slowing AND healing--I thumb my nose at them.  If, as has been argued by clerics AND developers, our heals are smaller because we can slow, then I view that as an argument that we should be able to slow then heal and be an equivalent healer to a cleric.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the problem is that length of fight determines how well we have to heal (to catch up for unslowed period, then averaged in with rest of fight).  The analysis also has to ignore resists, as resists have too large a noise ratio.<br />
<br />
I think someone attempted an estimate, and came up with a shaman needing to heal approximately 60% of a cleric.  Unfortunately, Rytan could (if he were actually inclined to justify a decision rather than just say, 'no') pick apart any such study because there are 10,000 variables.  Empirically, we can see the need for improved healing, but Old Asshat always demands proof (which he ignores anyway)--and proving something with 10,000 moving parts is unbelievably hard.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, as I said in an earlier post, I don't disagree with the sentiments, but the argument isn't actually a problem with fixed percentages, but what the percentages are, especially in relation to the mob dps and length of fights.  Raw numbers aren't the issue!  :)<br />

<br />
Mitigate slow, so that what was previously 75% slowed is now 30% slowed.. therefore...<br />
<br />
Shaman need 45% more healing to compensate?<br />
<br />
Everyday it still just baffles me that our class, who's healing is admittedly balanced around slow (Dev's said that), has our slow nerfed, but our healing remains unchanged....<br />
<br />
Seems to me that we need a 2500hp fast heal (1750hp now, increased 45%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Honestly, raw numerical differences are not all that important.  Sure, if you tack on zero's, they look huge, but if the percentages are the same, so is the net effect.  If the percentages are the same, it takes a shaman 2x as many fast heals as a cleric to heal a tank, regardless of the raw differences<br />
I still think we need work, but this is not the argument to advance--it's inherently flawed.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
not true, clerics have overheal, I have seen critheals for nearly 20k when no player has that many hp.<br />
<br />
clerics are over the minimum needed to keep people alive by a significant margin<br />
<br />
druids are probably very close to the mark in endgame healing for a fast exp group.<br />
<br />
shaman are still slaves to the malo/slow/pray your crappy heal can keep up cause the tank is almost dead.<br />
<br />
look at it this way, vrs a fully slowable mob, healing is trivial for a cleric, easy for a druid, but still risky for a shaman. vrs a mitigating mob the shaman is the one that loses out, the others are still capable healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont know this is all frustrating at times. Bugs me they set the healing % to slow for us and than changed the slows. Is also amazing how many people are just sold that shaman cant heal. <br />
<br />
Was in a group in wos and cleric left. I was healing and slowing and dotting while we were waiting even killed a named. I had no trouble or mana issue and dotted while healing but they had to have a cleric to heal. <br />
<br />
Was the easier side mind you. But that isnt the point. If people think shaman cant heal the easier mobs in WOS what do they think we can heal? Went to do a Draniks Exp. What classes? I say shaman and they ask do we have a healer? /sigh<br />
<br />
I healed all night with no deaths. But i dont know if i have a chance at some of the tougher mobs in OOW for exp group. I feel for a truely casual shaman. I'm not guilded but ive put alot of work into my gear playing more than i should admit at times. With max ft and improved healing i still hit a healing wall pretty quick it seems when i HAVE to malo a mob to have it mitiage my slow mostly and hope the tank doesnt die on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
never spent much time in an indoor zone, eh?<br />
<br />
kiting doesnt work too well in tight confines of places like BoT, HoH (where kiting can easily bring you an extra 2-6 mobs depending on the camp location), etc.<br />
<br />
additionally, why should the group give up DPS (from nuking, doting) when i can  very easily stand in front of the mob, tank it, land a dot or two, and just plain outright keep it busy for the minute or two it takes to chew up the primary target.  plus kiting doesnt always keep aggro if the cleric has to heal the kiter for any reason.  i've maintained aggro with nothing more than slow + melee dmg when a cleric hits me with their fast heal (granted thats less aggro than a CH generally), which translates into zero &quot;extra&quot; mana needed to keep the mob busy.  and i usually come out of it with only needing that single short burst heal during the melee, which is a small mana hit on the cleric, due to 41/tick standing regen.<br />
<br />
admittedly, this wont work for all shamans, because many shamans, from playing my non-shaman toons, always strike me as &quot;combat squemish&quot;, basically playing druid/wizards in heavy armor.  blech.  my hat is off to any other shamans who typify the war priest ethic, its a bumpy road, but it can be exciting and fun.<br />
<br />
lastly, yes, kiting in some respects does work fine.  and in those instances, i usually sit my ass down, and med or keep the kiter alive with spot heals.  but its a wise shaman who knows when to take control, and when to let others handle a job.  YMMV.<br />

But an argument like. The ratio of .73 is not fair is valid. So go with that. <br />

If you tell SOE, Shaman need to heal more because in xp groups and in raid content we just feel inferior by a wide gap and it's making us not want to play shaman as much. That makes sense.<br />

not at all.  but i think that people are misconstruing the issue.  shamans havent been nerfed.  we still have all the same powers and abilities we always had.  what HAS happened, and correct me if i'm wrong here, is they lowered our effectiveness against the new expansion because they over-powered the mobs ability to mitigate/resist our slows, without offering us a way to counter it (thru AA or other spells).  what i'm saying, if this is indeed correct, is dont confuse the issue, because you're not going to get anything complaining about the wrong thing.  if we get our &quot;agents inside&quot; to express the issue that the content ramp-up has made shamans less popular &quot;in the new expansion areas&quot;, then maybe they could address THAT issue, maybe fine tuning the level of mitigation or giving us a new spell line that counters it (similar to the disease cloud line of slows to counter heavily MR mobs).  screaming &quot;we're nerfed!  we're nerfed!&quot; only makes them roll their eyes and say &quot;here we go again...&quot;<br />

/agree wholeheartedly bro, but you dont always have the option of building a &quot;perfect group&quot;, aka, tank-cle-mezz-slow-dps-dps.  sometimes you gotta go with things like, tank-dru-sham-dps-dps (open 6th slot) because not everyone 4-boxes or belongs to a huge guild.  YMMV.  its THOSE times that shamans can be very key as tank mezzers, secondary healers, etc.  like i said, you gotta know when to hold'em and know when to fold'em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;shamans havent been nerfed&quot;<br />
<br />
You are correct.  Anyone with slow was nerfed, starting in late PoP, culminating in GoD, and carrying through into OoW.  <br />
<br />
Our buff line became rather worthless towards the end of PoP (max stats due to gearflation), was entirely useless except for 540 hp buff and pr/dr during GoD, and was just now partially restored with some overcapping and less reliance on stats in OoW.<br />
<br />
In terms of dps, anyone using dots as a primary means of dmg was nerfed due to content changes, faster battles, and lower hp mobs.  Necro's and shamans faced this bitterly in GoD.  In OoW, mobs have slightly more hp, and curse dots like Bane usually run their course.  However, our poison line typically does not.  Poor necro fire lines like funeral pyre haven't for a few expansions now.  <br />
<br />
So... yeah, shamans weren't nerfed alone, but the general content change, widespread slow mitigation, boss mob immunity to slow, gearflation, shorter battles, less hp on mobs, etc.. affected several classes.  It just happens to be unfortunate that shamans were affected by all of the above... so in essence.. yeah, shamans felt the changes to most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Nice posts Unkgor and Chutoi.<br />
<br />
Yes, the problem is much more complex than pure percentages alone.<br />
<br />
The real question to ask is:<br />
<br />
With cleric being such a key class in every high end group, and with a feeling that clerics alwys get &quot;special treatment&quot; fomr the design team, why are they so rare in the high end game (on our server at least)?<br />
<br />
I think we all know the answer to this question -- and this si the question that Sony needs to focus on in EQ2 if they don't want it to fail imho.</div></div><hr />

I cant haul heavy things with it anymore, but its great for light loads and groceries.<br />
<br />
The class still has some issues that need attention.  I wont pretend that OOW hasnt been a pretty good expansion for shaman on the surface, but the underlying issues havent gone away yet.  Healing parities are one of the larger issues that still needs attention.  Fights sometimes last long enough to get the full effect from Bane, but EQ has moved to a more nuke-centric format of gameplay; our nukes havent kept up.<br />
<br />
<br />
we heal more efficiently than druids. crit heals for over 5k plus 3 different HoTs, 2 (if have epic) of which heal the whole group. our only disadvantage to being primary healers is we have to slow the mobs. resists can be a problem sometimes.<br />
<br />
our dots give us more DPS than our nukes in Oow content. i can drop 2 dots on every incoming mob and watch the '...wears off' message just before the mob dies.<br />
<br />
there's nothing wrong with our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">&quot;we heal more efficiently than druids&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the name of the game isn't efficiency anymore.  Its burst healing and burst dps.  Druids still hold the advantage in burst healing.<br />
<br />
&quot;our dots give us more DPS than our nukes in Oow content. i can drop 2 dots on every incoming mob and watch the '...wears off' message just before the mob dies.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can also, in really low dps groups.  In my average time+equipped groups I'm in, bane barely wears off, if I malos on inc, slow a second after it hits the tank, and drop bane when the mob's life is at 97% or so.  I usually can cast bane+Yoppa's rain once per mob. <br />
<br />
I don't have dot crits yet, but I do have nuke crits, so my average dmg done per mob is around 4700 or a bit less (figure rain resists pretty much counter rain crits).  <br />
<br />
Last night, the cleric in our group was crit'ing fairly often for 3600 (new nuke + aa's + focus).  Druids, on the other hand, are reaching 6000+ crit nukes, and most druids I know can drop 2 per fight easily (not saying they crit 2x, just 2 nukes at 2132 base dmg (with 30% focus ~2700)).</div></div><hr />

<br />
aye, but then you're arguing personal skills over class abilities.  again, leaving personal skill out of the argument, in some cases, kiting/root parking is the winning move.  in some, its easier to just plant yourself in front of the mob (who you already have aggro on most likely due to malos/slow/etc.) and keep it busy for the 30sec-2min that the group grinds up the main target.  as a shaman, it didnt take any uber creative skill to tank mezz mobs, nor did it take gear that was beyond, or even AT the level of the zone i was doing it in.  granted OoW mobs hit insanely harder from what i gather, so this might not be an optional role for us at that junction.  i then counter, in that instance, maybe its time to discover new roles to fill, or create new manners of hunting.  with every expansion, it seems some new form of hunting has come into vogue.  Kunark/Velious introduced AoE grouping, PoP pushed to new heights the insanity of mass aggro kiting, LDoN intensified the popularity of pure DPS groups where you didnt slow/incapacitate mobs but merely out damaged them.  maybe there is some new manner/way to hunt that will be necessary and its merely a matter of time to discover it.  whether it turns out to be a hunting form that invites shamans in, or tosses us out.. who knows, but then  again, i'm not elemental/time geared, so i've not opted to pay money for an expansion that i probably wont enjoy.  maybe its not about us being nerfed.  maybe its just a crappy expansion and you're all trying to fit a square peg in a round hole?  i remember how monks beefed about becoming &quot;useless&quot; when BL's were added to the game.  i remember when tanks beefed when pally's and sk's were holding better aggro and soaking the same dmg.  those who have shelled out the money will have to decide for themselves whether its worth it.  i will offer the prediction that within a month or 2 they'll nerf the mitigation on &quot;some mobs&quot;, just like they nerfed summoning/enrage/flurry on a TON of PoP mobs a few monthes after the expansion was out.  will this be a cure or merely a bandaid.  who knows.  we'll see.<br />

For summoned pets it used to be Necro, Mage, SHAMAN, Sk, Chanter (only cause of the cotrol issues), then Druid.<br />

If you want to win the nuke argument try:<br />
<br />
Our PoP Poison nuke is flawed imho and our GoD one doesn't exist therefore the OoW is basically what our PoP poison nuke should have been and our Poison nuke is now 2 expansions behind the other classes ;)<br />
<br />
I mean compare... Less damage with a higher cast time for less mana is NOT an upgrade to DPS it is only more mana efficent.<br />
The OoW nuke should have been given us in PoP and us upgraded from that without a doubt in my mind.<br />
