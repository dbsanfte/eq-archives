<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well we tried it the other night and the mobs are not spawning corectly. There are long pauses inbetween the turn in and the mobs spawning which in effct throw off the timer for the scripted event part.<br />
<br />
The first time i tried to do this part here is what happened.<br />
The box was gave to the An Iksar Apparion, VS and SoR spwned on the stage and started fighting (Scripted and VS in Untargtable at this time) and the 4 guards pop. The gurds where mezed, Vs Killed SoR, and became targetable. Muti mezs broke and the chanter got droped and then the rest of us.<br />
<br />
This time...<br />
Handed in the box. The Iksar appertion despwned and VS poped has a ghost untargetable nonaggro. After 2 min the guards poped. After that VS went to the stage and despwned and a Swriling mass of Bones (actul name) poped. He sits up there for about 2 min then despawned. Now VS spawns and come off the stage and attacks us. He is still un targetable becuse he has not yet killed SoR. At some point in the confusion of trying to fight a mob we could not target SoR spawns and starts attacking VS but VS would not aggro to him.<br />
<br />
What I think happend is that the scriped part (where VS and SoR fight) is timed. And becuse of the long pauses and 2 extra useless mobs spawning the timer ran out and has far has the game was concerned VS was sapost to attack us by this time (already killed SoR) But VS dose not becom targetable till after he kills SoR who dosent spawn till a considrable time later.<br />
<br />
A gm did return the Iksar relics to me at least. But if your planing on trying this soo be carfull&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think I'll bring a GM along for mine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">omg grats zenok! Is that the first on xev? I've been stuck and the stinkin overseer for the last 2 months :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zenok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Krak ;) yah i think its the first one, i think you're the next closest on the server.....i did all the other pieces about 3 or 4 mo ago, when overseer was a common spawn /hide....heh, but got so busy doin other stuff took me forever to get people to help w/ final batte.....then i *cough* failed the first battle, and had to wait a month to try get relics back and try again :P hehe.....finally done w/ the thing though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So about what level are the guards and final mob you have to fight?  My shaman is currently level 32 and I have no illusions about doing this until at least mid 40s, but any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">50+ on all guards, 55+ on VS.  Would be quite tough to get pre-50, let alone before 55.</div></div><hr />

Turned the box in to the Iksar Apparation, he spawns to Vauris, and sits there for a few minutes. You do begin to get nervous and thing something must be wrong, but then he moves into the room and VS and the 4 skellies spawn. VS spawned in the middle of the floor, but was untargetable. <br />
<br />
We pulled the 4 skellies up to the tunnel and mezzed them and kept them mezzed. VS stays up alone for quite some time, and then finally he pops to the stage and the fight between him and Rile begins. This also took much longer than I expected. We kept the skellies mezzed throughout, but did get back pops we had to take care of in the tunnel.<br />
<br />
When VS finally won and spawned targetable, we attacked and got him slowed. He did run at low health.  <br />
<br />
I did the turn in to Iksar Apparition as soon as the room was cleared (Iksar SK was pulling), and killed VS before the room respawned.  When VS dropped, we killed the first skellie and he immediately repoped, which I thought was odd, but the others went down without repoping.<br />
<br />
It took much longer (the animations) than I expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hay Venom how ya been I havent seen you around for a while and was wondering just the otherday if you still played. Good to see ya are :)<br />
<br />
Well that all good to know I thought it was messed up.<br />
The first time I tried it I had very little info, Basicaly that VS would spawn + 4 guards, Mez guards kill VS, loot head, kill guards, then turn the stuff in. Due to some people haveing aggro from the iksar app we ended up mezing it and relogeing and had him up on the stage. So when I turned the box in VS and SoR spawned at onec and started fighting and so did the 4 guards. So this time when everything was drawn out I thought it was messed up. So by parking the app on the stage then turning the box in it maybe possable to by pass the long pauses. But you would be in the room with everthing and eat the first HT's. Thats what happened to me.</div></div><hr />
