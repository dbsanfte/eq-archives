<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, i'm trying to get use to slowing/debuffing etc. So I start out with Malise, then I would Disempower them and if theres time cast walking sleep to slow them. I know these are baby spells but I want to get use to my specific roll. Obviously the Malise line of spells is a must to cast for a shaman, is disempower needed? What percent slow is walking sleep? 10...20 percent, I cannot really view a difference, but i'm sure overall it does slow them a bit. Also I've heard that charisma effects how our spells land, is this a old wives tale or is there some basis of truth to it? I'm only 22nd level so I don't have any of the uber cool slows or debuffs yet. I'd just like a bit of help on how I should have my spells lined up, what ones I should cast when grouping etc. Thanks for the help! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">22 is frustrating, isn't it?  You've begun to taste power.  Like it, doncha...<br />
<br />
I've ALWAYS slowed mobs, and DoTted them.  To me, it's a means for having to spend less mana on heals.  Monitor your tanks hits/misses, if you see them miss or do low-damage hits a lot, disempower will improve that greatly.  Likewise, if you're in a caster group, or you find you don't land your spells reliably, the Malise line is wonderful.  <br />
<br />
You can chain cast Malise till you land one, and the aggro on the Malo-type spells seems to be extremely small.  I've never had something aggro me for a Malise spell.<br />
<br />
Don't forget Inner Fire:  20 extra hp and 2 ac isn't much, but it's dirt-cheap, and quite handy.<br />
<br />
I'm mana-frugal--Having 85 base Wis will do that, doncha know.  I look for ways to cut having to cast a spell, keeping party health/longevity in mind.<br />
<br />
Turtle skin seems to stack with most druid/cleric AC buffs of that level.  I make it a point to give clerics/chanters/wizzies AC and HP buffs whenever possible.  If it doesn't hold... it's generally relegated to the &quot;would not have&quot; pile and doesn't cost mana.<br />
<br />
Most folks don't realize that you can stack both Affliction and Infectious Cloud.  Just make sure you're not in the AOE for Cloud.  Don't really wanna ralph over your armor.  ew.<br />
<br />
I used Burst of Strength and Frenzy a lot on  my tanks if they were having a time of it.  They don't stack, but they each have a recast delay.<br />
<br />
I have 2 &quot;I wish I had..&quot; to provide:<br />
(1)  ... kept all weapon skills up to par.  I didn't start piercing til 19, and gave 1hb up.  Never touched 2hb.  Now I have a 2hb that is absolutely wonderful... and my skill is THIRTY.  *sigh*<br />
(2)  ... nuked more.  Keep evocation up to par, and divination as well.<br />
<br />
Oh... and the vision line of spells?  You can chain them... one critter to another to another... at least, I was able to do that a week or so ago during a Ring War in Great Divide.  I was looking at the waterfalls (where I was sitting atop a guard shack)  from cleear across t'other side.  Very helpful checking places out ... like Permafrost, Split Paw... etc.<br />
<br />
My apologies for writing so much; if I'd had time to edit, this would be shorter :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh.. and Charisma effects charm-type spells, which we pick up at Lev 29 I believe.<br />
<br />
Oh, and groups with 2 shamen in them are AWESOME.  &quot;Assault shamen&quot; absolutely rule.  Establish who will malo, other person slows, malo-person dots with the biggest poison dot, then other person dots, etc.  If you're interested, you can keep agro bouncing between the 2 of you while rogues/tanks do their best to pull it back.<br />
<br />
If we put our hearts into it, we can out-damage the rest of the party (perhaps barring smart-casting wizards).  It'll leave us 00m, tho.<br />
<br />
K.  REALLY done now.  Shutting up and moving off.<br />
<br />
Really.<br />
<br />
I promise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for you ideas. :D But I did notice something. I'd have trouble landing Malise on mobs, I'd cast my cha buff and it would tend to land quicker. I'm not sure if this was just a fluke but that idea alone makes me always have snake up.<br />
If my group is having problems with a mob after I've debuffed and slowed I'll normally stand up and give it a nuke or 3. Thankfully I have yet to be main healer for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cant remember the web site I got this from as I copied pasted and put into word.  Anyways here is what Brad said the stats do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also please note that I am giving you this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). I will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year. <br />
<br />
Anyway, here you go: <br />
<br />
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows <br />
<br />
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills <br />
<br />
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath <br />
<br />
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights <br />
<br />
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <br />
<br />
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) <br />
<br />
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit <br />
<br />
