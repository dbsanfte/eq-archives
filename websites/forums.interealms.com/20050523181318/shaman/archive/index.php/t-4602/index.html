<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks.  I'm midway through 58 and guildless.  <br />
<br />
I purchased Malo on MM for 32k at 57.  One less thing to worry about...whether it was too much is water under the bridge for me.  I've got it; lots of 60s don't.<br />
<br />
Yesterday in CT, I lucked out and won some Boots of Flowing Slime.  I'm wearing them now, replacing wolf caller boots.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is this....we used to have a saying in my old guild that today's uber loot is tomorrow's dust collector.  Looking at these boots, I'm not so sure that they are really that great and I am wondering if I should try to trade them off while everyone is still drooling over them.<br />
<br />
I currently have about 10k in the bank.  I MIGHT be able to buy a copy of Torpor for 15-20k if it ever comes up for sale.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts on whether I should try to trade out the boots for a copy of Torpor + cash (they sell for about 60-65k)?<br />
<br />
I'm interested in what the arguments would be for or against.  I'm guessing that some of you would tell me that I have underestimated the boots and that I am a long way from 60 and I should just keep saving my pennies and hope for the best.  Some pickup groups to Juggs may even be an option.<br />
<br />
I just find it really disheartening all the Shamans I see on my server auctioning 'WTB Torpor, Malo, Pox'.  I don't have Pox either, but I rarely use disease lines these days and I don't think I will miss it tha much.<br />
<br />
I mean, have you ever known an enchanter to be without KEI in their spell book or a Cleric without Aegolism?  Ok, that's another topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think if you can get torpor for those boots you should do it, even if you don't get extra cash. The boots are decent, but if you want mana regen you want torpor. They aren't really shaman boots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sell sell sell sell sell. When you are 60 and torpor'ing mana will be coming out your ears. Get all the cash you can now, so when torpor pops up for sale you can snatch it.<br />
<br />
and pox is extremely usefull soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with your read that they are not really ultimate Shaman boots.  AC7 I think?   Nice for a dr00d, but...<br />
<br />
One thing about the FT3 effect is that it is the same standing or sitting, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I concur with the other shamans, sell the boots for Torpor. It's a fair deal in my eyes.<br />
I did not do the math but I am pretty sure that Canni4 plus Torpor is A LOT more than FT3. Anyone willing to do the math?<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Meditate at 60 is equiv to FT13 of the top of my head?<br />
<br />
Cann4 + torpor is considerably faster than just sitting and medding, so that clears that up =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sure FT3 works standing. Does a shaman ever sit anyway? :) Anyways, I'm not sure what math you expect because it depends on how much time you have to cast stuff and if you're being interrupted and such. But a tick is 6 seconds, casting time of canni 4 is 2.5 seconds, 3 second recast time, each cast gives 82 mana, so basically when you chain it it's 82 mana a tick versus 3 mana a tick from the boots. Let's say you don't have aa points and torpor heals 4 ticks of 300 hp for 200 mana. Considering regen you can probably cast about 9 canni 4's, giving 9*82=738, minus 200 from torpor is 538 mana in about 10 ticks, 1 minute. That's 53 mana a tick, on top of buffs songs and other FT gear. To gain 538 extra mana with the boots you need 179 ticks, in other words 18 minutes. Granted, you have to keep casting for it, but the ability to gain mana this fast even if it's not constantly, outweighs it by far.  I hope this (on the fly, not sure if its totally correct) math shows that an oracle with torpor simply does not have mana problems as long as they keep casting.  You simply do not have that option without torpor, unless you have a personal heal slave. I bet it is often said on this forum, but for mana regen, torpor &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Edit: let me add that without any aa points or other gear according to the above math torpor+canni4 has the potential to give you mana 18 times faster than those boots. But with aa points in buff duration, quick buff, canni 5 or gear like mana preservation (not really high priority).. this will only get better. AA points will have no effect on the effectiveness of those boots, in fact, FT points are capped. And, eventually, since mana won't be a problem, you want boots with ac/hp or some more useful effect anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the last few weeks I have had like 4 tells asking what I thought about flowing slime boots, for example are they better than PoM boots.  I say this - did you really notice the improvement in mana regen from doing mental clarity 3?  I cannot say that I did at all.  /shrug<br />
<br />
FT3 boots for torpor are nice trade bait or nice flat out cash.  If there is a mana-burn team on your server, wizards like flowing thought.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Torpor &gt; FT3 boots.<br />
<br />
Besides, shaman don't wear slippers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wolf Caller Boots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ft3 boots.<br />
<br />
Hock em.. buy torpor. Nuff said. In fact.. hock anything you have to ANYTHING.. just get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like people agree with my inclination for the most part that I should get rid of the boots for Torpor.<br />
<br />
Only remaining question is how does the possible integration of 'Shaman CH' affect the value of Torpor?  Hm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The FT boots don't just have FT on them.<br />
<br />
hp+20, mana+65, MR+10. All useful effects.<br />
<br />
The ac kinda lacks, but hey, I'm over 1k unbuffed, so I'll take my extra 3 mana per tick, thanks. Maybe once I get Canni V, I would consider trading this back out for barbed dragonscale boots, or kael boots, or boots of the dead dream...but I'm happy to wear flowing slime right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sell em.  Not exactly what I would consider good tradeoffs with those boots, but you can always luck out and get another set if you really really wanted em.<br />
<br />
Had a pair myself for a while, didn't really seem worth trading off boots for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Boots are OK, but torpor &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; boots<br />
<br />
You can buy some relatively cheap and decent boots like barbed dragon scale boots pretty easily if you want something in your boot slot.<br />
<br />
torpor will help you your mana regen more than FT 3 (or even FT15) will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">torpor &gt; boots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had a pair of those boots and sold them since I prefer my wolf callers.  With cann4+cann5+torpor, it's all about hp,ac,mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just for clarification, of COURSE torpor is better than the boots...but here is the thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
HE IS ONLY 58 AND CAN'T CAST TORPOR EVEN IF HE HAD IT. I'd save my pennies and hope for either a drop or a drop rate increase (and thus an affordable bazaar price), but wear the boots while you have the option. Go camp ice giants for xp and cash, or hit the Guard camp in Seb, and buy Torpor out of the proceeds from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those boots are nice for the little bit o mana they give you, but are a real problem for their low AC.  Once you get inot the endgame, you'll be Torpor'ing yourself and probably have KEI on.  Therefore, mana won't be THAT big a deal for you.  The 14 AC difference for you will be a big deal when get AoW giving you love taps, and the little bits of mana and HP's can't hoit either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">you are all TOO hung up on Torpor<br />
<br />
not everyone buys their copy of torpor. it does drop, so does malo. paying that much for spells is NUTS.<br />
<br />
fools and their money are easily parted as they say.<br />
<br />
the last time i checked all the Kunark dragons are still getting killed just as frequently as they have in the past. Veeshan's Peak is a FERTILE hunting ground for these spells. <br />
<br />
Those FT3 boots are probably the easiest FT3 item to get, just think about that FT3 as you plunge 6 AA points on your final Mental Clarity.<br />
<br />
the boots are undoubtedly situational kit, like a fungi, like your coldain military wristguard, or bone clasped girdle. BUT don't discount FT3. with those boots FT7 is EASILY achievable.<br />
<br />
FT7 is no joke AND there are still plenty of levels to acquire your spells, they just don't drop in Velks !<br />
<br />
Banth<br />
<br />
PS i do know that Canni 5 is FT29 and FT36 &gt; FT29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Firstly, I do agree that FT36 &gt; FT 29, however, you have to remember that for those extra 7 points, you'll have to be giving up a substantial amount of AC and HP's.  FT3 boots are roughly level equiv to Wolf Caller's and you lose 14AC there.  when you have to deal with flurry mobs that often change their aggros to make sure that people don't camp out of TPW's, you'll take some serious hits.  Small changes to AC can make the difference between a Shammy getting CH'd and a pelt waiting on a rezz.<br />
<br />
Extra mana regen is great for soloing, but the beauty of the endgame is found in mobs and areas that take strong, coordinated guild action.<br />
<br />
Oh, and too hung up on Torpor?  no such thing.  Without a good healing spell for Can V, we turn into mages who can easily reduce themselves to FM and 0HP's but can't heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Update.  Sold them for 60k.  If they had a little more AC or HPs, I would have kept them.  FT3 isn't enough to place them in that slot and I would imagine the price will only be coming down.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know spells drop.  That's how I got my copies of VoTB and some others.  Problem is, as I said, I am currently guildless.  If I can buy them for a reasonable rate, then that works for me.<br />
<br />
Going to hold off on Torpor for now to see if this 'CH' is introduced...might bring he price down.</div></div><hr />
