<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was running around in Kod Taz, and the view of the big temple in the middle there was pretty amazing.  Screenshots don't really do it justice of course.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some of the architecture in GoD is nice, and makes for really nice screenshots.  Some of it is pretty repetative and dull though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't quite put my finger on it, but GoD just doesn't feel like Everquest to me.  <br />
<br />
PoP pushed things quite a bit, really stretching the EQ world visually, but it still had that &quot;something&quot; that made me think EQ for some reason.<br />
<br />
I sure wish they'd do another traditional feeling expansion, like Kunark.  Dark dungeons, MEN in armor perhaps.  Maybe some more DRAGONS.  I just want some straight up traditional tolkien/forgotten realms faantasy I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rofl.. i just came back from seeing AvP, and that temple reminds me of the predator's pyramid.. i guess GoD WAS really going after the extraterrestrial theme after all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NharviSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Imho, EQ looks more and more like a badly made Nintendo game  :( <br />
<br />
The mobs in GoD are horribly ugly, except for maybe the ghosts, but the rest looks like they couldn't afford a real artist for the models, they just took some random 3D artist and made something up.<br />
<br />
OoW and EQ2 to me looks more Nintendo to me that anything I've seen in years. I don't know why they bother pushing the graphics so much. when after all it still doesn't look good. If you ask me, spend more time on making the game run smooth and bugfree than painting more ugly NPCs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like that screen shot.  Whether or not I like GoD or the modles...that screen shot is cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Oow screens look pretty good I think.  Darker, some actual castles.  The mobs are still GoD style which I don't like, but the landscapes are much better I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
first I gotta say what a lot of people have no ****ing artistic sense whatsoever.  physiologically it has to do with the fact that human brains have differing levels of spacial perception.  some people just cannot notice things like proportion as well as others... thus you have instances where people think SoL models look good even though the proportions are screwed up like little kids would draw and their motions are not realistic<br />
<br />
the crappiest expansion was sol... and the models and art was SO BAD and amatuerish that smed decided to remove this altogether from sony and for PoP and every subsequent expansion the models are farmed out to another company.  that's why the ldon art looks so good and why the loading size of those zone are so much smaller than SoL.  it's another thing that isn't difficult for other companies that sony sucks so badly.<br />
<br />
someone mentioned eq is looking more and more like playstation... maybe it's because the same guys do the art now<br />
<br />
of course the downside is the visual unity of the experience.  different people do the art then ****'s gonna look different all the time<br />
<br />
it's one of the downsides of running your company like ****.  it's hard to have consistency when you're busy trying to save your ass</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of my main peeves with Luclin and GoD (non-instanced zones) is the FR lag.  Nedaria's is REALLY bad for this and that is with clip plane at 0.<br />
<br />
Hey, I know I'm not running a Cray here, and my vid card isn't state of the art, nor do I have 1G of RAM, but dayamn.<br />
<br />
I'd like to do more in Luclin, but when I am in Hollowshade and I am basically on top of MOBs before I see them...well..screw it...</div></div><hr />

AMEN BROTHER! Everquest is becoming AlienQuest. Lets see some more fantasy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  First time I zoned into Riwwi I remember stopping and thinking to myself that it was very un-Everquestish to be getting beat on by red-skinned, poofy haired samurai lookin thingies, big muscley things with small heads, and having to listen to listen to a guy named Pxxt Thxxqtlklt'xt somethin or rather do a zone wide shout every 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Who named these people?  Honestly!  Or perhaps I should express my feelings in muramite, for emphasis.  Ahem...<br />
<br />
&quot;Pixxyqlfp'ntxl Pxxxllfqk'zbt, Vxltyxxltliwi Qintpxtyl!&quot;  (Either it means that screenshot is pretty impressive, or I enjoy to have festering cheese in my britches... I need to brush up on my Alien tongues.)<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you walked up to a Muramite and just started moaning and spitting randomly, he'd probably turn to you and be like, &quot;WHAT did you just SAY 'bout my Mama?  You are SO dead!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">speaking of muramite language - what ever happened to learning languages?<br />
<br />
The muramites and taelosians, apparently, despite their very exotic names and appearances all speak perfect common tongue and have no language of their own. Just another thing that irks me about GoD and how hokey it all feels.<br />
<br />
That and the fact that you basically have two zones in all of GoD - Mountain and Temple - with all of 10 or so models inhabiting the whole thing. The only difference between say barindu and kod is that the mobs in kod hit a hell of a lot harder - beyond that they look and feel the same. <br />
<br />
Velious was a frikkin frozen continent and almost all the zones had snow and ice and yet every zone felt unique and had character there. GoD zones, mobs and lore are just so ho hum that those of us who want the world to have a life of its own are left wondering if we have left everquest and stepped into an arcade game.</div></div><hr />

I just spit out my coffee .. that has got to be the funniest thing I've seen here in a long time  :p</div></div><hr />

Too rich. All the people in the cubes close to mine had to come see what I was laughing at.  :)</div></div><hr />
