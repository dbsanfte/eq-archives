<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I trained the first rank in this, but due to the fact that it dosen't give you a message when it triggers, and they don't provide a % for it makes it rather difficult to determine how worthwhile it is.   Has anyone parsed the ability to determine how often it fires?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/bump.  I've been checking this forum daily and haven't seen anyone comment on this one.  Is it worth it?  I bought the 1st level, being as I use Q constantly...I don't want to shell out more points if this is a pointless AA (for whatever reason).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think its early yet but I did the same and periodically check my HP's with Trushars on ..havent seen anything with WOW factor yet. Probably be one of those AA's I top off after I have everything else.<br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i have not trained this ability yet but after i get some other things out of the way will probably pound out the ranks of it.  Have you seen any efficieny with it out of the first level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have it and my impression is it is the same percent as the first level of DoT crits whatever that percent is.<br />
<br />
Just my gut impression after using it a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been feedbacking this regularly since OoW went live, I trained the first rank, and when I use it as a heal on a MT I can see a noticeable jump when it goes off...just be nice if there was a nice Soandso has done a critical heal message every so often....</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes some filter to see how much healed might be nice, though need to be able to turn it off too, like dots. or just for crits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Frankly I got it hoping for eye candy crit messages so that would be a real plus if they added that.</div></div><hr />
