<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smokimon Trailblazer</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inspired by the “Know what you Know” thread. :)<br />
<br />
Here is the situation as it is presented to you:<br />
<br />
You enter a room and see a man in a White Coat standing next to what can best be described as a more comfortable, wired version of a Barber Chair.<br />
<br />
He explains to you that you have a decision to make, sit in the chair or not.<br />
<br />
If you DO sit in the chair you have the option to make life whatever you want it too be, You can change your life as little or as much as you would like to. Make yourself someone else entirely. You can stay the same person; all the same friends and family, just give yourself $10 million in the bank so you don't have to work. Maybe just give yourself $10,000 a year raise so you can pay off some extra bills. WHATEVER you want. Here is the key, once you sit down, and the switch is thrown, you will forget completely that you ever did sit down. As far as you know, this will become your reality, everyone and everything will continue on as if nothing changed, except for the changes you choose, and you will NEVER remember it happened.<br />
<br />
You don't sit down, leave the room and go on as if you where never given this choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you sit? Why? Why not? How do you know you haven't already sat down?<br />
<br />
I know, I know, there is a similarity of sorts too The Matrix, but this was an Ethics class discussion from back in '93 or '94 and I always enjoyed talking to friends about it. Now I pass it along to my friends here at The Glade. I cannot wait to hear your views on this.</div></div><hr />

Cause there is not 10 Million in my bank account, I'm not a rock star, my knee still hurts from playing basketball and supermodels dont throw themselves at me =D<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, interesting question.  I'd hope I wouldnt sit down.  <br />
Initially I was thinking it would be cool if you could do that for say a day or week at a time, but it then occured to me that would be even more insidious.  I can see it being like a drug.  Plus it really messed up that kid in Batman Beyond ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet I think i would still sit.  It would probably be with the intention of preventing myself from moving out of home early, or even better, going back to HS and removing all procrastination from myself, I then would have done my homework and given my best friend a run for Salutatorian hehehe.  If I HAD done my homework in school I would certainly have had excelent grades, not a gues, it's a fact, I was very smart, I was just dumb so far as looking toward the futer goes lol.  Just handing myself the money would be tempting, but not very. . . .fair?  I would be rich while others worked thier tails off for the same kind of money that I would be &quot;giving&quot; myself.  If I was going to be rich, I think I would rather have earned it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally would not sit down, since I believe that my experiences, my regrets, my success in life, by my own hands, define who I am today and drives me.  For me to change that, is for me to change who I am, and I'm too egotistical to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;All the roads we have taken to this point led to this day, and I wouldn't trade this day for anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
I will do with my life what I can, given the tools I have. There's nothing I would change that I could guarantee would leave everything I like just the way it is. <br />
<br />
Would I wish for more money? Maybe, but I'm OK financially, so why?<br />
<br />
Would I wish to be thinner? Maybe, but why? I'd rather learn to be happy with myself. If my self-esteem is low, being thin won't help, I'd just find something else to worry about.<br />
<br />
Would I wish for my son to be &quot;normal&quot;? It would be easier on him and on the family is he were, but how would that change his personality? Would he lose the best parts of him with the autism? I'm not going to take that chance.<br />
<br />
If I did sit down, I would make a wish to change another life, instead of my own. I'd wish for an end to the war in the Middle East, or that chilren could no longer get cancer, or that research would find a cure for AIDS. <br />
<br />
My life doesn't need any adjustments that I can't make on my own, with the help of my family and friends.</div></div><hr />

Probably only give myself a bunch of money, but might make some minor tweeks to appearance/body.  Nothing drastic, but stuff like fixing crooked teeth and bad eyesight.  Nothing that can't be done now given some money and time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah id sit down, and i my wish would be to know the cure to cancer, aids etc etc...<br />
<br />
But after i got back up, would i know i knew the cure? Or would i still have to go out and stumble on it somehow.  Like after i got back up and forgot i had sat down, would it just be like &quot;hey i think if i mixed pear juice and asprin into some form of pill it would cure cancer&quot;  or would i have the cure but maybe never find it (if never was to become a scientist or something)<br />
<br />
Now for my ethical question to tack on to this.<br />
<br />
You and one man are on a raft in the middle of the ocean.  You are a doctor and have figured out it will take 5 days to get back to mainland.  You have enough food  for one of you to make it back to the main land alive. Now you also have the cure to cancer, you spent you time on the raft thinking, and you came up with it, and you know its right.   Now the question is, is it ok to kill the other man and steal his food or not?<br />
<br />
A similar question.  A small town is torn apart by a series of greusome murders.  These murders all started when a &quot;mysterious drifter&quot; came to town. You are the sheriff of this town, and for a fact know the drifter is not responisble for the murders.  However the town is going to riot if someone is not brought to justice, and many assume it was the drifter.  Is it ok for the sheriff to lock of the drifter ( he will die, the only sentence in a case with murders this gruesome is the death sentence), to quell the riots and subdue the town?<br />
<br />
<br />
I would say to the 1st one yes, its ok to kill the man and take his food. You will save untold amounts of lives, for the loss of one.  The end justifies the means.<br />
<br />
However with that logic i should say its ok for the sheriff to lock up the drifter, which i  think is dead wrong.  <br />
<br />
Its hard for me to explain why its wrong, but just in my gut i can feel it and its wrong to me, the ends dont justify the means in that situation.  Part of it is because of the number of people it could possibly benefit though.  But when does it become ok.  500 people die in the riot. Is it ok then?  50,000 die in the riot ( a very large small town riot lol) then is it ok?  Wheres the magic number?<br />
<br />
My view actually has a name which i cant remember and is a combination of marxist ethics and some other guys.  Its been a while since ive had a philosophy class though and im not gonna go back and find my notes.   <br />
<br />
What do you guys think though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not tell the other man and give up your own life instead of killing him? I don't know what I'd do.  Maybe if he was too stupid to understand it, or you just couldn't trust him to relay it successfully.  Ah well.<br />
<br />
No way should that sheriff lock the drifter up.  If the townspeople kill themselves off in a riot over such a thing and blame someone over that with no evidence, it's their own fault, not counting the innocents who got caught up in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One problem, Simas. If you're a doctor you would know quite well that humans can survive five days without food easily.  However, say the comodity were water, and your situation is valid again.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that I'd spend a lot more time trying to figure out some way that we could both survive rather than deciding whether to kill someone to preserve my knowledge. However, if it came down to it, why not ask the other guy on the boat what he thinks? Maybe he would jump overboard to preserve your cure.<br />
<br />
As for the second one, I'd say sure. Afterall, there's still a trial, and in the US a jury trial for a capital crime takes forever. The sherrif could wait for things to die down and then tell the DA they don't have enough evidence. If he didn't lock the drifter up, chances are he would become a victim of vigilante justice and be killed by the crowd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my question, you do NOT get back up. Once you sit down you never again remember that there is anything to &quot;get back up&quot; to. The life you get when you sit is the only one you ever know, have known, or will know. YOU think it IS your life. Would THAT change your answer? So in the world in which you live in your mind there is no cancer, but in the world around that room in which you are sitting in the chair there is still cancer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it would be like sitting down and spending the rest of your life DREAMING you were licing in your perfect world. No thank you. I'll take my real life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Myrea you just have to accept the argument for the sake of argument, there is no way you could both live.  I forgot to add in the other guy is unconcious so you cant ask him to die.  As a doctor you do have an IV hooked up (or something) with his food supply already put in it and such. Or something.  <br />
<br />
Point is there is no way for you to both live, and you cant ask him to &quot;take one for the team&quot;.  Just because thats how it is.</div></div><hr />

I just don't see the point in asking a question that is so completely out of the realm of possibility that it requires multiple un-realistic conditions be placed on it to make it a real &quot;moral dilemma.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can't deny that sometimes I think about what three wishes I might make to a genie in a bottle, or what I would buy if I won the Powerball (which is probably less likely to happen than the genie.) But I don't really put much weight on it.<br />
<br />
The hard fact is that in a life or death situation, most human beings will choose life, and worry about the consequences later.</div></div><hr />

You are effectively being offered a miracle and a gamble, do you stay with the hand you were dealt or take some new cards hoping for a better hand.  <br />

As to the question, hell yeah I'd sit down, devoid of a moral center, there is no reckless choice I wouldn't consider.<br />
<br />
Simas, to the raft question, I'd probably kill the other guy even if I didn't have the cure to cancer. When it comes down to me or him, he is so dead. Besides, the law would agree with me, I'm quite certain that have laws for special circumstances that would prevent you from going to jail for that situation.</div></div><hr />

No, once you sit down you stay there, wired to the chair for the rest of your life. In your brain you live life in the world you created for yourself, and here in the real world you are in a building, in a chair forever.<br />
<br />
I would not sit down, and this is where it becomes a question of ETHICS not of MORALS.<br />
<br />
I would not sit down because although for ME life would be great, the life and world I created for myself. I would have all the people I love and care about with me, so I would not miss them. Of course they would be left here, they would be hurt by the lose of a loved one. By a loved one putting their own happiness over others pain. They would only know me as a vegetable in a chair living my own perfect life.<br />
<br />
The Ethical question is; are you willing to emotionally hurt those who care about you for the benefit of your own utopia. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is, I think, what IS reality?  Morpheus in Matrix puts it nicely, if you get down to it, what you define as reality is simply electrical signals intrepreted by your brain.<br />
<br />
If you sat down, let's say it's a matrix plug, you won't even know the new reality is not the /real/ reality.  If you view it from that light, then how do you know we're not all plugged into some machine somewhere, ala the fantasy chair, where the entire world has been destroyed and we're nothing but disembodied brains plugged in, recycled?  The moral conflict I think is.. if you do not even know if it is fantasy or reality, does it truly matter to the person involved which is which?<br />
<br />
It is in our nature (I'm one example, by far) to want to be in control.  Our lives, our thoughts, our destiny, all we want to think it is in our control.  Most people would not be comfortable in a situation they do not feel they are in control.  This chair and people's immediate reaction to &quot;it is a fantasy, and thus I would not sit down&quot; is a reflection of that.  I am not stating that is good or bad, for I myself have that reaction, and still hold on to that feeling.  It is just an observation.  Comments?</div></div><hr />

Now maybe it's because I just stood up for 6 hours and haven't eaten in 12 hours but this strikes me as odd.  While it is certainly possible I would argue it is not probable.  I try not to think of things this way as there are a number of things any wacko* can make up, and who is to say it's not true?  Who is to say dinosaurs never existed and their remains are not just a cosmic prank put on us by E.T.?   Who is to say there are not scaled down galaxies and universes inside of our couches? That we are not but undetectable, tiny dots on some larger creatures couch?  I don't believe in extraterrestrials just because it sounds good, and I certainly don't believe reality is anything other than what I see and experience just becuase the notion strikes me as intriguing.<br />
<br />
*Not to imply you're a wacko at all.:)</div></div><hr />

As for &quot;What is reality&quot; it is a difficult question if someone came and told me &quot;Sit in this chair to enter the real world.&quot; However, if they tell me to sit in the chair and have my dreams come true, and have that become my reality, I would say no in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Even if I wouldn't know once I sat down, I would know before I made the choice. Even if I were giving up one fantasy for another, I'd rather stick with the fantasy I know.<br />
<br />
Entertainment reference - 'Angel' had an episode where Cordialia, a main character, was given the chance to have &quot;the life she was supposed to have without Angel. Given that kind of choice, where fate was interrupted to being me to the point I'm at, would also be more difficult. <br />
<br />
I think it's matter of the connections you have in the real world. After I sat down, I'd think everyone I loved was fine and happy, but in making the choice, I would know that what I was doing would hurt them, and so the choice would be easy.<br />
<br />
Not to start a war, but my religious beliefs also would prevent me from acting in such a selfish manner.</div></div><hr />

I'm reminded of two things when I read this. One, the old Twilight Zone episode where the guy died and thought he was in Heaven because he got everything he wanted. I'm also reminded of a book in the Red dwarf series Better than Life where the crew was trapped inside a game that simulated life that was better than your actual life. In both cases they realized having what you want isn't exactly a good thing. It gets boring there's no challenge and eventually no point to life.</div></div><hr />
