<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok...Im inpatient.  Im off of EQ until Ameritech decides to install DSL in my house :(<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
I HAD a Riva TnT 32MB vid card and<br />
384 RAM<br />
<br />
Just purchased:<br />
<br />
Shadows of Luclin<br />
256Mb ram (total 512)<br />
and a GeForce 2 Ultra 500 with 64MB RAM DDR<br />
<br />
Is my EQ experience going to be significatly better with the last two purchases..especially when it comes to Luclin?<br />
<br />
Actually, I got those two for free :)  But I didnt know how much better the vid card was..since Im puter illiterate...but I put it in anyhoo and am hoping it helps EQ performace..<br />
<br />
Any puter savvy folks out there with opinions?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The videocard is much much better than your old card.<br />
(Your new video card is 2 generations better than your old. From slowest to fastest goes &quot;Nvidia cards&quot; Tnt - Geforce - Geforce2 -Geforce3 -Geforce 4. Also given fact you have and Geforce 2 Ultra its like like a Geforce 2.1)<br />
The ram upgrade will probably help just as much.<br />
<br />
I have 2 machines<br />
AMD 1800XP<br />
768 Ram Geforce 3<br />
I can basicly run SoL with everything on with no probs at 1280X1204.<br />
<br />
Second machine is<br />
Intel 800 mhz<br />
512 Ram<br />
Geforce 2 (Non-Ultra)<br />
Run in 800x600 all models on , occassional studdering.<br />
<br />
So really without knowing you cpu speed dunno where you will fall but maybe you can get an idea from what i posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pentium 3 933Mhz<br />
512 Ram<br />
GeForce 2 Ultra 500<br />
ummm..what else..<br />
SB live<br />
lol<br />
umm...<br />
<br />
thats bout all I know :)<br />
<br />
It ram &quot;well&quot; without Luclin...<br />
<br />
I just didnt want to be paranoid about my upgrades when it comes to Luclin :)<br />
<br />
thanks for the help BTW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The memory increase will help you tremendously with Luclin. I only had 256 when Luclin came out and it dragged. Bought another 256 stick and can run 800X600 with all models on. Only stuttering I get is in areas with lots of folks(i.e. East Commons Wal Mart).<br />
<br />
The vid card will help too. I have a Geforce 2 GTS. Looking to buy a newer Geforce 3 soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The 2 upgrades will make a noticable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VI has done alot of work to streamline the code so the specs that were originaly stated before SOL was launched are actualy lower now.<br />
<br />
I have a <br />
<br />
P3 800<br />
384 RAM<br />
G3 ti 300<br />
<br />
I don't have any problems except for raids and the Nexus with the new models.  But on raids I turn most of that crap off anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You upgrades with your current system should be a very noticable difference. I think youll be happy.<br />
<br />
Im guessing you could do 800x600 (maybe 1024x768) with all models on. With little to no graphics lag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I 've got  a pretty outdated computer  500mhz  376 mb's of ram geforce 2 mmx, cable modem.  and I run Eq perfect. (old world, kunark, velious, and luclin.)  at 800x600 resolution  Zoning takes about 20-30 secs. I also have that caching feature on too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was hoping this lil upgrade would buy me another year of unfettered gaming experiences :)<br />
<br />
Looks like I might just luck out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">RAM seems to be huge. I went from 128MB to 512MB and, not only did my zone times drop from 30-60 seconds to &lt;10 seconds, and the game no longer pause for 1-3 seconds whenever someone entered the zone, but I can now actually have some of the Luclin models loaded if I want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Upped my XP1900, GF 3 rig from 512 to 1 gig of RAM... I was literally zoning in seconds. Turned on all the new models, and zoning time has increased significantly. I can still play comfortably at 1280X1204 with all models on, but if you stick 50 peeps in a tight area, I will slow down quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Both the extra RAM and new Vid card will help you significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DSL was installed..tested my new machine..can I get an <br />
<br />
AMEN!<br />
<br />
Wow.  I have a 19&quot; monitor...am running SoL with models on @1024X768..and it looks great...\<br />
<br />
zones used to take 15-30...now are taking 10-20.<br />
<br />
Thank you Jeezus!<br />
<br />
And thank you Shammies of the Crucible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, good to hear you seen a big improvement. I have a celeron 1ghz 512mb of ram and radeon 32ddr LE card - aka piece of trash. I can run with old models in 800x600 fine, probably 1024x768, but I don't like the pauses I get sometimes. I threw in my friends Geforce 3 card and turned on ALL settings and features to High, previously i was on low textures and almost everything turned off. It ran pretty smoothe in East commons with a 100+ people in the zone.<br />
<br />
I didn't think the Geforce3 would be such a big improvement for my system. Guess I was wrong=). So now I'm going to wait on the geforce4 4200 and just get that, probably more than I really need since I only have a 1ghz processor, but what the hell=)</div></div><hr />
