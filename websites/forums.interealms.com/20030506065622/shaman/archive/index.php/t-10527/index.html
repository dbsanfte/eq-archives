<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm a 44th level shaman on FV. But guys, let me tell you I'm the stupidest shaman ever existing : I spent almost all my 44th level in the face of mobs, only root cooked for horrible levels (such as 29-33). The other day I wanted to go make some mob cooking in RM and I was horrible at that. I can kill 2 or 3 giants at the same time while tanking them (using instill to park if needed) but I can't root-cook them, seems I haven't the mana for it (which I'm sure is false). I simply forgot how to efficiently root-cook, I can do it but it's not efficient compared to tanking mobs. Any suggestion ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If youre in RM, then that means youre fighting Hill Giants.  They have lots of HPs and by lvl 44, you're really hurting for good Dots.  Dont even bother root-dotting (i assume thats what you mean by root cooking).  If you're defense is maxed, then you should be more mana efficient by slowing, and tanking for your pet, adding in what melee you can.<br />
<br />
If your defense isn't maxed then you should still be tanking for your pet!  :-)  HGs are a good way to get those Defense skill-ups!<br />
<br />
Leave the root-dotting to the druids!  :D  Tanking is more fun, and will benefit you more in the long run.  If you just can't bring yourself to not dot, then throw one in during the fight.<br />
<br />
Once you get your 49 Dot, you'll be amazed at how fast things die!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, you get two 1k+ dots at 49.  However, I've always thought root-rotting was the most boring way to hunt... with our slows, we can tank almost any mob while our pet chews it up.<br />
<br />
It's a personal choice, being able to med while root-rotting is nice, but root can break at any time and it tends to break often when our dot's DD portion hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, this is my &quot;problem&quot; : I always tanked while soloing (all skills are maxed but weapon skills). It's way more fun to get it &quot;in the face&quot;. But now I can't seem to remember how to root DoT. Oh men, I'd make a bad bad druid...<br />
