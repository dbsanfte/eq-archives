<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did you all notice yesterday after the patch that many mini named and most trash no longer mitigated slow?  Not sure if this is a bug or intentional but I sure am enjoying it.  Seemed the raid mobs all mitigated still but it's nice to get a full slow, being able to easily solo named that were difficult before...<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope it's permanent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They probably just upped the mobs' innate hit rate to compensate, but even if so, this way is better for shaman desirability, so it's all good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, pleasantly surprised to see a lot of slows landing for full.<br />
<br />
Its going to get nerfed..................................... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I don't think they did.  Most of the mobs I slowed in WoS last night would just stand there after being slowed and hit every now and then.  They might have done that to compensate for the huge aggro range the stuff there has, since you get adds if you don't have a proper pulling class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't had the possibility to log on yet since the patch, but I have been reading about the changes to mitigation since I have been back at home and I'd be very happy if what I am reading is true.<br />
<br />
If only raid mobs mitigated slow, 80% of my complaints would be gone and, despite all the obvious weaknesses, I'd feel like I am contributing adequately again.<br />
<br />
How did the changes to mitigation affect PG and Riftseekers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is a nerf for non slowing classes, that's and i really hope they undo this change :)</div></div><hr />
