I thought it was pretty funny.  Anyone agree/disagree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Meh - it found me underwhelmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think i am easily amused.  i actually found your signature even funnier.  well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/disagree.<br />
<br />
I think you can go to pretty much any class board and they will agree - should have been &quot;druids&quot; instead of &quot;shamans&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I'm not saying that druids whine more than anyone else...I'm saying people THINK that druids whine more than anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno, 9 out of the 10 druids I've grouped with in the past ... say... year or so, have whined about their class in the course of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its a COMIC, a JOKE. The people that get bent out of shape over it need to go take a valum.</div></div><hr />

Stop linking this particular god damn /gu.  It's been linked 10+ times that I've seen, and I may have missed a few.  Someone make a sticky thread entitled &quot;Yes, we've seen the /gu about shamans whining, it's very humorous, stop linking it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

2nd headline down...<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;T-Shirts move to EQDruids&quot; ( September 3rd, 2003 )<br />
 <br />
<br />
 GU T-shirts have moved! They are now being handled by Spiritual and the Folks at EQDruids. I can only hope that this is a positive move for the GU products. You can find the shirts linked from the GU store.<br />
<br />
And for those of you inquiring about commissions, Please be patient. I'll be ready again SOON.&quot;<br />
<br />
EDIT: and as far as the comic, it gets a little old being portrayed as 'the uberest class in the game that still wont stop whining'. I'd like to avoid another class balance argument, but too much emphasis is put on soloability. We are an awesome solo class, yes, but when it comes to grouping and raiding other classes outdo us way further than they should.<br />
<br />
so no, it's not funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Woody just has this obsession with bringing up shaman whining over and over again.<br />

It's kind of pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good call Gwain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've seen it numerous times, I still don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's one thing to laugh at ourselves - mistakes, idiosynchrocies, etc.  This isn't exactly one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My apologies if this has been posted before.  A rl friend emailed it to me and I hadn't seen it.  To be honest, I did post it hoping to get some people annoyed which really is a n00b move.  In my two years or so coming to this board I have always found it to be a great resource filled with helpful, bright, friendly etc. people.  Unfortuantely there also seems to be a decent amount of folks here who have a lot of time on their hands and who really enjoy pointing out what they feel is wrong in the shaman universe.  This was a weak attempt to get a dig into them and see if I could get them worked up.  <br />
<br />
My personal experiences now that I have played a shaman for over 3 years is that we are powerful and useful.  Sure there are things everyone wants to change but they should always been seen in the context of the big picture.  The shaman class works well.  We are needed.  People like having us around.  People want us in groups.  Oh, and we can solo too.  It seems like the last few times I have checked out this board the threads that I have noticed most have been those with a whole lot of &quot;thanks for nothing verant&quot; and &quot;what didn't get fixed in this patch&quot; and &quot;alchemy ruined my life&quot; etc, etc.  If I stumbled across this board and didn't know any better I would assume shaman in general were whiners.  Thankfully I didn't just stumble across this board and I know that for every cry baby poster there are scores who are reasonable and rational about the shaman universe.  I found the cartoon funny because I try not to take myself or this game too seriously (not always successfully).  It pokes fun at the shaman community of which I am a part.  Of course other classes whine but referencing shaman made me smile.  If it said ranger I doubt I would have laughed.  Sorry if I beat a dead horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think you'd have to work at SOE to see that warriors haven't been screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Woody has artistic talent, but he is also an unmitigated jackass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the guy who writes GU has never progressed beyond lvl 50ish and Karnors castle/Dreadlands.  So to him, a shaman must be pretty much a godlike character.  I mean, a 65 shaman completely decimates all the challenges he has ever faced on his 50 warrior.  So how could such a powerful class complain so much?  It boggles his mind.  Actually tho, we haven't done that much whining in quite a while.  Since PoP was new at least.  And truthfully, a LOT of our concerns over the ages have been both addressed AND fixed.  I think this board in particular can claim at least a hundred improvements to the shaman class that were recommended by seasoned veterans who post here.  The Crucible has a fine legacy.  <br />
<br />
I'd have to say that shamans are fairly balanced at the moment tho.  <br />
<br />
That comic was obviously just another stab at a class he really envies.  If it was at least funny, I wouldn't be so disappointed with it, but he hasn't been truly funny in quite a while.  He does good cartoon drawing tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">His forums are nothing more than a place for him to enshrine himself and call witness to those who claim him a god. I wish I was joking about this too :\<br />
<br />
I think furor put it best, this game is best called &quot;Wake the **** Up Quest&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have only been reading this forum on a regular basis for a couple of months (I have stopped by a few times over that last few years but not enough to matter). Of all the class boards I have visited over the years, I think this one has the least whining. Did I miss something?<br />
<br />
I have heard people who play other classes, whining about Shaman being too powerful, but I have rarely heard a shaman whining about being underpowered.<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ since beta (but most of that time I was a cleric, mage, warrior). I have always thought Shaman were a rock solid class. I still think so.<br />
<br />
Just thiniking out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All of you that are bashing Woody are just proving his point.<br />
  Personally I always think he's right on the money with his comics.  After all there is a thread on these boards about Warriors that is 30+ pages long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kindly explain how thinking that Woody is a choad is whining.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Every class has whiners, in some cases valid, in some cases not.<br />
<br />
But the proportion of people playing shamans I'd classify as such is REMARKABLY low right now.<br />
<br />
While I'm not offended by it, I don't quite see the joke as particularly funny because I don't perceive what he's saying, especially in a relative sense.  It's like making a joke referencing France as a huge nation.<br />
<br />
While it's not completely untrue, there are several better examples that could have been selected.</div></div><hr />
