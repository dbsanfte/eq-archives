<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having found my class of choice I have recently dinged 47.  Using these forums and my own experience on a druid I leveled to 46 I just found the giant camp in FV going lt blue to green.  <br />
My question is where to go next.  Key thing being I am a non JBB owner and probably will not see one until I get that lucky roll in Seb some time later in my career.  Places I have found to XP in are as follows<br />
<br />
Dreadlands - I can do much better without a group there - but am more than open to duoing with a ranger or monk.<br />
<br />
City of Mist - Havn't been here without a group yet, but the times I have been here I have gotten outstanding xp with groupmates significantly higher than myself.<br />
<br />
Tenebrous - I like this place - too bad the only place more remote is Stonebrunt<br />
<br />
GD/EW - Excellent zones - but I find the xp getting a little thin in these areas.<br />
<br />
Fironia Vie - I can probably milk the giant camp for another level - but I think it will be a long one<br />
<br />
I don't go for guard killing (I'm still naive enough to think that there is more to EQ than levels and loot) so that puts BB, Steamfront and other light areas out for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am also Level 47 and I have discovered two places where I can get some good experience (I too do not have a JBB):<br />
<br />
The undead in the Hidden Valley of Dreadlands<br />
<br />
Echo caverns (underbulk side).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lake of ill omen, blood gills are greatexp, low hp and blue till about 49ish 50ish.  great exp. average loot.  buy a bunch of fish scales give yourself EB.  the way I normally do it is root one blood gill and kill the the other.  Blood gills will always come in pairs, well most of them too.  there are 12 duo pairs i believ and 1 single spawn somewhere.  if your into duoing u can most likely take all 12 blood gills then</div></div><hr />

46 start to finish plus 6 blue into 47 in two<br />
nights play time.  This is the best place I have ever soloed. Duoing here is faster but soloing here is great xp.<br />

Ack you didnt sale all that acrylia to a vendor did you?....  You can sale it in the bazaar and make 400x what you would to a vendor for that ore.  And smiths will buy those windstones as well for 200pp+ hehehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not to hijack the thread, but is there a guide to tenobrous anywhere that a 39war and 44 shm can use to successfully hunt there?<br />
<br />
where do I go, what do I pull, and where do I set up my camp?<br />
<br />

What's the location of such a valley - and what mob levels can one expect there?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
