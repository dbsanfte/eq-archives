<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the impending release of GoD, do you think prices in the bazaar are likely to increase, or decrease, for existing items?  I'm thinking of pulling the trigger and buying some upgrades.  But I'm not sure if now is the right time.  <br />
<br />
On the one hand, a new expansion always means new gear, and some of it at least will be droppable.  That brand-new gear will probably be really nice and REALLY expensive.  The older stuff that it replaces will probably plummet in price.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, there won't be nearly as many people playing in those old zones once the new expansion comes out.  So the flow of these new items into the economy will be drastically cut.  <br />
<br />
Specifically, I'm wondering about ornate armor.  There are a few pieces I'd like to get for my mage, but I'm wondering if it makes sense to wait until after GoD, or snag them up now.  Ornate gets farmed a lot right now.  But when GoD comes out, a lot of those higher-end folks won't be farming ornate any more.  They'll be in brand-new zones.   <br />
<br />
So what do you think: buy it now or wait till GoD comes out and hope it gets cheaper yet?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sol Ro has room for about one and a half groups, unless you go in the trials.  Really not that many mobs out side of the trials, and the one hourish repop dosent help.  Id think that even after GoDs release there will still be a group or two farming it.  I would wait man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should only buy things when they are cheap enough that you are willing to buy them.  Ask yourself what the price you want to pay is, and then search for that price.  The bazaar always works in cycles between having too many sellers for a given item or too few.  Of course, there are a few exceptions to this with items that drop very frequently.<br />
<br />
The chances of ornate molds &quot;plummeting&quot; in price are pretty slim in any amount of time less than 6 months.  This is my prediction anyway.<br />
<br />
My advice, then, is wait until you see a bunch of people selling the items you want and then wait for someone to lower their price drastically (or negotiate the price you are willing to pay from all the sellers until someone bites).  Of course, always keep a look out for some lone seller selling items at way under the normal going rate :)<br />
<br />
On a related note, whatever armor type berserkers end up being, these types of armors will be available in mass quantities a month or two after the expansion goes live when everyone quits their twink :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If stuff drops commonly in GoD that is better than ornate, or there are other easy ways to get the effects from ornate, then the prices will fall.  Otherwise, it will go up a bit because less people will be farming SRT because they are busy in GoD.  For the most part, though, the economy will be clusterF for a few months - always happens when new expansions come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh all i can say is i remember on the day PoP went live someone was auctioning True Spirit (yes dogdog) for 150k and it sold within about 10 mins of it being put up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ornate chain will jump in price shortly after GoD emerges.  Ornate twinkage for the new Berzerk class will see the market dry up.  Its easier to PL a new twink to 65+aa's than get them into Elemental, LDoN or other armors supperior to Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Better and more plentiful gear = prices dropping on everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Non-Berzerker gear will remain the same.<br />
<br />
Berzerker usable, level dependant gear will go up because people know they can jack up the prices and still move the items.<br />
<br />
Berzerker usable, no-level-req gear will sky-rocket hardcore. The better the item, the higher it will climb. Again, people know twinkers want things badly, and they want them NOW. And that = $$$$<br />
<br />
For the most part I doubt that any new items coming out of GoD, short of items that are easy to get and match or beat Elemental gear, will cause any change in the economy. Items from several expansions ago are still selling for the same price they always have, or even higher after the recent economy dry-up from exploiter bannings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Phroke makes a very valid point...<br />
<br />
The &quot;old world&quot; class gear should drop a little with the new availability of &quot;newer&quot; items, which will be more expensive.<br />
<br />
While Bezerker items will be horribly inflated.</div></div><hr />
