<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, <br />
<br />
I am new to these boards but an oldy ingame. My name is Tallce as you may have seen and I am a level 63 Shaman on Vallon Zek. Anyways less about me and more about the topic. <br />
<br />
I have started to really miss the low level days of Everquest and was thinking of starting an alt on a different server to stop me from twinking him at all. I was wondering if there were a few people that would like to join me :) This wouldnt be a hardcore group that you had to meet everyday to grind out levels and powerlevel to the endgame, but more a group of friends that met up a couple days out of the week and hunted and quested together. If you're at all interested I would gladly give more information if needed, I am pretty open to any server other than Vallon Zek or any other pvp server hehe(i did have Stromm or Morden Rasp in mind though). <br />
<br />
Anyways if you are interested leave a message here or email me at m1k3_73@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from a few of you guys :)<br />
