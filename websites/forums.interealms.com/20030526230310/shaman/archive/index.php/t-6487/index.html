<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking about trying to solo The Great Saprophyte to get my remove cuse spell but I've heard some ugly stories about him.<br />
<br />
Has anyone here soloed him?<br />
<br />
What kind of attacks does he use?<br />
<br />
Any recommended strategies?<br />
<br />
How tough would he be for a 47th shaman with semi-decent equipment and a lot of solo experience?<br />
<br />
Normally I just buy that kind of stuff but at an average price of 7kpp.:rolleyes: on Zebuxoruk I really don't want to dip into my savings that far again for a spell that has limited use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
I soloed him in my mid 50's.<br />
It wasn't that hard.  <br />
<br />
Upper to mid 40's I believe you'd at LEAST need one other (maybe more?) helping you.<br />
<br />
NO reason to pay outrageous amounts of cash for this spell though.  This is an EASY mob to reach, and he isn't that hard.<br />
<br />
Greater Remove Curse is another story.  I don't expect to ever get that one. :(<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i had a hard time soloing this mob the first time cause i didnt think that the mobs near him would aggro since i was 55   well i was wrong i ended up having to gate out heh    just a lil advice  clear out the other people first with ur pet then go for the shroom stay out of the cave unless to cast a spell since he knockback's   cast slow and let ur pet do all the work thats what i do :P  if you want u can cast ebolt / bon   and plauge on him  i dont know if you can get a jbb off before he knockbacks off tho  i havent tested that yet   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helpls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First time i see GREEN con The Great Saprophyte in echo at lv 53, <br />
Slow landed easily, E-bolt resist, Malosi landed, E-bolt still resist<br />
Plaque resisted, than i start click my JBB... BOOM<br />
To my surprise, The Great Saprophyte  summoned me<br />
, AE dd and knock back, than kicking me down with other greens.<br />
<br />
IT'S UNDERCON, PERMAROOTED, AE DD KNOCKBACK, cast wiz DD<br />
<br />
After CR, I get fully selfbuffed with lv 49 pet, i clean all greens around The Great Saprophyte ,  send pet, nuke it down easily while my pet taunt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't try soloing it below level 51. 52+ you'll be ok. Pull the surrounding spawns first, they are on a roughly 1hour 15min timer. Giant mushroom is roughly 2 hour 45min timer. Ice nukes and dog work, poison/disease don't work. I prefer to stand with my back to the far wall (nearest him) in a nook, with my puppy at my side before I sic him.<br />
<br />
Slow, dog, cripple, nuke nuke nuke heal nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo'd him last night at 53.<br />
<br />
Went in with pet, cleared all little boglings, medded to full. Went in, dispelled him, not sure if it helped cause his DS was still there. Slowed him, don't try dot'ing him, won't land. His dd knockback is kinda weird, only happened twice to me, once to dog. Had to heal me and dog once (dog just had haste, i was fully buffed) cause we were both at 1/2 health and he was at like 1/3 so it was more just in case. Dropped gloves, which is nice resist gear, and also spores, which are for some quest. Wouldn't try before 49 for new pet, maybe wait for new slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Great Saph isn't permarooted for one thing and he has been toned down quite a bit with the new resist structure.<br />
<br />
The real key to nailing his azz is just getting the rest of the room clear of cultists and buffing the snot out of you and your pet's attack.  Ice DD's are great on this guy as well and the SoF DoT is too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Racked my brain to remember more about this encounter.<br />
I did clear out the little guys.  I was just messing around in the zone when I ended up with a bunch of them on me.  After clearing them all out, I medded up.<br />
<br />
Sicced dog (hasted and regen'd) on him while slowing, then I think I just nuked him down w/ cold based.  I did get knocked back a few times, but resisted several other attempts.<br />
<br />
This was pre-resist changes though, so no idea how this fight has changed since then.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just though you would like to know,  I got the spell tonight.<br />
<br />
Sappy was a wimp,  wish I had tried him earlier.  Took 4 kills to get the spell.<br />
<br />
My technique was to clear out the cultists.  Alacrity self and Scooby(HoS on self as always).  MR AND CR buffs.  Send Scooby.  Togor's.  Blizzard Blast till he's at one bubble then melee till dead.  Never went below 50% HP.  Went and did the Bogling Cheiftain for good measure.<br />
<br />
Hit 51 (yaaa Mystic Cattywumpus) the same night and got 5 of the six drops from CoM too.  All in all a good day.<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly for all the advice you gave me, it really helped!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guys....<br />
<br />
You're WAY over doing this.... I've killed the shroom more than 20 times (have him timed after server resets) and have received the spell 4 times now.<br />
<br />
He's very easy...<br />
<br />
Invis into the room and move to the right.  There's a spot where the floor plane moves up to the wall.  Sit there... I'll explain why in a minute.<br />
<br />
Summon dog.  Cast alacrity/celerity on dog.  Maybe regrow if you feel spunky.  No other buffs needed.<br />
<br />
Turn and face the saprophyte.  To your immediate right there will be a cultist.   Edge down the 45deg plane (from floor to wall) till you are very close to him.  Pull him with JBB.  Do NOT sic the dog on him as that will agro the second cultist to your left.  JBB and melee the cultist down.  Easy kill - 1K hps roughly.<br />
<br />
Pull the other cultist near you next and kill.<br />
<br />
Pull the cultist from the other side of the entrance and kill.<br />
<br />
Pull the last cultist with JBB.  Shroom won't agro.  Kill last cultist.<br />
<br />
Med and heal if necessary.<br />
<br />
Sic dog on shroom.  Wait for two taunts and then nuke him down with your spell nukes - not JBB.  No need for slow, his melee sucks.  Let the dog taunt twice between each nuke and you won't be summoned.  Dog will live.  You will be at full health and 50mana.... and hopefully you'll loot a new spell.  :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Gah!  Forgot to mention the reason for sitting in that spot... you are just out of reach of the AE nuke of the shroom - and something about that 45 degree plane keeps the cultists from adding... maybe a z-axis 'sploit?  ;)</div></div><hr />
