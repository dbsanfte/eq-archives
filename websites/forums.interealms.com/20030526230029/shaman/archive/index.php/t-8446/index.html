<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This morning I got Canni V :)<br />
<br />
I am thrilled, I am happy, it's taken me three weeks of busting my butt getting nearly 1 aa per night most nights to do it. And that was mostly in FG because I am not flagged for PoV/Storms.<br />
<br />
I only had a few minutes to play with it before I had to run off to work.<br />
<br />
Now I don't have torpor (I do have 70k to buy it, so if anyone from Rodcet is listening, do me a favour and take all my money, 'kay? :))<br />
<br />
So my current method will be Canni V then Kraggs. I have 2640ish hp, so I can Kragg for the full amount of 1950, which means I end up with 25 more hp.<br />
<br />
Now, Canni V takes 1925 hp for 1040 mana, correct?<br />
And Kraggs gives 1950 hp for 400 mana.<br />
<br />
So the end result is 25 more hp and 640 mana for the cycle.<br />
<br />
According to Magelo, I have 3500ish mana. I suspect this is off a bit because I usually have KEI, which adds another 12 wis plus a bigger mana pool bonus. So I'll assume 3600 mana for now.<br />
<br />
This morning I tested wearing KEI, and casting Kraggs from FM takes me down to 90% mana. So no matter how much mana I gain, the most I will get to after this procedure is 90%. That's cool and acceptable.<br />
<br />
I am trying to find the sweet spot - the mana amount where I can go from the lowest amount of mana to get the full 90%. For instance, at 70% I was able to canni/kraggs back to 90%. <br />
<br />
I think it is at 70%, but I wanted to make sure my figures and facts are correct... 3600 - 1040 = 2560 mana is the point where I can go from the lowest amount of mana to FM. This is roughly 71% (I assume I got the last 1% due to KEI and mc3 and 4 points of FT). <br />
<br />
So I can gain 20% of my mana pool back per cycle, or 1 blue bulb of mana... not bad at all! (Provided my health is 1930~ish or higher).<br />
<br />
Do some people bother to do it between ever pool, aka, kill a mob, do a canni V cycle, pull again? Or do you only do it when you are LOM? I think if I did it between every shroom I could maintain a constant 90% mana without any downtime, but the downside is a 12 second delay between every pull... does it make more sense to do it, or to keep up constant pulls and do it once when LOM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your numbers are close, CanniV is actually 1924 hp -&gt; 1066 mana.  C3 is 25 wis and 250 mana, making your mana pool with it around 3800. Anywhere below 72% gives you the full benefit of CanniV.<br />
<br />
As far as when to use it, the best answer is &quot;as soon as it refreshes&quot;. This may not be practical, so settle on &quot;whenever you can do it and live&quot;. The sooner you use it, the sooner it refreshes, and the more mana you get over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Canni4 gives me 40% of my mana approximately.  Pretty much every time it pops up if I'm at 70% mana I torpor myself to put me around 60% then I hit it.  Mid fight, down time, etc.  I almost always group with my wife so have virtue/focus/sta on and sit around 4800 hps.  <br />
<br />
If i had lower hps, I'd use it between every fight I imagine. I find more and more that my sweet spot is to do things every 3 minutes to get me to 60% mana. You're at 80 mana? TOP mob, buff something that's getting close to falling, Nuke, dot. If you have too much mana when canni5 pops up, you're not casting enough.<br />
<br />
Just an opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I kinda feel wierd answering this as my shammy is only 40, but, I havea  60 mage and before modrod nerfs I used to have pretty much teh same problem as you on &quot;when&quot; to use it when soloing/pairing with a healer.<br />
<br />
You are your own healer so soloing is pairing with a healer. Anyways, to answer your question on when to gain excess mana.<br />
<br />
Its all a balance between downtime and effeciency. When I was rodding, that means I wasnt nuking and putting out DPS. However, I would run oom and stop puting out DPS so I'd have to rod.<br />
<br />
Shammy case is a little different because Cani is on a timer. If you are oom when the timer pops its a simple choice. You Cani. If you are half mana and stil lfighting and gobling mana, its easy. You cani. If you are 60-70% and sustaining that rate while fighting, then it gets difficult.<br />
<br />
Its all about DPS if you have &quot;extra&quot; mana. If you dont have extra mana as stated above you are gonna cani anyways so you can slow, ect. If you have plenty of mana, and you can suddenly make more, you will channel that mana into some DPS. The question is what is the best way to do this?<br />
<br />
DPS is damage per SECOND. So you need to figure out how long it takes to use your excess mana nuking (I assume you are gonna nuke and not Dot, as you would have doted with your &quot;Normal&quot; mana, nuke mana is the &quot;extra&quot; fast damage mana). You then need to add in the time to Cani and heal. Take the total damage then divide by that total time and see if it makes sense to do the Cani. Ie, if it adds only 10 dps (not likely) and if you would have just medded and reapplied a dot to do the same or more damage, then its not worth it. However, if it adds a nice 50dps whack then its definately worth it.<br />
<br />
Point is, take a pencil and do some quick back of the envelope math. Think it out for a second, then set some guidelines for yourself.<br />
<br />
I know its not the exact information you were seeking, but its how us mages did it when we were the mana generators. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of the major problems with Can V is that if you're self-buffed, your HP's after Can V will always be low enough to cause low health aggro, which means that landing your CH is gonna be tough.  You can land torpor and lose one tick of it, can V and get out of HP aggro range quickly.  If HP wasn't on the top of your character's list before Can V, it sure will be afterwards!  Spend the same amount of time as you took for clarity3 on ND3, it makes a HUGE difference!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not true if you concentrate your gear on +Hp items. I am far from uber, but can avoid low life aggro with Canni5 while self buffed. I do not have Natural Durability or any of the other aaxp skills that add to Hp either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Luckily in fungal grove, I'm pretty safe. The bugs like me, and I stay out of the path of the shrooms.<br />
<br />
If I were say, soloing in PoN, I'd make sure there wasn't anything nearby before I did it. <br />
<br />
How much hp does ND3 add? <br />
<br />
HP is my #1 priority, that's how I got 2080ish hp unbuffed :) I'm in a mid level guild however we do HoT and try dragons, but we don't do Emperor, Vindi, WToV, etc. So while I am always looking for more hp, most of the big hp items - like a Vindi BP, etc, are out of my reach.</div></div><hr />

Already answered in the other thread but nd3 adds 10% to anything but pure hps buffs (ie aego, focus, brells etc). Any other hps gets the extra 10%, items, sta buffs even food =).<br />
<br />
<br />
If your farming HoT odds are you are pretty close to being able to do vindi especially if you've got a tank with a good amount of aa points.<br />
<br />
A couple quick sugguests on gear. Since you've got your 8th shawl I assume you have descent smithing skill and you've said your on dragon faction so I'd look into the spirit of garzicor quest. It results in the sanctum guardian's earring that I wear. Definitely a nice earring. Also I'd try to buy a pair of dragon hide boots in the bazaar. 19ac 30 hps and 9 sta make for some really nice boots. Loose a little bit of wisdom compaired to your current boots but you seem to have pleanty to spair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i am at 2745 and i never can5 in battle unless im full health , at that point i DONT draw aggro , i think it takes me down to 825ish<br />
 <br />
i always have replenish on so thats 24tick right there and my vindi and my regen AA.<br />
<br />
its very close but i do not draw aggro . now mind you , if something comes along and whacks you for 200-300 , you probly will get it , so you gotta be cool about where you do it.<br />
<br />
anyway , your about right on your 70% figure , thats about the optimal spot , 60-70ish. thats the spot that will allow you to keep on trucking without feeling rushed. i find if i drop lower im hiting can4 to try to make it up<br />
<br />
gratz and be sure to smile on that first can5 to death. i dont know 1 shaman that hasnt done it , self included as of 2 nights ago</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still haven't canned myself to death yet and doubt i ever will. Having lots of hps really helps =)<br />
<br />
Our other guild shaman with cann v on the other hand has canned to death a couple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Harv, i dont have CannV yet, but i do have torpor, and i am never lom unless we get quite a few mobs in camp at once. I would suggest keeping your mana pool up if you can. If you can keep your mana pool at 90% for every pull with little recovery time (10 seconds for the Kraggs cast i assume) then i would do that. Its really situational. Bacially the only time you dont wanna do a Cann5 is when it will take you below the mob frenzy point where mobs dont really care who they are beating on, they just know you are low enough and go straight for ya. Or when that 10 seconds is too much. Thats not to say you couldnt cannV while still fighting the current mob and let your dots work and finish him off while you heal yourself up, thus lowering that 10 second gap to 0 in the best case. <br />
<br />
A guildmate shaman of mine usually ends up cann5'ing every 2-3 pulls or so i think. I havent paid a ton of attention, so dont really know for sure. He has over 4k hp tho, so that really helps ehhe. I'm not far off from cann5, but when i do get it ill be sure to mess around with it and let ya know what i find myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have wondered about this as well.  I do not have Canni5 yet (chose a different route for reasons that I think were good and was very happy with the results) but I will eventually have Canni5 and have not really thought about when I would use it.  <br />
<br />
In a typical fight, I start at FH/FM.  <br />
<br />
Assuming I am soloing, I would pull with slow, then root, then pox, then bane, then e-bolt, then root (again).  That consumes a fair chunk of mana, and a minimal amount of health.  At this point I have a few choices; I could canni4 a few times, start a torpor, and canni4 until my torpor wears off (not like I had any other plans while I sit on my horse waiting for my DOTs to end).  This process usually brings me to full mana and full health again (assuming I do not have to root again or move excessively).   Eventually I have to cast root, bane, and ebolt again which consumes a portion of mana.  Then I have this waiting period again.  Would I be better off healing up to full with a heal like torpor then using canni5 and torporing again or simply repeating my torpor/canni4 cycle?</div></div><hr />
