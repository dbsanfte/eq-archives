GOOD LORD OMG GOOD GOD IN HEAVEN!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
This faction is going to make me pull my hair out. I have been handing in skins, killing in droga and farming the greenies in FM for MONTHS. I mean for a while i did nothign at all but farm droga named and mobs and made a ton of AA but im still freaking scowling.<br />
<br />
<br />
This means so much cause i figured out a viable solution to the thread i made http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20156 where i accidently put a aug in the wrong spot and it made a item no longer wearable ont he hands.<br />
<br />
Long story short the best approach seems to eat the loss in HP aug and upgrade my shoulder and put my rune of judgement back on my hands.<br />
<br />
So question is i guess, is there a better way to get your chardok faction up?  I hear stories floating around that chardom B is better faction then droga or anything else.  Anyone able to confirm?<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm, anyone on MT got some skins and salts they dont want ? lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Factioning sucks =)  It was months when you could AE level 35'ish goblins for days on end.  With the mobs as tough as they are now, it's just absurd.  I've heard chardok b is decent faction, but I've never tried it.  If you're after the cords, unless you've already got the items or MQ's setup for them, figure another few weeks of trying to get the urn (doesn't drop every time) off Drusella.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Took me a few months to max my chardok faction as an Iksar.  I guess it makes it a little easier if you go in with the attitude of this is great for aa exp and dont worry about faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kill korucust 4 times.<br />
<br />
Depends on your starting faction, but after maybe 8 korucust kills, I'm just up to indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i always heard it was like 3k kills to get ally<br />
<br />
only took me a week in (old) drogna to get scowling to ally<br />
<br />
did you try nurga ? just root, epic and they die, dont bother with buffs from pok they will dispell the crap outta ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Went back and checked my points.  6 kills so far and indiff.  I did hunt sarnaks a lot when younger )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Korucust's guards also give nice hits and you could probably do those with just another friend or two. My guess is that they are on a normal twenty minute or so respawn like other mobs in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lit, I recommend you hit Nurga and farm the living hell out of it.  Some of the stuff in there that can be quested would be upgrades for you assuming that magelo is up to date, and the kills are much faster than Droga.  Turn in skins and salts you get from the mobs there.  Dok B trash doesn't seem to be THAT much better for faction, and obviously kills are slower and many of the ghost-type mobs are highly DR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Harwel, go try Nurga. There are lots of dark blues there even at 65. If you want to try something different and know a ranger with the Headshot AA that also needs faction try talking him/her into joining you there. All but the highest level goblins there should be Headshot'able.<br />

Very detailed guide to Nurga here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take some 50'ish freinds to the deeper end of nurga or easier parts of Droga. The mobs die fast, no threat and you get faction while others get very nice xps and maybe some quest drops. Yes you'll hate getting chardok faction if you solo with no other goal. I just got ally, I'm in a family guild with a few mid 50's guys who can't join most of us in 65 adventures or PoP groups. I got faction and some aa xps. They got great xps and fun, even a few loot upgrades via quest stuff there. <br />
<br />
Treat it like a job and you'll hate bud. I've seen your progression on this boards, you burn yourself out. Take a break, get a buddy or a close group to make those boring faction hours a good time, not a dreaded job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I messed around in both nurga (powerlevelling) and fooling around in Droga, and it sure didn't feel like I took that long to hit ally - I even got a fantazillion spare skins/salts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">right on ill check out nurga. I didnt think there would be any upgrades worth questing in there, ill check them all out.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of getting alpha dog and going afk in the tunnel or something in FM too lol<br />
<br />
Dont know if thats worth it. But if i can epic nurga maybe i can just run around droping epic and root and ziping off to the next one. That would be kinda fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thnx for the advice though everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">or you can AFK farm faction in the FM tunnels while you sleep.<br />
<br />
Just find an area where your pet can eat everything and there's not enough mobs to actually kill you.<br />
<br />
Back before the change i did this for a month at the entrance drop in droga.  Just split the 2 mobs about 10 minutes and the roamer is the only wildcard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went from scowl to max ally (on my beastlord who never harmed a sarnak) in the same time a friend of mine went from scowl to...scowl.  So, if you ruined your faction in the past, expect it to be a long hard road.  Epic alone won't be enough in nurga, but epic+pet should get the job done.  If you faction in the goblin caves in FM, pull everything in sight with bane of nife and pet will finish them off (this worked the best for me).<br />
<br />
Good luck with faction though, the quest rewards are still very nice (although not as great as they used to be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Chardok B is a GREAT place to be, particularly if you can convince a friend or two to come with you.  Never even noticed myself going max ally to chardok (though there were some droga and nurga trips mixed in there, for various reasons).  Honestly didn't seem like it took too long.  Walked out with a million spells, a stave of shielding, and http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22628 (very quick and easy to get, considering).  I had a queen kill holding my faction down, as well.  My suspicion is that this faction is very good.</div></div><hr />

Yah, Headshot rules for faction farming.  Luckily my GF has it, so it's as simple as pulling with Turgurs and tank the mob til the Ranger gets a Headshot. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehehe while factioning to get the ring for my Warrior I encountered a Shaman that parked his fat Ogre butt in front of Droga with a Dog. I just picked off everything I could before it agro'd him, and plunked an arrow into whatever did. Finally logged out for the night back near the FM zone. Came back next day and saw his corpse right there in entrance. I'm assuming someone trained him.<br />
<br />
Have you tried the mines in FM where all the old Droga goblins were relocated to? Greenies and easy enough that my Warrior could almost keep up with the spawn time of the whole mine. Also, try and get a hit in if someone is killing Skargus for the second ring. He's a +300 hit from what I have read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I believe it's around 4k faction hits to get from max scowling to ally. Goblins = 1 hit per kill, salts are 1 hit per two salts (if I remember right) and skins are 3 hits per turn in. I think 300 for Skargus is about right as well. Other than that, not sure about Chardok B but I have heard the faction is quicker. Anyway, no matter what way you go about it faction is going to be a pain. Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kill the gobbies outside nurga in a cave over nearby they are mid 30's I believe maybe even lower 40's. They drop  llike flies they drop lots of skins too alot more then drog/nurg I believe. At worst give it a shot for an hour see what you think only annoying thing is the SK and there HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's a boatload of hits to get to Ally. My Monk hunted in Chardok for 25 hours (total not non-stop) to get the Pipe for Monk Epic.  He is now one Drusilla kill and Drusilla drop from the Cords.  Old Droga / Nurga were fantastic as well as an AOE group or two.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the heads up though on the FM caves.  I * thought * the Gobbies in LOIO gave pos Chardok faction. They may be FV and Iksar Warrior. (Troopers of Cabilis).  Been awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Max KOS to max ally in Droga was, uh... About 40 AAs.<br />
<br />
Much cash, too.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Litgruv, could you get into the Sol Ro zone?  I notice you do have an ornate, but don't know if you bought it or not. <br />
<br />
Even forgetting ornate, if you could get there and hope for ornate but meantime try for some of the five little nameds, it could mean huge upgrades for you.  The experience is very good, and you can get great loot too. <br />
<br />
A single group of (well-geared and AA'd) people can kill Xulz, and larger groups can have an easier time of it. Sol ro is absolutely STUFFED with shaman loot; it's like a reward for all the time we spent watching  other classes loot item after item while we were trying to get flagged or help our friends out.<br />
<br />
There are 85 hp shoulders with a nice buff on them that are actually common off Rizlona I guess it is, the bard NPC?  Sorry if I forget names, I haven't done her in ages.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can get, seriously, quite a lot of upgrades out of sol ro zone if you just kill trash for ornate or go and kill some of the small nameds.  Your geat isn't high level, but...with a bit of numbers, you can find that these mobs aren't exactly too high level either.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the quest for the shoulders you are going for is really kinda time consuming and boring, and it seems to me that when 85 HP shoulders are dropping as a common(with nice focus) off mobs in sol ro that are often left up for days (on my server), you might want to check that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just got Elemental Flagged and Sol Ro flagged so now i can. Its sad that all the time i put into the chardok thing is for nothing. but maybe Sol Ro thing is a wise choice.<br />
<br />
I dunno, part of me wants to finish it now, just cause i started it, ya know?  Maybe ill just log in and farm up the FM gobs when i can, i know they drop more skins then Nurga Droga.</div></div><hr />
