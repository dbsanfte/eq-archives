<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, is it me, or does this spell suck major ass?  I tried to use it in the trial of efficiency earlier this week, and 2 casts of radiant cure 3 would invariably remove the AE from the entire party.  Conversely, I had 6 casts of Pure Spirit and it never removed the AE from a single person.  I gave up at that point.<br />
<br />
From the spell description in lucy, it's supposed to remove a detrimental effect.  From the actual spell effect in my experience, it does nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having problems with it?  Is it something else we need to get Rytan to confirm as, &quot;working as intended.&quot;?<br />
<br />
Somehow, if several people actually submit a question, I see him responding, &quot;What?!?  It has a 1 in 4000 chance of removing a detrimental.  What's the problem?  You have canna.  And the mob is slow, so you have lots of time.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure that it ONLY removes detremental effects that do NOT use counters. Soo since you could cure the thing you did with RC then the spell whould have no effect on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Radiant cure, which I'm guessing he's talking about, can cure things without counters. It has poison counters, disease counters, curse counters and a chance to remove detrimental effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EDIT: sorry Foradce, my bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, I know that. My reply was meant for Nox. Of course I could be confused about what Nox was talking about. If so just ignore me altogether, which is actually a good thing to do in most cases ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I first got the spell I was interested in how well it would work.<br />
<br />
Did some tests with it by casting Malos on myself and then using this spell to try to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Back of the book is where it exists now. It's not all that great a spell.<br />
<br />
How many Mob AE's are counterless these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think it's ridiculous that RC3 does remove detrimental (6), but this lvl69 spell does remove detrimental(1).  Will be a long time before I see it, I'm sure, and if not for it being in the way of getting some spells I would actually like to have, I wouldn't care if I ever got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that detrimental (1) removes a detrimental spell from one person in your group (chosen randomly on the case of RC), whereas detrimental (6) did all 6? Since the spell is a single target cure, it wouldnt need to be anything more than detrimental (1). Detrimental (n) only works on NPC spells that dont have counters btw, for those that do you need regular PR/DR/curse cures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">RC is self-group only; PS can be cast on someone outside of group - like the MA - to remove root/snare/slow/malo/tash. <br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chutoi, i've had some pretty good success using it to remove the AE in efficiency trial.  Only once did I have to recast it after the first cast to remove the AE, and that was already after two RC3 already hit.  95% of the other times it removed the AE with no questions asked.<br />
<br />
It's not the greatest, but it's better than waiting for RC3 to refresh itself.  Tried using it a few times in a PG trial on one of the AEs, but I think that it's better in there to just hit people with SS and refresh it before the AE is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, I'm not sure on what the (n) after the remove detrimental means.  Thought it was # of chances to remove a detrimental effect per person, since I'm pretty sure that while at rc1, I had cured things off of more than one person in my group.<br />
<br />
Obviously being able to cast outside of group is a big bonus to the spell, but with it being 1/6 as potent (well, I think so anyway) makes it definitely less attractive.  Besides, I'm usually grouped with my guild's MA, since I play her as well. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm pretty sure the number is how potent the detrimental removal is. For instance, Radiant Cure 1 is never gonna cure something like Terris's AE, but with Resplendant cure (oow version) it has a pretty good chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can you say &quot;situational&quot;?<br />
<br />
As always, it's a number game. The only use of that spell is that, if 3 shamans cast it non-stop, they have a (small) chance of keeping a Main Tank effect free in some fights.<br />
<br />
It has next to no other use. <br />
<br />
For it to be useful, the easy fix would be to make the 'remove detrimental(1)' a base value that is modifed to match the level of RC AA the shaman casting the spell possesses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It utterly and completely sucks.  Totally broken.  Should definitely bring this one to attention of the devs.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to use it to lift the ice mez off people in RS, and it wouldn't even do that... leaving me to wonder what the spell was even for.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">RC is self-group only; PS can be cast on someone outside of group - like the MA - to remove root/snare/slow/malo/tash. <br />
<br />
Right?<br />
&gt;Nope, Slow can be cured through disease counter removal (like Abolish disease) and Tash by poison counter removal (Disenfecting Aura, whatever).  Pure Spirit won't remove those. It might remove Malo, Snare and other nasty stuff that does not have any poison, disease or curse counter. 2 problems I see: First problem is the 'might remove nasty effect'. It doesn't do that on every cast, you just get a chance that it works. Second problem: I didn't get any message yet if it removed a bad effect. I always had to wait for feedback from the people I tried to cure.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

With you here, was all happy when I seen we were getting this spell, then the final version came. Its junk. Tends to make me wonder why we cant outcure the priests, there was a time when shms were the cure kings. Was sorta the bargin we got for the dot knowledge + weaker heals.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to see us get a viable, useable group version of this spell.  The current version of the spell needs to be deleted or changed. Its worthless as it stands.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We were cure kings before Rytan the Asslord got a hold of us.  Abolish poison?  Deleted and went to clerics (after all, clerics use poison spells a lot more than shaman).  AA to remove detrimental effects?  Cleric. (purify soul or whatever it was--not the RC3).<br />
<br />
Level 70 spell that's the equivalent of using RC1 . . . that's for shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm struggling to find out just what this spell does.<br />
I want a spell that removes nasty effects on raids, whish is something I find myself being asked to do more and more. <br />
<br />
What exactly does this spell do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kumoe, this spell has a chance to remove detrimental effects.  As near as we can tell, it has the same chance as a single cast of RC1.  RC1 has 1 chance (not sure of percentage, but it's not huge) to remove a detrimental.  RC2 has 3 chances.  RC3 has 6 chances to remove a detrimental (if memory serves).<br />
<br />
Basically, this spell is crap, imo.  I've cast it 6 times during a fight, and gotten no result.  Was I unlucky?  Maybe.  I think it's more a case of the spell not being worth memorizing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm struggling to find out just what this spell does.<br />
<br />
That is a pretty good summary of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's still better to have something that has a chance to remove a detrimental effect with a small recast timer, than having to wait 2 min for RC to refresh to chance that you might be able to remove it (for instance, it taking four casts of RC3 to remove malos..which is 10 min, or use 4 casts of Pure spirit to remove and you've only spent under a minute to do it.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I always assumed it was an upgrade to Blood of Nadox, but after checking Lucy I was extremely disappointed. <br />
<br />
One of my more useful roles on a raid has been diminished by the Mudflation effect (higher poison/disease counters to contend with). <br />
<br />
Paladins get a single spell at level 67 with nearly double the effectiveness of Nadox (Crusader's Purity -  removes 32 poison/disease and 16 curse counters vs. Nadox 16 poison/disease for the group) <br />
Wouldn't Pure Spirit have been better being an upgrade to Nadox, or am I underestimating the power of the spell? From what I have read above, its barely effective. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Crusaders purity is target type single, nadox is group, HUGE difference there.  nadox is still more powerful since in 2 casts we can cure the group of 36 poison and disease counters vs a pally needing 6 casts to cure 32 of each, though they do get curse counters in theirs....</div></div><hr />

Used Pure Spirit last night to remove the effect off the mobs right before Arbitor (backflagging is soooo much fun). It worked every time, I might have been lucky though. Curing a whole raid is nearly impossible though.<br />

Dont get me wrong, I think its great you found an encounter that the spell is useful on. BUT, it's the counter issue that is the real problem. <br />
<br />
Ironic a lvl 69 spell works in one encounter 2 yrs old but on nothing more recent b/c of the counters on the detrimental effects included in the majority of the game material since.<br />
<br />
I just havent figured out if the spell wasnt finished or if its Soe's sense of humor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You don't use it to cure diseases.<br />
You don't use it to cure poisons.<br />
You don't use it to cure curses.<br />
You don't use it to cure anything with counters.<br />
You use it to cure things that can't be cured.<br />
Examples of this are maloXXX, snare, boil blood line, cripple, any pretty much any type of spell effect that you might dispel to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Some spell effects don't get removed with RC.<br />
Some seem more resistant than others.<br />
The &quot;remove detrimental (X)&quot; indicates how many attempts the spell effect has to remove the debuff.<br />
RC1 will get rid of malo, but not all the time.<br />
RC3 almost always gets rid of malo due to the 6 chances it has.<br />
This isn't going to cure an entire raid of a detrimental spell.<br />
What it should do is allow you to dispel bad effects on your main tank on hard targets (like 90% slows?)<br />
It will also let you get rid of annoying things like malo, when you've used RC and it didn't work on everyone, or you don't have anything more than RC1.</div></div><hr />
