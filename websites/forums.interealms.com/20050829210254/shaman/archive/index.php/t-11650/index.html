Help Sunmoon! Fix my LB before he posts as me or something equally disconcerting. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I fixed Krup.. the account is theree, just PW's got reset... going after millman and LB now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm nto sure if it was the board or not.. Millman, you had something at yahoo.com in there as your email. I set it to your one you've been using and emailed your PW. Litchebane has &quot;ask@me.net&quot; in there, so I can't send them an email. Have them email me a good email address and I'll send the PW with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed that the old board wasn't case sensitive for usernames but the new one is.<br />
<br />
For example I used to be able to log in as &quot;grippa&quot; but now I have to type &quot;Grippa&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LB2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What's your email address Sunmoon? I am having a hell of a time finding it and this board won't let me email you. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Use a PM to contact him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess I had an account from home as well as from work. One I used more was from home.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sunmoon rules, woot.<br />
<br />
Weird, tried both my yahoo and my other one while trying to reset and both were invalid.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again, you are the big reason this board has done so well.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Twice I have asked for an update to be sent to my email (no, it will not update to my email at work.  that is not the address I used to register back when)  each time the email to me has timed out before I got home and clicked the link.<br />
<br />
so - can I get someone to call me at work at remind me to do this before I leave?  or something?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for all your help Sunmoon - I know how much it sucks to get things started back up again.  Add to that a few whiney old heads (like me) that never updated our personal info (like me) and had our passwords mailed to an email account from a company we sold 3 years ago (like me) that no longer exists.<br />
<br />
It's good to be Krup again!<br />
