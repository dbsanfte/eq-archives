<br />
I've been sorta wondering about agility since the flag charms came out... they made them custom with the most important stats for each class.  Clerics got AGI which I thought really odd considering I'm always looking for DEX for my hammer proc.  It made me start wondering if there is something about agility we don't know or if they were just picking random stats.  <br />
<br />
I just checked and beastlord +15, cleric +10,  druid +15, enchanter +10, magician +15, monk +15, ranger +15, rogue +10, shadowknight +10, shaman +15, warrior +10, wizard +15 which leaves only bard, necromancer and paladin without agility on the class charm.<br />
<br />
Agility is showing up on a LOT of nice items lately and I really wonder why...</div></div><hr />

You will probably get requests for Agility buffs from people who either (1) are wearing Crafted armor, (2) have a twink in Crafted armor, or (3) would still be in Crafted armor if not for guild hand-me-downs.  <br />

It might increase avoidance by a small amount as seen from this test. Have to do some more testing though to make certain that this is for real.<br />

<br />
In any case you have TWO variables in your runs...less ac AND less agi, and more ac AND more agi.  If you want to prove something you need to eliminate one of your variables (or minimize as much as possible).<br />
<br />
And maybe agi does help when you have the defensive aa's trained..but i think a good majority of the people who have maxed these already are close to agi caps without buffs.<br />
<br />
My opinion on the matter is if you have to parse it to figure out the small gain..its probably not worth it in most situations.</div></div><hr />

Well, being a Shaman I was able to quickly fix this situation with an agility buff.  Behold, I was able to move again.  To a degree, I believe it does have an effect on movement.  The lower the stat, the slower I moved. The increase countered the movement lag to a small degree, but not entirely.<br />

<br />
There is a penalty for low agi on movement (maybe just for encumberance)  Could test this by making a troll i think is under the agi &quot;penalty line&quot; and putting a fungi on him..then try walking around then take off the fungi.  There is no movement bonus for high agi.  You also could have moved faster if you buffed your str.  So does str make you run faster too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye,<br />
Agreed, no movement bonus for high agility &lt;sigh&gt;.<br />
<br />
Yes, Strength affects ability to carry the weight without being encumbered, but no, in general doesn't affect movement.  Just the increase in agility from '0' allowed movement.<br />
<br />
Agility was the only attribute I noted was affected by the increase in weight and decreased as weight was added.   The others, such as Dex may have been reduced, but my attention was drawn to the red number in agility.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would drop a line or two regarding this, to show another reason for the Agility buff in certain situations &lt;grin&gt;  hehe<br />

Buff/spell slots are simply too valuable to mess with this crap and I dont see people sacrificing hitpoints or attack to get a few AC points.<br />
<br />
Proving a relationship between agility and mitigation is a daunting task and would involve isolating LR, CA, agi, AC, and any other possible factors across multiple players.  After you do that, you would need to provide a consistent test environment and run several series of tests for comparison.  Outside of a simulator, I don't see this as a possibility inside of normal EQ.  The only RELIABLE and VALID result you will ever get is the visible bump in AC which is pathetic at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is you cannot make your assumption because it inherently flaws your test.  If you want to prove item ac doesnt do anything than you have to run a test with less ac but same other stats, and then with more ac and same other stats.  And when i say same other stats, you need to be close not exactly the same...so like -20 to +20 stats i could see being pretty close.  Dont run a test where we all know AC helps mitigate hits and in one test have low ac AND low agi then another test with high ac and high agi and say that because your agi was high means you mitigated more hits.  In your parses you could have had low ac and low charisma then run the test with high ac and high charisma, and i bet you would come to the same conclusion--charisma helps damage avoidance.  But would your theory and subsequent testing be valid? No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">0-6 ac from a 60 agi buff? You're full of it.<br />
<br />
And no, most level 60+ do -not- have an unbuffed agility higher than 245. Possibly in elemental guilds, however that is a small fraction of the 60+ population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually AGI has one other verified effect besides the minor AC bonus -- it helps defensive skills rise faster.<br />
<br />
Of course by 60+ that had darn well better be a moot point, but it's still there.<br />
<br />
Personally, I cast it.  Why not.  It's a group buff, it lasts for over an hour, I'm not having any sort of mana issues, and if people don't want it, they can click it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Where did that 0-6 number come from?  Stat maxing?  My AGI is far from maxed, I get around 15 AC from Wrulan.  My warrior wife gets more, I think, not sure though.  15 AC is worth a cast every 72 minutes, especially when I link it to STA and can refresh both at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;I bet you would come to the same conclusion&quot;. No, I would certainly not come to the same conclusion. Charisma has never been shown to affect avoidance anywere. So if it showed a difference in avoidance, I would certainly make more tests, if they proved to be same result, I would have to keep AC and all other stats stable. Please refrain from using such insulting statements. I havent said its proof anywhere that agility makes you avoid more, just pointed on it as a possibility. And yes, it needs more data and yes, as you have stated it should be tested with similar AC values to be sure.<br />
<br />
Those parses I made were not to check out avoidance, it was to check mitigation. Also, I would have a hard time getting very low on agility(mean really low) while at same time keeping same AC. Will see what I can do though.<br />

Stat buffs have been debated since this board's inception, and not a single study has been done to prove they are real effective, even the great old Tudamorf couldn't prove it.<br />

I cast AGI when asked, 'cause it's not worth the lengthy discussion involved with it.  I casted wrulan on my 65 enchanter friend and he got 6 AC.  6 AC means nothing; once I showed him this, he stopped asking for it.  Aren't there soft and hard caps on AC?  Don't quote me here, but I think someone did a parse a while ago here and showed very little difference between 1000 and 1300 AC for shaman.  I don't hate casting any buffs (well maybe haste), but until SOE gives us more than 15 buff slots or changes AGI to really mean something, I just can't see wasting a slot with AGI.<br />

Yeah, so my subjects have some gear, but even if a cast of Agi was getting them 15-30AC I still could not see the justification in casting it because of limited buff slots. Whether AC is even a point of concern after a given value is debatable and has been discussed before.  If it came down to taking 100AC or 100hp I think I would go with the latter for it's obvious benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Certon the Dreamwarden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have an idea.  Get someones AGI reduced to 0 but load them up with the highest AC items you can find without +AGI on them.  Have them stand against MOB A for 1000 attacks.  Then have that same person wear all +AGI items and have +AGI buffs cast on them but have NO AC items and have them stand against MOB A for 1000 attacks.  Compare the results, and you will have seen the difference between PURE avoidance and PURE mitigation.<br />

Once your agi drops below 75 you start taking big hits to the displayed AC number.  If I was gonna do it I would start the test with 1agi, then when its time to do the 305 agi part, take off gear until you get the same displayed ac as you had with 1agi.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I dunno if you think my gear is good or not, but I am not in the elemental planes for sure and wrulan gives me like a total of 5ac... I use Bramblecoat (off JB BP) when I have the buff slot room and it gives much more AC than wrulan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Just from experience from myself and some fellow guildmates.<br />
<br />
When I buff up AGI close to max stat, I get hit a LOT less than when I don't cast. Unbuffed, my agi is normally around 150.<br />
<br />
A former guildmate cleric invested a lot of AAs into AGI, including Innate, Combat Agility, etc, very early on (along with HA, SCM, etc cleric required AAs), and barely gets hit. His AGI has been upped to Planer Power and maxed out. Doesn't matter if he gets summoned by healing aggro, etc. The elf just does NOT get hit (or at least as hard or as often as same level clerics with low AGI in the same guild).<br />
<br />
Another guildmate (SK) used to die a lot (in her high-40s-high 50s, solo-ing or duo-ing). She had high AC, a lot of HP, and okay DEX. In talking with her, she decided to get some DEX and AGI gear as an experiment, forsaking some HP/AC for both AGI and DEX. (Don't know the exact numbers).<br />
<br />
The one thing we noticed is that when she swapped out equipment is that 1) she started hitting a lot more 2) got hit a LOT less and 3) didn't die so damn often.<br />
<br />
Again, these aren't hard core &quot;evidence&quot; to the need for AGI, but I'm planning on upping my own AGI stats by quite a bit, and my mates are firm believers in AGI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors have parsed AC tests up to ~2200 AC(as memory serves), and found that even at that point, AC does have an effect.  I believe that most(if not all, will have to look it up again to be sure, maybe later) that gain was from mitigation, and not avoidance.  But the improtant point is, there no longer is a hard cap for AC(at least that we have found).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I read that warr post and the AC test was flawed because they could not control for the inherant stats on armor etc that were used during the test.  Until you remove all the variables except the one you are looking for it is impossible to draw conclusions.  Some Agi-free items with the same AC can even give differing numeric values when equipped so there may be something beyond what is visible that influences damage taken etc.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, it happened to me once.  My guild was raiding Lodi, and a druid made fun of me for giving him an agi buff.  He called me a n00b and explained that druids are priests, not melee.
