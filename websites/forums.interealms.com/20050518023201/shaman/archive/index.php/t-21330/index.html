<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate to add to the posts of late but I am worried that perhaps with the new content coming out that they will not change much about our class...think about if the raise the lvl limits they will likely raise stats which will look like a fix as far as our FoS complaints and such. I might just be paranoid from reading all these other posts. Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess, is that we will get a better heal and/or an upgrade to Focus (HP wise).  Other than that, I would expect BLs to get even closer to us in buff power :(  I haven't heard anything about raising the stat cap, but you never know with SOE.  We will probably see the unveiling of the END regen buff too.  Will probably goto BLs :p<br />

<br />
BLs outbuff Shamans now. Dunno about you, but about the best I can do for most of the people I play with is +500some XPs and +140some attack. BLs can ALMOST match that, and add in nice things like mana regen, a nice MGBable mana-hp regen, Ferocity.<br />
<br />
BLs outbuff us now.<br />
<br />
EDIT: just saw this on another thread:<br />
<br />
Focus of Soul: 544 HPs<br />
Talisman of Kragg + Spiritual Vigor: 620 HPs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AngborHT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, that may be fine for single groups, but all BST HP buffs are single target (with the exception of SV).  So you can't MGB them.  And it takes forever to single buff each party member with Kragg, IoS, Sta, STR, DEX etc.  And, they don't last as long as FOS.<br />
<br />
Plus, with the BST buffs you gotta cast STR and DEX, plus Kragg, IoS etc, so it takes up many more buff slots than the Shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 shaman and a 65 bst and enjoy both.  It is much easier, and faster, to buff groups/raids with the shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, um, I am not trying to sound elitiest here, but most of my friends/guildmates are maxxed in STR and STA. Dex may be a possibility for procs, but I really don't see anyone asking for it.<br />
<br />
Lets assume an average group of a mid-range EP guild, like mine (2 gods down, 2 to go):<br />
<br />
2 Tanks - max STR, STA from gear, maybe short a few DEX and AGI<br />
1 Healer - max STA and WIS from gear<br />
2 Casters - max STA and INT from gear<br />
<br />
Now, which set of buffs do you want? Ferocity is as much +attack as FA, we have already established BLs have more pure HPs. Lets see whats left, shall we?<br />
<br />
Shaman add . . . um nothing more. Well, thats not true, they add Malos. <br />
BLs add SD, and Paragon. <br />
<br />
YOU make the call!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AngborHT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not saying that BST are not great single group buffers.  My point is that it is much easier, faster and more efficient for a shaman to buff a raid.<br />
<br />
If you look at the stats that are buffed along with FOS, and not just the Hitpoints gained, then it takes many more BST buffs to equal FOS. <br />
<br />
True, that most of the players in an Elemental or Time+ capable guild have maxxed stats.  But if you ever join a pickup LDON group, you will run into players not so well equipped, and the additional stat buffs may help them.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I have a 65 Shaman (200+ aa) and a 65 Beastlord (36aa) and both are very fun, very powerful classes to play.  They both have their strengths and weaknesses, but overall both classes are very strong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all BST HP buffs are single target (with the exception of SV<br />
<br />
Actually... that's not true.<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Live<br />
They have a group str/dex/sta buff, plus the group hp/atk buff, group mana/health regen.  So they'll have to single-target Kragg every hour and a half (with focus).  Of course, the spell linked above IS a GoD spell, but OH YEAH, BST is a tremendous asset to a GoD group.  So they shouldn't really have too much of an issue getting it.<br />
<br />
I'd be really surprised if every EP guild didn't have at least 2 65 shaman buff bots on every raid, so I don't think it'll ever fall on a beastlord to buff a raid with Kragg.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
Fero adds 10 atk and 65 to all saves over FA - that buff hands down blows FA out of the water.  It's not &quot;as good&quot; and it's not &quot;close&quot; -- it's just a whole lot better, no doubt about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You've alluded to it already, but what worries me? <br />
<br />
Spells.<br />
<br />
Something new? Something blue? Something borrowed? &lt;== THAT'S a possibility.<br />
<br />
I mean there are FIVE levels of spells to fill up. That requires a level of thought, attention to detail and inspiration that quite frankly I have seen little to NONE of recently from Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont really see the point.  Nobody except maybe beastlords uses Vigor.  The pally HP buff is 330 and does not stack with vigor.  Vigor stacks with Focus so I just see it as another complentary buff.  I think beastlords have gotton way to many of our spells for being sort of a shaman-lite.  But ive never been in a group or a raid with beastlords that someone wanted the beastlord to buff over me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to admit that I am nervous about the new spells as well Faern. I feel somewhat spoiled having all the group spells.... I get nervous that the new spells will include an upgrade to Focus - say an additional 500hp or something. God help us if that is a level 66 spell and the group version is like level 70 or something.<br />
<br />
That could stretch the shaman on a raid buff......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frankly, until there's reason to choose a shaman instead of a beastlord or chanter for anything outside raiding, I seem to be losing interest.  Personally, the fun for me has always been in seeing what a group can do; I already know what a raid does.  If my only purpose is raid or solo, the game has no fun in it for me.<br />
<br />
Until they make it so it's not the case that there's no reason to use a shaman unless there are absolutely no beastlords or chanters arround, I think I'm on my way out.<br />
<br />
So raiding fixes might be nice enough, but they're very far from the whole game and could easily be functionally irrelevant to the entire portion of the game that exists outside of raids.</div></div><hr />

      I am worried about our raid contribution as well as our group contribution.  Let me explain some of the problems I am running into.<br />
<br />
I recently left my guild due to timezone issues.  The guild was on Australian time which was great while I was stationed in Korea, but with my move to the states I lost the ability to raid with them.  They just recently became an Elemental guild, so my thoughts are to find another guild working on similar content.  This is where I am hitting my glass ceiling.  The Elemental/Time guilds are either 1. Not accepting shaman applications or 2. will accept only it PoFire/Time Flagged w/ 250-300+ aa's.  They basically want a shaman that is more specialized that what they already have.  Now, I understand this, but that's a lot of groundwork that isn't necessarily feasible.  If I am already PoFire/Time flagged then it is very likely that I am already guilded/soon-to-be guilded with the guild that got me flagged.   Most of these guilds are running with 4-6 active shamans in their guilds.  The guilds that are carrying 6 were the ones that went through Luclin, and shamans are still hanging around.<br />
     So, my options for Elemental/Time guilds are slim, so I look towards Sol Ro/VT guilds- guess where all of the shamans are at?  These guilds are running with 6-12 active shamans.  They absolutely do not need anymore on their raids, so applications are closed.  <br />
     So, my final option is to find an epic/NToV guild.  These guilds are far behind in the power curve- I already have my epic and the likelyhood that I will want anything that drops is slim.  That's a lot of months raiding with nothing to show for it.  Our guild choices are slim, and progression for a shaman is slowly becoming obsolete.  You only need 2 shamans on a raid currently in a high end guild.   One to slow the named and the other to pick up slows if the first is taken out by aggro from an early slow- thats it.  Mana for buffs is not an issue- the only buff needed is Fo7 and possible STA, and if adds are not outright slaughtered then it is easier to mez/offtank than slow.  Some people may disagree, but guilds are pushing more for efficiency than numbers.  The loot tables are smaller now than they were in Kunark/Velious, so guilds are looking to equip less people so they can move faster through content.  If you can take a named down with 50, why bring 72?</div></div><hr />

I was faced with the same dilemna recently - I enjoyed playing a shaman, had seen virtually everything I could see as a hard core non-raid-guild player, and wanted to see more of the game.  This was at level 65 with about 85 AAs.<br />
<br />
Like you, I did some research, though I started a little lower - I wanted to look for guilds that were pushing into elementals, then I went down a notch and down another notch to the &quot;doing NToV&quot; crowd.<br />
<br />
Basically, I looked at application openings (are apps even open?  how many shaman do they need?  what are the requirements?) and compared those to what I personally could provide.<br />
<br />
Then I switched mains to a bard.</div></div><hr />

     Haha, that is what worries me- having to switch to another class.  Switching classes is something that I will absolutely not do.  I had a 57 druid on the FV server at the time that PoP came out, and I switched to a shaman on the Brell server to play with my friends and to get away from the trivial loot code.  FV had been flooded with druids early on after all the melees rerolled due to lack of group options in the mid-30's (aka. not enough healers in-game at the time)  Since moving to Brell, my shaman has achieved 65 and has broken 200 aa's.  I also managed to get myself Sol Ro flagged over about a 9 month period of guild/indy raids.  I have way too much time invested in him to reroll.  I played catch-up once and it was a major time-sink; I will not do it again.</div></div><hr />
