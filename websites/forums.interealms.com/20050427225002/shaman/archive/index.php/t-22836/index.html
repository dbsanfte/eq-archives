<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My places are kinda dried up a lil so if you could send me a e-mail with any tips ato iccanui@gmail.com  or just post them here, i would appreciate it. I wanna twink up my SK some more and myself ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Inner Acrylia is good. Just outside the Jails you can set up there and be in a spot where you have a chance of 3 different named spawning. High Pirest is a roamer, Archanist is in the room with the pot (his PH is on the Pot actually) and then you have the Arch Sage (or Mage... something like that) that spawns in the jail room between both cells. <br />
<br />
Their loot still sells for 3-10k or so each. Lots of Acrylia ore drops and the runes sell for a nice bundle. <br />
<br />
High priest can also drop a Regen mask that I believe a SK can wear. No level requirment or recommendation either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ogulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think doing Sewer's in CT drops flowing slime boots averagly selling       80-100k really easy camp with torpor/quince <br />
<br />
just invis down and use pet to pull from water send pet in on mobthen back off realy quick just tank it slowed with torpor/quince after you split the camp is really easy but really boring somtimes.. u get the boots somtimes really common 1 time took 12 hours to get 1 pair next took    4-5 hours to get 2 pair so expect to be random<br />
<br />
AA Xp is about 1-2% a kill fair doesnt have many hp at all<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GL with ur cash idea's<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Note: can always open a casino if u want :D good money there ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If Exp isn't a concern the Geonid caves in WL are pretty good.  Nearly every Geonid drops a gem or jewelry of some sort.<br />
<br />
LB, occasional green with DB (L58) named.  Not a ton of HP, but not a small amount either.  Bring your Bane / Anathema spells out here, as nothing else will stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Currently I'm a big fan of PoHate for cash farming.  It's a quiet zone the zone-in mobs aren't difficult and drop cash, gems and planar armor for the turn-in.  Mob placement is spaced out that you have to put effort to get more than 1 at a time (with few exceptions).  For me it's nice low risk and relaxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best cash I've seen so far for pre-SolRo farming is:<br />
<br />
Droga - Plenty of posts on it<br />
IA - Plenty of posts on it<br />
ChardokB - ZI mobs can be single pulled and root rotted (VP isn't so good).  There are 2 spawns of &quot;a rabid chokadi&quot; that are near ZI.  Their rare earring (the one with see invis) will go for 10k.  The ones further back drop some nicer equipment, including an 80-100k FT2 necklace.<br />
Nurga - Easier than Droga but less in PP and bazaar items.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like Droga.  The king spawn doesnt seem to rare and drops the Copper Hammer of Striking as his common.  Got him 3 times one night while sitting out on a GoD raid.  Maybe I was just lucky.</div></div><hr />
