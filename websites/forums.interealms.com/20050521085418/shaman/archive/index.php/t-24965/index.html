Your mana is a little less than mine, but you have more HPs...id say its a wash overall. <br />

Dasha, your power is mostly influenced (as a shaman) by your Wisdom.  Increase your wisdom and you'll have more power. <br />

I haven't bought any armor yet, am actually missing two slots still, and have a few other slots as newbie footman pieces. :)  I have done a lot of quests though and gotten a couple drops from named or rare normal mobs.  I value wisdom and power because mana regens so fast out of the fight and slowly during, that it helps a lot to have a large pool to draw from during the fight.<br />
<br />
Nice gear btw :)</div></div><hr />

Hehe, i seem to remember never to run out of mana, unless being the only shammy on a VT run, Canni was the WIN.<br />
Looking forward to see how its turning out for the sequel  :D <br />

I'm new here, first post!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My fiancee and I are actually accumulating a good amount of money now so we might just buy a few upgrades, yay!  What a blast it was to actually count up 1GP between the two of us lol.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to do scholar combines though and it looks like that could get expensive, we'll see.<br />
<br />
Have any of you ventured to other continents yet?  As soon as we can get a good chunk of playtime we want to try to get through Thundering Steppes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thundering Steppes is awfully challenging.  The mobs at the ZI are level 20 - 24.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Stormhold instead?  Gnollslayer Highlands also good exp for me at 17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gnollslayer Highlands?  Where's that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its an area in Antonica . . . if you take the griffin out to &quot;Steppes Station&quot; you should see a small keep right as you are landing, kinda off to the leftish.  That's &quot;Gnollslayer Keep&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rotstuffed Scarecrows, Giant Bears . . . lots of good stuff out there.  These are white con and up for me at L17, though many are marked as solo encounters which means that unless its red, I can probably take it.  Do beware (as always) of Group designated mobs.</div></div><hr />

Ahh yes, out by that station!  That's where our first griffin ride took us :)  Talk about cool!  We were duoing oranges out there a few levels ago, great area if you pull to the scarecrows since mobs didn't seem to wander through the plowed lots.</div></div><hr />
