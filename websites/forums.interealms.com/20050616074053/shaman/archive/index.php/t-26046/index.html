These days, Europe reminds me of an elderly aunt who hides her last pieces of jewelry with shaking hands when she notices a robber has broken into a neighbor’s house. Europe, thy name is cowardice. <br />

Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Like I posted in the NY Times thread yesterday, the world is catching on that President Bush was right and his vision for the Middle East is carrying the day.  As Mill's link shows, even Europeans are acknowledging that &quot;Bush was right.&quot;  Der Spiegel ran a whole article comparing President Bush's policies to President Reagan -- and how they were both successful despite all the handwringing and naysaying from the Left and the Europeans.<br />
<br />
More European's attributing credit to President Bush:<br />
<br />
Democracy Dawns in the Middle East (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,251-1508354,00.html) from the Times in London.<br />
<br />
Europe Decides That Bush May Be Right After All (http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006342) <br />
<br />
President Bush is winning the war in Iraq, he's winning the war of ideas, and he's winning public opinion.<br />
<br />
Pretty good for a bumbler, stumbler, foot-in-the-mouth hick from Texas who can barely read &quot;My Pet Goat&quot;, dontchya think?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  So far, all the predictions could not have been more wrong.  &quot;It will turn into Vietnam, only ten times worse!&quot;  Wrong.  &quot;The war will be a bloodbath!&quot;  Wrong.  &quot;The occupation will fail!&quot;  Wrong again.  &quot;It's too soon to hold elections, it'll never work!&quot;  Bzzzzt.  Wrong again.<br />
<br />
EDIT #2:  Fortunately, the importance of it all is not lost on everyone.<br />
<br />
We never thought we were going to have an election in our lives,&quot; Al-Aliat said. &quot;I'm happy and nervous at the same time. I'm afraid somebody is going to play a game. We believe we're going to have a better future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ayad Al-Hussaini of Everett, who joined his father, two brothers and a brother-in-law in another van, is making the journey with memories of the Iraq he left as an 8-year-old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Violence. Killing. Being afraid of saying the wrong thing to the wrong people,&quot; said Al-Hussaini, 24. <br />
<br />
&quot;My two uncles from my mom's side are dead. They wanted to say whatever they wanted to say and got killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're doing this for our country. So many people are dying now. When we have the government in place, all violence is going to stop, hopefully. That's exactly why we're doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Al-Hussaini and Al-Emara said the support of the United States in Iraq is another motivation to vote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what the U.S. is doing for our country,&quot; Al-Hussaini said. &quot;I feel I want to do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Iraqis are thankful for what President Bush has done, Al-Emara said. &quot;It's great. I think he's going to get a blessing from God.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, you're welcome.</div></div><hr />

Yes - it's all over.  Time to bring the boys home, we fixed Iraq.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I believe your statements might be more accurate if they took on an air of: &quot;In spite of repeated incompetence and bad decisions by the current administration, the US Forces in Iraq have managed, through ingenuity and guts, to make modest yet steady gains against the opposition.&quot;<br />
<br />
How soon we all seem to forget our history lessons.  At the 2-year point, Johnson appeared to have Vietnam all under control too with his successful (yet unrepresentative) elections.  Oops!</div></div><hr />

Use the search feature on this board, new guy, and you'll find them. In short, my doctrine would be to finish one campaign before starting another - like the military leadership advised Rumsfeld in 2002.  We're still putzing around in the mountains of Afghanistan (the forgotten war now) looking for the core of al Qaeda with insufficient forces while we simultaneously struggle to maintain order in al Qaeda's new recuiting grounds (new since we invaded).</div></div><hr />

So, should we have totally ignored Germany while we defeated Japan during WW2?<br />
<br />
Afganistan is not a forgotten war, it is a war that is over for the most part.  Additionally, what is sufficient force there?  Should we have brought in the 10th Armored Division?  Should we have put 100,000 infantry on the ground in Afganistan?</div></div><hr />

The number the JCS wanted to keep in Afghanistan fell near the middle of what they were ultimately left with and your seemingly uninformed number of 100,000 (including armor).  They had to revise it downward significantly to meet Iraq requirements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nothing you posted changes the facts on the ground.  <br />
<br />
We're winning.  We're not only winning militarily, we're winning culturally and it's creating a rippling effect of hope and freedom.  Just as quoted earlier, the Arab Berlin Wall has fallen.  The vast majority of Iraqis are overjoyed to participate in representative government, as evidenced by the massive voter turnout, undeterred by impotent threats of election day violence.  Libya stands down.  Demonstrations and protests against Syrian control are breaking out in Lebanon -- they're demanding their freedom as well.  If Baghdad can be free, shouldn't Beirut be just as free?  Riyadh?  Jericho?  The Israelis and the Palestinians are on the verge of meaningful peace, with Israel withdrawing and Palestine abating its campaign of violence and terror.<br />
<br />
And people in Iraq are teary-eyed with joy in finally being freed from the Butcher of Baghdad.<br />
<br />
And it all came about because of the vision, leadership and policies of President Bush.<br />
<br />
Is it completely over?  Of course not.  But President Bush will go down in history as being a man who changed the world by finally bringing peace to the Middle East.  <br />
<br />
Even the Europeans are begrudgingly acknowledging that yes, Presidendt Bush was right -- and they were wrong.  As the German author above posts:  Europe, they name is cowardice. <br />
<br />
You can deny, begrudge, diminish, discount or hedge the American success till the cows come home.  But the bottom line:  Iraq is free, and the Middle East is changing, and everyone in the world knows that America was the agent of that change.<br />
<br />

That was a situation where the US was in a state of total war.  The current US military is not prepared for total war.  <br />
<br />
I'm seeing all these declarations of victory in the battle to bring democracy to the Middle East.  We have to make sure we keep our eyes on the goal.  I can't help but picture Bush standing on the aircraft carrier in his flight suit, and wonder if we aren't getting a little bit cocky.  <br />
<br />
The middle east has had fits and starts of democracy for about 50 years.  There have been lots of elections that were later overturned by undemocratic forces.  Let's not jinx things by patting ourselves on the back too much just yet.<br />

I think Krup was protesting at being labelled a &quot;liberal.&quot;  There are certain people that post here that use the word liberal as an insult.  Others use the term &quot;psychopathic religious nutbag,&quot; but that is more obviously an insult than calling someone a liberal.</div></div><hr />

I have a tendency to label and judge quickly. Liberal or not, I just wig when people immediately jump on the defensive. Makes me feel like I'm arguing with my little sister. In which case, most prompt response is to hang up.<br />
<br />
I dont try to namecall though. Its like typing in caps. No point. No more effective unless you can follow it with a black eye or a busted lip. ;)  If someone takes offense at being called a liberal hehe, as a conservative, you know I'd just snicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, well being a Brit I know all about Mr Blair ;) I was glad to see him get in in '97, having grown up under 15 previous years of Tory apathy/mismanagement (go thatcherism..); but all the nanny state BS is getting a bit much heh. <br />
<br />
Canned brit politics: Labour will probably get in again though this summer, Blair has too strong a majority, and brown has made too much for Big Business (check UK economic growth for last 9 years or), despite all the 'iraq adventure' and stealth taxes. Oppostion (Conservatives) are too weak, and leaving a bit late to rely on immgration vote, Howard, though an accomplished politician is a bit too shifty for leadership, and Blairs 'champagne' socialism is too centralist/strong economic footing to attack on anything but extreme issues. Only thing I can see rocking the cart is if Brown breaks ranks and goes for the PM job early. Either that or the lastest anit-terrorism house arrest bill they are steamrolling through the houses atm could backfire and cause a 'piss off blair it's our country' uprising ;)<br />
<br />
Also, the bootlaces thing I think came from a news footage clip during the first few months of the iraq war. Crowd of disgruntled iraqis shouting 'Bush is the shoe, Blair is the laces'. There again, when we saw blair (black silk shirt -open neck) and bush (USAF bomber jacket) give that press conference outside Camp david, you didnt need to listen to know what was coming ;)</div></div><hr />

ROFL!  Excellent comparison.  That makes this just like 1941 . . . well 1941 with the assumption we had Germany and Japan cut off from the world, and flew thousands of sorties a year over 80% of its skies and had international inspectors running all around their country snooping into their facilities.  Yes Mill - they are identical analogies.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
In case you've forgotten, Iraq wasn't going anywhere in 2003.  When you've surrounded your enemy and constrained their ability to import pretty much anything, I don't think you or your allies are in danger of being conquered by them any time soon.  It's right out of the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) in 2002:  fight one enemy, fix the other - when the first is fully defeated, move on to the next.  But perhaps I should defer to your superior military experience on this one Mill.</div></div><hr />

I think Bush has a few issues to resolve (or at least not make a mess of) in order to stand next to the great ones like Reagan, FDR, Lincoln, etc...<br />
<br />
1) Iraq stabilizes to the point that we can withdraw all but a forward presence, no longer on security duty. Bonus points for capture of OBL and AMaZ.<br />
<br />
2) Iran. Given the casus belli for Iraq it's hard to not make the same case for Iran.  Our military is no longer built for this kind of operation and to get it there will require exceedingly painful &quot;guns vs. butter&quot; decisions fiscally. It is likely that the UN will be useless as usual on this.<br />
<br />
3) North Korea. Letting sleeping dogs lie will only work if NK doesn't export its nuclear technology. If (more like when) this occurs, it can no longer be safely ignored and bought off with cheap food.<br />
<br />
4) Trimming the budget. His proposal to reduce spending in the budget is a first step but it has to go a lot further to reduce deficit spending. He needs to ignore his critics both within and without his own party on this.<br />
<br />
5) Reforming Social Security.  If he achieves anything measurable at all on this he will attain instant FDR domestic stature, which is apropos given that FDR got us into this fiscal mess.  He cannot fail here and hope to achieve a solid domestic legacy- it's too important and now too high profile.<br />
<br />
If he delivers on the above he will go down as one of the great ones. And I still don't understand why his father got an aircraft carrier named after him? Erm, huh? Why?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point I fail to see how Bush (the lesser) could make a list of the goods, but history will be the judge rather than current speculation.  Right now I would rank him, along with Clinton, in the same group as Cooledge and the rest of the 1920s group - fairly non-descript.  But the fun is that it will take 20 years or more for everythingto shake out, but his economic poliies are a disaster now and foreign policy is a mess.

But will you please get your head out of your arse and realise that America is not the only reason its changing.<br />

Mill<br />
<br />
Im of the school of thought that says the coalition should have finished what they started in 91 and not left the country to fester for 13 years.<br />
<br />
If some of your reasons for invading Iraq ie Saddam paying suicide bombers were taken seriously then America should have invaded most of the Middle East many years ago.<br />
<br />
Afghanistan was a breeding ground for terrorists yet it took 911 for America to wake up to the fact and actually do something about it.<br />
<br />
Look at Northern Ireland and the IRA Mill how much of their funding was recieved from American citizens yet i dont ever remember you calling for Irish Americans to be hunted down.<br />
<br />
Basically Bush was right to invade Iraq but I also believe he did it for the wrong reasons.<br />
Yes there may be a very tenuous link to Al Qaeda etc but we all know that the real reason was oil plain and simple.<br />
<br />
The Iraq regime should have been brought down many years ago so why wasnt it ?.<br />
You may blame Clinton etc but then again why wasnt the job finished in 91 ?.</div></div><hr />

Because democracy and freedom have such long traditions in the Middle East?  Your post is laughable.  You suggest that a democratic, free Iraq was in the making all along?  Ok, you just go on believing that.  There's not many people that agree with you, however.  And I think the better analysis is that absent American liberation of Iraq, the Butcher of Baghdad would still be gassing Kurds by the tens of thousands, slaughtering dissidents without remorse or even a second-thought, and continue his harboring of terrorists and pursue his potential to inflict mass death and destruction.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you want to believe that the Iraqi's, Lebanese, Palestinians, Egyptians, Arabians, and yes even Libyans (!) would be experiencing these changes without the American liberation of Iraq, maybe charges of naiivete are something you should not be tossing about.</div></div><hr />

Too late, he's already among the greats. Your historical revisionism is a wasted effort on this, much like my decrying of FDR's horrid social and economic policy won't change his place in U.S. history. <br />

You are correct that the jury is still out on Bush the Younger. Given the rather lax requirements for aircraft carrier christening, I suspect he will at least achieve that much. Heaven knows he's already twice the success of his father.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Too late, he's already among the greats. Your historical revisionism is a wasted effort on this, much like my decrying of FDR's horrid social and economic policy won't change his place in U.S. history. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are obviously one of the deluded that think Reagan &quot;won&quot; the cold war and sprinkled fairy dust on the economy.  There is no arguing with a zealot.  Just as there is no arguing with the zealot that thinks Clinton will go down among the greats.  <br />
<br />
Reagan was one of the &quot;pretty goods&quot; to meantion him in the same breath with Lincoln so undermines what &quot;great&quot; is.<br />
<br />
I am not rewriting history, you are.  Debating this will be pointless because neither of us will listen to the other.<br />
<br />
Yeah, FDR had such horrid social and economic policy... SEC, TVA, REC, FDIC, the long defunct CCC that built the great western dams and employed millions.  Horrible, all horrible.   :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
At this point I fail to see how Bush (the lesser) could make a list of the goods, but history will be the judge rather than current speculation.  Right now I would rank him, along with Clinton, in the same group as Cooledge and the rest of the 1920s group - fairly non-descript.  But the fun is that it will take 20 years or more for everythingto shake out, but his economic poliies are a disaster now and foreign policy is a mess. One thing I have learned, I will not understimate him, but I just think he is on the wrong track.<br />

As I have lots to do today, I have not the time to write a Solzhenitsyn-length debunking of the Bush myth.   :D <br />

Most presidential rankings put former President Reagan just below the Abraham Lincoln - George Washington - Franklin Roosevelt class.  Those three, no matter what the poll, dominate the top.<br />

This is pretty close to how I'd pick it.  President Reagan - Top Ten material.  President Clinton sandwiched between Presidents Van Buren and Coolidge in the lower end of Average. (1/10th of a point less and he's below average... thank heavens he rolled over for the Republican Congress or he'd be really low.)<br />
<br />
President Bush (43) (please continue to refer to him as &quot;the Lesser&quot; -- it's worked so good for his opposition in the past, e.g. &quot;The Shrub&quot;, etc.) will likely end up in the Above Average category, certainly above President Kennedy, but not higher than President Madison.<br />
<br />
I love how the Left continues to belittle the President.  Remember, he's the guy that's beaten you twice.  Where does that leave you?<br />
<br />
The only President since FDR to increase his party's seats in Congress over his term.  The Middle East will go down as a huge success in the face of negativism, defeatism and rancor to the opposite.  He'll be seen as a wartime president that made hard decisions on the world stage -- and has been vindicated as being right, ala President Reagan.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to debate Reagan's merits or FDR's fallacies with you- they're both dead steeds. History and the American people have spoken. You can argue all you want but it will not change Reagan's perception among the overwhelming majority of Americans, not all of whom are &quot;deluded&quot; or &quot;zealots&quot; as you so arrogantly label those with whom you disagree. His legacy among historians and the rest of the world continues to grow, it is as inexorable as the tide.<br />
<br />
There is no arguing with a zealot.<br />
Start with the man in the mirror. This is a lost cause, my friend. Belittling Reagan at this point only smacks of sour grapes and pettiness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like it or not Bubba, Reagan is going to get a whole lot of credit for bringing down the wall.  Personally, I think it's deserved.  He played a high stakes game with the Soviets and drove them economically into the dirt.  I believe the whole Star Wars trump card played a role in that, but it turns out to have been a big bluff as well (at least at that time).<br />
<br />
My biggest disappointment in that list is Carter vs Nixon.  Carter did nothing to help this country while in office, and seemed to go out of his way to make things worse.  Yet he came out ahead of Nixon who had a lot of great events to his credit (Part I of Middle East Peace, re-opening China, getting out of Vietnam, etc).  Looks like the &quot;Scholars in History&quot; take a hard line on presidents that get busted on poor ethics.  So how does that explain Clinton's ranking?  :confused:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Because democracy and freedom have such long traditions in the Middle East?  Your post is laughable.  You suggest that a democratic, free Iraq was in the making all along?  Ok, you just go on believing that.  There's not many people that agree with you, however.  And I think the better analysis is that absent American liberation of Iraq, the Butcher of Baghdad would still be gassing Kurds by the tens of thousands, slaughtering dissidents without remorse or even a second-thought, and continue his harboring of terrorists and pursue his potential to inflict mass death and destruction.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you want to believe that the Iraqi's, Lebanese, Palestinians, Egyptians, Arabians, and yes even Libyans (!) would be experiencing these changes without the American liberation of Iraq, maybe charges of naiivete are something you should not be tossing about.<br />
<br />
Nowhere do I state you played no part but you are not the ONLY reason this happened.<br />
Bush and his friends sometimes seem to think that Bush is a godlike figure who only has to wave his wand and all the troubles dissapear.<br />
If it wasnt for Iraqi dissidents who lived under Husseins regime how &quot;stable&quot; do you think Iraq would be at this present moment.<br />
<br />
Palestine- Yep great help youve been there.All your governments seem to be too afraid to say anything to Israel.How is the liberation of Iraq making any difference to Palestine as you say it is.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia- Another country that is probably 1 of the biggest threats to America (Leadership wise not but breeding ground for terrorist wise) yet once again America too afraid to say anything.<br />
<br />
Also im glad to see it was the AMERICAN liberation of Iraq id forgotten that only American forces were/are there.<br />

All im saying is dont forget there were other people involved other than Americans/Bush but you like to forget that.</div></div><hr />

:eek: You've gotta be kidding me. THAT, my friends, is a case of &quot;If his face is on money then he must've been good!&quot;<br />

Even ignoring his genocidal wars and laws... He was a crazy sum'bitch with the white people, too! He completely lost his mind after his wife died, and I do mean that in the medical sense. If psychology had been around back then, he would have been a benchmark case for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and perfectionism.<br />

Please note that Lincoln is only #2 because he &quot;freed the slaves&quot; - In the last throes of the war despite having told his generals that they would NOT be fighting to free the slaves, only after word was brought to him that the Confederacy was mulling over freeing hte slaves themselves.

Tony Blair' sucking up to bush is just plain old embarassing. I used to hear people (usually arabs) on the news calling the UK america's lapgogs. Naturally I assumed that they were mentally retarded, ignorant, or simply indoctrinated to their party lines. That was untill I watched Blair in action and realised that they were right. Between that and his policies towards Europe I'm seriously considering emmigration out of pure disgust for what's being done to my country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Historically speaking, america is pretty good at timing it's involvement in various conflicts, being on the winning side, and claiming thay did all the work. I think America will get accredited for what happened in Iraq (After all, if he hadn't told Blair to send in British troops, nothing would have gotten done) and that history will tell if it was a good or bad thing.<br />
<br />
Democratic elections in Iraq? get real, the coalition forces (call them american if you must, Blair's so called 'Special Relationship' with Bush goes about as far as his ability to give Bush a decent blow job) vetted the candidates which really does invalidate the free democratic elections that they are claiming. Free and democratic elections includes the possibility of getting somone elected that is hostile to coalition forces..</div></div><hr />

As am I. He got us into a war in which he promised he wouldn't just prior to his reelection. He presided over some of the worst civil rights abuses in our history, including the demolition of the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech and press.  He presided over Prohibition. He was not well respected by his fellow leaders in the Entente who thought he was an idealistic naif.  He wound up, as his critics proclaimed before they were jailed, using the American military as a guarantee for British colonial imperialism. And last but not least, his popularity was so bad that in 1920 with FDR as running mate he presided over one of the worst political defeats in U.S. history.  His party lost power for a generation.<br />
