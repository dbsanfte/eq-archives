<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally finished playing EverPatch and actually logged in this morning.  The new face graphics are a great touch, but before I finalize Timbo's look I wanted to be sure I don't pick one that's common.  Please post a screen of your male hobbit's face, or at least a description of which options you picked.  I'm leaning towards white hair, matching mutton-chop sideburns, grey or green eyes, and the most &quot;friendly&quot; of the hobbit faces (brownish shadows and &quot;laugh lines&quot; around the eyes).  Looks a little like Bilbo in The Movie, actually.<br />
<br />
Also interested in male High Elf and Barbarian screens/descriptions, but those guys are lower level and more easily able to change their appearance by changing armor, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.. looking forward to some new adventures with old friends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Timbo,<br />

<br />
We still haven't been told when facial changes will be made final, so you have quite a bit of time to run around and take a look at the other wee folk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look forward to seeing you in-game again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daelen Mindreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK I have been waiting for days since you were fully patched and I have yet to see a Timbo sighting...<br />
<br />
Where the heck are ye shorty!?!?!<br />
<br />
btw you can change your face/appearance as often as you like for the short term.... so just get in and figure it out as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Timbo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Temp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok here is Tempin, he looks alot like the one you described.<br />

<br />
Handsome Devil no? I wouldnt blame you for picking the same features.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Tempin.  Actually, Timbo's facial hair is just the sideburns not the moustache, and I went with the hazel/light brown eyes.  And he's got more wrinkles.  And I thought his hairline was more receeding.  And he's dressed all in dark greens/browns.<br />
<br />
But other than that, we're twins!  /cough</div></div><hr />
