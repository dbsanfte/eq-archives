<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lalorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We are all upset about alchemy and I have put a lot of though into it and why didn’t verant add us into the new mix of items.  Here is why!  Most of the high end Trade skill items are very nice, take a ton of time to forage or farm components.  Problems with Alchemy is a temporary bonus to stats and to farm the components for temporary benefits does not pan out.  So there lies the solution….<br />
<br />
MAKE PERMANENT ITEMS!!    <br />
<br />
Make them all range items but make them right clickable.  I know some of the tinkering items have shrink so that one is out but how about the same stat potions that we have but make the a right clickable item? What is wrong with just making the list of potions we have now permanent and reusable?  Of course the DS potions and maybe the flowing thought ones are going to be hard to make and expensive. Add AC items or WIS or INT buff items.  <br />
<br />
Please shoot me down if this does not make sence but it does not tip any scales or upset any class because we already have the ability to do this.  just make it worth the purchase for some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This makes total sense!<br />
<br />
The &quot;sandwich of foul smelling herbs&quot; is range equipable AND edible...why not an equipable potion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well aside from alchemy being about making potions.<br />
<br />
What would a dropable ALL/ALL item that fits in your range slot with infinite charges of FT3 be worth?  Even the basic stat potions would have to be obsenly priced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno.  An FT3 item with no other stats v. an item with great stats and no FT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As drunk as I am atm, and as much as I want alchemy to NOT suck, the idea of alchemy making geerlok **** is wrong.<br />
<br />
If you want something to either recharge or with charges from the ranged slot then get something from a tinkerer.<br />
<br />
Potions are meant to be drunk and used!  even though they suck and are close to being 100% worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, personally I'd just like 1 reason to use Alchemy. I put a ton of cash into the project, and it's really not at all useful to me.<br />
<br />
Gate potions? Sorry, you can buy much better ones from vendors now.<br />
<br />
Stat potions? For the trivial upgrade, nobody cares.<br />
<br />
Resist potions? If you have access to a bard, and some decent gear, again, not really useful at all.<br />
<br />
Ditto for the utility potions, there are permanent/charged items out there that are much easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
I guess it's worth the price of admission for IVU, but that means I could have stopped at the hefty skill level of 70.<br />
<br />
If you haven't spent the cash raising your Alchemy skill, I suggest not bothering. Seriously.</div></div><hr />

Just like Shrink.  Otherwise, Alchemy worthless.  You are better off working on Brewing or Pottery than Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're all taking this the wrong way.  What I was discussing was a potion that had certain effects when held (Like an Idol + stats or something), but had ANOTHER effect when drunk (gate to bindpoint or Spirit of the cheetah, ITU, anything).<br />
<br />
Make em expensive as regular potions...or more..but make having the skill worthwhile.  FT1 or 2 is not much to ask for a player-makeable item..and if you are forced to drink it you're out of luck..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. An imaginary art which aimed to transmute the baser metals into gold, to find the panacea, or universal remedy for diseases, etc. It led the way to modern chemistry.<br />
<br />
2. A mixed metal composed mainly of brass, formerly used for various utensils; hence, a trumpet. [Obs.]<br />

3. Miraculous power of transmuting something common into something precious.<br />

Pay close attention to the definition. Alchemy is NOT just potions, it is sooo much more. Alchemy is the gateway to Chemistry. There is so much that can be done with it, but all VI does is crappy potions. This is one of the reasons I started a Shaman, of course that was before I knew that is was useless or an extreme money sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lefusgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a thought, but after all they are adding a inventory slot for Charms.  Maybe that could end up being the permanent alchemy item that is coincidently being discussed here. It could fit the role of a shaman as well, giving their people charms to protect and grant good fortune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is actually a good idea, obviously not applicable to gate potions or regen potions... but for all others, this isn't a bad idea at all... I really wish VI would give this idea some solid and serious consideration... and I think this would give Alchemy a sizable increase in marketability. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That may not necessarily be true. They have different teams that work on things so the team that works on loot tables may not be the same one that works on tradeskills. I wholeheartedly agree that the tradeskill team needs to seriously spend some time with alchemy. :)</div></div><hr />

I like this idea.  Heck...I'd even drink my own Blood of the Wolf potions if this change were to be made.</div></div><hr />

Holy Ovens in the ceiling ... Get those tradeskill folks thinking about Alchemy as a primary tradeskill instead of one step above begging.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Adaggio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Having read the actual definition of alchemy above, I am inspired by the uses alchemy could be put to! We could create powders that rangers etc could put on their arrows to make them explode! We could be mobile banks turning copper into silver etc. (someone had that idea above, i beleive). There are so many things we could do other than make useless, unwanted potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">IMO this could be the answer to our &quot;not enough spell gems&quot; problem, <br />
make them rightclick buffs, they would have to be no drop and shaman only <br />
but that would free up some spell slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That does open up a lot of options. They could make alchemy essential in preparing high end metal for smithing etc. Or as someone mentioned charms.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I saw a documentary on tribal shamanism where charms are made from animal parts to create healing benfits etc. Normally with feathers and fur etc. This could be utilised for the new charm slots quite easily, and for want of a better skill alchemy could be used being a uniquely shamanistic skill in EQ.<br />
<br />
Whatever they do, I would like to see alchemy useful for more than 2 kinds of potions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;alchemy in real life was turing items to gold&quot;<br />
<br />
uhh no not totally, thats mineral alchemy, plant alchemy was used medicinally, and spiritual alchemy was turning the materialistic side of the person (lead), to a more spiritual side (gold).  usually this is accomplished by making alchemical or spagyrical plant stones which are used to balance the corresponding astrological energies of the person.  Alchemy is one of the most misunderstood of the ancient sciences, probably because it relies so heavily on astrology, and that is definitely misunderstood.</div></div><hr />

 There are a few vendors that sell gate potions, to bind i believe. Cost is a bit over 1k or so, and is instant. Wish i could remember exactly where they are, but im sure one vendor is in Efp also sells the gimp regen, lght healing and invis pot's.</div></div><hr />

In the Moons of Uranus Expansion we'll be getting getting gunpowder and other fun stuff. :D<br />

Though the Charm slot is just a shaman speciality waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">permant would be a bad idea. it would be great for a wile but the market would eventualy get flooded and  the price of selling em would drop below what it cost to make em just like tailoring..<br />
<br />
though a say 4 hour duration would be encreadable</div></div><hr />
