<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im 45 and I have no idea where to hunt. City of mist worked well for a couple pulls, but I kept pulling trains.<br />
<br />
Im thinking about heading to Velious, seeing as Ive never hunted there. But I gotta figure stuff on velious has high Cold resist, making my jbb useless.<br />
<br />
Am I right? Where did you guys hunt at 45?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stehe McNorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 45 I, sadly did KC.  You would be supprised how often JBB lands on Velious mobs though.  I would stick to Kunark until 49, or do SolB, or Lower Guk until 49.  Then get your new spells and go to Colbalt Scar until level 54.  XP flies there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">City of Mist is way better exp than Cobalt Scar, plus it's a lot less contested.<br />
<br />
Once you learn how to pull in CoM it's actually a really good zone, plus as shammies we can slow/root/dot park multiples and use the mutt to chew the targets down, good exp to about 51 plus epic notes, very worthwhile zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I soloed Bloodgill Goblins in LoIO at level 45. Great experience and not super tough mobs.</div></div><hr />

Go eat some crickets leezard!<br />
<br />
CoM is a great zone, not too crowded and nice xp. Work on pulling for awhile you'll get the hang of it. At 45 you'll be able to get singles or at the most 2 at a time if ya practice.<br />
<br />
(hint, pull with slow.. long cast range and it seems to generate less aggro radius than some other spells)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bazmal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try seafurys, I have had a couple folks i know go from 45-56 there off them. One was a mage and the other were a couple shaman I knew. Of course you will start out slow but at about 50 you will be a machine there. Plus if you spend that amount of time there you will have tons of plat after. All 3 of the folks I know spent 6+ levels there and each came away with 20K+ in plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seafurys are the way to go.  I didn't start until about 52 on them and I really regret it.  They usually hit me for about 30-40 and I think their max is somewhere in the low 80s.  Slow, dog and about 10 jbbs later move on to the next.  At 52 I never ran out of mana and had constant pulls.  Unfortunately at 52 they aren't the greatest experience but at 45 I would think you would get killer experience with little to no down time.  They also drop good vendor cash items that range from 50-90p.  I usually killed 25-35 an hour and made 200-300p an hour.  If you can get the gornit camp on the side the money doesn't get a lot better.  I camped Gornit and soloed seafurys inbetween pops and made 1.5k in about 3 hours.  Oh and if you pull with slow sick the pet on the seafury and let the pet do the first 10% damage, you won't pull agro from him while jbbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 45, I had no problems landing the JBB on Eastern Wastes mobs (Ulthorks, Rhinos, Giants, etc)...and the exp just flew.  Also, collecting Ulthork tusks is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
As soon as I crossed over into GD, however, I had a lot of problems with resists, even on giants lower than the ones I was fighting in EW..../shrug.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">make invis to undead potions , go to CoM and invis past the front trash. go over the stables and setup in between the 2 . pull the courtyard and anything else you feel you can handle. once you hit about 48 go to Burning Woods , i found this place ot be AWESOME , u did 4 levels in a week i think  once you get 50 or 51 things will slow down , by then you should be doing giant fort. once oyu move to having to do ancients all the time , things go slow , but the loot is SWEET. no lies , possible better then HHK in time ratios and definetly more fun if you ask me. at about 51 or 52 i think it slows down , you wanna go to neriak at this point<br />
<br />
i made this for a friend , now its for you friend ..<br />
<br />
http://crap.unbreakable.ws/neriakthirdgate.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
do them till about 53ish , 54 if you arent bored out of your skull , then head to HHK. once you hit 57 its time to leave HHK , unlesss you can stand the slow down . this is where i am now , soloing the evil katta guard in the mansion. good XP<br />
<br />
hope ive helped in some way , good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for the help guys.<br />
<br />
I ran back to give CoM another shot, using distance and slow to pull. The exp was MUCH better, and I held the bridge area and the 2 walkways that flank it for a couple hours. Just spaced the spawns and I had near constant pulls. Just needed to med up the 10% for slow.<br />
<br />
Im gonna give what you guys suggest a try as well, I can never stay in one place too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">after resist change, I can actually land JBB at kael after debuff !! well only like 1/3 of max damage or less</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Level on seafurbies. Your mudflated gear will negate any damage they deal and you can kill them non stop. Great XP/gems too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I never really got the hang of pulling COM to well.<br />
<br />
I tried to solo the stables for awhile, but kept getting 2 or 3 out of the first rooms.  The exp there is fantastic though.<br />
<br />
I dont have a JBB(yet :)), so i need around 25% mana per mob(slow+ebolt), so for me to take 3 on at a time easily, i would have significant downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">lol color me retarded, but what is &quot;mudflated&quot; gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Orecets,<br />
<br />
  &quot;Mudflation&quot; is the rise in player power because of better weapons/armour being added to a Mud, causing the original mobs to become much easier to kill than they were in the original game.<br />
<br />
  E.G. compare luclin weapons with say, an Axe of the Iron black.<br />
<br />
 And compare how hard/how many hit points mobs have in Luclin compared with the original mobs (Antonica/Fawder/Odus).<br />
<br />
Therefore killing original game mobs, in this instance Seafuries, with Luclin era weapons/armour becomes much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ohhhhh, thanks!<br />
<br />
Im not sure how mudflated I am. I have 903 ac and 1350 hp buffed. Think I can kill me some seafuries!? I plan on trying once I get 46!</div></div><hr />

- When I was killing seafurbies I had something like black iron crap, that tunic from Unrest and ugh my best gear was the necklace from Gukk. I did fine. You should be able to do fine also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Do JBB and Geo's in CC mix well? Or resist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jalli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I dont have JBB, but blizzard blast rarely resisted by geos if ever so i assume JBB will werk fine.  Only resists i get in CC are from spiders and terrors...(oh yeah and once when i memed the wrong spell winters roar landed np as well hehe)</div></div><hr />
