<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I seriously doubt there is anything for 400 you could buy with the same impact, especially for the sub 65 shaman without blood. <br />
<br />
I'm still planning on picking it up myself even though I have bane for those magic only mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go for Anathema...actually I have gone for anathema myself untill I can get the points in Rujark for bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you buy a spell with adventure points, is it no drop? Someone in my guild was talking about buying and selling GRC, so I was wondering. <br />
<br />
The question came to mind here because my 58 shaman will need a ton of adventures to buy Anathema, and my 65 bard already has the points, if the resulting scroll is tradable. I bought pack shrew with the shaman, but don't remember if the scroll was tradable or not (I didn't even look, most likely).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes they are no drop and screw Anathema. <br />
Save up for Bane instead and buy some +40hp augs after that for 1150pts from Rujark.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone confirm this? (grc being no drop if bought from ldon)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would definitely say you should get Anathema.  I went right for bane myself, but I'm still planning to pickup anathema regardless.  I like the idea of having two more DoTs that do not break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RGC scroll sold in Tak is *not* no-drop (i.e., it *is* droppable).  It is LORE, for what it's worth. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know that the new curse DoTs have a long recast time (24sec I believe).  Does that mean that they are greyed out for 24 seconds after memming them?  That is how most other spells work that have long recast times (Spirit of Cheetah for example).<br />
<br />
I hope that the new DoTs don't follow this rule as that would be a pain for swapping out spells.  You would pretty much have to dedicate a spell slot to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course you cant do this..if it has a 24 second refresh after casting and you could just demem and remem and cast..what was the point of the refresh in the first place?<br />
<br />
And the recast really kills these spells in my eyes.  Only thing i see them useful for is root rotting one thing at a time (since they dont break root)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One line of spells I will never be getting. Evidently you guys have more spell slots than I do, because I need more than I have already without having a worthless spell like that thrown into the mix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, evidently you merely group in PoValor all the time instead of doing interesting things.  Whatever turns your crank, but don't get all down on people who actually play the game and run into situations where these new DoTs are quite powa.  <br />
<br />
Those of you saying this new spell line is worthless disqualify yourselves in the same breath.  It's hardly worthless.  All of our spells have some use.  Anyone looking to cut corners and not get a spell is just not going to be the same level of shaman as those who take the time to find out how the game works and how the spells they get interact with the world of EQ.  <br />
<br />
Reminds me, I was grouped with this beastlord couple nights ago and he was the only other person besides me who could heal in that particular group.  **** hits the fan and I wind up kiting a bunch of mobs around at 20% of my own hps while the chanter is mezzing them.  No heals from the bst, baffling.  I end up biting it due to low hp aggro and unslowed mobs and ask the bst why he didn't deign to heal me?  He informed me that Chloroblast is worthless and not worth keeping memmed.  I told him (in groupchat) that was the most idiotic statement I had ever heard and grats him on surprising me with further stupidity I had never seen before.  <br />
Yah, I tend to be kinda harsh on the &quot;special kids&quot; in my groups.  But he learned, and kept that heal memmed next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Myself..I'm coming close to 450 points in mistmoore, and I won't be buying anathema.  I'm about 7 wins from Bane and I dont play often, but the armplates in mistmoore are a HUGE upgrade to me at 65 (using Zraxthril linked sleeves right now heh)....the added HP/mana/sta would be a nice welcome to my gear....I'll save up for bane instead...<br />
<br />
And yes I am aware that the Guk sleeves and the Miragul sleeves are far superior....however, they also require far more playtime, which I don't really have. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All of our spells have some use.<br />

<br />
duh, you have never been in a group with 3 bards and 2 chanters?  <br />
Ok, special circumstances, but still...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd get at least anathema before getting anything else.  Certainly before getting any other spells.  The Bane line may not be the silver bullet some seem to think it is, but it is far from useless.  Much like most of our tools, Aanathema/Bane are situational.  I have a spellset that includes anathema for when I'm grouped with a bard/chanter and can't use rains without risking mez breakage.  Under those circumstances the spell shines, because I can fully debuff the mobs while they're mezzed and then drop anathema on them as soon as they're awakened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I do things other than valor Land. You can try to insinuate that you are better than me in game if you like, but it does not change the fact that bane line = a spell slot wasted on a highly situational easy to blow(oo, resist! no more spell slot for 30 seconds) junk bone thrown to us by soe. Trying to equate a beastlord not memming their heal to not using these spells is laughable. <br />
<br />
I rate these dots right up there with /shield for warriors. Sure, if you try hard you can find a use for them, but in terms of actual practicality they are worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ouch, 24 second recast time?    Other than having a dot on the MR line, I don't see a reason to get this with bane/ancient/blood, especially with a 24 second recast.<br />
<br />
And Land, I hear what you're saying to a degree, but bad annalogy.    Bst not using chloroblast when there's no backup healer vs Sham having a Mr based dot are 2 very different things.<br />
<br />
It's a nice solo toy imo.  I think I'm still getting 40hp augments first :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Those of you saying this new spell line is worthless disqualify yourselves in the same breath.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say it is worthless, but I will say that it is worthless TO ME. I put MGB in the same category. I will never have a use for MGB, and spending 9 AA on it would be a silly and pointless waste of my time. The bane line is no different. My default spell lineup while grouping is 7 spell gems dedicated to things that either can't be unmemmed, or run grave risks if I do.<br />
<br />
With a 30 second refresh time after memming it, and the near-constant need to swap it out as my only available spell gem for all the other spells I need to cast, there simply isn't the time or availability. I'd scribe a copy in case it ever got useful if the scroll dropped of its own accord, but to spend valuable adventure points on something I'd use perhaps once every other RL month, hellllllllllllllllllllllll no.<br />
<br />
Then, there is the whole resist issue. I can't speak to where you hunt, but since this spell uses the identical resist check to Turgurs, there's an easy basis for comparison as to how well it will work. Turgurs gets resisted. A lot. I try to avoid maloing stuff because it is time consuming (time consuming enough that tanks will somewhat frequently die with the added time, and I rarely group with clerics) and mana expensive. Turgurs gets resisted about 30% of the time on normal XP mobs, in LDoN and PoP. At least with Turgurs, I don't need to wait a half minute to try again. When I want DPS, I scribe velium strike. DoTs are ****ty except when soloing, and have been for a long time. The new line does nothing to remedy this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes even group cha has it's uses. Cha is an important factor in Divine intervention going off and with a groups of tank tank cleric cleric bard other on a raid group cha covers the caster and the tank in one easy cast =)<br />
<br />
As far as bane goes the recast time is a pain sometimes but I gotta wonder what people have that they have 7 slots perma filled cause I sure don't have 7 slots always filled. My normal line up has slow, malos, q, tnargs and cann4 always memed. I usually have malosinia up too but not always. That still leaves 2 slots which i usually fill with ferine avatar and either a nuke or bane right now. If i have ferine and bane memed i usually drop cann 4 or q to mem a quick buff. I don't mem a root because i've got aa root and ornate legs to us and thats good enough for me.<br />
<br />
Jharassik,<br />
even shield has it's uses. You can even dig up furror's post on how they handle some of the mobs in PoTime. Only way they have found to handle the dps on a couple of the mobs is a warrior shielding chain. Not fun for the warrior since the only heal they get is DI going off but it's the successful strat they use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">as usual, i'm different.<br />
<br />
i bought the remove curse from chest line of spells, then anathema and then vampire talon for my primal.<br />
<br />
working on getting bane...i bought another vampire talon for my dark mace of thought, too..<br />
<br />
dun get vampire talon twice until you remove it from the 1st weapon...<br />
<br />
the GM can remove the augment but restore 0 adventure points. you won't see a problem till you die the first time with vampire talon on 2 seperate weapons :/<br />
<br />
as far as anathema's usefullness...on named mobs in VT it's the win. 278 dd a tic plus nife's 214 or whatever is good DPS and doesn't pull agro.<br />
<br />
still seeking blood and as i said before saving up for Bane.<br />
<br />
? bane only bought in EC?<br />
<br />
oh, one more thing...the remove curse from chest line of spells is mostly useless...not all chests are cursed and even more so, most groups dun give a sh... about them.<br />
<br />
but when the group wants to fork with em and they are cursed, they're good to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My grouping spell line up is: Q, Turgurs, Tnarg's, Malo, Root, X, Ferine Avatar, Canni 4.<br />
<br />
All of those spells are either too useful, or (for FA) take too long to re-mem to not have them up constantly. In the X slot goes everything else. I'd rather put velium strike there, which is resisted less, does good damage, can crit, and I can cast about 3 times in 30 seconds if I want, plus takes hardly any time to swap out. Bane is none of those things, except possibly the damage....which I personally doubt, since stuff rarely lives long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You uber doods crack me up.  You speak as if the game starts at level 65 with 100 aa's.  Shocking as it might sound, it does not.  There are a lot of us out here, levels 30-60, that would love to get our hands on the new curse based spells.<br />
<br />
I know you haven't bothered to look at anything lower level than Bane or Anathema, but in reality, Odium at level 44 and even Curse at level 34, do much better dps than any of our similar level poison or disease dots.  Since LDoN is based on killing stuff fast, the curse line comes in very handy.  <br />
<br />
True, in group, I do not dot much, too busy slowing, healing, etc.  However, when the mobs are slowed or mezzed, or if I have a cleric in group, and I want to help with some added dps, the curse dots work just fine.<br />
<br />
And don't even try to tell me that I should be using a dd.  At level 34 the best dd does 412 damage for 200 mana.  Odium does 189 * 6 ticks, total 1,134 for 340 mana.  And yes, at level 34, the mobs sometimes live for 6 ticks.<br />
<br />
A fast, powerful dot will always be in my spell bar, and until I get some very high level dots, like Blood, (several months of play time until I get there) I hope to use Odium, Anathema and Bane quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Got to agree with Landragoran Heronwing, most spells have their uses, especially if you consider the level when you get them.<br />
<br />
BTW, comparing Anathema at 410AP to the +40hp augment at 1,150AP, is apples to oranges.  Sure, something 3x more expensive will be better, does not mean you forsake everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That's great, they use it on one or two encounters. Like I said, if you try hard you can find a use for it, but for actual practical use it is worthless(just like these dots).<br />
<br />
All spells have their uses, you are right..I mean one time i used sense animals for my cudgel quests. Something I use once in three years may have its use, but having a use and actually being useful(let alone being useful enough to drop all those points into to buy) are two different things.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think sense animals may be more useful than this spell line come to think of it..because when I need to sense animals, there isn't a better spell for it. <br />
<br />
When I want to dot mobs...</div></div><hr />
