<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While baron/baroness is common to all, the final titels vary a lot. However, we get to share our titles Venerable/Elder with the druids, while the clerics get a unique title.<br />
<br />
What would you guys want as final AA title? Or maybe you are happy with Elder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be happy with elder if they took it away from druids and beastlords.  I think every class should have a unique title.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, they should be unique, but Elder just fits a shaman. A shaman is all about wisdom and they are the elders of the tribes.<br />
<br />
It wouldnt be right any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, im only lvl 35, but i'll voice my opinion because im bored =D.  I do think every class should have its own little special title. Can't think of anything off the top of my head right now for shaman, or any class really, cause they took all the obvious ones for the lvls 51, 55 etc. Then the AA titles, not much left to think of for my simple mind...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i would like to see aa titles for like the 50, 100, 150 etc so you have a little more idea of your group mates, or perhpas the ablity to change your title to a previous one, in my opinion Heyokah would not only bring back a bit of story line, and alot of people would probably be clueless</div></div><hr />

I think Avatar would be the best.<br />
<br />
avatar<br />
n 1: ny new embodiment of a familiar idea; &quot;the incarnation of evil&quot;; &quot;the very avatar of cunning&quot; [syn: embodiment, incarnation] 2: the manifestation of a Hindu deity (especially Vishnu) in human or superhuman or animal form; &quot;the Buddha is considered an avatar of the god Vishnu&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe, but it sounds too cliche to me.  I wouldn't want to have a title that shares the same name as a spell I cast.</div></div><hr />

I do think they should have Titles added based on number of AA. At like 300+ Aa you can pick a title or something in the place of your last name.<br />

/Agree<br />
I know it sounds dumb but I'm putting off anymore class AAs because I just don't want Elder in front of my name. Doesn't fit me much and that's why i think they should give you a choice of 3 or so titles. Then when you do achieve 24 (i think?) points in class AA you get to pick what fits you best. Dunno just my opinion :)<br />

For example, Tribunal get Justiciar or Judge or &lt;your name here&gt; the Just.  Cazic worshippers get Fearbringer or the fearsome.  Innoruk would be Malefactor or the spiteful or something to that effect.  (Not sure where this leaves kitties since they're agnostic, but I bet someone could come up with something.)<br />
<br />
At the very least, Sony should let players vote on title before putting them live.  After all, we got to pick our names, it's sort of an extension of the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Myself, I kind of like Heyokah, Spiritualist (although droods have the elder spiritualists' armor line..odd i think). Seer.  Harbringer sounds kind of nifty also.<br />

Myself, I'm sticking to venerable as long as I possibly can.  Not sure what sort of Deity Type title a mighty Vah Shir could go with, except maybe Dar Khura.  Hrm...<br />
Dar Khura Tidykat Leondegrance.<br />

I rather like Elder, and don't mind sharing with beasts (since we're one of their parent classes).  Druids should get somerthing like &quot;whinenator&quot; for their class name.<br />

I would also like to see more titles added for some things like 250 skill in a tradeskill, finishing your epic or other long quests (like the kitty cloak quest should grant the title of 'Dar Khura').<br />

What i've feedbacked ever since Luclin was to make it Baron/Baroness, Venerable, Prophet/Prophetess<br />

Get next title upgrade at maybe 250 aa:  Spiritwalker or Spiritmaster<br />

Then perhaps final title at 450 aa.  I kind of like Hemmar's suggestion:  For example, Tribunal get Justiciar or Judge or the Just. Cazic worshippers get Fearbringer or the fearsome.

Skeptic<br />
Jaded<br />
Sophisticate<br />
Languid<br />
Stolid<br />
<br />
Or something that would bring a smile to my face:<br />
<br />
Apathetic<br />
Faithless</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">When these AAX titles first went live, I politely asked VI/SOE many a time to allow for an option that removes these titles. I don't want one. I never wanted one. And yet they are forced upon me.<br />
<br />
And what I mean by this, is I don't want other people to be able to see the title either. I don't want an illusion that makes it appear that I have no title, I do not want a title period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Cannibalist<br />
<br />
is what I suggested last time we saw this topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ooooh.  I'd vote for that.  Or if they could append &quot;the Cannibal&quot; to the end of the name, that'd work too.</div></div><hr />

Farseer<br />
Reverand<br />
<br />

Hmmm . . . that's all I got :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">How about Disgruntled since thats what most shamans are these days?<br />
<br />
Failing that, I'd like to see Farseer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I like elder, honestly. It doesn't fit with druids though. The druids had a strict hierarchical structure, with each level/division having a name. heehee.. Druids had a bardic branch, believe it or not, as they used songs and poems to record their history and lore. (Writing that stuff down was taboo.) Elder just doesn't fit for them, but suits us well. I would like to see &quot;Venerable&quot; changed but it's not something I'd stress over. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Heyokah is definately my first choice however....<br />
Dark Lord of the Sith has always had a nice ring to it.</div></div><hr />
