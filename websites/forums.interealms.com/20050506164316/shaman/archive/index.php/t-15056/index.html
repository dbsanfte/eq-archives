<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone<br />
<br />
Coming back to EQ after a looooong break. My friend is going to start a shaman and I'm going to play a beastlord, but I have no idea where to put my starting points. I plan to play either an Orge or a Barbarian, and would super appreciate any advice on where to put my starting points. <br />
<br />
Plus I need to know if a beastlord eventually stops doing melee, and becomes a pure caster.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I personally prefer Barbarians, got decent faction with the old world cities and a nice newbie area.(look at my sig if you wanna know why else) but Ogres have their immunity to frontal stun, and look horrid. At the end game shaman class doesnt matter much since you got great buffs and starting stats dont matter.<br />
<br />
And anyway, if you both do Barbarians you can have matching pets.<br />
<br />
Oh, and put your point into Stamina until you cant any more, and then the rest in wisdom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go Ogre. not getting stun while you are meleeing and casting is priceless for a bl who should always be meleeing. and i would put all points you can into wis then the rest into stam. i belive that will leave you with 102 wis and 135 stam. not having a decent mana pool in the low lvls sucks @ss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What about putting points in agility or dex? You need those to be at least 100 if you want to get faster skill increases, and BL don't get their stat buffs until much higher level correct? <br />
<br />
If a BL is going to melee from 1-65 then isn't sta the way to go, since it's the most difficult stat to raise?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Play an ogre, without doubt.  I have a beastlord alt, who is an ogre, and he's really awesome.  Your most important stats are stamina, str, and wis in no particular order.  Ogre has the highest strength and stamina by far of any beastlord race, and decent wis as well (compared to other bst races).  Your easiest stats to raise will be strength and stamina.  I capped both of them on my beastlord with only medium twink gear.  Even if you aren't twinking at all, you will have absolutely no trouble capping str and stamina later on in your life, especially if you are always with a shaman.  However, you will have a much harder time capping your wis as a beastlord.  I would advise putting all of your points in to that.<br />
<br />
Some people will say to put 5 in to agi, and here's why:  If you have under 75 agi, there is a pretty severe AC penalty.  Ogres start with 70 agi, so they will have a bad AC vs. other races.  However, you should have no trouble at all finding 5 agi somewhere from gear bonuses.  If you are starting completely from scratch, it might be worth it to put +5 agi and +15wis, but if you are doing any twinking at all, the +agi wont be necessary.<br />
<br />
Good luck, beastlords are a really fun class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No twinking. This is on Stromm. My first instinct is to go with sta, since every little bit helps, but if you guys think wisdom is the way to go, I'll seriously consider it.<br />
<br />
No love for dex or agility at all. How on earth will I ever get my skill ups (<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Put all you can in sta.  It is really easy to get wisdom higher with all that druman gear in the bazaar.  Don't sweat the decision too much though, stats don't make much difference at all.</div></div><hr />
