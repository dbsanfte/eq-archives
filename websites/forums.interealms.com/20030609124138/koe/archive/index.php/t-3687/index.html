<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sorry about last night.  I was paged from work and after trying to get the problem resolved on the phone.  I had to run into work for a couple of hours.  By the time I got home I went straight to bed. :( <br />

I hope everything went ok.  The mines in Thurg look like they might be a good place for a group in low 30s to have some fun and gain some xp.  I do know Tar goos hit hard (85), and guards will not protect you from anything in the mines.<br />
