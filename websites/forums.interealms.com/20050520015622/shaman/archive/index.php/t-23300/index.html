<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just came back from EQ after a year and a half or so and I was wondering what is the storyline for GoD, I know Sony has their one paragraph description somewhere I'm not even sure what that is.<br />
<br />
I was more interested in what people have actually learned playing through the expansion, and how are these people tougher than the Gods?<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess they are from a different universe but on some continent in this world?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as far as GoD lore .. Ive read this from the bottom of this site: http://home.cwru.edu/~srp5/Gate_Tiers.htm<br />
<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
<br />
From what the NPCs have said, apparently here's how things went down on Taelosia:<br />
<br />
1-The Nihil (the enslaved people in the city zones) kicked a fellow tribe of their Taelosians out called the Trusik for worship of a false god of the oceans and of destruction, Trushar.<br />
<br />
2-The Trusik went to Kod'taz, Yxtta, and finally Uqua, and did a huge prayer/ritual that was supposed to destroy the Nihil for kicking them out.<br />
<br />
3-Instead of destroying the Nihil, the ritual brought Norrath to the attention of the Legion of Mata Muram, who are now invading Taelosia and eventually all of Norrath.<br />
<br />
4-The Trusik and Nihil both seem to be slaves for the Legion of Mata Muram due to their Geomantic powers.<br />
<br />
5-Some Trusik are still in Uqua attempting a second ritual of destruction to kill everyone on Taelosia at the same time.<br />
<br />
6-Calliav and Morden apparently have arrived (and bringing all us phat lewt whores) just as the Mata Muram is starting to fortify their position.<br />
<br />
So apparently for us outlander people, its a two-fold battle against the Legion of Mata Muram and the Trusik with their god Trushar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're still trying to figure out how to eject gnomes from luclin's gravity and watch them burn up on reentry to norrath. <br />
<br />
I've had some promising trials in the grey, but I need a larger rocket to tie them too. Right now they just explode a few hundred feet up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The GoD storyline does (technically) tie in to the rest of the game a bit better than it seems - not that you'd know unless you read *really* carefully.<br />
<br />
A long time ago, Zebuxoruk discovered that gods aren't really all that different from mortals.  They still have needs, they can still be threatened or even killed, and - most importantly - the gap is shrinking as mortals become more powerful and edge closer to becoming gods themselves.  He was a protege of Druzzil Ro, goddess of magic, and decided, since he'd been taught how important education was, that he'd just jaunt down to Norrath and tell all the mortals that their gods weren't really any better than them, and that if they worked very hard, they could maybe be gods too some day.<br />
<br />
This didn't go over too well with the rest of the pantheon.  So ... they locked ol' Zeb in a box, and the rest, as they say, is Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
Except Zeb's story isn't done there.  When you're a visionary deity who has come to the enlightened understanding of the way that mortal life and deific power interact, and then you get stuck in a temporal prison outside the boundaries of normal creation, it lets you notice some stuff that other folks missed.  Like, for example, a gathering evil darkness from beyond the realms of the gods, possibly preparing to destroy everything.  You know, minor details like that.  But, no one wanted to listen to Zeb, because he was a heretic.<br />
<br />
Enter the adventurers, who go rampaging through the planes, tearing down the deities (at least temporarily), and breaking open seals on stuff.  Especially stuff like Zeb's temporal prison.  Ah, no biggie there, though, right?  Druzzil Ro comes along and sweeps it all under the rug.  Good as new!  Except ... its not good as new, and as soon as the first guild killed Quarm that was obvious.  Druzzil's fix isn't perfect.  After Quarm's been killed, the Plane of Time leaks.  If you're on a server that hasn't killed Quarm (or if they alter the PoTime files, like they did with the pseudo-instancing), then all the mobs in PoTime-A are untargetable.  The zone is just scenery.  After Quarm dies, though, they stop being frozen in time; you can attack them and hail them and all that good stuff.  The prison plane where nothing is ever allowed to change ... is changing.<br />
<br />
That's the deal with the LDoN nutball Calliav.  He was a visionary and scholar specializing in mental contact with things you shouldn't have mental contact with (despite being a magician and not an enchanter, but hey - I didn't write this script, I just report it).  He's also a worshipper of Zeb (like most of the PoK and PoTranq folks).  One day, he had the unlucky fortune to contact Zeb's mind.  Zeb, being a bored deity in his leaky temporal stasis box, gave him knowledge of everything.  Oops, damaged Calliav.  He's (sort of) better now, and eventually sorted out that there was indeed this huge threat looming beyond space.  Only ... its beyond space, so who cares?<br />
<br />
The camera now pauses to take a look at the not-so-peaceful continent of Taelosia, where a civil war is brewing.  The Nihil think that everyone should hold hands and get along, and use their magic to make worker golems and boring architecture and all that.  The competing faction, the Trusiq, warp geomantic powers to cause neat tricks like giving whole zones of people neg 200 to all their stats or turning people into giant bugs.  They worship a &quot;deity&quot; called Trushar, that doesn't show up on anyone god-watching checklists, but still seems to provide some measure of power to its followers (and no, I've got no clue who/what Trushar IS yet, if he even exists at all).  The Trusiq, though, decide that they've had enough of this civil war (which is mostly just loud discussion at that point), and open up the sacred Alter of Destruction to summon Trushar to this world so HE can end the squabble.  Oh, and as a bonus, Trushar likes to blow things up.  But, the Trusiq aren't really very good at this, especially since its hard to summon your deity when he doesn't really exist (at least not the way you think he does).<br />
<br />
But the Trusiq ritual does do quite a bit of damage to the fabric of reality.  Hey, it was trying to summon a god ... I'll buy that.  By itself, that wouldn't have been a problem.  We know that people try to summon deities all the time in EQ's history (Inny and CT especially must have on-call pagers).  But remember all that god-killing and seal breaking stuff from back in PoP?  Yeah, the funny thing about, say, killing the deities that represent the fundamental elements of creation is that its hard on reality.  So with the divine order still in disarray because people keep farming it, the Trusiq running around poking holes in existence works a little better than intended.<br />
<br />
Zeb's lurking danger?  Its the Realm of Discord.  The Realm of Discord has been discovered before, by the way.  The Priests of Discord worship it, believing that the order of creation is temporary.  And Miragul, the Erudite wizard/necromancer lich that everyone loves had discovered it himself while trying to find a way to cheat death forever, but decided that it didn't seem like a nice place.  As an aside, when the lunatic inventor of modern necromancy decides something is too bad to use as part of his personal quest to achieve immortality, it probably really isn't friendly.  The Realm of Discord is what creation would be like without the pantheon to give it balance and structure.  Of course, the &quot;real&quot; world (the Realm of Order, which includes Norrath and the PoP planes) still does exist, and signs of its presence are physically painful for the Discordites.  This makes them grumpy.<br />
<br />
Taking advantage of the weakened pantheon and the ritual nonsense in Taelosia, the Muramite army tears through the barriers between realms over in the temple of Uqua.  Their leadership holes up in the fortified temple of Tacvi, and the army begins to spread out and enslave whoever they run into.  This doesn't go well for the Nihil, since being friends and holding hands with Muramites just makes it easier for them to proc Chaos Claws.  Meanwhile, the remaining Trusiq realize they scrwed up (no, really?) and, being only slightly brighter than a cabbage, conclude that they need to perform the Ritual of Destuction again, because ... erm, it worked so well before.  Over in the rest of Norrath, Calliav senses a great disturbance in the Forc... I mean, a great danger to the nature of the world, and convinces Mordrin Rasp and all of us to go check it out by claiming there's &quot;phat lewt&quot; across the western sea.<br />
<br />
All of that is going okay, except that the Muramites manage to taint the body and mind of Mordren's cleric/love interest, causing her to quickly begin dying (where quickly is really relative here, I'll admit).  Calliav attempts to figure out what's wrong, forgetting that his real power is &quot;mental contact with things he shouldn't oughtta&quot; and not problem solving.  Guided by a mental presence that, dollars to donuts, is Mata Muram himself, he explains that the only way to save her is to defeat the tainting power at its source.  As a bonus, that would stop future invasions.  Since Mordrin isn't any brighter than your average brick, either, he signs on to this plan, and they begin constructing their own way to rip holes in reality, allowing people to go betatest Omens of War.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the story so far.  Considering, though, that Mata Muram is supposed to be a giant dragon of some sort ... I'm betting that the Realms of Discord will link back to previously known events some more ... maybe even a loose end from Velious.<br />
<br />
As for the deal with not seeing Taelosia ... that's actually been explained in game.  Luclin is in geosynchronous orbit over Norrath.  I forget where its supposed to orbit over, exactly, but I know its on the wrong side of the world to see Taelosia.  That plot point, at least, isn't entirely contrived.</div></div><hr />

Tacvi hasn't been cleared yet.  Tunat'Muram Cuu Vauax is, maybe, the last boss in Tacvi.  He doesn't look like all the other bosses in GoD either!<br />
He's a cross between an aneuk and a kyv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great write up. Wonderful to read and try to understand a bit more of what is going on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Breakdown in Communications is a great read.  It fills in the details about what happened after Mordrin Rasp and company find out that Taelosia exists and before they start shipping adventurers there en masse (hint: like stereotypical uberguilds, they tried to get there first and get all the goodies before everyone else arrived; unlike such guilds, they're mostly going to have to be cleaned off the walls with a sponge).  <br />
<br />
The quest itself is interesting, and the rewards are phenomenal, but its a major undertaking that will need support from quite a few people (probably a guild) to get very far.  Oh, and the event in the bubble in Qinimi?  It makes congealed evil look friendly.  I hate it, and I'm stuck there with like the next 6 steps done and waiting.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
Oh ... and I'm sure someone will ask eventually.  No, I don't get the whole deal with the Grozmok Stone.  I think that's something that will finally be cleared up in Omens.  I hope.  For now, its in the same category as Trushar - stuff that I just haven't got clue one about.  Speaking of Trushar, by the way, why does an angry and destructive false god of the oceans let us heal 630 hp/tick?  Not that I'm knocking the spell or anything, but ... it just doesn't strike me as the kind of magic that personifies unrighteous anger, you know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, take EQ evolution manual and read the impressive Classic, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin lore.  Then throw your manual away cuz here's the 411, G...<br />
<br />
Gods got tired of bein camped and no longer commune in any way with Norrathians (yet people on FV STILL have macro's like 'Tribunal aids me in smiting my foes!' and such), instead a tribute guy takes all your crap and casts spells on you that you can toggle on and off.<br />
<br />
We found another continent that we never knew existed, wow, whaddayaknow, we're even MORE moronic than we thought!  Maybe if our BOATS weren't freaking broken, we would have FOUND the place earlier.<br />
<br />
Oh hey, bob, what's that over yonder?  Looks to me like an alien samurai warrior and one of the Olson Twins with a Barbra Streisand nose and white hair, and looks like they fighting... and now he's practicing his 3hb... can I borrow your gnomish telescope, Bob?  I think I can... (Bob and Jim are cut short as Cragbeast Queen bites em in half).<br />
<br />
ENTER MORDEN RASP:  Oh, nooo!  Within the space of 6 un-proofread paragraphs, I have stolen a magical item with my friend... (pause while he checks cue cards) the... dark.. elf.. Tondial (someone off stage yells &quot;That's TONDAL you oaf!&quot;) and my girlfriends all sick and stuff, crap, I better set up a bunch of wayfarers camps and have people kill orcs and vampires ASAP!<br />
<br />
And now, the interplanetary space pirates known as the Muramites, or, in their own tongue, the Pxxxtqylfx'tl'ywixlftp  Qitwwl'xrtln'xes, are going to kill everybody, and its up to us to stop them.<br />
<br />
So basically, they took all the awesome Gods that 989/Verant created, cut them out completely, and put in a bunch of aliens, forgot to convert the Zone/Mob name text file format, somehow LIKED the garble they saw on the screen when they tried to display it, and ran with it.  Omens of War is supposed to be about the aliens getting ready to invade multiple worlds, and I would assume the barbarian and the attractive (yet surprisingly small foreheaded) erudite on the new login screen are Morden and Nedaria.  Firiona Vie can be seen to the left of them, thinking of a way to sue SoE for replacing her photo of 5 years with a hideous one eyed alien hoochymama on the login screen.<br />
<br />
And oh yeah, Caillav's crazy.  Didn't see that one coming.  Also, the whole Grozmok thing has apparently been totally abandoned.  For all I know, some n00b in NERIAK (stupid lazy programmers kicking trolls out...) will wake up and have the Grozmok title.  Wouldn't matter, 90 percent of people I meet try and roleplay yet have never read the storyline.  For all intensive purposes, he's the grozmok, she's the grozmok, you're the grozmok, -I-'m the Grozmok!  It doesn't matter, most people would think you're talking about a variety of cheese.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Theres a storyline?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not to be confrontational, SB, but that's a stunning example of the tendancy of current players to take a &quot;grass is greener&quot; approach, ignoring problems in the past and non-problems in the present to paint a biased picture.<br />
<br />
Almost all of the things you are complaining about as being senseless have very well founded origins in the storyline.  For example, the reason that no one ever sailed west to Taelosia is simple.  They tried, and died.  The Taelosians had wanted their privacy (considering the behavior of many folks in the rest of Norrath, can't say I blame them), and had warded their contintent with a magic that was supposed to dissuade travellers from crossing the sea.  It actually worked better than that (because of the influence of the Trusiq on its casting), and caused people sailing west from Odus to succumb to suicidal despair.  That's why maps of Norrath - even waaay back in the Classic days - label it the Abysmal Sea.  <br />
<br />
The Grozmok story hasn't been abandoned.  In fact, we know that the part it plays is still upcoming.  Calliav has been searching for it - its a big part of the reason he led the Wayfarer's Brotherhood to search through the LDoN zones.  Recently, though, Mordrin confessed that he has it, liberated from LoY when the Brotherhood formed.  Personally, I suspect that the prophecy of the Grozmok will be one of the things required to undo the damage that has been done to the stability of the pantheon.<br />
<br />
Want to talk about an expansion where the storyline doesn't work?  I'll give you one - its Luclin.  The GoD storyline may not be to everyone's liking (I'll admit that its Lovecraftian theme didn't work as well in EQ as elsewhere), but at least it IS a storyline, as I posted earlier.  Luclin is little more than a self-contradictory, nonsensical mess.  Holding it up as &quot;better roleplaying&quot; over GoD is claptrap.  Don't believe me?  Try to follow almost any of the Luclin storyline quests.  Then try to tell me what the Whisperlings are.  Or who the Order of Autarkic Umbrage is, and what its &quot;secret plans that the living will soon fear&quot; are supposed to be.  Tell me anything at all about the war between the subraces of the tegi.  Explain how the thought horrors interact with ANY of the other groups in Luclin, or anything else about them, for that matter.  Try to count how many deities the Shissar managed to utterly and permanently destroy (its at least one, but might be two ... sucks losing count of something like dead gods).  Figure out Vyzh'Dra's gender (this one's trickier than it sounds).  Tell me who built Vex Thal - or most of the other ruins on Luclin.  Tell me anything at all - that makes sense - about Aten Ha Ra (Luclin is the only expansion whose boss has no background story whatsoever, even less than some of the LDoN raid bosses).<br />
<br />
People slam the story of GoD because they want to paint this expansion in the worst light possible to justify their proclamations of doom.  And I'll agree that it was not at all good when it launched.  Certainly, a handful of new models would have done the place some good (or at least a palette shift, like the tegi got), and the various temples really need some differing wallpaper.  But it is by no means justifiable to say that it is SOE &quot;tearing down&quot; the storyline that 989/Verant crafted - much of what we're seeing in GoD and Omens connects to things that have been in-game from the start.<br />
<br />
Oh ... and about the names.  Seriously, people.  Its not like this is the first expansion with bad names.  Try these:<br />
<br />
Frizin Q'Tentu<br />
Gkzzallk<br />
Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek<br />
Kwilrz Vn'Ycxa<br />
Palardiag Dax'Kunoksan<br />
Slani Veekilaleeki<br />
Tarsos Fis'Zaaksen<br />
Warlord Tk'kik'tthik<br />
Xaon Bulzekel<br />
Xeroan Xi'Geruon<br />
Xerskel Gerodnsal<br />
Xlixinar Arcut<br />
<br />
Not a single one of those is a GoD name (if you know where they are all from without looking them up, you need to get out more *grin*).  Included on that list are names from every other expansion (except LDoN), Classic EQ, and many of the add-on areas and zones that were not part of an expansion.  Names that made sense, have an appropriate vowel/consonant ratio, and a limited number of X's and Q's, were never EQ's strong point.  Honestly, I should think people would be happy with GoD names - at least they no longer name the ITEMS like that.  Remember the Collar of Tavuel Xakreum, Wito Xi Tetoracu, or Ishinaear Xiall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nicely written Shabura ... those names in your last post remind me of Akheva Ruins/Ssrasheza/Vex Thal-ish names. And Slim ... that post was funny up to about the sixth paragraph.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A++</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well forgive me for using paragraphs, as opposed to the common incredibly long, hardly legible single paragraph that is the standard.<br />
<br />
And Shabura, my complaint is not with the storyline content.  I think it has real potential.  It's in the presentation... it's just sad.  You can tell they just threw it together.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here, maybe you'll like this one better...<br />
<br />
I'm very happy that all the gods are no longer being followed in the storyline, I'm happy with a story based on poorly developed, static characters and a couple supportive stereotyped support characters who are INCREDIBLY non-dynamic.  I'm also blown away with the ingenuity of the names and the concepts of aliens.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
I have been with this game since Beta IV, and I LOVED the lore back then.  Velious was my all-time favorite.  Defend modern lore all you like, but it simply cannot compare.  Face it, people don't don platemail and magical staves to fight aliens.  If I wanted storyline like this, I would load up Unreal and have a blast.<br />
<br />
Also, storylines with a linear progression and a set &quot;goal&quot; are not mmorpg-friendly.  For example, we have characters who are progressing through an adventure... do we ever see these characters in action outside of story segments that are about as long as one of my posts?  No.  Do we get to participate in fighting Mata Muram alongside them?  No.  Will we see the incredible fight where the characters finally win, assuming they do?  No.<br />
<br />
Yes, you may be able to kill said aliens yourself, but it would be just another raid setting where you take down X mobs for X amount of loot and progression.  I guess this is more an issue of player RP / GM Quest Involvement than the storyline itself, unless, of course, you consider the fact that a storyline that revolves around characters we'll never meet fails to give the player any feeling of impact on the world of which he is a part.<br />
<br />
A good storyline for a MMORPG is one that changes each month based on how the players affect the world.  It's hard to do, with multiple servers, but it is the only one that could work.  The broad, encompassing, yet broad and interpretable faction based story of Velious simply gave us a fantastic backdrop in which to choose our own sides in a conflict.  GoD/OOW just loads up some poorly written text files and puts in a ton of Gauntlet Legacy type, time-limited bashemups, most of which have no content outside of the random Boss NPC shout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I cannot argue that Kunark and Velious were the best for lore.  Perhaps Velious gets the slight nod, but ONLY because so much of Kunark didn't go live with the expansion (later quest additions have helped considerably).<br />
<br />
Do I like the EQ pantheon of gods?  By and large, yes.  Do I think that a storyline about the gods withdrawing their favor from the same armies of mortals who have defiled their planes and disrupted their essences is out of place?  No.  It makes sense.  It would, in a tabletop roleplaying game, make more sense to see more impactful effects of that situation - like reduced powers for divine casters.  But I cannot in good faith sit here and ask for something like that, when traditional class balance is still so wanting.  EQ is not tabletop.  It has to make sacrifices for the playability of the environment.<br />
<br />
And as for the aliens thing ... I guess I'm absolutely all alone here.  I'm a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's works.  I like the theme (and I'm not just talking EQ here) of the incomprehensible horror ... the things man was not meant to know ... the threat from outside space as we perceive it.  Sometimes, it works really well.  Sometimes, it doesn't.  But the continuing success of Lovecraftian fantasy elements in movies and other games made it reasonable to expect that SOE would try it with EQ.  After all, we complain just as loudly when they don't try new things (i.e. spells).  You say, &quot;Face it, people don't don platemail and magical staves to fight aliens. If I wanted storyline like this, I would load up Unreal and have a blast.&quot;  But no one proferred that complaint when we fought actual little green men (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7269) on the moon.  I would argue that a magical culture with platemail and staves as their weapons of war does carry them to battle when faced with opponents, no matter how alien they are.<br />
<br />
There are only a handful of real problems - so far as the plot goes.  <br />
<br />
1) There need to be more ways to get bits of the story.  <br />
There actually ARE more people who give you story parts than their weak-sauce story window and the handful of LDoN Iconic characters.  To be honest, I hate the story window, simply because it provides the impression that you get to learn the story just by reading those updates.  Which, just like its always been, is blatantly untrue.  To learn the story, you have to hail all the weird NPCs in back corners of zones and run all the quests in order to put the parts together.  That's how its always been.<br />
<br />
2) They need to employ less cut and paste duplication.  <br />
I'm bound by the Omens NDA, of course, but I will say that it makes progress in that direction.  Yes, the GoD models are still around.  No, they aren't alone.  And more importantly, the areas look different.  I can identify most zones by a screenshot of the terrain.  That may not directly impact the plotline, but it certainly impacts the believability that there IS a plotline.<br />
<br />
3) They need to ease back on the linearity.  <br />
This is a point we definately agree on.  PoP was linear, but hid the linearity under a veneer of trials and tests that made it tolerable.  And, as much as people felt betrayed by the ending, it prevented the need for a Sleeper's debacle, and (as my original post showed) did help set the stage for later expansions, a sort of forward-continuity between expansions that hasn't been tried much previously (only barely with some Kunark-to-Luclin Iksar plot).  Of course, we don't know how GoD ends, so we may be pleasantly surprised there.  I'll admit, though, I doubt it.  For what its worth, Omens looks like its better in that regard.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to the end of the day, EQ has never been a game about roleplaying.  While you label the LDoN Iconics as non-dynamic, the truth is that EQ has always been about non-dynamic characters.  With very few (recent) exceptions, every NPC says the same thing when you hail them now as they did when you first saw them.  Faction is the only dynamic content ... and its a joke.  I've gone from the Velious dragons' most trusted ally to their most hated adversary more times than I have fingers to count it with.  Right now they love me.  They always forget.  They are thousands of years old, but they'll never learn about betrayal.  Sure, by the time I get to Mata Muram, someone else will have killed him.  But hundreds of people had claimed King Tormax's head before I ever saw him, and every couple of weeks Narandi the Wretched rises again to try to sack Thurgadin.  They tried doing it differently - once.  They made dynamic content, but the only players who saw it as good were the ones who used it as a tool to deny other players the loot that content could provide.  WE made the message clear - never again.<br />
<br />
Until we get real, functional AI, there will never be an actual roleplaying game except where real people are the wheels that drive the plotline.  Yes, GM events are a nice touch in that regard, but (except for the big &quot;Bloody Kithicor&quot; style events, which there DO need to be more of), they, too are ephemeral things that don't impact the world.  If that's what you expect, then you will be eternally disappointed with this - and any - computer game that prefaces itself as an RPG of any sort.  That is a reward sadly offered only through traditional tabletop gaming and a few uniquely player-drived MU*s (I recommend Achaea, although its pvp with an insanely complex combat system that will turn off many).<br />
<br />
But, lest I come across as too much of a Sony apologist ... I'll close with one fact that I think we ALL agree on.<br />
<br />
The LDoN Iconics ... have had their 15 minutes of fame.  Please, move along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
but soe and 989/verant are the same thing<br />
<br />
the main problem is that 2 different &quot;visions&quot; created EQ.  from the beginning smedley was really interested in the interactive and massively multiplayer aspect of EQ but really didn't give a **** about how that was implemented.  he basically created and championed the idea of thousands of people playing a fantasy game online but he was mainly concerned with things like how many people could be supported on a server, how much ppl would pay to play, how he could leverage the brand by branching out into other media etc.  but he really never gave 2 ****s about the lore or about whether there be gnolls in the game or trolls or any of that atmospheric stuff.  he left that to his good friends brad mcquaid, steve clover and GZ... these guys who had the day-to-day implementation of EQ were VERY involved in making EQ not only a massively multiplayer game but a game textured by their own experiences and vision of what roleplaying/muds should be<br />
<br />
for example the idea of factions interacting with various dieties and territorial loyalties was something entirely concieved and championed by GZ.  they were going to go with a standard alignment system (lawful, good, evil, discordant etc) until he came on board and overhauled factions for every NPC.  that sort of thing would largely irrelevant to most game designers as needless fluff but to an old MUDer like GZ it was of paramount importance to the persistence of the world.  your actions would have consequences online.  kill a particular npc and it would have an affect on your place in the world.  eq wasn't very successful in this regard but it's an old tenet of rpgers and the INTENT was there by the people who cared the most to try to inject that sort of texture and lore into the game.<br />
<br />
in fact, almost the entirety of pre-sov lore directly derived from mcquaid and clover's pen and paper experiences.  for example Sir Lucan in freeport was an old character of brad's and similarly FV was a character from old campaigns as well.  all the lore about trakanon (involving iksar and in the original version... trolls), FV, the dwarves of butcherblock and the opposing twin cities of freeport and queynos and the splintering of the erudites is stuff that brad himself wrote while he was developing the backstory for the design document for eq in 1996.  basically all of antonica was merely an expansion of the pen and paper universe of brad and steve.  kunark was all the stuff they thought up when developing antonica and faywder but couldn't fit into release.  velious was the natural extension of where trakanon came from.<br />
<br />
as I'm sure everyone knows mcquaid oversaw the lore up through SoV until smed forced his old friend out for monetary reasons and the lore is actually very tight and very linear to that point.  your point that SoL is the ****tiest and most dissassociated lore is actually imo a very astute one.  practically speaking sol was the first expansion after brad and steve left sony.  the kernal of the idea was what happened to the kerrans... but really the rest of SoL is just crap that is more or less dissassociated with whatever preceded it, and also what followed is.  they actually had a brainstorming meeting where they voted whether to make sol based on the underworld a la the hole or in space.  they didn't know where they were going with sol and it shows.  (i think they compromised by having an underground world IN space... not that that was a good idea)<br />
<br />
the majority of the guys who designed sol after brad and steve left were hired guns.  they were brought on during kunark when the game started to pick up steam but they never really played it.  they didn't have a feel for the game or really understand the intricacies.  since then there's been another generation of designers... most of the sol guys are gone and a lot of the new guys either came up playing eq through QA or were actual players who ended up at sony.  part of the reason the lore is tighter post pop is because the guys who are there understand that that kind of **** is important to people who play<br />
<br />
science fiction derived npc name in eq just isn't kosher.  and although smed could give 2 ****s about it himself, he's enough of a businessman to realize that lore is part of the &quot;brand&quot;<br />
<br />
as far as sony versus 989 versus verant.  yeah there's been some corporate shenanigans mainly revolving around smed and his boss kelly flock trying to figure out the best way to make money from eq but the company has always been held corporately in the same hands.  sony's always owned EQ and paid the developmental costs and the rent and the bills for eq from its inception to today.  creatively it's even more linear.  it's the same studio in every way.  i guess brad's forced exit from sony has somehow warped in urban lore into a buyout of verant by sony or somesuch but that's not in any way close to what actually happened.  it has more to do with playstation 2 and console versus PC games and pc games not being percieved as profitable in the late 90s but it's complicated.</div></div><hr />
