<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In drinal ppl generally buy/sell at freeport bank.  Near bank and in middle of things is reason of course.  Heh I always got lag when running into the market.  Sometimes would lev and walk around on the roof.  I had a game i played called &quot;whose the thief?&quot;  I would summon a bag or food and drop it then walk off.  Then I would see how long it took for someone to grab it.  Then I would yell out, &quot;Has anyone seen my summoned bag?  I lost it!&quot;  Seriously I would laugh like crazy.    So where is the center of trade on other servers?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gfay on Xegony.  In light of the Nexus portals - it seems like a good choice.  It has always been there though, and PreNexus, I always assumed it was some kind of elf or wizard conspiracy :).  Kinda sucks for evil races, as it is hard to bank there.<br />
<br />
These days it would really suck to have to get to Freeport/EC to do trades.  I would bind at the firepots if this was the case I guess.   I don't like depending on porters to get places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tunnel seems best for me just because it's a place with no faction woes, unlike NFP and GFay. In the post Luclin world, it can be a bitch to get to, but back in the day it was closer to any port than NFP and closer to a druid port than GFay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bimaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On Tarew Marr it is EC tunnel as well as /join auction channel. Most people on the /join auction channel are in EC anyway.</div></div><hr />

More of the higher levels are starting to move to the Bazaar though. You need to either have a character bound in the Nexus or just tell them you don't have Luclin. ;)<br />

We have an auction channel now, but there appears to be a fair amount doing both. It's strange to go running through there and see the twin auctions :)<br />
<br />
As for why? I remember long ago (mid-late 1999?) a rumor went aroung that some guild was going to do an auction night in the EC tunnel on fridays. That slowly crept to all other times. GFay has also always had it's share, and other zones have incidental auctions, but EC is it. <br />
<br />
Personally I used to just dump gear on lower-level alts who were playing there- took much of the pain and boredom out of auctioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EC tunnel is E. Marr's auction zone location.<br />
<br />
auction:auction is also used, mostly for mid-upper end gear. <br />
There are generally no less than 50 people on it, though most are advertising selling, not buying.   There is a strong silent minority of shoppers who say little to nothing in #.  And the vocal small minority that think it is their own personal chatline to amaze everyone with their humor or intelligence, although they generally prove to have neither.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On Tarew:<br />
<br />
/join auction, go sit in Bazaar. Weightless coin, a bank in the zone, major manaless transportation one zone away. Ideal.<br />
<br />
If only the code for the Bazaar would get implemented =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">On Luclin:<br />

EC tunnels - which SUCKS since it is so far from any Spire.   Our channel is 'auction' and it's ok.  I *hate* hunting on the moon and having to go to EC to buy an item I see in the auction channel.<br />
<br />
I wish more people would use the bazaar - the only problem with it is that several high lvl guilds seem to have bound most of their peeps there. You'll zone in and there will be 40 naked people just standing around, and it lags the zone horribly.  Maybe it's just my computer, but anytime there are more than about 30 people in Bazaar my frame rates drop to the single digits.</div></div><hr />

EC is still the number one spot.<br />
<br />
Bazaar is full of high lvl toons just sitting on their butt waiting for their guild to do something.  Makes it laggy as heck.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it's your machine. I'm running a 750 with 1/2 gig of ram. The bazaar simply crawls unless I jack my clipping plane down. The nexus runs smooth and normally has more people in it..so somethings just broke there. <br />
<br />
As for auction..it all happens in the EC tunnel on bertoxx. Our /auction channel is basically just a mirror except now you have bored people on raids listening in. <br />
<br />
I've gotten tells like &quot;hey I have x-item for ya..only thing is I'm deep in acryilla...I'll get back to you when I'm done&quot;</div></div><hr />

Heh, I remember thinking, &quot;Oo, it's Friday.  Auction night.  I better get over to EC and see if there's anything good.&quot;  From there it turned into a 24x7 Mega-Mart.</div></div><hr />

Gfay - why, I have no idea, always been like that. <br />
<br />
/join auction gets you the same 15 people selling stuff, and discussions on fungi prices.<br />
<br />
Admittedly tho /auction is helpful. Easy to get quest gems and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think all you Bazaar promoters are missing one critical thing<br />
<br />
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DON'T HAVE LUCLIN?!<br />
<br />
EC = Expansion free. If you can log in... you can get to EC. There's a bank for evils and a bank for goods. Plus it's relatively easy to get faction in NFP for Iksars to bank there aswell. Druids can drop you off in WC easy... and it's not like you'll ever have a problem finding someone to port you. Just join /taxi or whatever your server port channel is. If it costs you more than 20pp start a price war.<br />
<br />
I wish to god there were spires on that side of Antonica though... mainly because all you freaks keep dragging me up to Luclin. :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">On Fennin, the zone used is East Commons.<br />
The channel most widely used for auctions is /join bazaar<br />
<br />
Funny story:<br />
My friend Demetrium somehow became the owner (op) of the bazaar channel one day. I told him about the /chat moderate command and he used it. (the /chat moderate command allows only the ops to talk in the channel. Everyone else isnt allowed to speak in the moderated channel.)<br />
Needless to say, thats a good way to tick 100 people off!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On Quellious it's also EC tunnel with an auction channel. It surprises me how many people sit auctioning in ec who never do on the channel at all. I don't know, when I'm auctioning I want to reach the widest possible market...<br />
<br />
As for why? Long time ago Quellious started doing sunday as a bazaar day in EC. It sorta stuck and spilled over to EVERY day :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I actually saw an honest to god auction in /ooc the other night in EC.  A pair of guys were auctioning off a slew of midlevel items, they would start the bidding at a low amount (100 for a Spine Chill Spear, for example) and then people would bid it up until someone won.  Then they'd haul out the next item.  It was fun, and a lot more interesting than the standard WTS GEBS 2k CCG 1K PST spammed every 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I saw something like that back in the good old days when a fungi cost 10k, some guy had one, and decided to raffel it, 10 tickets sold for 1k, the person who /random 100'd the highest got the tunic, not sure if it worked or if the prize was delivered as promised but it was an interested take on the normal /auc wts crap schitck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">On Terris people still use EC alot. Most people that are in the auc:auc channel are sitting in EC most of the time from what I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">On the Seventh Hammer our auction zone is EC. some people are trying to sell stuff in GFay but its usually bronze/banded and black alloy weapons and the like.<br />
<br />
/join bazaar:bazaar<br />
<br />
is our chat channel for auctions, but it's also full of idiots... so much that friends and I just have OT conversations in the channel until enough people get talking about it to make a separate channel. Example.<br />
<br />
/join SNES<br />
<br />
this channel only lived for one night, but we had a lot of good discussion going on about old school RPG's and other good games.<br />
<br />
/join Kmart:Kmart<br />
<br />
the Ghetto bazaar.  this didnt last too long, but *shrug*<br />
<br />
/join Generalbullsh*t:password<br />
<br />
was a general chat we had for a while, but most people still use the bazaar =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">On The Nameless is /join trade then head to the Bazzar.  At least it's starting to head that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yup Beeg got the Inny stuff... <br />
<br />
Usually 100+ on the market channel at any given time. Not that many in ECom anymore usually low level 20-45 peeps still hang there but I never see more than 50 people in the zone and most of them are newbie hunters.<br />
<br />
Usually what happens is ya just pick a place to hook up on the market channel.</div></div><hr />
