<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm, again one of those long recast clicky effects.  I don't see a clicky slow on ours /hug TA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The effects on our epic 2 have been know since before the release of oow. The clicky is Prophet's Gift of the Ruchu  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6273&amp;source=Test), and the focus is Reverence of the Heyokah  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6289&amp;source=Test). It wont have a right click slow.<br />
<br />
Oh, and notice that the recast time on the warrior 2.0 is 5 minutes, as opposed to the 10 minutes on 1.5.<br />
<br />
My prediction for our epic 2.0 is as follows:<br />
<br />
Catstick of doom<br />
<br />
46 dmg/28 dly<br />
AC 25<br />
STR 20<br />
DEX 15<br />
STA 20<br />
WIS 25<br />
AGI 25<br />
hp 305<br />
mana 325<br />
DR 30<br />
CR 30<br />
PR 30<br />
MR 25<br />
Dot shielding 4%<br />
Regen 2<br />
FT 2<br />
Right click: Prophet's Gift of the Ruchu; recast time 5 minutes<br />
Focus effect: Reverence of the Heyokah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kinda sad that what's supposed to be the &quot;end-all&quot; of warrior weapons is just &quot;the best offhander in the game:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, you need an offhander as much as main hand weapon, and the epic is an excellent choice for offhand, so there is nothing wrong with that. Epic 1.5 is the best offhander available for all but a small handfull of warriors, even among the elite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if thats the case i wonder what the reacast on the clerics will be as theirs is 6 mininutes as it is...<br />
<br />
<br />
3 minutes anyone??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the shaman 2.0 doesn't have clickable slow, then it's a situational weapon, at best.  TA &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd like to see the HoT on our 2.0 be 5 mins instead of 10. <br />
<br />
If I had a TA, I'd probably keep that equipped instead, sure. But if I had a TA, the Epic wouldn't be quite so outrageously better than any of my other items, and so it wouldn't be that much of a sacrifice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SK epic 2.0 has been done too, it also has a 300 second recast delay, so it's highly likely that ours will too. Not that that will be of  too much interest if your not in an Anguish capable guild though :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's amazing how powerful they made the effect of that Cleric epic. In 3 years, this effect will still kick ass, because it scales with the power of the characters.<br />
What will a 500/tick HoT be worth in 3 years?!<br />
<br />
Cleric epic effects are well designed and timeless. Whoever did them, did well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cleric epic effects are well designed and timeless. Whoever did them, did well.The cleric epic should have the same recast as the rest of us. Clerics aren't special. They shouldn't be treated like gods among us or showered with praise when they decide to log in, nor should thier epics be retardedly better than the other classes. I sure am glad they decided to continue the trend from 1.0 into this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Goblins are a playable race now?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;I like the Shaman 1.5 epic better. Get a life clown. The HoT and increase chance to crit are sweet from our epic. Plus our other HoTs stack. You lose buddy. You might have had a chance if you compared the Cleric epic to the druid epic thou.&quot;<br />
