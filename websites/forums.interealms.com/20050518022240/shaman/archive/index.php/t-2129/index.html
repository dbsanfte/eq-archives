<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this should prolly go to the hunting area forums..but no one goes there! :)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to STRESS how fun, and efficient xp is in Paldual caverns for 8-25.  I went from 9-12 in 3 hours soloing..with a troll!<br />
<br />
Im only mildly twinked (1kpp investment), and it's a very manageable soloing zone.  For those that want to make the trip..please learn from my mistake.  I TP'd into nexus..bound at bazaar, and ran into caverns.  Well, THAT side of the caverns is way too tough for a 10 shaman.  The zone you want at that level is the thicket side of the place.  After dying, I had to find a way back from the haven side to the thicket side.  Not very easy.<br />
<br />
What ended up working for me (After the invis wore off mid zone...another death) was to get an interzone evac.  Took me right to the thicket zone from haven side!<br />
<br />
Anyway, the only thing lacking (Ive found) is the lack of &quot;worthwhile&quot; loot.  Granted, I don't need the loot BADLY (100pp left) but I still need to loot cause Im not uber twinked.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the mobs that had worthwhile loot?<br />
<br />
Anyway, happy hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess this thread should be moved then...   :D<br />
<br />
In addition, trollies (or any shaman for that matter) can do the shaman quests on the moon.  Is it just me, or does the noob quests offer MUCH better rewards than in the past??<br />
<br />
I did a simple level 6-8 level quest and got decent sleeves.<br />
<br />
dunno..<br />
<br />
take care</div></div><hr />
