WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!<br />
Edit: BTW, that quote at the bottem from the appeals court is so accurate, it's amazing. Here it is<br />
&quot;Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of culture high and low,&quot; the appeals court said. &quot;To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic, but deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world was we know it,&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I find very interesting  in both society and the news media is the fact that kids are killing kids each and every day. And nothing is said  except on the rare occasion. Gangbangers are shooting up neighborhoods daily. kids kill each other over sneakers, jackets and other articles of clothing. What is being done  about this?<br />
Do we try to ban Nikes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, the hilarious part is when he said video games should be protected by the 1st amendment. LOL, if you're telling me total crap like panty raider, deer hunter and daikatana are protected by the 1st amendment, then I say to you that is total crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok vader, by extenison that video games aren't protected, thus all violent movie aren't protected, thus the godfather seroies isn't protected.  I bet alot of people would disagree with you that the godfather isn't protected.<br />
Plus, ven made an insightful comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's ironic when you see this guy, acting as a crusader for the first amendment, then picture all these horrible games.<br />
<br />
*** does the godfather have to do with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because just because the content isn't great material doesn't mean it isn't protected.  Read it again.  It's not a very big logical leap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crap shouldn't be protected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If parents let them play the games then the games should be made.  Its not like 10 year old kids can afford playstation II's or the games to go with them.  Let parents raise there kids not the courts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Freedom of Speech means you have to let someone express themselves even if you consider it crap, junk or doing nothing to enlighten society. You can't censor it, just because you disagree with it. <br />
<br />
I agree, kick the crap out of parents, make them responsible for their kids and make them raise them. You can't legislate morality or child raising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, vader, I've decided that what you say is, as you call it, &quot;crap&quot;, so lets stick vader in jail because, my virgin, under 17 ears have heard it and been scarred forever!....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that was more of a joke, though much too odd, to be caught as one.</div></div><hr />
