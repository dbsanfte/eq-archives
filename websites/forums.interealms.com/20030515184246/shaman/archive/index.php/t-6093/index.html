<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done this quest twice, one with me and hubbys monk when we had no idea what the reward was and again with my cleric.  I don't recall there being any mention of anything else to be done.<br />

When you speak with Lerin he tells you he's on his way to sell at the Bazaar but there are no guards to escort him. He asks you to escort him in return for one of the items he was going to sell and gives you an unsigned agreement, give the agreement back to him if you want to take him up on the offer and he'll give it back again as a signed agreement. He then starts off toward the Nexus zone and you have to protect him from several waves of mobs.<br />
<br />
Once he gets to the nexus zone he will thank you and ask for the agreement, hand it to him and he gives you a Jasper Kundan Earring LORE ITEM NO DROP  AC: +3 Str: +3 Agi: +3 Wis: +3. <br />
<br />
He despawns at that point if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
The sequential earring quest similar to the Velious Coldain rings and Shawls in Luclin starts in Sanctus Seru and is one terrific pain in the arse as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />

No thanks.</div></div><hr />
