<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I've been regretting since lvl 30 not choosing Innouruk for the diety and getting that stupid snare necklace.  Now at 56 I finally have a use for the Cazic version.  So I want to go do the first cazic quest in paneil easy enough get 4rat liver, uh oh uber camp.  What I dont know is if I'll be able to do it right away.  I dont think I've killed any eurudites but don't knwo about troll faction.  If it is bad does anyone know how to raise it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as what your faction will be I'm not sure.  You can raise your faction killing Kobolds in The Warrens.  Head through the Newb zone and instead of going to the Hole take a left through the cave entrance and kill everything you see.  The teeth can be turned in for faction, food and reward(ringmail armor) as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will be KOS at worst and dubious at best.  I was KOS, but had killed at least one erud on Paineel faction.  It took me about 6 hours of killing in Stonebrunt and Warrens to hit kindly with both Paineel and the Erudin guards.  <br />
<br />
If you don't care about your faction with Erudin, you can gain Paineel faction fastest by killing the guards outside/inside Erudin.  I have heard this is the best route and takes about an hour or so.<br />
<br />
It is worth your time to get both necklaces because essentially they are 2 low cast time, manaless spells.  Before the 10th nerf on the Grey the fear undead amulet + a ranger/SK was a great way to make exp.  At least you can still go to WW with the other amulet and get nice exp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go kill erudites in erudin my faction in paineel went up up VERY fast killin them and the guards i killed where only lvl 30 and very wimpy i went from dub to kindly i think in 20 kills give or take a few</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hunnybumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't want to sound like a n00b but what are the stats etc. on this item and is it possible for an Iskar to get enough faction to do it? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kill lots &amp; lots of kobolds in the Warrens &amp; kill the Erudin guards (very, very easy). I got my faction up pretty quickly. If you can, AE your way through the Warrens (with a wiz/mage friend). Newbies will love you for not looting the corpses.<br />
<br />
I'm currently amiable to the folks in Paineel. :)</div></div><hr />
