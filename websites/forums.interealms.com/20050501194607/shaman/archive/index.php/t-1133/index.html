<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First time poster, hello everyone =)<br />
<br />
My Troll shaman is only 20 now.  I had a fungi when I first started playing him but sold it for some monk gear.  Now that the fungi has shot up (50-70k on my server) I am wondering if it is really worth it for a shammy.  Yah I know fungi regen &amp; troll regen &amp; regen spells own, but worth 50-70k?  I would like to solo a lot, but I definitely plan on doing a lot of grouping too.  I only ask, cuz I would have to sell most the stuff on my retired rogue &amp; monk to get this kind of money back up.   <br />
<br />
Sorry if this is not the correct place to post, redirect me if its not please ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like a lot of things, it depends on what you would give up to get it.  If you have the plat to blow, blow it.  If you would have to sell everything on your monk, and you like playing your monk, then don't (though it is a great monk twink item too!).<br />
<br />
If you think you'll get to 45 soon, just get a jbb.  A LOT cheaper than a fungi, and a LOT more powerful for the soloing shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You found monk gear better than a fungi???<br />
<br />
Anyways, in answer to your questiong, I love my fungi.  Is it worth 50-70k? Think that is stretching things a little bit, but if you have the money, go fo it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JBB &gt; Fungi for soloing ????<br />
<br />
..dunno if i would say that...they both are important for their own reasons IMO but i will tell u this...jbb/fungi/epic = exp machine...now if i could just find the time to do the grinding i would be ok :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes.<br />
Fungi + JBB are the best peices of equipment you can get as a shaman.<br />
<br />
When you hit 60 and get Torpor, the fungi won't be critical.   But before 60 it is a godsend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Key to solo xp over time is doing damage.  Fungi is going to give you about 8 extra mana per tick.  That is one free EBolt every 41 ticks.  So, fungi gives you a chance at 1,132 damage every 287 seconds (tick is 7 seconds?).<br />
<br />
During that same time, jbb gives you a chance at 9,452 damage. <br />
<br />
Even if half you jbb shots are interrupted after the full casting time or completely resisted (a gross exaggeration) and your ebolts are never, ever resisted, the jbb is &quot;only&quot; 4x better ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As a shaman I would try looking for a Fungal Patch Vest dropped in FG.  It's the same as a fungi, but it's more class/race restricted, therefore making it run cheaper than the normal Fungi.  Problem is it's a rare drop and it's rarely sold, but I would keep my eye out for that.  On my server, prexus, I just recently saw one go on auction.  The guy started the biddin at 10k, it ended with a bid for 31 or 36k.  On prexus fungi's are going for 50k+, so it's definitely a cheaper way to go, and i'm sure it's the same on your server.  But like everyone said, fungi rocks, if you can, get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It depends on how much effort/time it takes you to get one.<br />
<br />
If you have the cash sitting around then by all means get get one. <br />
<br />
But if you are short on cash dont worry too much about it and just level. May be different though if you exclusively solo.<br />
<br />
Levels mean way more than gear for a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">numbers are like that...<br />
but you gotta keep yourself alive first.you can't JBB all the time you counted,but fungi is .<br />
<br />
even with fungi and chloro, i still can't JBB 24hr non-stop.the main drawback of JBB-soloing is the fight itself tooks forever.if you spend more mana to kill and use the time to sit/canni/med them back with fungi,i'm not sure which way will be faster.<br />
<br />
more,JBB is for dmg dealing only,fungi is all purpose<br />
<br />
and the most importatnt part,fungi is lv1~torpor,JBB effective range is 45~low 50,i won't care about JBB if i have click spear.i think root/epic 2 or 3 mob at the same time &gt; tugur/JBB<br />
<br />
the pp you spend in fungi does not vanish,you can resell it any day you like.<br />
<br />
they just serve different purpose.they are different items of different kind. i think it's a problem of &quot;whcih to get first will be better&quot; but not &quot;which item is better&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by tinysun <br />
i won't care about JBB if i have click spear. <br />
<br />
Do you have a click spear? It takes a minute and a half to work, takes 9 seconds to cast and does what...1300 damage? The numbers are rough, but the spear is something like half the dps of the JBB (263 in 8 sec). Sure the epic click is very nice...and you can med mana back while it works...but it is in no way a replacement for the bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh yeah, totally forgot about the large race fungi.  I'll have to shop for it. That would be sweet.  I could buy one right away then hehe.  Maybe I'll hold out and wait for one to pop up so I can get a jbb too!  Thanks a ton guys.  BTW, you think a 60 mage, 57 cleric could take out whatever drops the large race fungi tunic?  I've got those chars at my disposal ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What drops the Fungal vest in FG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You might be able to do the slower cycle with a less chance to drop, but I haven't been to FG since they 'nerfed' it, ie. mobs are a bit harder.  I know that with a shaman slowing, at 51 I could tank the mobs easily, but without a shaman, I don't know if your pet could do it.  If you brought a long a monk or something, you might be able to do well.  I know a friend who spent alot of time there trying for a Heart of Fungus, never got it, and never saw the Patch Vest drop either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have neither a fungi tunic, nor torpor, so I cannot comment, but I'm curious to what others think about the fungi tunic after torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true.  Torpor's healing capability for the amount of mana means regen is insignificant.  You're better off selling the Fungi and trying for like a Velious Quest BP or Vindi BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">IMO:<br />
<br />
Bracer &gt; Fungi &gt; Epic as far as items that affect our ability to solo go.<br />
<br />
Fungi &gt; Epic &gt; Bracer as far as items that affect our usefullness in a group go.  I only put the Epic above the bracer for group stuff because of the stats on the spear.  <br />
<br />
The way that I thought about the whole which one do I try for first dilemma was: The bracer is cheaper and will let me farm more cash for the Fungi so get the bracer first.  I got mine for 8k.  The Fungi is expensive but easier to find than a broodling tear so I bought the Fungi next for 50k (ouch).  The Spear requires some luck and help from the guild so it took me a bit longer to acquire, and I got it last.  Sadly, the one that affected my gameplay the least was the epic.  Not to say that I don't love my spear of fate, I just wish the effect was still a HoT instead of a DoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mez been thinking about the same thing.<br />
<br />
Mez is lvl 51 now and have about 13k in da bank, jbb, iksar chestplate, and mez an ogre.<br />
<br />
On my server fungi are going for 70k+   mostly +<br />
<br />
Malo is 15 to 25k unless yoo be Scurg ;).<br />
<br />
Torpor is 35 to 45k.<br />
<br />
For the price of Fungi,  I can get a lot of spells to stick in da bank.<br />
<br />
Mez has been thinking about saving for da fungi but buying major spells when I can get a nice price, but only a nice price.  I expect the price of spells to drop slowly over the next few months as the new drop rates have an impact on da market so mez not buy unless da price is very nice.  Future fungi prices are also likly to drop but I think that is less predictable.<br />
<br />
The extra 10hp per tick da fungi gives over the iksar chestplate is very nice but so is being able to scribe Torpor and Malo when yoo ding 60 instead of half a year down the road.  If I had the 70k right now I think I would buy the fungi but I don't so I think I will just save cash and do what ever I can get the best deal on.<br />
<br />
Not an easy choice and hard to evaluate because I don't know how much work ( lots and lots)  it will be to get to lvl 60 and what kind of impact the fungi will have on the process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have Torpor and ToV BP but still use my fungi for soloing...<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because with my aaxp and in bearform I get 50hp per tick standing. WIth Torpor that is 350hp/tick.  WIth potions and staff etc you can take this even higher (90hp per tick and 65 respectively standing).<br />
<br />
I have never understood the argument that Torpor means put your fungi in the bank.  The more regenerative ability you have the better as the basis of a shamans mana gain is all about converting HP -&gt; Mana.<br />
<br />
Certainly I use my ToV BP when in raid situations but for soloing the Fungi only *benefits* your Torpor spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for the link for the fungi vest.  I was reading the comments and from the looks of it, you gotta be 51 to _equip_ it. That would suck if its true, but at least when I hit 51, i'm sure it will be a lot cheaper than the fungi tunic.  So after reading the comments, I think I might get an ikky regen bp for downtime when im canni dancing and put the psc back on and possibly buy the JBB before I get to 45.  Luckily, I have my cleric (lvl 57) for healing if I'm pl'n or I die.<br />
Plus, I put my rogues piercer on him, 12dmg 20del exq. vel. spear, so he actually does pretty decent melee damage for a lvl 20 ;) <br />

I think we can all agree on the &quot;standing&quot; regen -- but is sitting really six points less at these two levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you can afford a fungi, go for it.<br />
It's a good investment, an outstanding item.   Not only can ya use it on yourself, but you can use it to PL your twinks too!  ;)<br />
<br />
I would sell my JBB long before I would sell my fungi.<br />
<br />
I have a Wolfcallers BP, but still find myself using my fungi often at level 60.  Yes, I have torpor.  When I am in fast paced duo or trios, I can't stand around torporing all the time.  Usually I am pulling or we are moving around.  In a good easy exp group it doesn't seem to take more than like 40 or 50 seconds to kill your mobs.  <br />
<br />
So effectively making myself immobile, with the cast time and snare effect on torpor, for 30 seconds is a pain.  So canni4 when I can, regen and fungi healing me non-stop... I manage my mana a lot better.<br />
<br />
2 more points for Canni5, then I think it will be a different story.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
then do you have a bracer?you should notice a JBB fight last more than 4 min usually .the main point is that druing all this time <br />
 you're not able to do anything other than stand and get hit.plus the main part is that you can't fight more than 1 mob at the same time.epic,on the country,can act on 3 mobs at the same time if you want to.<br />
<br />
talk about killing one mob.JBB is faster.but you don't fight just one mob and logout do you?spear = multi-root/rot.i'm talking about overall exp speed.<br />

don't get fooled by numbers.</div></div><hr />
