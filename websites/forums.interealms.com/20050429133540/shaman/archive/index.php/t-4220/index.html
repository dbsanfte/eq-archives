<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">trying to figure out how to get Playername and Guildname into the title bar of the spell book. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there is any simple way of doing this unfortunately. As far as I know you can't embed the label commands and the eqtypes that corrispond to the guild name and player name into the title of the title bar. The best you could probably do was use some blank char as the title of the title bar and manually position the labels for guild and play name over the title bar. Not even sure it that will actually work tho. Not sure what would happen when you tried to display something over the title bar altho you can try it.</div></div><hr />
