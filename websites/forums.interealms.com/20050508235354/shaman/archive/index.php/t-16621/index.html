<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in a small guild. Total members 36, but that is not a true indication. Most days we are between 4 and 8 online and sometimes 2 full groups. Very rarely more than that. Most of us are 60 65 (with 65 most common) a few in the 55 - 60 range.<br />
<br />
Now what can we do in EQ? As long as there are 4 - 6 online it its ok. We can do LDoN or normal xp groups. As soon as we are more than that we have to start leaving people out as LDoN is very unforgiving in this regard. The problem for us is that we are rarely enough to form 2 groups and using a raid to do an xp group is just plain silly with the poor raid xp.<br />
<br />
When we decide to form a raid with 12-18, there is hardly anything for us to do. The few raid type mobs we can do have to be timed to know when they are up. It would be pure luck for us to find anything that is a challange. Usually we end up spending an hout looking for a traget and then just go to tactics and farm piglet or something with a raid!?!?!<br />
<br />
Is there anything in EQ that is aimed at guilds like ours??? I was hoping for LDoN, but that proved to just make things worse for us. Can't raid and even if we happen to be 8-12 online so that it would be possible to do two LDoN groups we don't have the class mix to make that work. So we have to leave people out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Are there any other guilds like ours? Or are all other guilds so much bigger that they don't have this problem? Am I just looking for something that just doesn't exist?<br />
<br />
And yes, I can see that some of these issues are the same for a big guild but in a different way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like your guild is in a delicate spot...you want to kill more, but you can't.<br />
<br />
Most guilds your size are composed of good (often RL) friends who just want to be able to use guildchat with each other and hang out. But you don't, you want to progress. The only real way this is going to happen is if you bulk up on members. That's just the way the game is made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, my bad. Should have said that that was not our goal. We just want to have fun. Not get 'uber' equipment. Granted improving gear is great, but that is not our major goal.<br />
<br />
For us doing a raid would be for fun. Not for the reward. You hit the nail when you described us as friends (albeit EQ friends, not RL friends). The rest was incorrect. We play together. Most of us never ever do pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Getting better gear is a bonus, but not a driving force. The problem we have is that we are punished by raids not giving xp and groups beeing limited to 6. That would be ok if we could raid when we were more than 6. But there are hardly ever anything up that we can raid with 6 - 15.<br />
<br />
So group and leave the latecommers out or make a raid that does the same thing the xp group did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild is very similar to yours. We are usually 8-10 people online and all friends for almost 2 years now. (EQ not RL) What I started was a weekly EU night. Every Thursday we pick one spot and all go there, no matter how many are on. UP is good as well as Akheva for these nights. Veksar can also be good. We are all around level 60-65 as well. UP you have the shots at various minis up and can be a lot of fun. Dark Masters are level 60 mobs and give good AA experience and can spawn Doomshade. Then on Sunday nights we have planes group nights. We chose a plane and go there with 1 or 2 groups NOT in raid mode. Just have people come and go with no stress of having to stay so long or a hard to get to place. The rest of the week we group as we can, adding in people from planes channel or LDoN channel as we need. Knowing that we will all get together on Thursdays and Sundays helps people know that we are not excluding them from what we are doing at the time they log on. It really has worked for us. The reason we have all been together so long is that we know we are one big clicque. Instead of the huge guilds out there where if you're not in that certain clicque, you end up in pick up groups the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">looking at your magelo assuming the rest of  ya are equiped as decently. best thing bout small guilds is there perty  tight  nit  so play well off each other.<br />
even if just as equiped as ya can become just  shopping  in the bazar ya would have a good chance at any of the  below <br />
<br />
with the  12-18 ya can some times  get <br />
<br />
all 3 kings yelnak, dain, t-max. <br />
<br />
dain is spawnable  could  if have few peeps ready kill him off at your convience<br />
<br />
yelniak  has a 4 guard  dragons once ya  get the ruetine down  could take them out. then maybe yelniak him self  its rooted gives ya alot of room to work.<br />
<br />
tmax give and take depends if you got someone to pull him.<br />
<br />
<br />
you could take the  dragon in dn  zalandasomething. a can get your selves some st  keys there<br />
<br />
west wing  dragons in tov (the one near  zone out  drops a st  key and out in ww.<br />
<br />
griegs and servator of luclin in gregs end.<br />
<br />
doom and rc in up<br />
<br />
the 4 tower bosses  in bot<br />
<br />
the burrower in deep and ac<br />
<br />
the caller quest in fg<br />
<br />
the  4 warders in st  and the 2  near zone after some  key  farming<br />
<br />
vindi <br />
<br />
r1 and2 in ssra(the snakes that spawn  arch lich what ever its called on your server)<br />
<br />
the giant  lords on pos<br />
<br />
kata<br />
<br />
the  dragon in vp <br />
<br />
assuming your server  like mine none of these are all the contested any more bound to find  1 or 2  up when ya can get a raid force on.  some  harder then others none will will make the the talk of the server  but sure enough would  be plenty fun to  kill off with a small force</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think there is still lots that smaller guilds can do and be happy with as long as you don't look at Elemental+ guilds as being the norm.  The real trap most people seem to fall into is looking at one to many Magelos and feeling like they got passed over and that EQ &quot;wasn't made for them&quot;.  EQ has LOTS of middle ground with content that does not take a Quarm-sized force.<br />
<br />
Most Velious and Luclin mobs can be done with less than 36 peeps easily and some of the lesser mobs in PoP as well.  Kaison has some great suggestions for smaller guilds above.<br />
<br />
You may even consider an alliance with a guild that is in a similar position if you are looking for a bit more flexibility in your raid schedule.  Sometimes an alliance can lead to a merger and definitely open up some targets for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I disagree kaison, with quite a few of your 12-18 person hits. Some because of revamps(zlandicar), some because of actual mob toughness(12 people on yelinak? I don't think so, especially not with people pre-elemental). Bot tower bosses? Even wtov named are very dependent on class make up..if you don't have at least two clerics and a good set of dps, your mana is going to run out before they die. <br />
<br />
You want fun? Go kill the kunark dragons with just your 4-8 people. Take your 12 and kill vindi. *shudder* Maybe even get everyone to do the VP key quest*/shudder* and take your 2 groups there. Or first tier PoP, like the minis in PoN or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hate to be the contrary one in this thread but unfortunately Merrygrin, all things considered, your guild (like many others btw) is probably the odd one out. Though Papabear is right, there are a lot of encounters you can do now that would be very challenging. The problem is, those same encounters can be done by people who a) play more and/or b) are better equipped (and thus, the encounters pose little to no challenge). Thus, they're rarely alive for more than a few hrs after spawning.<br />
<br />
The game is fairly long in the tooth so there aren't as many guilds progressing through expansions as there once was. A lot of folks are levelling up much faster and choosing to join big guilds that are leaps and bounds beyond their experience level (i.e. a person can level to 60 or even 65 and join a Luclin+ guild without ever doing a single Kunark or Velious level raid). Thus, the steps of progression that many of the oldtimers remember are no longer required. The smaller/more casual guilds who have always progressed slower than their larger counterparts often find there isn't much of a pool to recruit from unless they drastically lower their level requirements. But even that causes its share of problems (like, how would you like to be a low/mid 50s member of a guild that's mainly 60+?). Of course, this is just the opinion I inferred from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
NToV can be done by as few as 2 groups (maybe not in its entirety but I really doubt many small guilds have the consecutive hours available to worry about that) and doesn't require elemental level gear to do. Never underestimate how much 5 levels PLUS 2 expansions worth of AAs can trivialize previous &quot;uber&quot; encounters. As Kaison mentioned, the Crusaders outside Yelinak's chamber would be very challenging as well. A GOOD (by skill, not necessarily gear) 2-3 groups can kill Yelinak. With elemental gear, you can single group him. Jharassik, you'd be surprised at what folks can do when they TRY. There was an Aussie guild on Tholuxe (Wreckers) that used to pride itself on what it could kill with minimal numbers. Telkorenar with 18, pre-PoP with no NToV/ST gear? I wonder if Silkenshammie (the leader of Wreckers during that period) still comes by here :)<br />
<br />
In my view, many guilds like Merrygrin's and Genine's don't want loot pinatas. They just want encounters that will challenge them without requiring zerg tactics or more members than they have. What I would suggest to them is perhaps try allying with similar guilds so in the event you do find a challenging mob available, you can try it out. Honestly, with EQ being as old as it is with as many people entering the high end (in level if not content progression), the people feeling the pinch more now seem to be the smaller guilds. Don't know if there's anything that can be done to remedy that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Advice from someone below 60, so it might not count for much:<br />
Think outside of the box. There is somthing to do outside of planes, arent there? Like owning one of the cities. Loot might not be good, but would be fun. Killing all GMs in one of the cities might be hard. Set the challenges yourself. Then your aiming for accomplishments, not loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem we have is that we are punished by raids not giving xp and groups beeing limited to 6. <br />
<br />
Don't form a raid - you can use guild chat to communicate.  Instead try to balance out the groups so they both get a fair share of the kills.  Easier said than done tho I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Basically I think I'm just whining (pass the cheese plesase). <br />
<br />
Raid encounters fall into three main categories for us.<br />
<br />
- Can't do because of faction (Used to be a RP guild and people doing shawl and things).<br />
- Mobs are too hard. This is a given, and not an issue.<br />
- Mobs are never up. Main problem. Kills us more than guilds that raid more often since we raid once a month at the most (less and less due to lack of targets). Basically we can't find targets that are up. Mini bosses in PoS is about it. But if we wanted to do the same raid over and over it would be for equipment.<br />
<br />
Things that are perfect for us are the epics (but we are done with most of those) and long quests like shawl where we can help eachother.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there is not much more. I get the feeling that EQ is about two things and two things only nowadays. BIG raids and xp grinding in a group. There is nothing in between.<br />
<br />
In big raids I also include raid often as there are minor targets. By raiding seldom you will never get to them though.<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS A lot of the targets listed here are either not up or too hard for us. Because of our size we seldom have the ideal raid setup in regards to classes and our equipment is not as good as others. I'm definatley high end in our guild.</div></div><hr />

      I think the kaison list is not adjusted.The question is...can you kill vindi ? Dont even try the kaison list if you can't.<br />
<br />
       Well even if you can't ,there some mob : <br />
<br />
Burrower in acrylia , Lcea Katta , The ring of slime in CT ,all named in PoN (except mukaji and including the maze event) , Prototype in PoI (would be tough ,specially the first) , klandicar ,doomshade ,rumblecrush ,aramin (in pod)....ect<br />
<br />
ps : oh you have acces to tactic ,so Glykus and overseer are perfect for you  :cool:  (hinvat ,vinta and anival too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The guild I'm in is similiar to yours. One thing that helps is that we have enough druids to go around looking for what named are up. Our biggest problem is lack of DPS. We have no rogues and only one beastlord, 2 epic rangers, 2 epic wizzies. The rest are druids, shaman, enchanters, 3 epic warriors, 4 clerics(3 with rezz stick) and lots of lots of paladins :)<br />
<br />
At one time we struggled to take down anything but recently we've done DS, Zlandicar, Vindy, CT, BoT tower bosses, acidic mass, named gater in PoN, PoI Dragon(but we keep getting the gnome killed so no key hehe),etc.. When we lack DPS it hurts and we usually have to invite some friends to help out but for the most part we have a lot of fun with the people we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Our guild is very similar to yours in size - we typically raid with about 15 people total. We raid once or twice per week.<br />
<br />
Our EZ Board is full of strategy and discussion on killing raid level mobs with very small numbers. Feel free to look around and get some ideas.<br />
<br />
Serenity's Tears (http://pub18.ezboard.com/bskylarkschallenge) <br />
<br />
We mostly raid Planes of Power targets. BoT Tower Bosses, Paffa in CoD, Xanamech, Maenetic Prototypes, Annival the Blade, Shadow Master Vinta, Hinvat Deathbringer, Glykus Helmir, The Diaku Overseer, Mujaki the Devourer, etc.<br />
<br />
We recently took down Vallon Zek with 15 people.<br />
<br />
If these seem too hard, you all may want to start with Derakor the Vindicator and/or Velketor the Sorcerer. They were great learning mobs for us.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo, to give you an idea of what kind of gear we have:<br />
<br />
Ximix Mixim (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=343647)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Zlandicar would be a pushover for a group of 12.<br />
<br />
My guild does him pretty frequently with 6 with gimpy gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a reflection:<br />
<br />
Funny how this turned into a list of targets that our guild could do. Although appreciated, not exactly what I was whining about. Although I guess it is kind of part of the whining.<br />
<br />
Now that we have the list of targets. Could someone make them avaliable on the days we happen to want to do a raid??? <br />
<br />
Again, we are not nor will we be a raiding guild. But it would be fun if we could do it on occasion.<br />
<br />
My complaint in a nutshell: Either you have a raiding team online often/regulary or you will never get to raid at all.<br />
<br />
As hinted at before what would be good raid targets for us is farmed by the ones equiped to do so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am not sure that I get your point?<br />
<br />
You can do LDoN, right? Therefore hence or otherwise you have relatively &quot;fun&quot; adventures whenever you want them, aimed at small numbers.<br />
<br />
If you want more, the list of possible mobs to take down is, frankly, enormous. I mean, who does Kunark dragons any more? Who does ToV any more, who does Vindi / AoW / Tormax / Dain etc? all the big guilds have moved on. Some or all of the aforementioned are doable with relatively small numbers. I know that even my non-uber guild can take out Rumblecrush and Doomshade in UP with 2 - 3 groups without breaking sweat. perhaps NToV mobs might be too tough with small numbers, but HoT can certainly be done with small numbers. How about the revamped plane of Hate?<br />
<br />
On top of all that, you have all the oddities like, for example, Plane of Mishief or Veeshans Peak - they are good for small numbers of people, and are not exactly crowded.<br />
<br />
Are you all flagged for Sleepers Tomb? I'm guessing not, so that could be a goal (primals are still pretty nice for the melee classes).<br />
<br />
Like I say, the problem seems to be too much choice rather than not enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I should really stop posting these as it makes me look like a whining cry baby (and I hate that even though it is true in this case).<br />

A nice list again. Pitty that the mobs are not up WHEN WE HAPPEN TO HAVE THE PEOPLE ONLINE. Sorry for shouting but this is the point Ihave been trying to make. I do see the odd Kunark dragon up once in a long while. They are never (except when we get truly lucky) up when we have a force capable of taking them though.<br />
<br />
I love LDoN. I hate the fact that I have to tell two friends that they can't join me because we are in an adventure that we started when 5 of us were online and during the adventure two more from the guild logs in.<br />
<br />
Hate is just another xp zone. One that we spent MANY hours in after revamp. Nothing there for a raid (we can't take the raid targets there. Not even close). Admitedly I have never been to PoM but I suspect it is the same thing.<br />
<br />
VP, not gonna happen. Trak is on the very upper end of what we can do. Odds that he are up when we have the force. Just a notch above nil. To get even a group flaged would take us a couple of years (slight exageration, but not by much).<br />
<br />
Things would be different if we were a guild that always had our 12 - 15 online. We do not.<br />
<br />
I will shut up now. I only look stupid repeating myself.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">While you may feel that LDoN isn't suited for your guild, I think you're wrong.  Sure you can't do the raids because there aren't enough people to do them.  Consider what it was like before LDoN to get decent items though.  There aren't many mobs you can do to get items worth keeping with two groups.  At least in LDoN you can group on your own and accumulate points to purchase some nice items and augments that will help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok as I see it you have two problems. One, you don't really have any formalized raid time for your guild. Two, your having trouble finding mobs when you do have a raid force on. <br />
<br />
Sit down with your guild and pick some time when most can attend for a raid time. As a small guild you have to try and focus your strength by getting everyone on. Big guilds can get away with calling impromtu raids with who ever is on hand. Having a raid force in hand makes things alot easier. Also, having a set raid time is alot more important with LDoN, because you shouldn't have your people spread out doing adventures forcing 90 minute delays.<br />
<br />
Ok, your raid force is on now to find something to kill. This isn't as hard as you make it out to be. You may not find the mob you really want up, but there is always something. Sit down and make list of raids with-in and just beyond your guilds ability. On raid night ( or day ), send out the trackers and go down that list. Learn the spawn time of the mobs on those lists. Vindi spawns every 8 hours, so if your raid day is Saturday (or Sunday) you may find that he isn't up in the morning but he will be up in the evening. Some things are always up as well. Someone mentioned the Caller quest in Fungus Grove, that would be a good fall back target. The Halls of Testing in ToV rarely runs out of mobs. The PoI Dragon (prolly a bit beyond your guild but ya never know....) is spawned by handing in quest pieces to a gnome who will spawn again a couple hours after someone else has done the raid. I will however say that highly contested mobs like Torrmax you aren't likely to find when you want. Even when you do don't expect 2 tries at him.<br />
<br />
Finally keep adding mobs to that list, keep pushing the boundries. As your raid more you will get better at it. Your guild will also get better equiped.<br />
<br />
Edit: A starter list for you<br />
Vindi - this is a test mob of your guilds raiding ability. Tactics learn from doing him will come up again and again. Easily tracked by a Rallos Zek worshiping ogre.<br />
Grieg's End - Grieg may be beyond you but I doubt that the Servitor of Luclin or Praetorean Myral are.<br />
PoN - That over sized Croc (i forget his name) spawns fairly quick, The Spider Matriarch, The Hobgoblin Lord (spawned by going thru a cycle of lesser mobs.<br />
ToV - Doz the cursed in HoT, Gozz and Telk in WToV (1 dragon kill wont screw your faction too badly just go kill Vindi next time)<br />
Kunark Dragons - All happen to spawn in zones with a druid/wizard port. Drop someone and give the zones a quick check.<br />
Seb - I bet Trak is up more often than you think. One easy way to find out is to have someone cast eye of zomm while facing into a wall. The eye will pop up somewhere in zone. Eventually it will end up in Traks lair.<br />
The Hole - have someone create a halfling brell worshiping rogue and run down him to Yael's room.<br />
Fear - Send a brave (or expendable ) druid in for a quick tracking of the mini's and Cazic.<br />
Cazic Thule - Ring of Slime, Gnome walk.<br />
Umbral - a number of mobs here.<br />
Katta - Lcea Katta (tricky mob but fairly easy when you get the tactics down), Nathyn good robe for ench and necros (just one long boring fight).<br />
Acrylia Caverns - A number of things you can do here, some highly contested like the wurm (his named is changed now) and some like the High Priest event always up (*havent spent any time here really since revamp*).<br />
PoS Frog Event - kill all the frogs in the middle of the zone to get a named froglok to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Poster above has left a good list for you to start on, personally I think it looks like you are not trying hard enough to find targets, for that you need dedicated scouters and you need to do a little research on your targets and maybe even keep time on when things go down and will repop.<br />
<br />
A dedicated raid night or several sounds like a good suggestion as well (get people used to logging in at a certain time/night and you may have a good/better turnout).  If you could get 18 on there are tons of targets you could do that either spawn every x hours, or you can spawn.</div></div><hr />

I have a pretty good understanding of what it takes to be a raiding guild (or one that raids frequently). That is not and has never been our goal.<br />
<br />
I wish my grasp of the english language was better, becuase I can't seem to get this point across.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for sugestions on how we can increase our raiding time. I was asking if EQ discouraged a guild that does what we do. Not what we can do to adopt to EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm in a small guild. Total members 36, but that is not a true indication. Most days we are between 4 and 8 online and sometimes 2 full groups. Very rarely more than that. Most of us are 60 65 (with 65 most common) a few in the 55 - 60 range.<br />
<br />
Now what can we do in EQ? As long as there are 4 - 6 online it its ok. We can do LDoN or normal xp groups. As soon as we are more than that we have to start leaving people out as LDoN is very unforgiving in this regard. The problem for us is that we are rarely enough to form 2 groups and using a raid to do an xp group is just plain silly with the poor raid xp.<br />
<br />
When we decide to form a raid with 12-18, there is hardly anything for us to do. The few raid type mobs we can do have to be timed to know when they are up. It would be pure luck for us to find anything that is a challange. Usually we end up spending an hout looking for a traget and then just go to tactics and farm piglet or something with a raid!?!?!<br />
<br />
Is there anything in EQ that is aimed at guilds like ours??? I was hoping for LDoN, but that proved to just make things worse for us. Can't raid and even if we happen to be 8-12 online so that it would be possible to do two LDoN groups we don't have the class mix to make that work. So we have to leave people out in the cold.<br />
<br />
Are there any other guilds like ours? Or are all other guilds so much bigger that they don't have this problem? Am I just looking for something that just doesn't exist?<br />
<br />
And yes, I can see that some of these issues are the same for a big guild but in a different way.<br />

There are no boss mobs currently that I can think of that are aimed at guilds like yours.  Sorry.  Unless your folks decide to change their play style, it will just be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, Merry, here is my cut on it.  Many of the guilds are though with much of the content mentioned here.  If you create gimps, lvl 1 characters and plant them at the mob spawn points, you can easily cycle through your characters to see what is up when you have force to raid with.  I understand you feel that nothing is up when you have force, and maybe sometimes that is true.  But if you scout once force is online, you will find something some percentage of the time.  Now to increase your chances of getting a mob when you have force, I would suggest to your guild that they try raiding, say once every 2 weeks, at a very odd hour.  I used to get up at 4:00 am and raid till I left for work around 8:00 am.  I just went to bed early the night before.<br />
<br />
If you just want to reinforce your belief that nothing will be up when you have force, that is your prerogative.  However, it will not improve your current situation.  You have to believe that there are solutions out there that can work with the time, resource and equipment constraints that you have with your guild.   In the end, it's really up to you and your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They missed the mark with the LDoN raids big time....   Big guilds don't want to do them 'cause of the 36 person limit, small guilds can't do them because they're too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/agree Warador<br />
<br />
Skelter, thats good advice. Never thought about that.Don't know for sure that we can easily get lvl 1 chars to spots where they can keep track of targets, but it is definitely worth trying. Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Competition for spawns is hardly the exclusive problem of small guilds! Indeed, the fact that your guild is small counts you out of the running for the bulk of the most fiercly contested spawns. The bulk of the hardcore raid orientated guilds will have moved on to bigger and better things , so, in fact, you probably have less competition for your potential targets than larger guilds do. Mobs are either up, or not up, regardless of the size of your guild?<br />
<br />
When a mob spawns it spawns for everyone. If a given mob is not up, that merely proves that somebody got there before you - and that says nothing about the size of your guild.<br />
<br />
Obviously, dynamics differ from server to server, and not having a toon on your server, I cannot speak with any authority on the speed at which mid-level target mobs get dropped in your world, but in mine, the fierce competition is mostly gone now - Kunark is almost a ghost town, Velious is getting that way too. Back in the days when competition for these mobs was fierce, we had lowbie alts camped at relevant spawn points, but these days it doesn't seem to be necessary, because these mobs are not fiercly contested any more....but maybe that is just the vagaries of my server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Are small guilds discouraged in EQ? <br />
<br />
Yes.  It is easier to make content to entertain people 75 characters at a time than it is to make content that entertains small agile groups.<br />
<br />
Think about it.  You are in charge of allocating resources to design zones and encounters.  You have  a choice in front of you.  Spend a certain amount of man hours on an encounter that can be done with 6 to 12 people, or spend the exact same amount of time on an encounter that takes 75 people.  Which one has more bang for the buck?  75 &gt;&gt; 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That may be true Gandalph, but that mentality was obviously not the driving force in LDoN. Furthermore, I remember when my guild needed 50 people to camp KD arena for Thrgy quest armor drops (we couldn't even dream of taking out Vindi) whereas now, I duo the arena (63 shaman 63 pally), just for the hell of it. So, by default, a lot of content that was designed for large numbers is no do-able by very small numbers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Merry, I think you hit on a problem that a couple of guilds that I have been in have had.  One of them grew and became a raiding guild to solve the problem (bah), and the other merged with another guild to try and solve the problem (bah).<br />
<br />
Maybe an alliance is the way to go for you.  Make a pack with a couple of other guilds, and this will allow for some mild raiding content (just to add spice), and some extra bodies to fill the groups, that way you won't be a true raiding guild, but still have people to draw on to experience some of the bigger content.<br />
<br />
Also, it sounds like you guys don't wait for critical mass (1 group) because critical mass may not happen every night.  To me, this is a sign that you need more people in your guild.  Make new friends that don't want to raid, and get them in your guild.  That way there is always a group on line every night.  Keep adding people that meet your standards until that happens, and you should see an improvement in the enjoyment factor.<br />
<br />
I know I have been online with nothing to do at times when the rest of the guild set up a group and is too deep for me to join them.  It sucks, but its the game.  It's those times that I log off to play an alt., read a book, watch a movie, or actually do something productive.<br />
<br />
I am sorry to hear your woes Merry.  I hope some of this helped in some way.  The sad truth might just be that the peak of your enjoyment of the game has come and gone.  I know mine has, but that hasn't stopped me from trying to find something new to peak my enjoyment once again.</div></div><hr />
