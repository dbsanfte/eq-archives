<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I am a lvl 35 Troll Shaman on the Saryn Server.  I've got about 100 pp to my name and have basically been spending the past 2 lvls working on alchemy with whatever little cash I scrounge up.  Seeing as though I am still not really at a point where I can safely make SoW potions, I determined that Alchemy would probably not be the best of ideas as I attempt to save for a JBB&gt;<br />
<br />
Assuming the Bracer runs roughly 16k on Saryn and Alchemy is just not going to help me get there any faster (aside from HG's being that we're really only talking lvl 44 and up with efficiency), are there any suggestions on a good money-making strategy for the next 10 lvls?  16k seems like an awful amount of cash :)<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go hunt as normal for the next 5-10 lvls, then get alchemy up to 70 so shrink potions are trivial, then selling SoW, IVU, lev, EB, and shrink potions (theyre all trivial at 70)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Asyn.  Your earning potential is so much higher at lvl 45 than at lvl 35.  Just concentrate on levelling for a while, then invest in Alchemy (I did it until Shrink was trivial, around 80) and hawk SoW potions whereever you go.<br />
<br />
Best places I've found for selling SoW potions are Firiona Vie/Dreadlands and Thurg/Great Divide.    If all you're doing is selling potions, pop back and forth over the zone line and auction in both zones periodically.  I tended to go to DL, solo a few things, auction, and then med a bit; if I was really selling hard, I'd gate back to FV to auction again and finish medding, then run back to DL for the next kill.  Of course, you lose your pet, but those are the breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Option 2:  Go to SolA and hunt for named and keeelll anything holding a weapon.  Zone to LS, sell, rinse, repeat.  I have to say though that this is likely not the best option.  It'll take WAY too long and will slow down your exp (at 35, there really is only so much that will still cough up exp in sola).  Keep in mind that lvls&gt;gear for a shaman (for most classes) and that you'll be better off killing stuff for exp rather than loot.  Besides, you can't use the JBB till 45 anyway (the effect that is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">16k on Saryrn????  I thought it was more like 20-30k. I have yet to see a JBB on auction, but always see people wanting to buy and &quot;paying very well&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here's another option for raising fast cash:<br />
<br />
&quot;Daytrade&quot; - i.e. buy and sell in NFP.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I've been daytrading on and off on Saryrn for months now and have made a substantial amount of money. Buy low, sell high. There are always people that are in a hurry to offload their loot at crazy prices - just takes a little patience to wait for a really good deal. Start off with small ticket items and work your way up to the big stuff. Easy platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">got mine for 12 on saryrn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice deal!! When did you get it?<br />
<br />
I need to start looking for one as I creep closer to that magical level . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honestly, you can't even use the darn thing for another 10 levels anyway.  Even then, you need to be able to find it once you turn 45.  Actually, following guides on this site can take you from 46-56 in like 2 weeks with a JBB, so just get the 10 levels first, then go camp someplace with gem drops or gear.  Maybe get a reliable partner an camp Seafury cyclopses or KC or something.  It'll be much easier to get cash at 45 than it is at 35.  If you were a druid, I'd say quad dorfs in BB and sell their weapons, but you really can't...so I'd stick to drops and gems.  Maybe head to places with odd MQ potential and sell MQ'd items.  Folks usually pay well for stuff they can't normally get.<br />
<br />
Potion selling is nice once you're good, but it costs money to get the skill high enough to do it reliably, and even then, you're probably not going to make enough selling sow potions and shrinks to buy a JBB.  They just aren't as needed in the J boots, AA run 3 world.  It's only like 50plat profit per 10 shot potion, hardly worth it, you'd be better off selling CB belts.</div></div><hr />

I've played evil race through all my characters, and I've found that being evil has it's advantage when it comes to making cash. (GF plays good bah) <br />
First things first, you have to consider what's important to you. If you finallize on gettin a JBB by 45, start saving. Don't let anything tempt you, heck during those dark times, i've even stop buying food and summon thme one at a time. Second, do not start alchemy in the low 30s. It will cost you way too much money. Ok, say you can make sow potions, TRIVIAL and no failure at every attempt. You make your potions, sit in ec or use auction channel and wait. The profit is alright, but consider this, running back and forth doing trips to potion vendors. Instead of doing that, you could be killing things, getting xp and getting loot. Heck, killing spiderlings makes more money nowadays then making sow potions. <br />
<br />
At your lvl, your cash flow should start nicely.<br />
Start hunting rangers at wc druid ring area. They spawn every 6 mins and have fs everythime. They drop bows, words, runes, the odd gem and even arrows, all can be sold at the ring. At 35, you might need a partner or someone to break the camp, but once you get the rythm and with canni skill down you should be make good cash every level. It won't make you 16k or so, but is a good start. By the time you reach 40-41 when they start to go smurfie blue on you, your bank should have at least a few k.<br />
<br />
At 40s, head to EW and hunt urthoks for xp/cash and their tusk. Hand them in at CS for gems/crown etc. I made another few ks here till 45 or so. By that time, my bank is around 10 and if you're lucky, you might just have enough. <br />
<br />
Don't stop lvling to make cash. Remeber LVL = Power = Cash</div></div><hr />
