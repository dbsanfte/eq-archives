<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It truly saddens me to see people like Snoww,Faern and Valgoth getting anonymous neg rep bumps for the fact theyre defending WoW.<br />
<br />
These people have probably contributed more good stuff to The Crucible about EQ than the spineless people who are neg bumping them.<br />
<br />
Me and Blazz have had many arguments over Raiders vs Non raiders but i can safely say that not once has he neg repped me and i think even if he did he would probably put his name to it.<br />
<br />
Why cant you be all grown up like him  and if you neg bump someone at least have the guts to put your name to it.<br />
<br />
Keep reading on here how the Blizzard Forums are full of kiddies who insult etc.Wouldnt know this myself as ive never visited them but please dont let The Crucible turn into the same sort of thing.<br />

I was under the impression that we had the forums for other games for a reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soon we'll have more options then we won't be posting in the &quot;EQ General&quot; forum anymore. Besides, it's not like WoW posts are dominating General. There's more WoW related activity in the WoW specific forum. <br />
<br />
You guys should cut us some slack. :) We're currently &quot;between homes&quot; when it comes to community/forums. Most of us love the Crucible (and have been here a long time). Can ya blame us for wanting to stick around? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, I don't really mind the WoW posts myself. I come here to relax, share my thoughts and read some interesting or thought-provoking posts. Besides the WoW threads have a high entertainment values, what with the wildly speculative and flat out wrong statements from both sides. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't have any concern with people posting that they like WoW. I just get bored of people posting rude statements aimed at those who still enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
It's great that people are deciding to move on to another game, and some of the posts are interesting.<br />
<br />
The posts that attack EQ players and call them names because they don't hate SoE and have fun are what I am sick of seeing and most of those are in WoW threads. <br />
<br />
I was told earlier to stop reading WoW related threads. Erm, ok, but I'll choose what I read.....<br />
<br />
I am sure that once there are WoW forums on here a balance will occur but until that time I would love to see a lowering of the fervor surrounding WoW and how much better it is than EQ. It might be to some people, it might not be to others.<br />
<br />
I played in the beta and it wasn't for me. I don't hate people who do like it though, and I don't expect to be called a masochistic twat because I prefer and still enjoy EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the most longstanding criticisms by players about class boards, is that they are posted on mostly by people who are either burned out or have actually quit, leading to a very cynical depressing atmosphere. So naturally some are going to feel like it's more of the same and not like it when these boards talk about how eq is over and wow is the new thing.<br />
<br />
I don't mind a wow thread or two and I support the plan to make this site for all 3 games, but I also understand the frustrations of people who still like EQ that they can't come to a forum without seeing a lot of negativity about the game they choose to play.<br />
<br />
edit: but I do agree about the general point against anon rep bumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;I was told earlier to stop reading WoW related threads. Erm, ok, but I'll choose what I read...&quot;<br />
No I said it was silly to read WoW threads if you are going to complain about them.<br />
And about negative rep bumps about there being WoW threads , that is just ridiculous. I don't really care about reputation but why negative bump them because they are about WoW, makes little sense but whatever rocks peoples boats.</div></div><hr />

I have had a fair few anon neg rep bumps as regards this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25062) and find it very annoying . <br />
And to all those who gave me them anonomously for speaking my mind ,  as regards my 'whining' , at least it achieved something (i.e. a revamp of this site ).. unlike your cowardly gimp actions .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't see why anyone actually cares if they get negative rep bumps at any rate...  I know I don't and I'd hazard to bet that at LEAST Snoww doesn't give a whit and probably Faern doesn't either.  <br />

If anyone actually lives for little popularity ratings that message boards like this give you, then you probably need new hobbies. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't insult folks who stay with EQ. Hell I havn't cancled my account yet. But I think about it more and more as each day In WoW goes by.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying the hell out of WoW. And many of the people I respect and have come to know over the years play and post as shaman on this board. So I come here and want to tell them about the cool, fun game I am playing. <br />
<br />
Keep playing EQ. Have fun. Hell I can log on right now and play EQ and have fun. I have ahd fun for almost 6 years playing EQ. But, and it is a big one. I am having more fun every second in WoW than I would be having in EQ. <br />
<br />
The fact that people anon rep bump is shameful and to me a complete cop out on the part of the board. They would not allow these baseless flames to be allowed on the board proper and certainly not with an anon handle. It should be fixed, and if people are afraid that when they are peing little prickish munchkin they might actually have thier own rep damaged in the process so be it. I don't mind that people disagree with me. Or dislike my grammer. Or think that my ass is fat or something. But when they are too damn cowardly to sign thier name behind it it does dampen my spirits for a few moments. <br />
<br />
I feel sorry for them. It must be rough to go around in life like a snide, sniviling little weasel as you walk among your betters. <br />

Put that in the anon rep bumpers pipe and smoke it. Cowards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Rep bumps are a pretty new, meaningless tool on these forums and the best part is you can get either good or bad hits for posting nearly anything depending on the whim of whoever reads your stuff.<br />
<br />
Guaranteed ways to get positive/negative hits on rep are to talk about one of the following:<br />
<br />
1.  How much you love/hate Sony<br />
2.  Uber v.s. Casual gamers<br />
3.  The board rep system<br />
4.  Write a guide<br />
5.  Agree adoringly or profess your undying disagreement with someone who has more green dots than you.<br />
6.  WoW (of course)<br />

I'm still looking for the option to turn the rep system off in cp... :p</div></div><hr />

One i got from someone which he explained why he gave it to me and he signed it so i have absolutely no problem with that at all.<br />
Now the anonymous one states &quot;this is an EQ forum go post wow **** somewhere else&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ok not only did he not sign it but he didnt actually have the brains to read the post.My post was not about whether Snoww etc are right or wrong to post WoW threads in the General section.<br />
<br />
You neg repping me was exactly the thing the post was about and just kind of proves my post was true.<br />
<br />
One thing i have noticed about neg rep bumps is the anonymous ones tend not to actually give you any neg rep pts as the person posting it doesnt have any rep to share around in the 1st place.Guess that kind of says something too :).<br />

Shaman in WoW kick a55. Seriously powerful class with nukes, defensive totems a well-done storyline (esp Tauren), and nobody is kicking the Tauren out of their homes simply to market an expansion race.<br />

However, if we're criticizing grammar, I think I'll jump on the bandwagon and criticize the criticism:<br />
<br />
It should be you're not your. But the retard probably is only like 12 so hes probably not across it yet.<br />
<br />
It should be he's instead of hes in that sentence; contraction of he and is. What does hes probably not across it yet mean? <br />

If your critic is on a journey that has not passed Contractionland or Apostropheusageland yet, perhaps neither has your own voyage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Shrug, the rep system isnt perfect, but I find it entertaining. My rep list generally looks like a christmas tree, red red green green red green green red, with a few greys tossed in for good measure. Since I tend to be VERY vocal about topics I believe in, and I tend to post on fairly controversial subjects (and not always on the &quot;popular side, thats for sure), I usually generate a fair amount of hits. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I never give out negative rep. I give out a lot of positive rep, many times to people who are on the opposite side of my issue yet put up a good counter-arguement. I always sign my rep. I also tend to pass out rep to people who have gotten lamer negative hits for stupid reasons. I am betting a positive hit from me is worth a bit more than some near-grey negative snot-nose who thinks its &quot;k00l&quot; to cut on people anonymously.</div></div><hr />

I want to see those brave fellas who bump my rep in either way. In general, people post their name when they give good rep bump, but those who give negative one, have no guts to do so.

I agree, I sign both positive and negative rep bumps.<br />
<br />
My favourite negative rep bump I've gotten was for posting on a thread about revamps saying that I thought Paw was the zone going to get a revamp not blackburrow.  <br />
<br />
The negative bump I got was &quot;No, you're wrong it's Blackburrow&quot;.  It was unsigned, but there was only one person in that thread who stated that they thought the gnoll zone revamp would be blackburrow.  <br />
<br />
I also was glad to see that the person chose an important issue to negative rep bump me for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Lol I just got a negative rep bump for my latest less than positive remark about Furor.  The Funny thing is that the poster (another anonymous hero) ended his remark with a snide, rather childish insult - 'get out much'.<br />
<br />
So he's not going to be changing my opinion about the type of person Furor represents.<br />
<br />
And what's even funnier is the insult implies I must be sitting at my computer playing RPGs all day rather than going out.  Hmmm now what's the stereotype for that?  Might it be the 7 days our of 7 uber raider - people from the likes of FoH?<br />
<br />
So sorry, but whoever you are, try a lot harder when you want to insult someone, because that one bounced right back in your face :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Yes, this is indeed no street fight, and your 'generous' reputation distribution is as pointless, especially considering how you give it out just 'in spite', missing the topic and screwing those who don't see things your way&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I received this snippet with a nice red dot because I signed mine when I commented on their post... I doubt I would have received a negative hit from this person but for that reason alone....<br />
<br />
Folks, if you can't handle having a post you make have a comment about it then don't post. If you claim the reputation system means nothing to you then don't cry if a post you make is not met with universal approval. If you retaliate with comments such as the one above purely because your feelings were hurt then you can bet any further reputation bumps won't have a signature.<br />
<br />
The last time I checked when you click the reputation button to provide reputation the box asks you if you approve of the post, not the poster. It doesn't mean you think someone is a moron if you choose to use the button to provide feedback, and having green blobs under your name doesn't help win jobs, pay the mortgage on yo double wide, or keep your bish in make-up.<br />
<br />
Lighten up, and if you don't want to see negative rep bumps stop making stupid posts. :)<br />
<br />
I'll get over this negative bump, with counselling and a strong group of friends, but I fear the next one might do me in..... :)</div></div><hr />

It was apparently given to me because, on the first page of this thread, I asked about the reputation system and whether it was a feature of the forum we were stuck with or whether it was something admin can remove.<br />
<br />
This is getting juvenile, folks.<br />

Let me make sure I'm understanding this:<br />
<br />
Someone who takes the time to *make* a rep bump and write a note about it is telling you that you are taking it too serious?  Can you say hypocrite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I personaly kinda think that the rep system is fun myself.  Anon rep hitters however are cowardly and usualy arn't people worth reading thier opinions anyway.  I guess I too, lurk too much in the General area (most of my post count comes from the equip. forum) to make any sorta use from the rep system :p<br />
<br />
Eitherway, I think its kind of a fun system if its not abused and people actually SIGN thier names to thier bumps.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: ROFL...Love the anon GREY rep hits incredibly mature :)<br />
<br />
The ppl that abuse the system are those with rep. The very same with rep are the anon bumpers can you see that? <br />
<br />
and this lil gem<br />
<br />
YOU AND YOUR OPINION ARE WRONG <br />
<br />
Gotta love it how people can be so immature to hit simply because they don't agree with you.  Heck, I didnt even post anything truly controversal and I still get knocked :p WTG guys, you win at life :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The rep system is useless. Everyone here has the ability to read, interpret and judge posts without some arbitrary points system to artificially weight their validity. The way it's being used right now, it's nothing more than a griefer's toy. <br />
<br />
The point of a board is the free exchange/discussion of opinions and information. Reputation provides nothing that light moderation will not insure anyways. People are using this system to discourage opinions/thoughts they disagree with. If even one person has refrained from posting because of the possibility that their &quot;reputation&quot; will be affected, then this board has failed in it's mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Indeed, like the person posting a negative rep bump to me just because I said that &quot;If you are posting negative rep bump to someone, have guts also signing it&quot; - and that person goes all the way out of his way to post a negative bump with a comment just because that person could. Funny people.<br />
<br />
In any case, the rep system in a way is pointless. It's like the &quot;star camping&quot; thing, the same - colorful dots, who has more, look at me, and so on. As far as I am concerned, the community does sort the posters out on their own anyway, replying or not replying to the posts they like or do not like, some additional system behind the scenes, what some could use just for personal kicks and satisfaction of 'smacking someone with a red one' is obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Ditto for me, Banadan.  But I don't fully agree with your opinoun of the system.<br />
<br />
Only negative rep bump I've ever gotten was from somebody griefing on this thread.<br />
<br />
Rep is supposed to indicate how much weight a person's statements should be given due to their past performance and service to the community.<br />
<br />
Negative rep bumps done out of spite or pique serve no purpose. <br />
<br />
Dragging somebody down by posting your max number of negative rep bumps per day just so that you can have the &quot;glory&quot; of tearing down an icon of our community is petty, childish, and only worth of tabloid journalists and network news anchors.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the rep system should be modified so you can report &quot;grief rep bumps&quot; and people who end up with more than 10 reports as a griefer would have all their rep bumps reviewed and if they are just childish snotty bumps then they would be deleted and that persons account suspended for griefing.<br />
<br />
[snicker... like that would really solve anything?  hehe]<br />
<br />
A much more reasonable fix would be to turn off the anonymous nature of rep bumps.  Let the maker's name be visible as of today.   Even for past rep bumps.  <br />
<br />
That would put the fear into those trolls who have abused the anonymous nature of the rep system to get their thrills.   To be suddenly &quot;outed&quot; to their victums is the worst fear of such spineless cowards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The problem is that anonymity is what makes the system work in the first place. Anon negatives wont bring any sort of &quot;revenge&quot; bump from someone, just to get them back. In a perfect world, everything would be signed and no one would do this sort of thing, but lets face it, FORCED signing negatives would practically dry them up completely, and I dont think thats good for the system overall.<br />
<br />
Myself, I have gotten dozens of negative hits. I tend to be outspoken and often comment on topics that are fairly controversial, and defend my position resolutely. But in the long term, the postives I have gotten have significantly out-numbered the negatives, and I see that as an indication that I say SOME things people agree with. <br />
<br />
I like the system. Its fun to see the numbers go up. I actually dont mind seeing the ass-hat comments from the negative people who are just griefing. Makes me chuckle, because its SO amusing that THEY think it actually matters to me.</div></div><hr />
