-The buggy infinite loop type sounds that used to show up all the time when playing.  There's nothing like sound of getting hit stuck in an infinite loop.<br />
-The buggy running sound where it made that odd kachunk sound sometimes.<br />
-The super loud burst of sound you got once in awhile a few months ago if using a Creative sound card.<br />
-The totally freaky sound of stuff in a dungeon when you have 3d sound turned on and can hear it coming up behind you and hear the echo in the tunnel.  This has actually saved me from a nasty suprise a couple of times.</div></div><hr />

been in Paludal lately? it's still happening, try the sound of someone laughing, over, and over, and over... with the sound of money being looted in the background the whole time. :eek:</div></div><hr />

Every time I hear that laugh in Paludal when running through it scares the crap out of me.  Lucky for me I haven't had the sound loop thing in awhile on my windows box.  Now that I've mentioned it, it will probably come back to annoy me next time I'm on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">one of my three systems loops the hooting owl sound in FV at night and the chirping bird sound during the day.  it_drives_me_bonkers.  EVERYTIME i'm in the zone and only on this system.  i've resinstalled the zone files (and even all of eq) but nothing has helped.  i avoid FV as much as possible beacuse of this becuse it really makes me want to throw my monitor thru the window after only a few minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll tell you the most annoying sound ever.  The cracking egg sound in PoD.  Every time I&quot;m pulling anything around the spiders, or in the castle and I hear that, I jump and think I pulled some aggro or something.  NOPE, just background noise.  Thank you, drive through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still think one of the wierdest sounds, esp since no other NPC's in the game literally &quot;speak&quot; is the prisoner in HK who, when you get near him, says outloud (in a rather british dialect) &quot;May I please have some water?&quot;<br />
<br />
weird....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This isn't from EQ- but when I have AIM on, when some one sends me a tell it says &quot;MOOOO&quot; well if i have the sound up it says MOOO FFARRBBB (sounds like a fart)<br />
<br />
Lol mom was sitting in front of the computer when i first was changing settings around and someone IMed me and my brother yelled &quot;OMG MOM- GO CHANGEYOUR PANTS&quot; ... not in a joking way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trolalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">one time when i was in Freeport a named begger said over my speakers something on the lines of &quot; can i trouble you for some coppers&quot; i about jumped out of my skin, i had never heard anyone talk to me on EQ before</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, I noticed that Paludal Caverns loop myself the other day.   There is this spot near the first Bandit Camp (ShadowHaven end) where I started to med up - and all you can hear, *all the damn time* is, '*tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa *tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa *tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa *tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa *tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa *tinkle* Bwahahahaaaaa , and so on'.  <br />
<br />
Very disconcerting and, eventually, had me fighting the urge to rip my soundcard out :-)</div></div><hr />

It's the most satisfying sound to me. Let's you know your really hurting something for a change.</div></div><hr />
