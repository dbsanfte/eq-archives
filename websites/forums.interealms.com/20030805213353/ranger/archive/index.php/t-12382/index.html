<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ticharary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have always tried to be somewhat original with my first Ranger being named : Hezakiah (Biblical) Ravenwood<br />
My Warrior is Lashandrey (La-sean-dre) Daquikrbeaterup (Surname sucks, but I couldn't get anything to stick and this PoS name did ; kinda pissed me off) Then I have my dark elf Cleric Kharman(Was going for Kharma) Valienshire (whatever)<br />
Then came Ticharary Bladeskimmer (Ticharary was brung from a book I read a while back...can't remember name) Then I read a book by Anne something or another that was about dragons and stuff, and the boys name was Jaxumm...so theres my Monk. I have not thought up of a surname for him as of yet, and I keep getting suggestions for something like &quot;Upsiddajaw&quot; (Upside the jaw). But Jaxumm is not a play on words ya know?<br />
<br />
Other names that I have seen that were kinda iffy:<br />
<br />
Attreau - Never ending story<br />
Tonedef Whitepony - I take it you are a fan of Deftones?<br />
Balkorre - Never ending story<br />
Thorre - Duh (guess what class)<br />
Razen Helzfyr - this is my RL friend =p<br />
I saw a druid with surname - Nosowferu<br />
<br />
Some are lack of imagination, but some only implement their fantasy world more so I guess. If that makes sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't quite get your point here.  You are saying that the people taking from the Never Ending Story are unoriginal, but you taking names from other stories/sources is original?<br />
<br />
My name gets misinterpreted all the time.  The basis behind my name is about 2 years ago when on Spring Break in Rome, a bar was pumping this bad techno/dance music into the adjacent square.  When we walked by the girl was chanting Nerple Nerple Nerple in the song, (Sounded more like Noiple Noiple Noiple) my friend turned around and Said, &quot;Nerple&quot; that fits you, I am calling you Nerple from now on.  the next day 3 friends flew into Rome and the other two got them on it, and when we went to out term abroad at the end of the week, they got some 25 students calling me Nerple, and through email, our hockey team as well.  So I chose it for my EQ character's name.<br />
<br />
Problem is, apparently a &quot;Purple Nerple&quot; is some childish move where you twist another person's nipple, so now everyone sends me tells saying &quot;PURPLE NERPLE!&quot;  and such.  Makes me want to smack them.  The worst though is when they misread my surname &quot;Reveler&quot; to read &quot;Revealer.&quot;  I once had a guy spend a half hour trying to explain that he thought my name was &quot;Nipple Revealer&quot; and refused to believe it wasn't.  The name Reveler is just for a drunk bolsterous person because Nerple was drunk most of the time from levels 1-20 and sung quite often.</div></div><hr />

Anne McCafferey, the Dragonriders of Pern series. The boy was Jaxom. That series is well known enough that its almost as bad as naming yourself Strider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ticharary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nerple - yup, I took Ticharary and Jaxumm (Jaxom) from books, but I made effort to my other names. At least I'm not naming people Darkfyst or Soulsyferr, right? As far as Attreau (Atty), thats my old guild leader, and I love the fact of him using that name. I think it shows his age group (I'd guess he's bout 25-30)<br />
<br />
Taamar...thanks for remembering the book. GREAT SERIES OF BOOKS GUYS.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a big fan or fantasy novels or movies, preferring to read more non-fiction, historical fiction or war novels such as thodr by Tom Clancy, so I have not a clue who Darkfyst and Soulsyferr are :P   What may be obvious to you, isn't necessarily obvious to every one else.  For me, I could pick out characters from Tom Clancy books, or NHL players no problems, but come to fanasty novels and I am clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">everyone seems to think my surname came from Starfox 64.  Well my friends I have had this charcater b4 n64 was even released in Japan:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some like to be unique, others like to pull names from characters they really connect with in some way. I tried to do both, two of my characters Ashkevron and Evanyel, some may recognize from the &quot;Herald Mage&quot; series written by Mercedes Lackey. Vanyel Askevron was the first openly gay main character/hero I ever encountered....and I connected :) I highly recommend the books!<br />
  Some of my other alts, I just came up with something from the name generator and changed it a bit into something unique that I thought sounded &quot;cool&quot; (Xanthus, my wiz and Erebix, my warrior). <br />
   While I could care less if you call yourself &quot;Rambo, Bilbo, or Heman Hohumper&quot; I DO shake my head and say &quot;hmmm...not a lot of imagination went into that name. Bet they aren't here to roleplay, just get loot (probably from begging :p) and constantly annoy people with join/duel/sowpls/tpformybunghole/joosuxx0r spam.&quot; While not a hardcore RP nazi...I do try to give the fantasy setting at least a BIT of a nod :)</div></div><hr />

Starfox was originally released for Super Nintendo :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's what your name means to you. Mine's a DOS command (duh). Not very fantastical, but I've used this name in many games and I connect with it. One guy used to follow me around and harrass me about it. /shrug It's not like my surname is &quot;Windows&quot;, heh.<br />
<br />
I saw a &quot;Hotredknob&quot; on my server... Those are the types of names that bug me. Or &quot;Snatchette&quot;, etc. Or &quot;Ilikeweed&quot;. Please, I'm *trying* to believe I'm in Norrath =P<br />
<br />
For some reason I wasn't offended by the name Kashagoogoo Der'Commissar. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

   <br />
I play a male bard named Tylendel, and Taamar Bladesworn is derived from Tarma the Swordsworn. Not celibate, though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MadWarper DaeDraug<br />
<br />
My surname was a composite of two Quenya/Sindarin (Tolkien elvish languages)...<br />
Dae (Shadow) Draug  (Wolf)= Shadowed Wolf, not bad for a Ranger (IMHO)<br />
<br />
Now if any one can dissect my first name... You win a &lt;looks at empty pockets&gt; the knowledge of that my first name means <br />
:p <br />
<br />
MadWarper DaeDraug <br />
Half Elven Ranger of the 46th Arrow <br />
E.Marr <br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing a Ranger knows more about than where he is going, is how he is going to get there.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BTW, in neverending story, the name was Falcore *not positive on spelling* with an F, not a B.  So the guy liked the sound of the name, and decided to change it a little to more suit his needs.   Good for him, sounds like a good name to me.  Not even close to the same thing as Gandaaalf.<br />
<br />
I got my name out of a book, but not because I had any love for the character, I just liked the name.  Always had kind of an elf ring to it, though not quite as much as something like Elrond, and since I wanted a half elf right from the start, I thought it was a good choice.  My last name, actually Strongbow but there wasn't enough space for the W, I picked because I have always looked at rangers as a class that are masters of the bow, even before archery was really useful.<br />
<br />
I got my surname back in the days of when GM's had to do it, and I&quot;m glad to say I was the first Strongbow on my server, though I have run into many since. :p</div></div><hr />
