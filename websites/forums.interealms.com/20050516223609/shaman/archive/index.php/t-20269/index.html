<br />
Why this is so vastly superior to the warrior, SK, paladin epics?  <br />
<br />
They want to make it relevant to the level its obtained, and accounted for mudflation.  But that's not especially fair to the older epics.  <br />
<br />
I hate the idea of this class.  It should never have been introduced.  All it does is make balancing for other classes that much harder down the road.</div></div><hr />

Bringing the other epics up to speed somewhat based on difficulty might be a good idea also. The warrior epics should be at least as good as a CHoS given the pain in the ass to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am leveling a Berserker now and I can tell you there is no good reason for the introduction of the Berserker class.  The class is not finished (official word from SoE) so I am not sure what the class will be like when all the AAs and other tweaks have been done.  I wanted a pure melee and took up the Berserker as novelty.  I am not sure if this is a good idea.  I want it to be welcome in groups but I do not want our desirablity to come at a cost to other original classes.  I know how it feels.  At this point it does not look as if the Berserker is going to be made into a one toon DPS fest.<br />
<br />
Gart is so on target!   One thing that I have learned (or think I have learned) watching the introduction of both the Beastlord and Berserker classes is that once a MMPOG based on classes is released no additional classes should be introduced.  Keeping a game balanced when new content is regularly added is very difficult, but the addition of new classes makes the job of balancing the classes near impossible.</div></div><hr />

So, I am not surprised, grats Berserker. <br />
Apart from that I hear that they don't have a role to fill, except be less damage than other pure melee classes (excluding warrior). But until now they don't even have class AA skills.<br />

<br />
Looks like Allahkazam is using an old version of the paladin one, but it's close enough I think.  46/37 ratio? 125hp? 40% haste? AND 40 to attack???  Hell, why not stick a regen on there too?<br />
<br />
These disparities are absurd.  It's like there's no institutional memory, no deep thinking going on in SOE now.  They just randomly kick crap out without pondering what it means.  2 guys start characters.  One makes a paladin; one makes a berserker.  If you are the paladin, this is going to appear really badly to you.  <br />
<br />
The fact that the berserker one is also 40% haste is huge.  That's a really big deal.  What 40% item is nearly so available for classes that don't get one on their epic?  4% extra melee damage is significant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is exactly why it's a decent weapon. Most everyones epics were Kunark era. Berserker epic is not Kunark era. Nor is beastlord. Hence why they are both MUCH better then the rest of the epics. Paladin epic was the first one put in..hence why it's a piece of junk that no one bothers to do really... there are some who do it for the fun of it, or just to have the weapon, and that's good for them. But to design the berserker epic from the get go as something people would only get as a &quot;trophy&quot; item, isn't worthwhile use of a development time, especially considering it's their epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So the general consencus is SOE should have designed an entire quest around an epic that was planned to be obselete before the first person ever got it?

It's better than any pre-elemental weapon, and superior to most elemental ones. The quest is apparently pretty easy. You don't have to make the thing as godlike as it is for people to want to have one.</div></div><hr />

I dont know about that, I see a fair share of at least rangers who still use at least half our epic for quite a long time (I certainly have).  Not that many are lucky enough to get both....but thats a whole nother can O worms.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other classes out there, maybe rouges? (I believe ragebringer can be slipped into off hand after all /shrug), who do strive to aquire and use their epics for quite some time.<br />

OMG lol. I beat him with 7 people, one of them was a 54 sk. We werent even prepared.This mob is a joke.<br />
<br />
That said, this is a nice item, and I am GLAD. Id feel sorry for the programmer if he had to make a quest that yielded an out dated piece of crap like the pally epic. Doing an epic is a measure of opportunity cost now. I didnt bother with my beasts, simply because I could easily buy him better weapons. The windblade, war marshall staff, etc are all tradable weapons, very cheap. The great staff fo the 4 winds is incredibly easy to get for 1-2 prepared groups. In order to make the quest even have a point, it has to compete with similar options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't think the point is that the berserker epic should necesserily be nerfed (maybe a little bit, I mean wow... look at it). But other epics (melee especially) should be brought in line... Throw in some extensions to the current epic quests to upgrade them.

I sent that link to an SK buddy of mine and his head just about exploded.  The developers sort of had to make the berserker epic a kickass item, due to the weapons that are currently available to single group encounters.  I agree that extensions to the current class epics would be a great way to give every class the same opportunity to wield a weapon that is up to date with today's EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i dont have a problem with this item.<br />

Also i think the only class to whine about it should be the warriors.<br />
<br />
bezerkers were a bland class that needed peping up......loads of forums are saying they were low damage melees.<br />
<br />
shaman epic has been useless for a while......since about luclin(ish)  but then around that time most other clases had stopped using theres too.<br />
<br />
i do think they need a upgrade quest for existing epics........but i wont expect one unles they use that cheep gimick to sell the expansion after the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Why is this being compared to knight epics?<br />
<br />
Berserkers are a chain class, like rogues or rangers.  They're not a knight/tanking class.  The only thing they have in common with knights and warriors is that they us 2handers.  <br />
<br />
This epic should be compared more directly to the beastlord/rogue/ranger epic, all of which have 40% haste, and the beastlord at least gives a total of 125hp, with a 50% slow proc.  Ranger, too, 40% haste and a slow proc.  Rogue, 40% haste.  Monk, clicky haste.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the huge deal is.  I think you all are just complaining to complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Relax guys,<br />
<br />
It'll get nerfed. Trust me.<br />
<br />
At every expansion, they place something that looks very attractive in the game that peeps want to buy the expansion.<br />
<br />
Once the sales percentage is met, they'll nerf everything, a piece at a time.<br />
<br />
They do that, every single time an expansion is released.<br />
<br />
Already GoD nerfed the key that was used as a turn in for a Troll Illusion potion at AS (Boat City). Then yesteday they nerfed the fishing tradeskill which had the fish selling for PPs instead of the usual prices like most all fishes sells for. They could have done that at the same day they nerfed the key, but they didn't. Think about it.<br />
<br />
Then they nerfed the animated bait which as a turn in for hundreds of points at the Tribunal.<br />
<br />
They nerfed the Casino, I doubt they'll bring it back live again.<br />
<br />
They nerfed the tradeskills at GoD on the boat city.<br />
<br />
More nerfs coming soon and that weapon is on the list.<br />
<br />
Remember Windblade? They nerfed it too.<br />
<br />
As time progresses and there will be another expansion being released this fall, stuff will be horribly nerfed before the next release.<br />
<br />
Then this new expansion will have tons of new things that attract new buyers, then the nerfing cycle will begin when the sales percentage goal has been reached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think the problem is that SoE doesn't really understand the value of the epics to certain classes.<br />
<br />
My next comments are not directed at those who have access to the uber stuff... I'm sorry, but you probably really don't care about how good the shaman epic is, if you have access to TA for example.<br />
<br />
I'm in a guild that raids Tier 1, and Tier 2 PoP...  GoD is hard for me... my epic is still a DANG nice piece of equipment in my primary hand.<br />
<br />
I only mainly use the effect when soloing... as an extra free dot.   In most xp groups I never click on it unless I'm root/rotting something...<br />
<br />
There isn't much out there I consider an upgrade for me... either in effect, or stats (mainly stats).<br />
<br />
So my &quot;kunark era&quot; &quot;epic&quot; ... is still &quot;epic&quot; to me.   It may feel as dated as it wants... but it's still dang nice.    Wis, Sta, Resists, Hp, and Mana... plus an effect that is situationally very useful to me.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying there are NO upgrades... but it's not like I have a ****load of them falling on me.<br />
<br />
-- side note... if there are a ton of upgrades that I can get, I'd be happy to be proven wrong with some examples.<br />
<br />
I think for most priests, and even casters, this is the case.    Try to pry the epic away from a wizard.     I don't know about necros... the mage epic is still uber... enchanter epic has a couple of sound items... but in terms of pure stats I don't know how many upgrades.<br />
<br />
For some melee's , it's a different story.    Stat wise, the epics are still pretty good... all of them.   But not as good as they were compared to the newer - and in some cases easier - to obtain weapons in terms of damage and delay.<br />
<br />
As a quick and dirty example... any 1H class can use a Copper Hammer... 13 / 20 with a 179dmg proc (and stats, but not &quot;epic&quot; stats).<br />
<br />
The dmg/dly, realistically has no impact to a priest or caster.    It doesn't matter if there's a 100dmg / 10dly staff out there for priests.  .. we're still gonna miss like crazy... and do pathetic damage.   It's stats and/or effects. <br />
<br />
Regardless of stats... the Bard epic is often held in the hand for a long time.<br />
<br />
Rogues as well... there's many 15 dmg piercers now... and even a 16dmg one from LDON that any rogue can get...  but the Haste + Atk keeps it in the hands of many.<br />
<br />
The newer epic is balanced for right now.    As was the Beastlord epic.<br />
<br />
Our epics were balanced for back in Kunark... but some of them survive the test of time either based on stats, or effect.<br />
<br />
It would be nice, if there was a quest, to upgrade to &quot;epic 2.0&quot;... but... it doesn't seem to be in SoE's plans... furthermore... I wouldn't want anything to bring back the days of uber epic confrontations... they still exist today... but with more and more things to do... they do seem a little less painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">SOE should have done what it makes new players who happen to be paladins or SK do:  farm plat to buy a weapon better than their epic in the bazaar.  That's in the spirit of a grand adventure game.  <br />
<br />
Or, maybe this highlights a wee little problem.....<br />
<br />
Seriously though, the berserker class is new, but to a new player, the paladin class is new too.  <br />
<br />
There's a fundamental fairness issue.  I don't give a crap ultimately because I'm neither a paladin nor a berserker.  And I don't think I live my life looking for something to bitch at SOE about.  <br />

I do, however, feel free to comment on something I think it is a bad move in a game on a bulletin board dedicated to that game.<br />

<br />
Berserkers are a GoD expansion class. <br />
With the exception of Beastlords, everyone else's epic is from Kunark.<br />
This many expansions later, I'd hope they would give a brand new class a better weapon.<br />
<br />
Many players at level 50 and higher can get weapons with more hp &amp; better ratios than their epics from the bazaar.  A 2hs weapon w/ 125hp, 40% haste &amp; some attack w/ only mediocre saves is not going to change the world of Norrath.<br />
<br />
I don't begrudge Berserkers their epic one bit.  Good for them!<br />
Would it be nice if they made an epic 2.0 quest for everyone else to upgrade?  Yes.  Am I expecting it?  No.<br />
<br />
Give them a break already, let them have a nifty toy.  Look on the upside, you won't see many berserkers putting in for a weapon when something drops, since not much is going to be better for them until they hit Elemental Planes or upper tiers of GoD.<br />
