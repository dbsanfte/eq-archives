peace and anarchy<br />

Well, to be honest, you really don't need to worry much about gear.  As you level, it will come.  I was in partial banded until my 30s, and then it was just slowly bringing in Totemic armor :)<br />
Just play through.  Tradeskills will be easier for you to work on later, so don't worry about them for now.<br />
Just play and enjoy yourself</div></div><hr />
