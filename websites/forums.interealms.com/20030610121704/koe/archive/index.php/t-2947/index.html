<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Crossing the boarder from Canada to the United States I have often been thrilled with a sense of Freedom, a sense of Greatness that transcends time and space, a sense of brotherhood, a sense of kindness, a sense of deep abiding strength.<br />
<br />
America a country that is so fiercely proud of its heritage, its flag, its accomplishments, its freedom.<br />
<br />
America a country filled with natural beauty, filled with deep canyons and spiralling mountains, magnificent fields of grain, power and grace in the animals that inhabit this blessed land from the soaring eagle to the Rippling power of the Kodiak Bear.<br />
<br />
A nation filled with my friends, family, colleagues. People who defend the defenseless, feed the hungry, cure the sick, enrich lives.<br />
<br />
A nation that will now lead the rest of the civilized world in a steely pursuit of Terrorism. A final and complete retribution on those that would attack like a thief in the night, that in their cowardice left no calling card, no claim to the infamous events of Sept 11/0. <br />
<br />
The world stands ready to follow this mighty champion of Freedom into battle, althought there will be pain and sacrifice in the days ahead, a new age will be born. An age where our children can grow and learn and reap the benefits of a free and democratic society without fear, without apology, but with Fierce Pride.<br />
<br />
I had to write something, I have so many feelings, rage, anguish, loss, shock, helplessness.<br />
I wish there was a way to volunteer to help, I have enquired and only trained personnel are needed however my prayers are with you my Brothers and Sisters to the south.<br />
<br />
A Canadian<br />
An American in this time of great sorrow and need<br />
A Friend</div></div><hr />

I have to say that i was both amazed and touched at the British show of respect and dedication to the new Cause at the changing of the palace guard.  I was choked up...<br />
<br />
Ive heard the anthem thousands of times but it sounded so sweet coming from an allies instrument.</div></div><hr />
