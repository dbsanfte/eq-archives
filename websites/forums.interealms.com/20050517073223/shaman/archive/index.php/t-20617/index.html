<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...maybe they are getting all the small fry changes out of the way before the BIG patch for Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">or maybe they just cried on the right forums to get what they wanted<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Good for them. <br />
We need to have a few more WELL written comprehensive essays posted over there.  That thread seemed to have pretty good back and forth discussion.  Glad to see it seemed to work for them.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, an 1800 point spot heal is too much, but the # 1 positional DPS class getting MORE DPS is Jim Dandy?<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am not quite sure exactly what changes you mean, but the rogue disciplines were overdue. If I recall correctly (I do not keep up with roguely stuff much) they did not get any GoD disciplines, or rather the turnin was bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm all for everyone getting more power, as long as the classes I play don't get left off the bus. Shaman haven't got anything really good in a long time, and really could use some luvin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually rogues got screwed on the new disciplines from day 1.  They were the only pure melee class that didn't get any new disciplines from the melee balancing part 1.  The they finally brought the new disciplines over and they were complete crap..allowing a single thrown attack to automatically crit every 30 seconds.  It was next to useless since only zerkers can do any real damage with thrown weapons.  <br />
<br />
Now after this change, the rogues very first backstab on a mob does considerable damage.  However, for the skill to work, the rogue has to have been hidden for 3 secs, activate the disc which apparently costs a considerable amount of endurance to use, and then move to position and backstab.  It's a one shot deal in any given fight and a time equipped rogue's max hit was with this was in the ballpark of 1.2k damage.  Not a big boost in overall dps at all, SOE more or less threw them a bone the same way they did us when they changed daluda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This was repairing a problem that existed already. Not a bump, just a correction.<br />
<br />
And it effectively only works off the first hit after coming out from invis for a few seconds. While invis, they can't attack at all, doing zero dps. Not that much of a bump if you look at it in the correct perspective.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a pretty ****tastict ablilty. <br />
<br />
On my rogue I'd rather get nothing, than this puddle of ass juice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">New disc lets a rogue get one bigger opening backstab (the rogue has to be hidden for 2+ secs, then you gets one backstab shot).  Initial reports are it does not effect a double or triple backstab.  DPS wise, it should be pretty meaningless, but might result in some neat eyecandy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I see this as a good thing... We group with rogues every now and then and the more dps they have the better the group is. It's not like if a druid or chanter got an upgrade where it would make us have less of a chance to get into a group by being replaced by them.</div></div><hr />
