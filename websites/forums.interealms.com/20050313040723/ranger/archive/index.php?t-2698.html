The lagg there is terrible and caused me to get killed even though I had sow on by trains from other players and a wolf that aggored me cause I couldnt get away.<br />
<br />
I have never had lagg like that before only on luclin    What is up with that??<br />
<br />
Anyway I need to get a shoulder item and thought about the crested spaulders that can be found there.<br />
<br />
So how was your experience at Mistmoore??  Is this a good dungeon to check out??<br />
<br />
Where is the closet bind point to here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can bind in GFay at the entrence to LFay. Mistmoore is the original zone for trains. It and unrest were some of the most wild zones to be in. You can't really solo there, but with a group, can get mad xp as both are pretty empty these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morphous</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't solo in MM what are u a Warrior? All ols schools Rangers learned to solo here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BP</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The basic premise when hunting in Mistmoore is to never attack first. If a mob is going past you without attacking you, leave it alone. If you attack, it will bring the entire castle on your head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smokimon Trailblazer</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have soloed for exp in Mistmoore all the way in to the Graveyard. Great fun and tons of learning to be done there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Speireag</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever seen a REAL train? &gt;=)<br />
<br />
As I was running past the mobs who were back to back single file from the castle to the zone line...   <br />
<br />
About 355 mobs acknowledging that they wanted to kill me or around there...<br />
<br />
If you want to know why it's called a train, hang around mistmoore...  Just watch your back.<br />
<br />
Hitori</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liri Trueblade</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, it is Train City. <br />
<br />
If you specifically want the Crested Spaulders, ya gotta camp the Avenging Caitliff. I camped him for awhile, invis, had no problems with trains or agro, (I was 50-52 at the time though). He pops in the stairs off the jail and does have a ph.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, you CAN solo there, but it can be very difficult when you are the only person in the zone. With the bad pathing, the total number of mobs and thier assist range, it is difficult for a lower level player to single pull the mobs. Harmony is the only saving grace to make it possible. The graveyard is another great spot to attempt to solo. It is an outdoor zone, so you can have sow up, etc. At night, the mobs become undead, and see through invis. During the day, they are regular and do not see through invis.<br />
Expect to zone out alot when you get multiple adds until you get used to it. If you have a decent group, the xp is great as you will not be standing around waiting for mobs to spawn, and won't have to go far to get some new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason there are mobs that walk around, one might walk right past you in the graveyard, but they aren't really there - they are someplace else in the zone.  So like they said, if it doesn't attack you first, don't attack it.  <br />
<br />
If you do, the one you hit will just keep walking, or might poof, and then the REAL one will show up like 2 minutes later with the WHOLE castle following him.<br />
<br />
Not sure enough people hunt there to cause trains anymore.  Not like the good old days, when you had to wait outside the zone for like 15 minutes before it was safe to go in as train after train crashed on the other side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself and all my friends have sworn to never again enter that hell-hole that is castle mistmoore.  The trains in there are worst thing ever dreamed of in your most horrible nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenrai</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I guess asking any of you for an Electrum Bladed Wakizashi for part of the Call of Flames spell quest is, well, for lack of a better line...out of the question? :D <br />
<br />
Can a pally, ranger, cleric and druid (with the possibility of another ranger and a shaman or two) make it in to get the fangs and back out again to get the knife? Is wolf form aggro there just like being in normal form? Why do they make the masters of tracking have to go into horrid dungeons to do their quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mistmoore is by far my favorite zone ever! It is a place imo that is a great xp zone for 30-40 (even 20s I believe but may not be able to go farther than GY) also a great place for a Ranger to shine :) Yes, it can be trainy but only for the unwary and those that refuse to learn which is why I like the zone so much. It can be unforgiving, you screw up it can kill your whole group so you have to be on your toes. <br />
<br />
Now with 3 expansions out, MM is virtually deserted, so if you are level 30-40 I advise bring some friends and kill from zone in to castle if you can :) I miss my MM ventures (although camping maid and butler I still shudder since I spent days and days to not get my maid fang...a friend of mine gave me one eventually)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget mistmoore is outdoor zone, Harmony is your friend. Helps keep down the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wait till daylight, invis up, move into the rooms, and prepare for the fight of your life.<br />
snare early, and make sure it stays snared.<br />
At lvl 49 your group would have no problems. Most of the zone will be green with some very light blues thrown in for color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did a raid there several weeks ago. Everything went fine until towards the end when  Mobs spawned like mad. Total wipe but it was FUN!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarlyn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe..Ven, they probably didn't spawn. Someone trained you. The trais can come out of nowhere. They can be delayed trains too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I think I just saw a train go by.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hang tight then&quot;<br />
few minutes pass...<br />
&quot;OK I guess we are safe&quot;<br />
&quot;INC&quot;<br />
&quot;***? what is nuking me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Add!&quot;<br />
&quot;Add!&quot;<br />
&quot;Add!&quot;<br />
&quot;OMG I have never seen so many MOBs before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahhh, I love MM. Those who leanr it, love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerOfTunare</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, my friend's brother was showing me some SCs of the mega train he caused there one day.  He (60 cleric) and a 60 rogue decided to speed things up and pull everything at once.  So they both ran through the castle and literally agroed the WHOLE ZONE!  They pulled it all to the zone and could hardly move because of all the mobs.  I think the rogue was able to zone but the cleric died from the sheer number of them.  The funniest part was that there was a lvl 19 or so druid afk at the zone.  She also happened to be bound there.  The result was one of the biggest deathloops ever.  When the rogue and cleric zoned back there was about 100 corpses all over the ground, and the druid had lost about 5 lvls.  They tried to rez as many corpses as they could but the druid only got back up to like lvl 18.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any train storys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest getting a group up for your first trip to this place.<br />
<br />
Most servers are BYOG.<br />
<br />
If you try to solo here, depending on level, start slow and learn your way around. You can get lost here, and CR can be tricky if you are by yourself.<br />
<br />
Some mobs see thru camo all the time, some only at night.<br />
<br />
Learn the traps, some are in the hidden room behind the graveyard. You will want help your first time thru here, as you can have a hard time finding the secret doors.<br />
<br />
Mobs are underconned. Casters can kill ya quick. Agro is rampant in MM. If something runs from ya, you can expect a HUGE train coming back.<br />
<br />
Learn how to run up to the crosswalk to the tower, and jump off the crosswalk, which if you take a left leads you right back to the zone line. The tower is seen down at the end of the ramp near the lake.<br />
<br />
Be prepared before you go here, you will more than likely die, and you want to make sure you can get your corpse. <br />
<br />
DO NOT wander down in the valley near the front of the castle. There are lots of mobs down there, one of which can be the shaman epic mob wolf mob. Very tough. Lots of HPs.<br />
<br />
There are some traps in the castle that will strip your camo, be prepared. Sucks to run thru camo'd, and wham! you lose camo and the whole castle comes after you.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mistmoore is one of the most valuable zones in the game for teaching a ranger their craft.  When you know Mistmoore, when you can survive Mistmoore without zoning at the drop of a little brown bag of fishing grubs, you will have become a much more valuable player. <br />
<br />
You will also need to camp Mistmoore one day for the fangs of the Maid and Butler, see the Call of Flames quest.  Getting to know it now will serve you in great stead in the future.  <br />
<br />
Go for it.  Check the beastiary for Mistmoore and look at the other drops there.  Might find something else you want, like the cloak the Hooded Dhampyre drops.</div></div><hr />
