<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I couldn't find anything from the search...I am level 13...and was on auction. I got my first piece of equipment last night. I got a Chrysoberyl Talisman...It gives 5AC, +3wis, +20 Mana, and has (worn) Affliction Haste 2...<br />
<br />
From what I can assume, it means when I cast an affliction spell, (DOT?) it either gets cast faster, or lasts longer..I'm guessing longer than whatever affliction haste 1 would be.<br />
<br />
Can someone clarify this for me?<br />
<br />
Also...if I'm level 13, does it mean anything to me, or is it like the Earring of the Solstice? Level 51 applicable only?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it speeds up the casting of all of your DoT spells up to level 44, so it a GREAT item to have at level 13.  I wore one of those until my 40's even without the focus effect :).<br />
<br />
You can see which spells it affects by rightclicking on your spell gems to see which ones have a reduced casting time.  It will say Casting time (5.0)  Your casting time (4.1) or some such.  The I, II, and III on the effects only signify the level cap for affected spells, not the magnitude of the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I saw it on there...The guy that was selling it was in the Dreadleands...He came ALL THE WAY to Halas to sell it to me!<br />
<br />
The Talisman replaced my Initiate of the Tribunal necklace...So this was a perfect piece for me to get.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that the Affliction Haste can affect my spells! Thanks for the clarification!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very nice item to have.  Believe that it is a faster casting time. Very nice effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night, I got an item with AH3 on it and Poxx of Bert's casting time went from 5 seconds to 3.5.  You can even see the new casting time when you right click the spell.<br />
