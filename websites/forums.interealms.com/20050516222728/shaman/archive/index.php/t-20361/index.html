<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19256&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1) is one of my favorite threads here, so I'd thought I'd start a new one with a slightly different topic.<br />
<br />
What is the stupidest thing that you'd done as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Mine, was quite recent.<br />
<br />
Some guildies and I were farming insignias in SSRA. It was going well, no problems. I'd lost bot9 &amp; symbol but I had more than enough hps for a canni5.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I was standing too close to one of the named that the melee were fighting in the corner when I hit that canni5...and just as I hit that hotkey and took my canni5 damage...<br />
<br />
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!<br />
<br />
Loading Please Wait.<br />
<br />
I have never died from canni5, and I did not get low hps agro...but...<br />
<br />
Lesson for the day was (mind you I was very embarassed and guildies were giving me a hard time)... don't stand near an enraging mob when you canni :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think that's so much of a stupid shaman trick, as stupid shaman mistake. <br />
<br />
I can't remember anything dumb, but funny that I've done at the moment.. though I know there have been those moments, and quite a few of them. I'll get back to you :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Um, switched spells to rebuff, then tried to slow a mob with Talisman of the Diaku. Several times. No yawns, no resist messages.... /bonk<br />
<br />
After that, I adopted the 'leave 4 gems the same ALWAYS' philosophy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once, for some stupid reason, I memmed gate in the slot I normally mem cannibalize.  I think I was about to gate out of Chardok but then got a group at the last second.<br />
<br />
So I go down to join the group, things are going fine, first pull comes in with 3-4 sarnaks, I'm slowing and patch healing.  My work is done for the moment, so I hit my canni hotkey.  Next thing I know, I'm at my bind point trying to explain myself to my group.<br />
<br />
That was the last time I put ANYTHING in the canni spell slot.<br />
<br />
In my 20's I was kiting a sarnak in LOIO (gee, sarnaks bring out the best in me) while my group took care of the other one.  Stopped to heal myself real quick, but apparently didn't manage to hit TAB to retarget the sarnak... tried to root him, and rooted myself right in his path and at low health.  Didn't last long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dunno if it counts as a &quot;stupid trick&quot; or not, but I like to get into bear form and then sit down when I start sliding on ice.  Your legs don't move anymore and you look kinda like you're floating.<br />
<br />
I've also got many a guild picture of someone with levitate &quot;riding the bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've also been known to wield my smithing hammer when running around PoK so no one knows I am shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pressed the cannibalize 5 hotkey just after I got rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a couple days ago I was fighting a particularly nasty mobs to finish a quest.  I had mem'ed a rather odd and customized set of spells for the encounter.<br />
<br />
I was responsible for healing the pets and keeping dots on the mob.  About halfway thru the fight I threw a Stoicism on all the pets and was running low on Mana.  So what's a Shaman to do?  Cannibalize of course!  So I smacked my Canni hot key . . . and rooted the last pet I healed.  WOOPS!<br />
<br />
The morale of the story - NEVER put root in your canni slot.  No matter how much it might seem like a good idea at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've had a few occasions solo'ing where I commonly hit -TAB- to switch between me and my target during the fight where I've got my -TAB- out of sequence and ended up Quiesciencing the mob and Blood of Saryn / Breath of Ultor'ing myself.... those are fun times...<br />
<br />
Here's a good one too - very old, but still interesting.  I was back on Xegony on Ciccero during some undead bard in Sebilis raid back when he was still a raid event and I get killed to a jug or something we were doing while clearing everything.  I get rezzed in naked RIGHT at Trak's feet just as they're finishing the UDB and Trak pops right on top of me, freshly rezzed, naked, and unbuffed.  One DoT - Loading Please Wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Pressed the cannibalize 5 hotkey just after I got rez.&quot; <br />
Yep, done that!  Glaani has been slain by Glaani!  This was at a raid, no less, with way too many witnesses lol.  Cannicide is a sad, sad thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I memmed gate in the slot I normally mem cannibalize...&quot;<br />
Done that, too!  Now I never, ever keep gate memmed unless I am soloing, or duoing with my monk partner and he suggests it =P<br />
<br />
My own personal biggest mess-up was at a mini-raid in Kael in my early 50s...I healed a not-quite-FD monk with 5 mobs on him.  /sigh  There's nothing like being responsible for a wipe.  Blehhh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As one with a Shaman alt, rooting self ya.<br />
<br />
Dumbest Shaman trick?  Hmm, I can remember being the main healer at Paw Spires and continually casting regen on the &quot;tank&quot; and wondering why his health didn't go up. (Old UI)<br />
<br />
As an Enchanter?  Every once inawhile (Fear), I'll break out Fascination (AOE Mez).  Invariably the 5 pull goes from out of range to a point where I end up mezzing myself.  One of the nuances of Fascination is it always seems to wear off on you before the MOBs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, looking at my long list....<br />
<br />
Cannicide - Yep, with Cann4 no less.<br />
Gating on accident - Yep.<br />
Rooting myself - Yep, TAB error.<br />
Doting myself - Yep, another TAB error.<br />
Nuking myself to death - Yep, another TAB error.<br />
<br />
Most emparassing - Running into Velks to find zone empty , but (surprisingly) cleared of all spiders.  Running invised to TOP camp and summoning a pet between Crystal Fang's and Frenzied Stalker's spawn point.  Realizing that I forgot to Acumen myself as Fang and 5 of his friends un-invis as they give me the smack down. At least I was alone.<br />
<br />
Most regrettful - In a pickup LDON, we were clearing trach mobs from a room with a named when I assist-pet attack a little to quick.  Tank had not switched to the mob being pulled by the bard and still had the named targetted when I assisted.  Needless to say the named and five of his buddies charged us after quickly dispatching dogdog.  We took out a couple of them before wiping.  Luckily we had already won the adventure and were just trying to get the last of 4 named mobs that had spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just last Sunday my pickup group finished an adventure and decided to stay together for another one.  Running out, I made a wrong turn leaving the dungeon, was swarmed and died.  <br />
<br />
Ran back to the zone to collect corpse before the next adv.   As I zoned in, I got the quest message.  Ran into the dungeon only to discover that it was the new one - after I zoned in.  The group leader requested and received a new adventure while my corpes and all my gear were in the old one.  Not only was I naked, I had started the next adventure, and the rest of the team was in N Ro.<br />
<br />
I died after the slow on the first pull when the tank did not catch the mob before he beat on my naked body.<br />
<br />
20 minutes into the adventure my corpse popped from the old dungeon.  We were successful in both runs, but my mana never got about 23%.  <br />
<br />
I passed a chance for a 3rd runthrough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SylentsofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This actually happened to me this morning.<br />
<br />
I had my Shaman in a group and my rogue was playing my nasty dot. I had just gotten to the group and we where waiting on a bard, so i went ahead and buffed up the bot. Well, i forgot to untarget Sy and did my group buffs. I didnt notice it until all the buffs where done and i was a 20m. boy was my face red<br />
<br />
Sy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tab error, self nuke, with JBB.  Was oom while solo in PoJ (level 56 at the time).  Had already decided to zone after my last kill (the iksar monk on the main level, took a few dots and dd's to finish him off).  Was at 15% health due to using the old tank in teh face technique (he hits pretty good) and getting two rat adds.  Figured I'd let dogdog finish the rats off and then zone, since I was not taking much damage from them.  Tabbed over to target myself to cast a quick heal, but did not have enough mana.  Decided instead to help doggy out with the JBB, and forgot to change targets.  I figure the 267 hp dd was just barely enough to kill myself, so it was a very mana efficient suicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">accidental gates during raids where you are the only shaman suck...<br />
<br />
fresh res, click mod rod in the back corner of raid room and die because a wanderer popped his head in at that point and spotted me at 10% of course the only thing anyone in raid saw was Diab has been slain by Diab  stupid mob didnt even agro anyone else.<br />
<br />
reslowing seru, getting summoned, tanking seru with no dots and only slow+decay cast on him...for almost a full minute before the tank could regain agro....ok so thats embarassing for the tank but I did feel kinda strange having to camp out several times durring the raid to clear agro.<br />
<br />
canV deaths due to the hp report bug noone believes you and you are already pissed off now youre getting crap for being a newb as well.<br />
<br />
dog dog on the wrong target...8 inc!</div></div><hr />

If the heat of the fight I did not notice that I had my virtue and fos dispelled.  Hit canni V and then got low life agro.  Owch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Stupid things I've done in the year and a bit since I started playing:<br />
<br />
...Seeing that there were Corrupt guards in Qeynos, I decided to kill one in my 20s, thus making myself more popular with the normal guards. I walked up to a green guard who /con'd dubious, hit him - then got toasted by nukes from the normal guards who assisted him. Quick trip back to Everfrost and an embarresing CR.<br />
<br />
...A few levels later, taking off a ring that gave me 35 HPs, when I was down to 20-something, just to see what would happen: LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
...Getting a rez in the Hole, just before we got to the building with Kirn in it. For some reason, I forgot to loot my corpse, pressed Canni V - LOADING, PLEASE WAIT..... The only time I've ever killed myself with Canni, and it had to be on an epic raid with my guild  :o <br />
<br />
...Getting a tell from a level 1 beggar in Halas, asking for plat. So, I popped into the bank, withdrew 50,000 copper and headed (slowly) to the warrior pit to meet the beggar. As he came into view, I fell half an inch and took 20K falling damage - thankfully he assumed it was a guard killing me. Ended up paying 200pp for a 35% rez, as that's all I could find and losing exp in the low 50s was painful.<br />
<br />
...Thinking I could single pull Chief Ry'Gorr yesterday during the 8th ring war - I ended up training half the fort on my unsuspecting guild raid force, just after I turned round to see 20 odd orcs and giants annihilating me that is. LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....<br />
<br />
...Summoning a NORENT bag while farming Fine Steel weapons in Guk; to cut a long story short I left my beloved JBB in it, and didn't realise until the following day - bah.<br />
<br />
...A couple of weeks ago, my guild raided Fear, in an attempt to get a tear for me. We broke in well enough, then it was up to me to lead the way to the golems (I'd not been there before). Headed north from the zonein, by mistake, then went back the way I'd come and east. Pulled a spidery type mob, all alone on a hill, then watched in horror as a contingent of sarecrows came close to me. Even worse, these 100-hitters then seemed to teleport me around, ending up with me dead in the middle of nowhere and a lot of angry mobs after the rest of the raid. Zoned in, naked, nearly died to a scareling at the zonin. Gated out. Zoned in again, still naked, avoided the first scareling then got aggro from two more. Channeled a Gate. Zoned in a third time, saw my raid force at a nearby wall. No scarelings - so headed towards them, only to find I'd got company. Walked straight back at the mobs and, while they were hitting me, channeled another gate. Thankfully, they didn't aggro on the raid - and after getting a rez, we left, tails between our legs. So much for it being an &quot;easy&quot; epic!  :( <br />
<br />
...Trying to cross Siren's Grotto to get to Western Wastes. Zoned in, invised, jumped in the first pool and aggroed a swordfish and seahorse. There then followed what seemed like an eternity as I tried casting slow, root, Q, Tnarg's and Gate (in that order), only to have  every single cast interrupted as I was being pushed around. I ended up clicking my emergency Gate potion, so that failed attempt cost me just over 1000pp. Needless to say, I've not been back.<br />

One that is fun I've done a couple times, is VP myself. My assist key is the same number as my VP key, just on different pages. So, I have just finished CannV and drop a Q on myself, then forget to change the page back and try to assist the MT. It's kinda fun tossing yourself across the room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I used to play with my cleric friend Resident all the time. We had a deal, he would heal me, I would go kill everything out in the grey. I could handle 2-3 snakes with him just dotting them and healing me. After each fight I would canno down with canno 4 and he would heal me just before the last cast goes off to kill me. It was a game we play.<br />
<br />
One day in PoP He's the cleric in my group at the tin men camp. We are just wasting time killing stuff with no real purpose in mind. I was lom from playing around and canno. My group sat there, waiting for respawn and watches me canno to death. He forgot to tell me he was afk :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">was on a hard ldon adv a while back, well wound up getting an odd pull with 3 mobs and I was of course sitting on about 35% mana(thanks for asking before the pull) well I got 2 maloed and slowed, one person tnarged and was sitting on mana vapors, so I popped off a Q/canni V and dropped down to about 1300 hp so I could take care of the last mob which wasn't mezzed yet, had my finger on the VP button the whole time to clear myself of the inevitable low health aggro; well cleric tosses me a heal when the mob was barreling down on me, it changes gears and mows the cleric down(who was at half health already). I VPed the last mob, slowed it and we made it through the pull and cleric gets a pally rez. <br />
<br />
So at least I didn't kill myself with canni V but someone else ^_^</div></div><hr />

...the tents at the NRo adventurers camp are good for this.<br />

'Aim' yourself and your horse in such a manner as to get the best 'trajectory'<br />
<br />
Debuff yourself (not a must but resists can be frustraing when you get too many resists)<br />
<br />
Emote feeding the horse a gallon of beans, hit a clicky with big green particle effects, Shrunken Gobby earring maybe....immediatley cast VP upon yourself.<br />
<br />
End result, the audience sees you force feeding beans to your horse, your horse launches off the top of the tent leaving a trail of green smoke behind his butt. You and horse land 12 or so feet away from the tent to the rapturous applause of all your fans.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like having a very large wolf pup chasing down and beating the snot out of a level 2 berserker to get you that good feeling. Kinda funny to hear the newbs shout hey where the hell that come from, run run.<br />
Or summon no rent bag after no rent bag or black bread or water pods and drop along paths nice to see how many you can lay down before he first start popping, even funnier watching newbies fight over them.<br />

First time in over a year as a shaman...and..accidentally canicided... within a couple minutes, a cleric 'tripped' over my corpse, rezzed me, virtued me, and her ench bot c5'd me.  Backin business!<br />

After awhile, this warrior and bot cleric from an elemental/VT guild come by and group me since they wanted whisperling faction.  I was allowed to leech the XP.  After awhile, me and warrior run to umbral to check our whisperling faction withthe remains guy..run invis...I pick up a undead add.  Warrior: &quot;Hrm, thats a tough mob, better zone i'll die&quot;  Me:&quot;No, I brought it, we can take it&quot;  Proceed to slow/debuff said mob, put pet onit, dot and warrior needs a heal.  Hit my heal hotkey...and wind up in pok... Forgot that I swapped kragg's out for gate.  Poor guy died. :)</div></div><hr />

So here we are, doing HP.<br />
Its a pretty slow fight for us shamans once all the adds are dead, stack a dot, stack a dot... etc<br />
<br />
So i bust out the old ID4 belt, and start laying the spears.<br />
Now, keep in mind, I two box a wizard, so im constantly switching back and forth nuking / canning / q'ing up.<br />
<br />
HP is at about 20%, wizzy goes oom, hit druzzils and laungh the swarm pets and swap back to shaman to continue the nuke brigade.<br />
<br />
my shaman is at 10%..<br />
<br />
Scroll up to see that the last 5 spears ive casted have been on myself :P<br />
<br />
Yup... one of those days<br />
<br />
heh</div></div><hr />

Don't do it around AE mobs though =).<br />

We were binding outside one of the house bosses rooms incase we out aggroed the pets and got banished. Well, instead of binding i gated all the way to PoK.</div></div><hr />
