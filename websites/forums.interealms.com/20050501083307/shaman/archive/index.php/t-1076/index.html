<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone posted something that was put in another post just to point it out, which I can't find now, saying that all abilities had their own numbers(not the1 through 10 thing), so that, for instance, he could use his canni 5 skill by typing /doability # or something like that, and that he could bring up a list of each skill with numbers -- some of them very high ones.  <br />
<br />
I thought he said by hitting shift and UP, but that doesn't do it.<br />
<br />
Could anyone help me out on this one?</div></div><hr />
