[quote]When they [Crazy Horse and his friend He Dog]were in their early twenties, however, both young men were regarded as something special by the old men of the tribe.  When they came back from a raid on the Crows, they were singled out for honors, especialy the lances of the Crow Owners Society.  The lances were three or four hundred years old.  He Dog described the occasion: &quot;Crazy Horse and I went together on a war trip to the other side of the mountain,&quot; the Bighorns.  &quot;When we came back the people came out of the camp to meet us and escorted us back and at a big ceremony presented us with two spears, the gift of the whole tribe, which was met together.  These spears were given by the older generation to those in the younger generation who had best lived the life of a warrior.&quot;-&quot;Comrades&quot;, ch4 Friendship For Life:  Crazy Horse and He Dog, Stephen Ambrose<br />
