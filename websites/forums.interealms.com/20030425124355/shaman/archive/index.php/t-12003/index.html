<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After realizing I was spending too much time dancing and not enough time fighting, I decided to do the quest last night. <br />
<br />
I found the strange ochre clay in bazaar for 50p and snapped it up - 1 down.<br />
<br />
I made my first trip to Dreadlands and Karnors Castle to try the &quot;/ooc loot bone chips&quot; request as recommended in the walkthrough. What a place...just getting to the castle was intimidating. I zoned in to Karnors Castle and there were 12 corpses at the line....yeesh! I hoped they had been dragged there. I asked in ooc if anyone was killing the Skeletal Warlord and someone said &quot;yes&quot;. I asked if I could trade shaman buffs for the bone chips and was told to wait at the entrance until the warlord spawned. About 25 minutes, and 2 trains, later I got a tell to come to the well and loot. I checked the eqatlas map and nothing named the well. I told him I dont see the well on the map. He told me to just come to the LCY. Nothing like that on the map, either. Then he told me to come all the way to the back and turn left. I said ok and then all my buffs started blinking....can it get any worse? Time was running out, so I made sure gate was memmed, invised myself, and ran for the back left corner. The room was empty, then my guy appeared and led me to the next room. I looted the bone chips and breathed a sigh of relief. Before I could buff him he ran off, so I sit and memmed the usual melee buffs. He came back and asked for strength and dex. I didn't realize he was the puller and had just pulled, so I started buffing and got aggro from the skeleton he just brought in! Only got hit twice before the group got his attention and I moved to another corner. After the fight I finished the buffs, thanked him again, and gated out - 2 down.<br />
<br />
Next I made my first trip to Trakanon's Teeth. This place was four times spookier than Dreadlands. Of course, the hunting spot for Yun Shamans was all the way across the zone. After zoning in from Swamp of No Hope, I went south along the wall until I was even with the gate to Old Sebilis, then went east. It was night...and raining...and I could hear things. Got to the gate safely, went through, summoned pet, buffed, and took a deep breath. Then the rain stopped and the sun came up...ok, maybe a good omen. Went back out the gate and headed west. Within 30 seconds I saw movement, targeted it, and it was a Yun Shaman, moving fast! Sent the pet in and waited until he taunted, then cast the first DoT. Pet gets jumped by Yun Knight and I can't heal fast enough. I root them both and scoot. Then I notice about 3 new icons in my effects window, none of them good. I healed myself a couple of times, medded, summoned another pet, buffed, and took another deep breath. I know they're both out there waiting for me. Headed back over to first fight area and get jumped by the shaman. Pet engaged shaman and I backed off and rooted him. Then I get jumped by the knight and I rooted him and backed off. I nuke several times with new poison blast spell and shaman goes down just after the pet. I try to move over to loot....what the ?...I'm rooted! I looked at the knight, he looked at me, and my root icon started to blink! I rooted the knight again for good measure, looted the shaman powder, and gated out - 3 down.<br />
<br />
Now for the easy one, the crushed diamonds. I headed to the Firiona Vie docks to get on the boat. There's a Translocator guy there that told me the boats aren't working and he can transport me to Timorous Deep. I asked him to and I appeared on the dock at Timorous Deep. I ran to the south end of the island and found a large stone bird statue. From there I levitated, invised, and ran straight south to the location in the walkthrough, picked up the bag, ran back to the dock, and got transported back to the Firiona Vie docks - 4 down.<br />
<br />
I walked over to Marlyn McMerin's shop, gave her the 4 items, and pressed &quot;Give&quot;. The bone chips appeared on my mouse pointer and I saw a message that she had no use for these. Then I got all the quest completion messages, experience, and faction adjustment messages. Then I got 2 messages from her listing the items she wanted. I checked and the spell scroll was in my inventory. I sat down and added it to my spell book and all was ok.<br />
<br />
So I submitted a /bug report, but I got the spell! Yea!<br />
<br />
Note to self: make sure you know what's going on around you before you start casting buff spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What happened was someone turned the warlord's bone chips in without turning in the other items.  The new quest NPC code hands back items that are already in.<br />
<br />
Not a bug, just a very good feature ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been doing this quest this week.  Only need the Yun Shaman Powder now. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falmorn Hawkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh.<br />
<br />
Did the quest a little bit ago (yeah, I was 52 at the time, so sue me), and had something very similar.  McMerin took my diamonds, gave me back the yun shaman powder, and ate the clay and bone chips.  I almost  went running back for the dread diamonds to get another copy for another shaman, but decided to load the NPC with the powder for a future shaman to &quot;get lucky&quot;.<br />
<br />
Side note:  I'm damn  glad I got Cann2, wish I'd done the quest much sooner.<br />
<br />
And my stuck point was the powder.  I had the other three components for about four levels until I went into Trak's Teeth alone one fine Sunday day.  I was complaining about the rain and lack of visibility to my guild, and someone said they'd bring on their tracker.  Before I could say, &quot;No, I'm just bitching for the form of it,&quot; they'd already logged.  So I headed back to the zone line, and lo and behold, I stumbled across a Yun shaman!  And silly me, I only had Turgur's and eBolt loaded.  So I slowed, and spent the rest of the time &quot;nuking&quot; with my eBolt.  Yun Shaman 0, Falmorn (scared silly and exhilarated) 1.   :D <br />
<br />
Those are the experiences that make EQ fun.  Hands down.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am not sure why people are having problems with the Yun powder... the Yun shamans are always up in Trakanon's Teeth.  Just get a ranger friend to track for you or run around in the appropriate area.  Each time I got my Yun powder (first one was lost to a server crash and the second came 5 minutes after the server came up ;) it took me all of a few seconds to find them in tracking on my ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chaw, your bone chips explanation makes sense. This means it wouldn't be an exploit if I got the other 3 items and made another scroll to sell or trade. Interesting that the bone chips are the only lore, nodrop item of the 4 needed, so someone couldn't have had an extra one to turn in earlier.<br />
<br />
I agree, the Yun Shaman was easy to find once you get in the right area. I thought it was more fun to do the quest with my shaman, because she doesn't have the tracking ability. I usually die twice in each new zone until I get a feel for the place, and I wasn't looking forward to a corpse recovery in Trakanon's Teeth. And those frogs move fast...no running away until you root 'em! <br />
<br />
By the way, numerically the difference between Cannibalize and Cannibalize II doesn't seem that much, but in practice it makes a big difference. I solo kited/root rotted spectres in Oasis last night for 5 yellow bubbles and chased down 3 sand giants and never got below 50% mana (with kei going, of course). Didn't bother with the pet because it was too much trouble to slow all the spectres then start casting DoTs. I should have been doing this several levels ago; the spectres seem to give a lot of experience for their level, or maybe it was because I always pulled 2 to 4 of them at a time. Controlling 4 spectres on a pull gets the pulse rate up a little, even if they do move slowly. (Note to anyone who tries this: please pull them to the south of the lake and keep them away from the lower-level groups at orc highway and the docks. If you lose control warn the zone and fix the damage. If you think spectres look creepy at level 44, imagine how they look to a level 15 player.)<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend doing the quest for the new-zone experience alone, but no matter how you do it, get Cannibalize II as soon as you can. If you're a bazaar-browser, keep an eye out for the clay and powder. As I said previously, I bought the clay for 50p. I saw the powder this morning for 300p, and the run to the iceberg is trivial. It's just those bone chips &lt;shiver&gt;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd have gone nuts if I hadn't gotten my Canni II spell.  It makes a huge difference for me in how fast I recover my mana.  It's very appropriate for the level you obtain it too because Canni I starts to become cumbersome at that same time.<br />
<br />
Can't wait til level 44 and Mini Torpor!  Rar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rah!<br />
<br />
I used Shiuna's method of traveling south along the wall and as soon as I was roughly level with the gates I saw my first Yun.  I charged into battle and 30 seconds later Gated out again... Remember to get a KEI and have your pet up. ;)<br />
<br />
I returned, properly prepared this time (full hp,ac,resist buffs on myself and dog), and saw a Yun, again, almost immediately upon getting to the level of the gate.  I charged in... and agro'd a knight.  By the time he was dead the Yun was gone so I settled down to wait against the wall.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later the Yun was back and I took him. :D<br />
<br />
It would seem that waiting against the west wall, at the approximate level of the gate, allows a clear view of the Yun Shamans patrol route/spawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the beginning, the frogloks and other jungle creatures coexisted peacefully in the happy valleys of Trakanon's Teeth. Back then, a froglok yun shaman was not hard to find. Then a few months ago, a change came. Frogloks became aggressive, attacking everything. They nearly became extinct for it, making it very difficult for a shaman to find even one. But more recently, another change was made. The frogloks have taken over, and blindfolded you could easily find many yun shamans in the south part of the zone.</div></div><hr />
