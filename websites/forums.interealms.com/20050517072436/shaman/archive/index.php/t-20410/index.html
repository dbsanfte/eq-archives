<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I've been reading through the message boards lately, and seeing all the talk about how we need this &amp; we need that to fix the Shaman class.  So I started thinking about other things that Sony could do to help the game progress somewhat and in turn be able to make the appropriate changes needed to many classes.<br />
<br />
From what I see Sony is having a difficult time balancing new content encounters with Old World encounters.  Every time they add in a new expansion they are making the old world encounters more trivial.  Well what if instead of making stuff harder, why not spend some time revamping some of the older content.  To make thing more inline with what player’s can do with today’s items/gear.  <br />
<br />
I personally love the older content.  I still have not bought GoD and probably won't.  I’ve spend most of my time lately exploring my old hunting grounds (everything pre-Luclin).  I have a blast walking thought these old hunting grounds &amp; seeing the mobs that use to scare the **** out of me.  I mean it is mostly trivial now, but it would be great if we could some how find a way to make these zones useable again.  My last trip to LGuK had like 3 people in there (2 65's &amp; one anon).<br />
<br />
I would really like to see them revamp most of the old world content to upgrade the drops to be something close to or equal to the loot found in the current day zones.  This also means that I would like to see the mobs matched with today’s standards as well.  When I start my alts I try my best to use these older would zones, but have a difficult time finding groups.  Seems everyone is stuck in Luclin.  Maybe it’s just me (Left the game for the entire release of Luclin), but I just don't know what the appeal is.<br />
<br />
I know that this probably won't happen has there would have to be a lot of time and effort put into revamping the older items &amp; zones to keep them inline with today’s standards, and that means less money in it for Sony (so it’s really not going to happen).. But I think it would really nice for the older players to be able to pick up some of their favorite old items and have them actually be useable or considered as a useable item, instead of vendor trash.  <br />
<br />
Well back to my dreaming, and continuing to explore every aspect of the old world..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've actually hit on something there.<br />
<br />
I'd say it boils down to this:<br />
<br />
If Sony is so concerned about class balancing trivializing old content, then they have the duty to go back and &quot;fix&quot; the old content.<br />
<br />
If they are not concerned about trivializing the old content, then we need to see the end to that excuse when talking about balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last night instead of just using the PoK books I started in Feerot and visited:<br />
<br />
Feerott, Ogguk, Rathe Mountains, Lake Rathe, South Karanas, West Karanas, Port back to Feerott then Upper Guk and Lower Guk.<br />
<br />
I know its just nostalgia, but I really enjoyed cruising through the old zones. South Karanas is HUGE (even bigger than an Xbox!)  Guk is an *amazing* dungeon and I really enjoyed running around exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sorry but I'd rather that they didn't change all the old world content. <br />
<br />
I still enjoy taking an alt to some of the old Dungeons to level up in. Dont get me wrong I do enjoy the revamped Nurga/Droga. I spend nearly all my solo time in Droga at the moment, but I think if they just raised the level of all the old content it would stop lower level characters from being able to learn the art of dungeon crawling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't believe it is the &quot;lower level&quot; old world content that is in contention.<br />
<br />
I think the point of contention is the &quot;upper level&quot; old world content.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, if SoE is holding back balancing because a L65 blows thru N Qeynos and wastes Fippy . . . come on.  That's a &quot;well duh&quot; moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you revamp the old uber content, that sort of leaves newer guilds boned for progression, don't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Old world content has no bearing on Planes progression . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They revamped Cazic Thule, that seemed to go over well. <br />
Sub-50's have PLENTY of places to hunt in. It's the 65's <br />
who run out of content - and most everyone's heading to<br />
level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The whole problem is how SoE is coming at the game. For them everything has to be BIGGER BETTER MORE UBER.<br />
<br />
I think SoE needs to expand its content without making the game harder and harder and levels high and higher and more raiding upon raiding.<br />
<br />
Old EQ was like reading a good interactive book. It was something you enjoyed to do and could at your leasure. Now its a job to get the next bigger best thing or kill the newest meanest mob.<br />
<br />
Raiding is good, big mobs to kill are fun, but expand the whole game. Right now if you arent 65 you just sloshing around in largly unkept content. No new quests, no zone blancing no spell reviews, its all about getting to 60+ and dealing with that content.<br />
<br />
Its killing the game if you ask me. Its has its fun points, but its truly unhealthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Although it might be hard to implement, this is my idea of how they should 'revamp' old content.<br />
<br />
Each zone has a staging area - and the zone is instanced based on the level of the person/group entering it...once inside the zone, you can only group with people +/- 5 levels of you, so that the zone instance stays valid.<br />
<br />
I guess that is kind of putting the LDON concept to the old content, but it makes any zone you go into somewhat of a challenge.<br />
<br />
I don't mean all zones should be this way, only ones they revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">More instanced zones, especially dungeon zones, would be welcome, and especially at lower levels.<br />
<br />
I would have loved to do a crawl thru BlackBurrow without worrying about re-pop behind me when I was in my early teens.<br />
<br />
I am NOT in favor of outdoor zones being instanced - that would just suck and take away from the whole &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm still pissed that they revamped Cazic Thule, that was the second best zone ever designed (pre Kunark)<br />
That was the best zone a 25-35 guy could hope for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I LOVED the original Cazic Thule zone. Stayed<br />
there for the most part from 19 until everything<br />
turned green. So close to Oggok too! <br />
<br />
However if you went there shortly before it was<br />
revamped, you'd likely find yourself the only person<br />
there. Once mobs are green, most people have no<br />
interest in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personally, I enjoy the older zones, especially dungeons.  In many ways the game has passed me by.  The flagging requirements of PoP created a bottleneck that killed my guild, and my interest in upper end content.  If they'd have introduced it the way it is now, things probably would have been different.<br />
<br />
Nowdays, it's dungeon crawling, and exploring older content that used to scare the **** out of me in the 40-50's.  Now, I go there with my SK, and take on encounters that required full groups or mini raids.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to see some revamps of some of the places similar to Droga that allow some higher level soloing/2-boxing.  Mid 50-60's mobs with decent loot drops for those willing to put the time in.<br />
<br />
On TM, Droga is the Shaman's zone.  It seems like there's a steady group that just hangs out there (like me).<br />
<br />
I am not elementally flagged or geared.  I'm wearing several pieces of Ornate that I have won the roll on, or been able to afford by farming places like Droga.  There are times I look at my old guildmates that moved on and see them in the Elementals or Time, and wish I'd have made that journey as well.  I chose not to.<br />
<br />
I traded the BS of guild officership, personality clashes, epic mania, and loot bitching to just logging on and enjoying the game.  I have several other officer friends that we just pair up and go on 3-4 man adventures, or visit some zones like CT, ToV, Velks, Seb, etc.  <br />
<br />
Not uber, but definitely playing the game for the same reasons I started playing for 3 years ago.  When that ceases to be fun, I'll cancel my accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No money in it.  Won't happen, at least not on a large scale.  Doesn't matter what else we say about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They won't revamp old zones unless they want to keep interest in the game until a hyped up new expansion comes out. New content is more money. Can't really get any money out of the revamp of old zones. Ideally it would be great if old zones were continually revamped, however I think that ideal is different from what the game is now and what the game is destined to finish as.<br />
<br />
WoW might be great in recapturing the old feeling I had with eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's how i'm looking at it, Mcroc. It's kinda sad that i'm almost ready to fully jump ship. I love my beastie, I love my guild, but EQ is getting a little musty and smelly all around. <br />
<br />
Revamped zones in the past have had one of two effects... One, it makes everything nodrop quest items for a class likely not your own (A lot of the newbie zones for quest armors), or it forces the newbie crowd to stick to Paludal LoIO DSP content by sucking away low-end dungeons and retooling them for 50+ people.<br />
<br />
Now, for those 65 people saying that they're &quot;hurting for content&quot;... You have most of PoP. You have higher-end Luclin and LDoN. You have every scrap of GoD. Maybe if you got your butts out of BoT, you would see the wide wide world. Nobody's &quot;hurting for content&quot;, folks. Even if you were, the end result of adding new zones for you is that everyone would pack in the easiest zone possible, with a second bunch sloshing through the best RvR zone possible.</div></div><hr />
