<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard the seru shard drops off regular legionaires and legionaires of the hand in Sanctus Seru.  They can be found wandering around the upper walk that goes around the city.  Can anyone confirm for me how rare they drop this and which seem to drop it more frequently.  I solo'd the area for about 3 hours last night without seeing one.  Plat was nice though and danger was minimal.  At 65, nothing assisted even if I was fighting on top of another guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you take a exp group up there, and kill for about 2-3 hours, you should see 3-4 of them.  I am pretty sure he drops it and spawns in the same spot every time, but the groups I have gone in have always just gone in circles around the catwalk.  Great exp, and a fairly common drop.  The mobs say some really funny death lines, and also drop around 20pp coin each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got my shard from one of the legos that spawned at the zone in. Got it on first kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hartmut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">seru shard is equal to katta  ...<br />
<br />
was easier for me because i was not kos in katta..<br />
<br />
only the 4 guards inside bank room drop the shard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The shard may drop in the katta bank only, but the Seru shard drops in many different spots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are actually 10 shards for the Vex Thal Key Quest that drop throught SoL.  You need a unique shard from the following 10 zones:<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peak  - soloed, took me about an hour<br />
Seru - soloed, 4th kill<br />
Sraa<br />
Maiden's Eye<br />
Scarlet Desert - buffed up a group hunting on the plateau and they let me loot one, was there about 30 minutes<br />
The Grey - first sun revenant I ever killed<br />
Akheva - soloed, 3d kill<br />
The Deep<br />
Fungus Grove<br />
Acrylia - won random on a guild raid on the way to Ring of Fire<br />
<br />
(My bank is CRYING with all this VT key quest, not to mention various PoP quest crap!)<br />
<br />
It's like the stupid VP key quest on steriods!  To complete the quest, you also need a glowing orb of luclinite (drops from nearly all SoL boss mobs) a piece from the Emperor (you have to complete an additional 4 part key quest just to get TO the emperor) and another thing I can't remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A sceptre frame which requires turning in an essence emerald to a mob in Akheva past the IV =)<br />
<br />
10 shards get combined in frame, makes a new 2 slot container.  Orb and emp peice get combined in 2 slot container to make your key and then your bank rejoices.<br />
<br />
Don't forget your melee need to do a 2 part quest to get weapons to even be able to hit the emp. And then you get to spend hours killing yard trash that can be upto lvl 66 and half or more is unmesable and probably half spawn a second mob when you kill them.<br />
<br />
As far as the actual questions. No clue just go up and solo your way around the catwalk. Personally I've gotten 4 shard drops in seru and I'm still not kos to them so it hasn't been bad for me. Even saw 2 drops consecutive mobs. On the other hand i've heard hours and hours for one shard from other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seru Shard will also drop off of the &quot;An Intervallum Guard&quot; mobs.  After killing all the legos and ignoring the guards, a guard finally jumped me and lo behold there it was.  I still have Ssra and ME to do.  ME is a pain.</div></div><hr />
