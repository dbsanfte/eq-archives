I was just surfing the EQ section of this forum and caught myself thinking &quot; these poor bastards, still pineing over a dead game &quot;.  Thats the cross over point, after coming into and leaving many game communities  im starting to recognize it. I will never again play EQ, was just sureal. I never thought i was going to be able to let it go, I loved my shaman so much, i thought i would always be logging in once in a while, but i realized tonite i will not be. I mean how many times have we all quit and come back later. how many people have said &quot; you will be back&quot; when you leave adn they turned out to be right. But no more.<br />
<br />
Onward to WoW. I cant wait, the open beta really got me pumped, i had so much fun with my hunter im going to play another one and rename her the same and make her a night elf again and just continue on. Also will make a shaman cause its simply in my blood. Hell will probably make all classes cause they are so well done, though i dont like the mage. Too much pure magic is boring to me. <br />
<br />
<br />
So how about you guys, are you truly free yet?</div></div><hr />

EQ is dead for me. My guild is falling apart and I have few friends still in the game. Many will be playing EQ2 or WoW. I have tried every mmorpg since DaoC looking for that wondereous feeling that I had when I started EQ and I finally found it with WoW. Looking back I feel kinda sad. 120 days played on my shaman with alot of memories. I hope my my days in azeroth are just as special.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">E-what?<br />
<br />
Seriously. I may go back for a month just to see what's what - but WoW is all I expected it to be.<br />
<br />
And more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will never again play EQ, was just sureal. <br />
<br />
I completely agree with you about the feeling you get when coming to the realization that you will never again play Everquest.  It really was a very surreal feeling.  Though I think a lot of my surrealism came from the fact that I was not only retiring from EQ but taking a good long break from MMOs entirely until WoW's release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ has been dead to me since I got in to closed beta 6 months ago...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guild leader saw attendance dropping off, tried WoW beta for two weeks, then announced he was retiring with an intention to restart in WoW. Getting to take the vast majority of your guild into WoW with you for the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quit a long time ago.  WoW is going to own so much.  I can't wait for the high level PvP wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I completely agree Litgruv. I played WoW Open Beta and reallized that EQ was a dead horse. I killed my 3 EQ account's.  Can't wait for the 23!<br />
I will never go back to EQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly what I think everytime I read the other sections of this forum too, Litgruv.<br />
<br />
I too have quit many times only to come back... first for AO, then for DAoC, then for Shadowbane (lol!), then for SWG.  But this time it is for real for sure.  I haven't logged in since whenever it says in my sig.  I wasn't even playing any MMORPG's in the meantime.  Everytime I even thought of playing EQ, I thought of how many locked zones I couldn't get into, how huge the gear gap, all that crap and I it made me want to puke.  SOE will be left with the group they catered too, the elite raider.. and even some of those guilds are bleeding players.<br />
<br />
  Now WoW has me hooked big time.  It's been a long time since my only thoughts on the way home from work each day is to log on and play until I can't keep my eyes open... and repeat this process day after day.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for Tuesday!</div></div><hr />

I have a  small guild of friends gonna be on a pvp server somewhere, pvp is damn fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same here, played stress test in September and couldn't find myself logging in on EQ anymore.  Cancelled the whole **** and saved me some money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have not raided/played in EQ in roughly 2 months now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll add my 2 cents in here, too, I guess. :) I got invited into the closed stress test, and during that time, I was still an active EQ player.  As I played, I stopped playing EQ.<br />
<br />
And after the stress test... I couldn't log back on.  <br />
<br />
Then I got my closed beta invite.  I cancelled my EQ account.<br />
<br />
Theres too much downtime (and that didn't really change in EQ2 from watching over my cousin's shoulder either).  The fights are too slow.  Only certain classes could solo effective - and theres still very strong incentive to group (it's just not to grind for XP)<br />
<br />
I will probably be on the pacific RolePlay server (if there isn't a PVP RP server) if anyone wants to look me up come Tuesday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I will likely leave behind my shaman with qvic+ gear and over 800 AA.  I was hesitant to do so before playing WoW, because I've spent almost 250 days in EQ advancing my character.  WoW seems to be a much better product and seeing that made me not care about dismissing 9 months of online effort.  I want to relax and not worry about what raid target has changed, or hasn't changed because the devs are still toying with the encounter.  Even if just for a month or two while I level up to 60.  It will be good to explore and level with old friends again, and then hopefully to raid with them.  It's going to be one or the other and I'll know by the end of the month which it is.</div></div><hr />
