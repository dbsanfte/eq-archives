<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bunch of my friend and I just moved back to EQ from DAOC...one of them had deleted his characters(doh) so we are trying to PL his enchanter back up.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any great ideas for PLing an enchanter to 40 with a 60 shaman? Enchanter is currently lvl 30. Just need to get him up to lvl 40 so he can exp group with the rest of us(mostly 60).<br />
<br />
Strategy and zone ideas would be great if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Runja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems memory blur (lvl 12 chanter spell) would be all you need.   With that spell, nearly any class is a great power leveler.  Just beat the mob down to near death.  Then, have the enchanter mem blur twice (to be sure) and then the chanter nukes it to get the kill and xp.  The mob can't be too high level compared to the enchanter otherwise mem blur won't land.  The tricky part about mem blur is that you will never get a message if it was resisted.<br />
<br />
Any zone with blue, white, or yellow (not red) mobs would work fine with this method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can you think of a good zone with low HP lvl 30-40 mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try bloodgill goblins in LOiO, one shaman epic gets them low enough to run away, but not die normally. So would be easy to memblur it while its running then finish it off. Can rootpark 2 at once then epic, memblur and they will die for 30 mana =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is easy now that pet exp rules and pet agro has changed. <br />
I 2 boxed a 57 shaman with an enchanter and worked out some tactics I posted before.<br />
<br />
1&gt;work in outdoor zones for safety. you know the good zones. avoid those with giants nearby.<br />
2&gt;I used pets for both.  shaman pet is essential, not chanter's.<br />
3&gt;tactics designed to move all the risk to the shaman and uses mind wipe heavily.<br />
4&gt;shaman and chanter select a pull spot and set up at 90degree angles from it. important later.<br />
5&gt;chanter parks pet in the death walk lanes from that spot, shaman pet parked away from the spot within calling range.<br />
6&gt;shaman pulls with malosini (even easier with malo), pulls to spot, roots, slows if needed to extend pet life. shaman pet agros.<br />
7&gt; shaman proceeds to JBB/melee etc, but do not use mana to kill.  let shaman pet do the work. your shaman pet is most mana efficient powerleveling tool enchanter has to do damage.<br />
8&gt;chanter stands only to tash.  keep mob rooted when under 40%<br />
9&gt;when mob gets to under 20% life, chanter stands and mezzes.<br />
if mezz fails, shaman and pet kills mob. if it sticks, shaman pet walks away since agro breaks. <br />
10&gt; shaman moves back.  angle here is important, mindwipe is increasingly unreliable as you level and mobs get bigger so you want to know when it works. cast until the mob changes direction looking towards chanter, signaling success.  even so you will occasionally think you have cleared its hate list and still not get the exp.  Oh well quantity will make up for it.<br />
11&gt; chanter nukes to break mezz.  depending on nuke output and life left either the mob will come hit the chanter once/twice, then death walk, or will death walk immediately. you really want chanter pet to agro if you can as it is more efficient than nuking out.  takes practice to know when to mezz as you level and take on different mobs.<br />
12&gt; chanter pet kills or chanter nuke outs, gets full exp. sit rinse repeat.<br />
13&gt;chanter does not slow, generates too much agro and eats into mana. key is to let pet regen rate work as much as possible.<br />
14&gt;chanter cast breeze/clarity/ and speed on pets. nukes, tash and mindwipe. that was it.<br />
15&gt;shaman buffed all, treated it as farming greens.<br />
16&gt;chanter gates at 1st sign of trouble, shaman is more than capable of dealing with mobs at this level.  it is tempting to mezz adds but I found invising worked as well, let shaman deal with them. dont let chanter die. takes too long to make up the time lost.<br />
<br />
essentially the enchanter is offsourcing debuffing, rooting, slowing, and all the damage onto shaman and shaman pet. it was much harder before the pet agro changes since you had to do all the damage and control the pet which often killed the mob. Mezz breaking pet agro helps a ton.  Gives the chanter plenty of time. Even if mindwipe fails, mob normally is much madder at the shaman pet for doing 80% damage to it.  I ran my chanter to 30 using the shaman pet to do 80% of the damage. shaman added 1-4 Jbb shots as we progressed past L30 and pet started to take a pounding. <br />
<br />
loio, overthere, fvie spiders (always available), eastern wastes walruses/ulthorks, later on dawnshroud is good.  Feerott ruins outside Ct is better than people think for powerleveling. Lots of static mobs. I mean lots of fast repopping mobs that dont wander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice PL strat there.  I'd use the strat above but possibley try it someplace with faster spawn rates and lower hp mobs.  Personally I think, If you are gonna PL a caster stick to old world.  All the mobs have low hps by comparison to thier same level counterparts in other expansions.  I PL'ed a cleric thru all of helllevel 35 in 2hours with a 56monk in lower guk.<br />
<br />
Pull, beat the hell out of it to less than half a bubble<br />
Cleric roots<br />
Feign Death<br />
Cleric Atones and blasts<br />
woot, xp<br />
<br />
Think would work much the same with a chanter, using a melee, preferably a monk to PL the chanter is probably your best bet.  Of course this will hurt his spell casting skills, but only way you are gonna PL and keep spell skills up is if he has a manastone and chloro.  I think the main thing when PLing though is simply to stick to old world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe, I kind of think of Kunark as the old world now compared to Velious and Luclin.  Point taken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I must say that Punko123's Bloodgil idea worked extremely well, PL'd my chanter buddy to 40 in no time. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks as well for the other ideas guys, still need to do this for a warrior and ranger friend of mine. :)</div></div><hr />
