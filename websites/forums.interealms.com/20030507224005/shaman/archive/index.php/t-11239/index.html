<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend recently decided to transfer his level 53 halfling cleric to the server I play on.  I am a level 60 shaman with jbb, torpor, no horse, no epic.  I am wondering where are some good spots for us to duo to help him regain equipment? <br />
<br />
I thought PoG would be good, try to get armor of stability, could duo yeldema maybe other weak dragons on WW for armor and talisman.  <br />
<br />
I will do some research once his transfer is processed, but in the mean time if anyone has some time and some ideas i'd appreciate some help.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could duo PoG but the armor drops aren't that great there except for the BP and legs which fall off the much more difficult named. However with the money you make there you can easily outfit the cleric with enough buyable armor to at least get him on his feet again. <br />
<br />
You could also duo the bank in Kael for corroded drops. The drop rate isn't that great but I've seen a lot more plate drop there than any chain. Seen plate BP, arms and bracer drop in the time I soloed there.<br />
<br />
I don't know enough about cleric armor to help much with where to hunt the nice cleric no drop stuff but I know that from hunting in PoG you will make sizeable amount of money to pay for a respectable suit of dropable cleric armor.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />
