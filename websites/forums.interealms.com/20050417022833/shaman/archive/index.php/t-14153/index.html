<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, here are the places I've tried...need a good spot, I'd like some loot too as I just upgraded so i got only about 1k in the bank:<br />
<br />
1. JP: awesome solo xp ( made a yellow in about 30-35 minutes after only like 6 gnolls) but lots of trouble with adds. Even with virtue and kei, stupid gnolls kept coming. Handled about the first 6, then pet died, I'm low mana/health and had to get out...maybe a better spot to camp there? (was pretty much right at entrance, maybe a little further in the caves.<br />
<br />
2. KC: too many idiots who like to train you, nice xp but morons make this place unsavory anymore.<br />
<br />
3. SD: Someone said this place was good xp...it was terrible...all light blues, some shaman casters that are more trouble than they are worth<br />
<br />
4. COM: lot of trouble with adds, good group spot I'd guess, haven't been there too much.<br />
<br />
5. IG's: terrible xp and loot contrary to what people say. Only time I ever made anything was if I had the front 2 to myself, which happens once every millenium or so.<br />
<br />
6.PoJ: was pretty decent xp when I was in a group of only 3, kind of difficult as it's a trainy place with pesky rat adds. Full group one time netted me a whole yellow in 4 hours (yuck). Died alot here, doubt it's a good solo spot, with all the rats running around.<br />
<br />
7. HHK: Camped alot, tried to go there about 5 times, 3 times camped, one time got too close to those stupid dark elves in Kithicor and they slaughtered me in about 2 seconds hehe, other time I made the mistake of travelling through night, got trained by a ton of some tough ass green zombies, got annoyed and gated. No xp in HHK anyway I hear.<br />
<br />
So, those are the places I've tried, and the results. Keep in mind I don't have LoY ( I know I know - Dulak would be a great spot), so I'm looking for other suggestions. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>HamptinHoptin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just hit 52 and i'm looking for a solo spot where I can get at least 1% per kill (besides highkeep).  I noticed you listed JP gnolls as giving you a full yellow on just 6 gnolls at lvl 53.  Did you mean full blue?  I've been killing the warriors and such and I've been averaging 1% ever 2 solo kills which takes me 40 gnolls just for one yellow.  <br />
<br />
Thinking of hitting howling stones zone in next.</div></div><hr />

yea mistake on my part.... I was getting about a yellow an hour or so...meant to say blue before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dulak is still the place to be for me at 52.  I went to ME last night and tried the apes and toilers.  Actually, these mobs, especially the toilers were easier than blue cons in dulak, and pulls in Me are much harder.  I've been in the armory in Dulak lately, kinda boring, but all DB and 1/10 drop a gem.  The caves are nice, too, in dulak, but finding a good spot to camp can be tough at times.  And, getting feared by the occassional Hatebringer will bring a quick end to your time (gate out).  Still, there are a lot of places to camp in dulak up to level 55, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HamptinHoptin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I hit howling stones zone in yesterday and it was pretty decent exp at 52.  I was getting about 2% reg exp every 3 kills at 52.  Things are still dark blue at 53 but didnt spend time to kill anything after I dinged.  I'll head back there tomorrow to see how it is.  Pretty quiet, only seen one person zone in the whole time I was there (about 4-5 hours).  Only real danger is there might be 2 HT mobs up when you zone in and usually they aggro and they see invis (undead) so be ready for them.<br />
<br />
Also, the east stairs is a trap so dont go running up there or you'll fall down below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen a 59 druid quadding on one of the boats, and it wasn't the hardest either. Mobs on the dandolak are still dark blue to my 54 ranger dual box, and i'm still having trouble clearing the entire boat. I'll probably stay on this boat for another level or two, then move up to the next one as soon as I start waiting on spawns alot.</div></div><hr />
