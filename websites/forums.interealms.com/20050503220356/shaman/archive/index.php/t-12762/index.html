<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this has been covered before, I did a search and found nothing.<br />
I'm a little confused as to how the stat cap works.  I am lvl 54 sham with a wis of ~236 unbuffed.  When I am KEI'd it hits 250 and does not go any higher.  Someone told me that even though it only says 250 it is actually higher (258 or whatever).  Is this true or is 250 as high as I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">255 is the stat cap for level 60 and under. From 61 to 65, the cap automatically goes up by 5 per level. Also starting at 61, you can train AA planar advancement to raise your caps an additional 5. And you can train AA innate enlightenment to raise your WIS/INT caps an additional 10 points per level. So at 65 with AA points, your WIS cap can be as high as 355.<br />
<br />
The fact that the caps can go up probably means that the displayed cap is indeed the cap and any extra WIS over the cap is lost.</div></div><hr />

Pre-61, the cap is 250. Your gear,buffs, etc may actually add up to more than 250, but anything above 250 has no bearing on game mechanics.<br />
<br />
61+ (or maybe at level 60), the cap increases 5 points per level... so at level 61, a Shaman max Wisdom is 255, at 65 the cap is 275... additionally, there is an AA that will allow for even higher maxxes up to a in-game maximum of 305 Wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">kei adds 25 wis - is your wis exactly that much?<br />
I believe the cap pre 61 is 255..not positive.<br />
i know at 65 with no aa's cap is 280 on stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you.  That answers my question.  It looks like I should be trading up some wis gear for ac/hp/mana stuff as I am usually kei'd.  <br />
Thank you very much again.</div></div><hr />

The cap is 250?<br />
<br />
I thought it was 255? Or is that only for other classes? I know for a definite that my druid friend has their WIS maxxed out at 255. And they're level 57?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The cap should be 255 on all stats before level 61.<br />
<br />
Don't forget between 255 and 280, you only get about 1/2 the return on any stat as before 255, and past 280 the return ratio gets even worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not true, I am level 61 and my wis caps at 260.</div></div><hr />
