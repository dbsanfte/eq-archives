<br />
Shaman have two types of slows, magic based and disease based.  <br />
<br />
* Magic based - Turgurs (level 51) slows up to 75% by level 60.  Resists vs. magic but &quot;cured&quot; via cure disease.  This is a fairly recent but positive change making it possible to cure a slow off a melee character without stripping all their beneficial buffs.  Turgur's has a duration of 6.5 minutes at level 65.<br />
<br />
* Disease based - Cloud of Grummus (level 61) - slows up to 40%.  Resists vs. disease and cured via disease.  We get a lower level version of this spell Plague of Insects at level 54 (25% slow).  There are some mobs which are only susceptible to disease based slows (Turgurs won't land).  Cloud of Grummus has a duration of 3.3 minutes at level 65.<br />
<br />
We also get Tigir's Insects (level 58) which is a spell that can slow up to 4 targets (including the caster, if you're not careful) by 50% at level 60. Tigirs has a duration of 3.3 minutes at level 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For most normal exp mobs, magic based slow will be your best bet.  For raid type encounters, you could consult this handy list, put together by Seredith:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw on a slow chart that some mobs can only be slowed with Torpor.  I don't have Torpor yet, but I know I can't cast Stoicism on NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They meant turgurs (the level 53 slow) not torpors which means the mob can only be slowed via the magic based line of slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lucy says that Grummus is 3.3 minutes, but I could have sworn it was longer?<br />
<br />
We did Lord Vyemm a few months ago, when affliction focus still worked on slows.  I had an EA3 item which made my turgur's last for a little over 7 minutes, but wouldn't work on grummus.  I slowed Vyemm as we engaged and watched my timer.  I got distracted by his oh-so-fun AE, and forgot to reslow.  Vyemm was at like 2% life or and came unslowed and killed our tank, then died (tank was pissed =P).  I looked at my timer and it looked like it wore off right at 6 minutes.  I was the only shaman there with grummus... Maybe I am just remembering it wrong.<br />
<br />
edit:  About the original topic - Don't worry about disease slows.  You won't get them until much later in your life and you will only use them on the occasional raid that has a magic-immune but slowable target (Lord Vyemm in NToV, Emperor Ssra, and I think the HoH dragon as well).  Just use your magic based slow ( &quot;____'s Insects&quot;) on everything you fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">turgurs you use 95% of the time.  DR slow is for special circumstances.  AE slow is a great spell but more for raiding when lots of stuff being pulled, and depending on the set up.  One thing people always seem to forget is that AE slow has a neg hate reducer so comes in handy for raids.  but all in all tugur's is the way to go all the time.<br />
<br />
side note, jinheim dont forget EA3 never worked on cloud of grummus because grummus is a 61 spell and EA3 only does up to lvl 60.  not realy sure what went on for you :)</div></div><hr />
