<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I've gone squish like 2 times trying to solo moktors in umbral... once was an assasin added cause I started a torpor late and got low health agro as someone pulled through me. once was hitting cannib 5 when I was nowhere near prepared for it but still I don't see myself as near winning the fights I was in since they love to summon. I wasn't near winning I don't think... <br />
<br />
Check out mah magelo and see if you can figure out if I'm just not well equipped or AA'd enough for this yet?<br />
<br />
Slow, epic (hard as hell to channel), plague, pox, bane. re epic and re bane as necessary. root keep back as much ass possible for less hits....<br />
<br />
Should I be trying other mobs? where do you solo in the zone? I'm pulling to near zoneline...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a very wierd fight.  I spent some time watching a better equipped shaman doing this before I made my attempt.  The first torpor, the mob is down like 5% hp.  By the 4th, the critter is down under half.  It's fun to watch.  And one helluva rush to do.<br />
<br />
Once I leaped in and tried to solo my own moktor, I already had a satisfying adrenaline rush  *grin*.  It's not too bad.  The only thing I changed with these from the crap blues I used to solo is that I don't try to do epic first, just takes too long.  I never had issues with my mana during this fight.  Though I'm using the cheapo horse, and these fights are so long that it's probably helping a LOT.  My AC was only about 950 when I tried, so I'm pretty sure that's not your problem.  <br />
<br />
I've only had the one chance to try it so far (guildies always show up when I'm in UP now, go figure), and I did get smeared, but the only reason for that was my slow wore off halfway thru a torpor and I didn't manage to channel.  I'm pretty confident that next time, if I just re-slow halfway through, it shouldn't be a problem at all.  Or hell, if slow really is lasting longer, maybe that'll fix it.  ;)<br />
<br />
I'm also pretty sure that I lost track of a dot wearing off in there somewhere.  The critter had a bub of health when it whacked me, so I think I was just being a little sloppy.<br />
<br />
I'd say don't bother trying to root, the summon seems to automatically interrupt.  Just stand there, take the hits, and dot, torpor, dot, torpor, dot, torpor.  I think I was even crippling in there a bit, seems to lower the dmg on the higher cons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get your back against a wall or in a corner and it makes it alot easier to channel casts. I was able to solo these before any aa skills, but using malo and torpor. DO NOT forget to reslow. I have gate out when doing these in case something goes wrong. Its even possible to swap spells during the fight cause they hit so slow when turgur'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont really have much question about soloing a moktor.  I havent tried it yet, but in my umbral xp group I try and be the tank as much as possible.  If I have c3 on I am the tank every fight.  It actually works better as then the cleric can nuke, I land bane and ebolt and go through one torpor each fight.  On a horse with any kind of clarity this is an easy process to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaiden on your magelo you look awful close to getting canni 5 =) GL if that's what your saving for it's the best ability i've gotten since torpor =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I solo Moktors from time to time, and I must admit that doing this with only my own buffs is fun ... once lived with 56 HPs.<br />
I always pull with Malosini (less mana than Malo, sticks in 99%). I use the strange pathing in the tunel to zone in to my advantage and slow them while they roam back and forth. If I get resist on slow I just step up a few to get him roaming again. Don't get hit on the pull, since he won't roam then. Get into a corner, apply Dots and let Doggie chew at him from behind.<br />
Don't forget to re-slow.<br />
<br />
With Aego and/or KEI it get's easier for sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe Ive been soloing and duoing there when regular group isnt available.  A great solo spot is to the right of the zone tunnel exit.  Head along the right wall until you just get to a tree with about 4 or 5 monkey spawns.<br />
<br />
I think that is the best xp Ive found in game yet.  Solo with c3 or duo with a really good rogue.<br />
<br />
Beemine, aye Im now just two points away from canni5.  I can taste it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ok, with aego, and abit more courage soloing moktors is fun, a challenge, and worth it. but far less worth it than the gargantuans. those things hit for half or less in the average combat round and gave me more exp than some of the moktors. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any success soloing other mobs in this zone? i hear plenty are very resistant to some of our dots? I'd really like to do assasins to try to get my rogue some armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Assassins seem to be totally immune to posion and disease. :(  As a side note, peeps can find a place to solo in this zone these days?  It's always packed to the gills now on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've solo'd the elysians, usually sitting in the SE corner. Also <br />
managed Gantru, but that was before the new resist patch, <br />
haven't tried since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thanks for the info you two, but jargas, please tell us how many/if you got resisted in dots/dds. or whatever you used to solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I generally pull with Malo, then send in the dog to distract while<br />
I get off Turgur's, I've had maybe one out of 20 resisted after Malo. With Elysians and Gargantuans anyway. Then I use Pox,Epic,and JBB. I have all three affliction focuses and mana prez,<br />
so that helps alot, and a horse. If you're shooting for exp effeciency, I suggest umbrous toilers in Maidens Eye if you have<br />
a horse of any type. You can manage an AA in about 4 hours once<br />
you get a rhythm down. Also of note, but probably beaten to death, is shrooms in Fungus Grove. I get one percent per shroom solo, and usually pull two at a time. I dont need to use a fungi or horse, so the less fortunate shaman might want to try this. Also note another thread where it mentions Dog can dual wield and use procing weapons effectively. On serious long term soloing outings, i've equipped him with SSoY's or/and Gnoll Hide Lariats and they will proc.  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back against a wall is a must. I've never soloed another mob that push you as much in melee as these. Once you have that they're kinda tough. I'd say nearly twice as hard as Yeldema so if you haven't done her do it first. They're kinda bad exp solo though. Too much HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I disagree on the xp.  They key to them is to realize that what you may gain in mana effeciency by using solely disease dots, you lose in actual killing time.  It takes a lot less time to regen two bubs of mana with c3 and horse than the extra time spent killing the mob by not using poison dots.<br />
<br />
I pull with slow, root on way in, sick puppy, epic, malosini, pox, bane and ebolt.  Repeat them as needed while bracering and torporing.  I usually kill a monkey in 4 mins or so (less than two plague runs at least).  Full health and mana less than two minutes later.  With all buffing included it ends up being about a yellow every 40-45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Thats pretty dang good Id say considering that you can get either of the named (helm or bracelet guy) and get a quick 9k item right there.  The bracelet one is a blast to solo, talk about a long fight sheesh.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
I wouldnt suggest this without a horse though.  I dont canni at all during the fight unless im approaching full hp.  Levitate is a must (far less interrupts and easier casting in general).  I also dont pull to the zone, the pulls in umbral through the zonein tunnel are just too annoying for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tgout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bleh, JBB this, and JBB that. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't wear one so I am constantly finding ways to solo around being reliant upon it.<br />
<br />
Gantru are not hard to solo. Course it helps to have, Pox, Bane, and Torpor but is also doable by lower level.<br />
<br />
You can see my gear in my link below.<br />
<br />
Focus items own. Plain and simple and can help you conserve mana like nothing else.<br />
<br />
Typically I buff up, slap the puppy with a few buffs. Yank em with Slow 1 in 9 or so might resist first but the screwy pathing at zone in allows for another attempt. Walk them back to rover and get on my horse. I use the cheapy one and start swinging my Rune Etched Icewurm Fang. Pox/plague, Bane/Ebolt them and simply go to town melleing, Refresh Bane/Ebolt a minute later or so Dead Gantru. Horse + C3 = Lots of bonus Exp for hunting mobs higher level than 51. :D Our melee output is nothing to be scoffed at and when combined with our dots only brings mobs down that much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe,<br />
<br />
Tried this at 58 with a moktor, got him down to 30% and me at 2 bubs hps and less than 1 bub mana. Decided to hit the zone while i still could.<br />
<br />
Got summoned about twice i think on that short run and only just made it in time to zone to run into a train on the other side LOL. Ran back and zoned back to UP with about 50hps left and stripped of all buffs, really, really glad i left the moktor rooted :)<br />
<br />
Just thought others may find this amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I solo these easy with aego/horse and pet. No aego makes things take a little longer, gotta be more careful. Epic, bane, pox, reapply dots as needed. Only thing that is annoying is the random summon you get while casting torpor, interupts it everytime.  hell I dont even wear my fungi or cast regen. Just be careful, dont go below 40 or so mana, dont c5 unless ya have aego up. I never use malo, these things have low resists. Always keep epic dot on. The 199 hitters give almost a full blue bub of AA per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't forget your friend &quot;root&quot;.  Simple spell... but when you have doggy meleeing, all you have to do is root mob and you won't get summoned until eitehr doggy dies or root breaks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tgout, you know you arent getting any mana regen while meleeing on the horse...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, as for the iksar whining about missing out a ton with no JBB, honestly I say it is clicked maybe 5 times a week since I got 60.  I keep applying the dots and canni/torpor for mana, using E-bolt and Bane means I get time to cannit maybe 2 times and refresh torpor before I am reapplying poisons.   When I refresh disease, or rehaste pet I get no canni time, and the only bracer action I really see is when I don't need to med after battle and mob is slowly pathing away.    So on many encounters, I could just as easily be an iksar (cept I look good....)</div></div><hr />
