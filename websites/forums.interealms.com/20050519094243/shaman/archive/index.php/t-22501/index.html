---------------------<br />
<br />
- Issues for shaman and druids with the Healing Adept AA have been corrected.<br />
<br />
- Finishing Blow will correctly be capped by level.<br />
<br />
- Kick Mastery, Vicious Smash and Strengthened Strike no longer increase the damage on all melee attacks.  They now only apply to their intended attacks.<br />
<br />
- You will again have to hide to use your rogue Sneak Attack abilities.<br />
<br />
- Item recast timers should display correctly.<br />
<br />
- Planar Durability will now add the correct amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
- You now will be able to see mana displayed numerically on the default UI.  To see the mana value, you will need to view the mana bar on your inventory screen.<br />
<br />
- A casting time has been added to the Demi Lich Skullcap.<br />
<br />
- Some clickable items from the new Veeshan's Peak have been modified.<br />
<br />
- Berserkers who had purchased the AA, Fury of Ages, are being refunded the purchase points in order to fix a data error.  You will be able to re-purchase the AA for the same cost.<br />
<br />
<br />

Sounds like the aa refund was because of a glitch in the char files or something. Not because the skill is dumb. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strange though this patch proves how easy it is for SoE to refund AA points so why the wait for Shaman ?<br />

I've thrown the [shenanigans] flag at Brenlo and I'll see what he says when he get to work.</div></div><hr />

Good one, Sony.<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to getting rid of the no tint on my robe using the old models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those would be the six robes wearable by races that don't have robe graphics, I believe, excepting the robe from Sleeper's Tomb which has its own turn-in-NPC.</div></div><hr />

What the heck Sudedor, this was the point I was trying to make on the SOE website but you insisted the reason DID matter.  I'm glad you see where I was coming from at least.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the record, I will be re-purchasing COTA if it ever does get refunded, so it doesn't really matter to me one way or the other.  I just found the unusual delay of the refund curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was under the (obviously mistaken) impression at the time that it was a &quot;lot&quot; of work to get these refunds done.<br />
<br />
As I have seen here, that seems to be untrue.<br />
<br />
As such, out came the [shenanigans] flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what does this do really?<br />
<br />
Let him know you are upset with him?<br />
<br />
Do you really think that matters much. He has shown an abiliity to lie, obfuscate and cloud many issue or out and out ignore and belettle people who are standing an inch from him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pissing in the wind has more effect. Sure it is messy and you might end up smelly and sticky, but at least you are relieved.<br />
<br />
There is little upside to the relationship customers have with SoE. <br />
<br />
I mean Pronouncments on high is very hard to argue with. <br />
<br />
You just end up talking to yourself<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Snoww, if you feel that we have no impact on SOE, then it really doesn't matter to you does it?  Nothing anyone says or does makes a difference so why bother?<br />
<br />
Here is Brenlo's response from the private Correspondents board:<br />
<br />
Well please do call Shenanigans, however, let me explain.  <br />
<br />
When we [converted] to the new AA backend the conversion of Fury of Ages broke,  the AA stopped working and no one could purchase it.  To correct it for everyone, it had to be reset, which meant anyone that had it would lose it.  <br />
 <br />
A little different than the Shaman issue, but you are right, Shaman and Necros should have gotten their refund as well.  I will see when we can make that happen.<br />
<br />
No, we don't have our refund.  No, we don't have a date for it.  But I believe we have someone trying to make this right, who agrees that we have gotten the short end.<br />
<br />
Until Brenlo proves unworthy of my trust, I will trust that he is doing as he says he is doing.<br />
<br />
(Gah - 90 minutes to finish one post.)</div></div><hr />

Thats complete and utter bull**** to me.<br />
Yes different reason why the AA was useless but *** is stopping them doing exactly the same thing to CoTA and the Shaman who want it can repurchase it those who dont have their AA pts back.<br />
Lol and i love the &quot;I will see when we can make that happen&quot; bit tacked on at the end.<br />

If you read my posts and substitute bull**** where I use shenanigans you might see it in a different light.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is [shenanigans] that we didn't get CotA refunded.  I made Brenlo aware of it.  He agreed with me and is looking at how he can get it done.<br />
<br />
Your post was exactly what I said to Brenlo, except I used shenanigans, with the brackets to show that I really meant something else, to try to keep the mood lighter.</div></div><hr />
