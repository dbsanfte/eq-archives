Hi,<br />
<br />
We've had a change up on Test for about a week, and I wanted to share it with you guys and see what you think. Here's the basis of the change -<br />
<br />
When a pet is hit with a spell, it uses the resistances and level of it's owner to see if it resists the spell.<br />
<br />
This means that if you're a level 60 magician for instance and you've got on various buffs and gear that raise your resistances, your pet will save vs. spells as if it was also level 60 with your exact resistance scores.<br />
<br />
Using the owner's level is going to make a huge difference in how well the pet resists harmful spells, and should make a noticeable difference in how well the pets can survive AEs for instance. Allowing the pet to also benefit from your items and buffs means that it will be living a lot longer when fighting casters.<br />
<br />
There is a drawback to this, although I think the good outweighs the bad. If we go with this new scheme, it will mean that the pet always uses the owner's saves. Some types of pets currently are highly resistant to poison or disease for instance. Going with the new scheme would mean they will potentially not resist those types of spells as well, depending on the owner's resistances.<br />
<br />
Overall, this change would mean that pets are much more resistant the vast majority of the time. I think this would be a very positive change for pet classes, but I'd like to see what people think before we go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />
<br />
- Rich<br />

Not that Rak is particularly difficult either way, but it looks like the age-old strategy of using fire-spell immune fire pets to do battle with the final fight for the shaman epic may very well be going away soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, they might keep immunities intact and apply the rest of resistances.<br />
<br />
Second, you can kill Rak without a mage. I remember trying him before epics were even in game (god it's been so long, I think I'm remembering this right) and we just pulled Rak's reaver outside the bulding to the long corridor where the arch is, used a single tank in his face holding aggro, kept clerics behind a wall and out of AE range and arrowed and nuked him to death.<br />
<br />
If it comes to pass, it will be different, but no harder imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know how large his AE range is, but walls don't block AE's in outdoor zones. Maybe it's small enough AE range to just heal from out of range, but walls wouldn't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I'm sorry, that was ill-phrased.<br />
<br />
They were out of range, and happened to be around that center wall. The wall itself does you no good.</div></div><hr />
