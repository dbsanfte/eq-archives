If true, it is kind of a bummer.  The guy is abrasive, but it was useful having a high profile person screaming about some of the problems with the game after Lum moved from ranter to Mythic employee, and providing a high-traffic board where people were free to criticize the game after Whineplay exploded.  I guess we'll have to find a new ranter for Warcraft to scream about its problems.<br />
<br />
Of course, this will have me taking everything he said so far about WoW with a metric ton of salt, instead of the mere pound of salt I used before.<br />

Seriously though, you can stick up for him all you want, but i cant see how ill ever feel he is anything more then a fecal spewing jack ass.

<br />
I do care that his opinion for the last 4 years was casual gamers can go screw themselves. The only valid game is the end game and huge raids and no one else matters. This person in charge of quest has my hopes sinking. I had hoped to escape EQ's raid or die mentality. Now not only was Furor one of their premeire beta boys, now he's actually payed and in charge of content. Not itemization either, he's in charge of quests, the one feature of this game that I was looking forward to.<br />
<br />
The above poster put it well, I don't hate furor but he does represent everything I dislike about the direction of EQ(IMHO). Now he's payed to create content. I can't help but worry about the future of WoW or who its going to be designed for.<br />
<br />
Is my first newbie quest going to require I mobilized 74 people at once to deliver our guild notes simulataneously across town. The more people I can get to join me, the more uber my starting tunic will be? Why not start the game off right and show those casual losers from level one who's the uberest!</div></div><hr />

Guildmaster Firor: Hello, Helpless Newb, do you want to learn the ways of the uber?<br />
Newb:&quot;what uber?      <br />
Guildmaster Firor: The Uber are a select few who get to play with the new content before it gets spoiled.<br />
Newb:&quot;How do I become Uber?&quot;<br />
Newb:&quot;I want to be Uber!&quot;<br />
Guildmaster Firor: Very Well, go seek out the way of the Lifeless.  And you must return my &quot;Aura of Lonliness&quot;.<br />
Guildmaster Firor: But Take Heed, if you do not return what I ask for in 10 days, I will not be here any longer, and I will talk all other townfolk with me<br />

The concept is encouraging, though.  They hired someone who indisputably gives a **** about what kind of game he's playing.  If SoE had done this early on, I don't think so many of us, myself included, would be crying in our beer over the state of the game.  At least not for the same reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed but what type of game is he playing? In EQ he wasn't playing my game. If his quests resemble what he considered acceptable as Furor, uber jerk, power gamer, I want nothing to do with that games quest system. He's been an arrogant jerk for 4+ years, why they hell do I want this person designing anything? Tigole I can handle, he's always had a cool personality, Furor is nothing but an ass who I want to be far away from any designn decisions in any game I play. <br />
<br />
This isn't a kneejerk reaction, the thought of him being involved in WoW is the first time I've seriouslly considered saying, no thank you on WoW. I wanted to play this game for something new, not another EQ uber raid clone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't mind it. EQ sucks largely and Furor also said that out, straight, not through flowers like most do. As for Blizzard hiring him, then to the clueless here - helloo, I doubt that he was exactly hired as a developer, first, and second, one man does NOT make the game. I personally think that it's OK, at least he will then see that none of the crap what's plenty in EQ, makes it to WoW.</div></div><hr />

Read some of their old updates.  If I had to deal with unrooted Ssra named and Emp with DT's and other crap when Luclin was released i'd probably bitch up a storm too.  People seem to overlook the long story posts amd the fact he's fought more for high end players and fixing stuff than most would consider within the rights of sanity.  He reminds me of Spider Jerlesulem of Transmetropolition.  He can't write when he's hated, but in the end it's not really what he deserves.<br />
<br />
Edit:  No, I don't know him.  I've never talked to him in game, but like many others i've lurked the FoH board for years.  People who say they wouldn't play WoW cause of him being hired on.. how well do you actually know?  Is it just comments from other people, or do you have that sort of experience following his posts in his board?  I don't get why he's the person everyone loves to hate.  And Furor, on the off chance you read this post, let me do a bit of ass sucking.  Damn fine job thease last few years fighting against Soe for changes that helped many others behind you, and I am looking forward to WoW with an even greater anticipation that perhas your input will cause stuff like the asformentioned hole that was Luclin to never occur again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Who could it come that far ?<br />
I wrote a Mail to Blizzard and asked if that Bad Rumor is true.<br />
If it is, Im no longer interested in WoW, Im not going to pay a monthly fee, knowing that idiot Furor gets payed with my money.<br />
It seems Blizzard stands no longer for high quality games, now they are a company amongst many. Sad but true. I rather shove SOE 12.95 a month in the Ass then giving any copper piece to Blizzard.<br />
And about telling &quot; ah yes such a nice person in real life &quot;<br />
FORGET IT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Those that say they won't play WoW b/c of whatever reason they come up with just boggles me, reminds me of various hollywood types that said they would move out of the US if a certain guy became president.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the knee jerk reactions people give, Furor did have some good points though as is obvious here, many people missed the points he made due to the vehicle he used to present them; I had the same problem with a a guild I lead, I didn't believe in sugar coating things, and sometimes you need to yell to get things done or emphasize with colorful metaphors to get a point across when dealing with a text based environment, if there was a better way to do it or address the issue of leading through text easier anyone that has a few active neurons would heartily do it; saying ok guys um please turn that mob and clerics would you start rotations doesn't exactly get anyone's attention. I was in a guild that was usually 1-2 steps behind what foh was doing, I can understand his annoyance with the encounters as having dealt with them myself.<br />
<br />
To address the idea that furor's viewpoint is only applicable for the (here come the typical labels) uber, high end, power gamers, I am number one, etc etc people take a look at the trickle down effect; those that followed a year or more after to the same raids did not have to deal with the initial problems, bugs, poor itemizations, and so forth as did those who got there first. And there have been other &quot;non-uber&quot; changes that have trickled down from high end raid changes which have been good for everyone. One idea he posted a while back was something I completely agreed with on loot itemization, instead of having items rot due to class specificity of an item, the named mob would drop a token or item which could be turned in to an NPC for an item and nothing would be wasted dropwise. Now I would bet most that have a hate on for furor completely missed the idea he was trying to convey<br />
<br />
Again don't get lost in the vehicle of the message, not everyone is a churchil or blair in delivery of an idea, if you always discount someone's ideas simply b/c you have a dislike for them, be prepared to miss a good idea or clarification or information you might need. Using a webpage as a discourse for relaying ideas is very powerful but tempering the delivery and choosing the manner is important, personally in the realm of EQ, I prefered tigole's presentation over furors.<br />
<br />
and the disclaimer: I don't know furor, don't care to, and could care less if he never posted anything ever again and started a damn fern garden and danced around in a fairy princess dress.</div></div><hr />

I feel exactly the same.  This has singlehandedly destroyed any desire for me to play WoW.  The first serious misstep by usually shrewd Blizzard in terms of its customer relations.  Looks like my friends and I will finish our goals in EQ and then quit.  There apparently won't be a fun, casual-friendly MMORPG for years to come.<br />
<br />
However, I haven't seen this officially confirmed anywhere by Blizzard.  Anyone got a link? I'd like to email their CS and ask for more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And there have been other &quot;non-uber&quot; changes that have trickled down from high end raid changes which have been good for everyone.<br />
The fact that a single player out of roughly 400K wields that much influence over the developers alone is horrifying.  Now tell me what single change Mr. Altruism has advocated that would help the non-raider?<br />
<br />
That's right- none.  And now Narcissism Personified is working at Blizzard ruining the game casual players have been waiting for.  Great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Interesting how some of you think that he would have such a major impact on WoW.<br />
<br />
So maybe he will just design high end raids. That would have like 0 impact on the casual aspects of the game.<br />
So maybe he will just be beta testing the encounters from the inside and tweak them. That would also have 0 impact on the casual aspect<br />
<br />
And maybe he is the best thing that could happen for the casual crowd because he has some really really cool idea's but then maybe he ain't.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day we have to wait and see how things work out.<br />
One thing is for sure, I would prefer a Furor over an EQ dev. At least the first gives a **** about what happens while the last is only interested in his paycheck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">umm wake the hell up please, they perportedly hired him not the converse, which means in simple unadulterated terms they take from him what they want since it is their game, he doesn't dictate anything nor would I want him to at all.<br />
<br />
Being narcissistic infers everything done is for one's own sake or concern without a whim as to what happens to anyone else, the things he asked or demanded more properly stated affected a lot of other people not just FoH, to which the results were hardly ego-centric changes.<br />
<br />
Also for those griping, bitching, complaing, extolling, and blathering about what furor has said that offended your virgin ears, take note of what the moron that posted about the situtation said on his own web page, not a whole hell of a lot better is it? He needs to look at the mirror and point then say there's the problem...<br />
<br />
This also makes everything he has said since then, totally biased, and really unfair to those who thought differently. Apart from that, I think it’s cool. I think Furor being the loudmouth ******* he has been in the past had a lot to overcome in the image department, but as was said, it’s not like he’s the community manager. He’s a quest guy, and he knows what he believes are good quests. His writing will improve, technically it’s pretty decent, and while there are some obvious amateur flaws that would never actually fly in the professional fiction field, with some work he might be able to make some decent quests (or at least think some decent quests up, his dialogue made me cry).<br />
The end result is this. Online, Furor was an asslord. A monkey ****er if you will. A loud mouthed, egotistical, over the top bastard, and hardcore gamers loved him for it. In real life? Probably has a massive amount of knowledge in his head, loves MMOGs (obviously to stick around for so long) and wanted to get into the industry. He kept his eyes open, saw an opportunity, went for it, and made the right impression. Now he’s involved with what he loves, and everything he’s vocally screamed about in the past is pretty much a non issue. Good luck man, don’t make quests that suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You cannot forget the fact that he has much experience of untuned raids encounters. He should be able to atleast tell fun from frustrating when it comes to encounters on a guild raid level.<br />
<br />
And if you dont take his posts on the foh website and the forum TOO seriously, he's actually quite entertaining to read.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I dont care how much knowledge he has, its how he conducts him self. Its more principle then anything else. I agree that having someone from a high end EQ raiding guild help with content balance is great to help avoid the pitfalls, but i cant stress enough how wrong it is to let someone like him be praised. This basicly says, that hey, you can treat everyone like **** nad demean anyone not like you, but just know about what you do and its ok. Im sorry, but its just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
But hey, this aint my planet now is it. /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Go to the very bottom of the page. Warning, there is profanity. And from the looks of it, that is all most of you people will see. The rest of us, the people who didn't automatically freak out and go into convulsions because they read a cuss word, will see furor pointing out an obvious flaw of SoE's that affects mostly CASUAL players.<br />
<br />
The man swears, get over it.<br />
<br />
You read one cuss word and all reason goes out the window. Furor is the devil. Furor hates casual players.<br />
<br />
The man loves games. He loved what EQ was, and for all the same reasons we all loved EQ too. If you all could just get over the fact that the man uses harsh language on HIS OWN message board, you would realise you know absolutely nobody who is better for the job.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
I dunno why I feel like I have to defend some guy I don't know and have never met. I guess i'm just sick of all the &quot;I heard from a friend of a friend about this jerk on veeshan who hates casual players.&quot; people spouting off about things they have no clue of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Arzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I share the disgust with Furor expressed by others.  Yes, I wish he was working on a game that I figured I'd never play instead of one that I'm excited about.  That said, Blizz has already designed a lot of content. They don't seem inclined to make WoW powergamer/uber-guild centric, and I don't expect them to hand Furor the keys to the car and say, &quot;It's all yours now, do what you want with it.&quot;   Even then, I can't say I know for sure how he would develop WoW.  Furor may be a jerk, but I'm not going to shy away from the game because of the personality of a developer as long as that personality isn't effecting my gameplay (i.e. a bug report is met with a response of &quot;FU!&quot;).  Who knows what aholes roamed the halls of Verant/SOE during whatever period you were really enjoying EQ.  This news alone should not make anyone say, &quot;No WoW for me.&quot;  If it's a good game, the fact that Furor is back there somewhere working on some portion of content will be the last thing on your mind.</div></div><hr />

Anyway .. I got no affinity to this guy one way or the other .. So it makes no mind to me .. I will prolly play the new game from the old sony crew anyway .. WOW is not seeming that impressive over all ..<br />
<br />
How many games have come along to be our saviour only to let us down .. hehe . Waste of money .. <br />
<br />
Atleast the new game from the old EQ developers will have some familiar feel to it that made EQ so attractive .. <br />

I met some SoE developers a couple years back at a fanfaire and I didn't much care for them either.  He knows MMORPGs, he knows about broken quests, he loves MMORPGs, and some people are not like their board personas.  At work, I'm a real prick, at home I'm all soft and gooey.  My decision to play WoW will depend on how much I like the game, how many of my friends play and if the gameplay/content doesn't suck.  This tidbit has no impact on my decision.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I wish I had posted the fairie dress discaimer first, BUT, I do not know Furor from Ted Kopel's butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've always said if Furor could drop his sorry ass online attitude, he'd go far. I've always liked him, just hated the way he came across. Id' still love for him to call me a punk ass sellout bitch to my face though like he spouted off on his boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I can go both ways on this one.  On the one hand I'm not sure Furor knows enough about the &quot;casual style&quot; I play to make constructive comments.  On the other hand, he (apparently) lives and breaths MMORG's, so having someone like that working on a game should bring a lot of valuable insights to the development team.<br />
<br />
As to his presentation style...I'm willing to bet that in face to face situations he tones down a bit  :p .  Also, I think it's good to have a level of contention - as long as people can vehemently debate without taking things personally this approach oftentimes results in a more thorough discussion and a better solution in the end.  (mainly because people are actually saying what they feel as opposed to tempering their comments to avoid possibly offending someone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">yes Furor is a complete pillock on FoH message boards yes he has acted like a spoiled brat on may occasions, no I am NOT a fan of his, but him being employed by Blizzard will not prevent me from looking seriously at WoW .<br />
<br />
Personally I still have the EQ bug (AFTER 5 YEARS i SHOULD HAVE GOT OVER IT DAMNIT!!!!) but if I do decide to play WoW then Furor being a Blizzard employee really doesn't effect me.</div></div><hr />

Cause I guarantee you if we're being denied content, guess who suffers? The average Joe guy on the street. The same poor schmuck who always suffers. Yea, YOU DUMBASS. Call your congressman.<br />
<br />
And people say he doesn't care about the casual gamers!<br />
<br />
This man's style of writing, while offensive to many, is the only REAL thing that people appear to notice. If you read the above quote, letting the silliness of the wording roll off your back like water on a duck, you will see that HE WAS THE ONE who whined and complained that content was way, way, way out of line for people paying to play a game. He, being in arguably the top guild of ALL servers (contested mainly at the time by Afterlife) was actually making a statement that, in fact, turned out to be rather valid. A lot of people DID NOT enjoy &quot;high end&quot; (and even medium difficulty) Luclin content until AFTER Planes of Power came out. Furor made that comment in the article linked in this thread.<br />
<br />
Furor was aware of the &quot;trickle down&quot; economics of content. Top end &quot;raid guilds&quot; being the first to access ANY difficult content will continue to remain as such no matter what game is made. It's the casual players who will not access that content for some time to come AFTER the hardcore 18 hour a day players do it. It's simple, really. So, this guy--Furor--with his foul mouth and &quot;in your face&quot; style commentary realized that if HIS GUILD was moaning and whining...imagine how incensed the casual gamer will be. Altruistic? Maybe not. Realistic? Hell yeah.<br />
<br />
Again, say what you want about what an azzwipe he is. I don't care. The guy was not an idiot no matter what you say. I don't need altruism in game design. Realism (as far as game goals go) goes a long way, though.</div></div><hr />

Go to the very bottom of the page. Warning, there is profanity. And from the looks of it, that is all most of you people will see. The rest of us, the people who didn't automatically freak out and go into convulsions because they read a cuss word, will see furor pointing out an obvious flaw of SoE's that affects mostly CASUAL players.<br />
<br />
The man swears, get over it.<br />
<br />
You read one cuss word and all reason goes out the window. Furor is the devil. Furor hates casual players.<br />
<br />
<br />
You honestly think anyone is offended cause he swears ? lol<br />
<br />
He is a antagonist. He is a source of negitive drama that while has some positive effects, is based off negitivity.  Like i said, you can beat someone into subission to get what you want, but just cause your end result was desired, does not justify or validate the means.<br />
<br />
Furor is a walking bad vibe that has the power to spread his negitivity, like i said and will say for the last time in this thread, he should not be rewarded for the path he walks.<br />
<br />
But in reality thats just my opinion. Sunmoon really summed it up best, he has alot of offer, but just brings it the wrong way and swearing is definetly not what im talking about heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any who im outie on this topic, giving this guy more attention not what i care to do /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what? How does that actually change what is brought about by HIS involvement? Does a person doing it with a positive attitude somehow make that same change more valuable? Understand that I applaud those who remain positive. It is definately a breath of fresh air in this whining world in which we exist today. However, if change is implemented and that change is positive, whether the statements that prompted the change were whiny or supportive isn't going to be the thing I cared most about.<br />
<br />
It's not like there was violence involved in order for the problems to be brought into focus. We're talking about semantics here, really. I am watching people on this thread state they have lost their excitement for a game's potential based on ONE GUY'S choice of semantics when pointing out major issues with game content. That is what this really boils down to. <br />
<br />
I've read the arguments that Furor was all about his guild remaining on top while keeping other people &quot;locked out&quot; and I can't find any actual facts to back up those arguments. I just see people who didn't like the way he spoke misunderstanding what the guy actually said---based on their being blinded by not being called &quot;l33t&quot; by the very same guy they can't stand. The part where he said:<br />
<br />
Cause I guarantee you if we're being denied content, guess who suffers? The average Joe guy on the street. The same poor schmuck who always suffers. Yea, YOU DUMBASS.<br />
<br />
...that part applied to me as well. I was the dumbass in his comments. I am the average Joe guy on the street. Alert the media! I'm not considered &quot;leet&quot; by Furor! /gasp.  Sheesh. They guy was still right. Not about the dumbass part. I'm actually rather bright. I'm also not named Joe and I don't live on the street although I travel them frequently. Even still, I knew what he was getting at. It was the intention of his message, not the delivery, that I focused on. If others did the same, they might not have misunderstood the guy so much. Instead they said he was an elitist pig. Maybe he is. I don't ACTUALLY care. I just know that his elitism managed to iron out some stuff in EQ for me by the time I arrived there. I saw back then and still see today the positive impact a foul-mouthed guy like Furor had on the game and how it HELPED ME when my time came to get where he had already travelled.<br />
<br />
I suspect some of you will feel a need to sue me for having been helped indirectly by a cretan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talking as a monk myself, monks at the time probably were a little too powerful given the itemazation.  Shortly after Furor called for the monk nerf Planes of Power came out and the itemazation had been fixed to compensate for overpowered monks in relation to warriors.  Unfortunately the nerf had gone through so the monks got hit double hard.<br />
<br />
I think the people that complain about Furor are either uninformed or have never heard a cuss word in their life.  I used to think he was a loud mouthed jerk but then I started reading the FOH forums and his updates.  The man knows what he is talking about and does genuinely care about making a good game.  If the rumor is true it is my personal opinion he will make for a great quest designer.  Even if he sucks at it it's not like the quests are going to go in the game without any review from the higher ups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
I guess Furor didn't have any monks in his guild. Lord knows he wouldn't cry for a nerf to any player in his squad. He was all about crippling anyone not there to propel him to the top...his being all elitist and such.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
If monks were hit double hard, that's NOT Furor's fault. Furor could only speak on facts that he had at the time. He couldn't necessarily factor in what Sony might or might not have had planned for development. If he didn't have that information, why hold him responsible? If Furor had known what was in development for monks, it's possible that he would have kept his mouth shut where nerfing monks was concerned and just waited to see how it balanced out in the end before he cried for a nerf to any class. I don't actually know. It's simply a possibility. <br />
<br />
It's amazing to me how people BLAME FUROR for the monk double whammy as if he had some inside information beyond what was present in front of him. If he did actually have inside information about what was in development for melee's to even them out with monk power, then he crippled himself and his own guild's ability to tip the scales in their favor by having the monk overpower left in tact so that he and his crew could abuse it for their own evil intent and personal gain. It is often alleged that is what he did. Again, I can't find evidence of such a claim.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Furor was calling for monk nerfage, and as we've seen, Furor's calls for changes can affect the game.  I doubt he wanted it (the monk nerf) to go as far as it has though.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Ok, we have seen pretty much the full spectrum of responces to this topic. Ranging from total negativity to somewhat support, with most indifferent. <br />
I think we all agree it is a rumor.<br />
<br />
Now Let me complete the spectrum. If the rumor is true, I am not only playing WoW, but I will be donating money to blizzard just for the hell of it. Let me reverse Litgruv's Analogy, My hot girl just told me that she had 2 more twins, they were Playboy bunnies, and they want to all compete on who is the best in bed with me, along with the 7 girlfriends Of Hugh Hefner.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I have never met Furor, don't know how he even looks like, never talked to him in or outside the game, all I have done is follow FoH's website along with some other high-end Guilds.<br />
<br />
I don't want to get into vague unqualified statements, (even though I will make them too). <br />
To all the people that critique him, have you been following his updates?<br />
One of them he was bitching about high-end people ruining Lower Guk, for those level 50. What the hell would that be any of his concern?<br />
<br />
You have to cut through the cursing and whatever else offends you and try to understand what the hell his point is. <br />
One thing I will argue to death &quot;A valid Point is a Valid point no matter how it is worded&quot;<br />
I actually find his writing very amusing. It may be too Ranty or vulgar for some people's taste, but I am sure that isn't his only way of communication, he only acts like that when he thinks there is reason or to let some steam, surely you can understand that.<br />
<br />
What is funny is that, we have come to the conclusion again and again, that SoE does not understand well thought out, calm, logical arguments. They respond to whining, cursing, bitching. So I even wonder, is Furor really like that or SoE made Furor?<br />
<br />
I hope the rumor is true. The guy has passion, he is a seasoned player and he is in my opinion intelligent.<br />
It is really beyond me why there is so much hatred towards him. Almost as much if not more than people hate Thott, and Thott's writing style is the total antithesis of Furor's so it seems nothing pleases you people. <br />
And to go off on a tangent, I hold nothing against Thott, I find his writing amusing too, and I do not hold him responsible for Shaman Nerf, and neither should anyone else. Slow mitigation is what killed us and he certainly didn't suggest that idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You know to be honest I am tired of people bashing others with no substantial reasons and are not willing to investigate why, but they are satisfied with the superficial BS of grammatical and syntactical choices someone makes.<br />
<br />
You are not above and beyond everyone else ok? Cursing does not automatically disqualify logical and fair reasoning, if you don't like it, that is your limitation not the writer's. And speaking specifically, Furor was never accountable to the Greater EQ community for &quot;Quality Control&quot; to make sure he was portraying the &quot;Right Image&quot; It is HIS website, HIS Guild and he can do as he pleases, but he took alot of his time to bitch and whine about Game issues that did not only concern him, and many as you see thank him for alot of improvements.<br />
What exactly is Furor to blame for those that said that he represents everything you hate in the game? At least give some kind of hint of what the hell you are talking about.<br />
<br />
What was the last time YOU made a change, much less a positive one, in this game?<br />
<br />
Good Thing I am not Furor, your reactions are a slap in the face, We have seen and experienced SoE for the last 5 years, I figured anyone who is fighting to improve the game would be Praised, not hated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly the point, you never had to deal with him in the game.<br />
<br />
I have.<br />
<br />
As I said, most of the people in his guild were decent people, but he made them do things that were not right.<br />
<br />
It's not a simple matter of what he said, it was his actions also.<br />
<br />
When something benefitted his guild, Furor wouldn't say a thing until after he was done with the content for the most part, unless some other guilds were 'nipping at FoH's heels', or if it was 'too hard' for his 'elite' guild. Then he would do things to irritate the hell out of the guilds who were at or near the same level in terms of content, or whine to get it toned down so FoH could beat it.<br />
<br />
AL beat The Rathe before FoH, and I know this really, really got to Furor. FoH went into a decline after that occurred. Furor's ego took a serious beating.<br />
<br />
FoH lost the reputation of being the '#1 guild on all server's' quite a while ago, and this is something that I know infuriated him.  Of course he's going to leave EQ. There isn't anything there to boost his ego anymore.<br />
<br />
Watch what happens in WoW, it will be EQ all over again for him... his ego won't be satisfied with anything less.</div></div><hr />

Do you have any clue what you're talking about?<br />
<br />
Apparently not.<br />
<br />
Balancing a game for the casual players means that all content can be defeated by a group of six or so people, and all the best items and games can be attained by people who play maybe a couple hours a night, 3-4 nights a week.  Where does that leave the &quot;hardcore players&quot; (of which I am not one) ?   Where does that leave &quot;high end content&quot;?  The content for those with a lot of playtime available to play a game will be ridiculously under-thought.<br />
<br />
Why is it that in every thread you have some snide comments making the casual gamer out to be some victim of the gaming industry?<br />
<br />
You know I have a buddy of mine on the server I play on (7th Hammer) who is a casual gamer who has the exact attitude you have, and it drives me nuts.  He automatically ascribes these values of being utterly evil and diabolical to everyone that has gear better than him or has access to more zones than him.  Then, he secretly applies to the uberguilds and cries because he gets rejected, mainly because of his former antagonism.<br />
<br />
What I state is fact:  Balancing a game towards the casual gamer, or indeed from the bottom is, is bad game design.  Period.  That's not a cutting remark, I'm not digging at the casual player.  It just makes for a not-fun game.</div></div><hr />

Aruman, that is absolutely ludicrous. No one &quot;makes&quot; anyone do something that is not right as far as operating their cartoons. There are no guns to the head, fear for one's life/safety, or threats made about the life/safety of one's loved ones. People do what they CHOOSE to do in this game.

Agreed, Circuits, however, I'd like that add that such people should use that &quot;right&quot; wisely and admit that the people assessed to be &quot;decent&quot; had their own mischievous side as well because they went along with whatever was unpleasant to the complaintant. Everyone makes mistakes or has errors in judgement. Some people are downright idiots and griefers, but it's not right to say that it's all &quot;soandso's&quot; fault because &quot;soandso&quot; made someone do it. That's just a need to make that guy (soandso) the bad guy rather than seeing things from a pragmatic view.</div></div><hr />

Believe what you want. I am not going to argue the point...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is FoH members weren't really given a choice, they either did what Furor said, or get booted from FoH.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe it was their own ego's that made them do what he said (I'm in the #1 guild across all servers, and I want to stay here) or maybe they didn't mind doing what Furor said. However, Furor was the one directing FoH's activities as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does? There is really no other way? Geez, I guess I'm stupid after all. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
There is a sea of people between your definition of &quot;casual&quot; and those who raid industrially. They play every day for many hours at once. But they seek friendship, not fraternity; personal challenge, not militarism; fun, not frustration. They had a place in EQ once. They can have one again.<br />
<br />
You know I have a buddy of mine on the server I play on (7th Hammer) who is a casual gamer who has the exact attitude you have, and it drives me nuts.  He automatically ascribes these values of being utterly evil and diabolical to everyone that has gear better than him or has access to more zones than him.  Then, he secretly applies to the uberguilds and cries because he gets rejected, mainly because of his former antagonism.<br />
<br />
Except I don't do either of those things. I do think honestly and seriously about things that interest me though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he is an employee of Blizzard or does become one, I daresay part of the conditions of employment will be not to take advantage of, or share, inside game knowledge. No public uber guild for Mr Furor this time. <br />
<br />
Having said that I think I would rather have him designing stuff than ruining it for everyone else. Having people vocally abuse his work may give him a rare insight into how his actions may have affected SOE (Verant) developers; he will either grow up a lot or leave Blizzard a bitter man.<br />

<br />
Sounds to me like you haven't read his stuff much.  I haven't, and even I know that Furor writes or speaks or whatever that way not because he is mysteriously forced to by circumstance or whatever -- he does because that's how he WANTS to.  There's no mystery, and the poor boy isn't trapped in a world he never made, forced to be a jerk by cruel, cruel others.  That's a lot of work apologizing for another guy you've put in, and it's pretty transparently pointless.   And by your own standards, unnecessary too -- you say you like it.  The people who don't -- well, they're not somehow fools or mistaken and they don't, say &quot;misunderstand&quot; him at all.  What's to misunderstand?  The guy's a jerk.  <br />
<br />
Just because he can make valid points sometimes doesn't change that.  In exactly the same way that being a jerk doesn't invalidate his points.<br />

<br />
As to whether you like his logic or ideas, I think you are too emotionally invested in your worries about what some people somewhere I guess suppoedly &quot;think&quot; about your &quot;being utterly evil and diabolical,&quot; in your own words.  You certainly mention that theme enough, whether or not it has anything to do with the topic at hand.  Certainly it seems to clutter your ability to respond to people in a civil way or even see what they're talking about before going off on a rant on you own concerns.<br />
<br />
I do think it is well worth noting that you seem to insist you know what fun is.  That's a personal thing to each individual.  It's neither of your knowledge nor any of your business.  Nobody can claim to really know what &quot;fun&quot; is -- at least not for anyone but himself.<br />
<br />
Lots of people define fun different ways.  <br />
<br />
I would bet that hundreds of thousands of the EQ players out there that Sony claims they have define &quot;fun&quot; in ways quite unlike you do.  And their money is every bit as good. Their happiness in the game is no less valuable, either.<br />
<br />
So designing things to appeal to those other guys is just as legitimate as it is to design them for people like you.<br />
<br />
Seeing things only one way doesn't necessarily mean you've come to a blinding insight; you could just have gotten used to things as they are and have a lack of vision.  I think Sony has reached that point.  I think you might be echoing Sony's hitting a dead end in your own vision too.<br />
<br />
Personally, I consider myself a hard core raider, and I still agree with Eoin and others that I think are getting at the idea that there are many ways to have fun, and all should be accomodated for and rewarded.  Right now, if you want to really advance, the design of the game limits you to a single one.  Unless you just want to rack up AA or something as a kind of mini-game in itself(yawn).<br />
<br />
I think Eoin is saying Sony might do well to think outside the box for a change.  It's advice most of us could use at least sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Why is it that in every thread you have some snide comments making the casual gamer out to be some victim of the gaming industry?<br />
<br />
<br />
uh, cause considering MMPOG, it's true?  are you seriously going to try to say with a straight face that every first generation MMPOG on the market isn't to a larger or smaller extent geared towards a player who plays a LOT versus a little?  that's like saying FPS aren't geared towards people who have fast twitch reactions or internet porn isn't geared towards guys who love naked babes.<br />
<br />
ever since people have seriously started looking at behaviors of people in multiperson online games since the SEVENTIES (bartle did his first segmentation in '79 I believe) it's been an axiom that different people play games differently, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS with different measures of success.  although every new guy who stumbles onto the MMPOG genre or MUDs has this exact same epiphany sooner or later and thinks he's the first one to realize it, GAME DEVELOPERS know this, have thought about it, have thought about what kind of game they want and the games you have before you have been developed with this exact thing in mind.  go back and read some of the comments from Brad Mcquaid about design choices for EQ or just hop over to Ralph Koster's site and read about some of the things he wanted for UO and SWG.  Plainly EQ is geared for the hardcore player.  It's MORE geared to them now than before PoP.  Yes it's stupid to play the game then complain about this thing when everyone knows EQ is about the timesink but then again those who complain aren't WRONG when they point it out.<br />
<br />
as for Furor and blizzard, they should have hired thott.  at least he would have been charting out his quests with nice bright colors<br />
<br />
although I suspect the primary reason people have a negative reaction to furor is because he was first known to people for cheating and advocating widespread anti-social behavior like training camp stealing, all this was a long time ago however.  I'm not 100 % up on the details but seems to me that after his first account got banned for duping and cheating and the PnP was been in place he's pretty much behaved himself like a the proverbial whipped dog.<br />
<br />
furor's primary impact has not been gameside but more playerside.  FoH obviously isn't the best guild in terms of accomplishing kills first or having the most skilled players based on its record but it was the FIRST well known uberguild across servers.  you can't argue that his brand of anal-retentive/borderline obsessive attention to his guild's status (as such in an online game) wasn't a semetic watershed for how guilds were organized early in this game<br />
<br />
before FoH, guilds were usually a few old friends who liked to group together and hang out ingame.  maybe they were all guys who liked the same type of fantasy literature or guys who happened to all start out in Halas or hang out near the forge in Kelethin.  much like Little Congress before LBJ most were very casual and didn't take themselves as seriously as they should... but htf were they going to KILL NAFAGEN AND RULZOR THE SERVER being halfassed like that?<br />
<br />
in short, uber guilds learned how to be hardass about recruiting, hoarding resources, requiring playtime etc etc from FoH.  they weren't the best but they were the first, and that's something.  it's counterintuitive to have guilds lock out other guilds, race in front of each other and have grown adults bicker over toys for their toons like tots in the sandbox, especially in an ONLINE game where presumably everyone is online to socially interact with each other, but Furor showed us that that's the way to get things done in EQ.  in a way, Furor was EQ's ultimate soup nazi, and that's something he can take to his grave.<br />
<br />
I'm sure blizzard knows what they're doing in hiring.  now would this have happened if Bill roper and the original design team for WoW was still there?  who knows but I cant imagine one junior quest designer doing much harm to a game.  honestly I'd be a lot more interested and concerned if they did something really stupid like hiring abashi like brad and the verant bunch did back in the day</div></div><hr />

<br />
You made my point for me, Aruman. Do what Furor said OR....<br />
<br />
That's the CHOICE those people had placed in front of them, Aruman. THEY CHOSE TO DO WHAT HE SAID. Thei other option was not to stick around. They CHOSE the former. They had the option of not staying a guild doing things they didn't like or approve of. No one FORCED them to do anything.<br />
<br />
Why can't you see that? <br />
<br />
Is it because somehow people have it in their minds that being discharged from FoH would somehow bring the world to a cataclysmic end? lol.<br />
<br />
Face the facts. The so called &quot;decent&quot; people that you liked in FoH, yet did things that you don't necessarily approve of are off the hook in your estimation FOR WHAT GOOD REASON? So far, I don't see you bringing one to light. Being threatened with being kicked out of a guild full of griefers (if that is how you saw Furor and his &quot;ilk&quot;) shouldn't have been much of a threat. They should have, decently, not cared!<br />
<br />
Sheesh.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe it was their own ego's that made them do what he said (I'm in the #1 guild across all servers, and I want to stay here) or maybe they didn't mind doing what Furor said. However, Furor was the one directing FoH's activities as a whole.<br />
<br />
That's generally how guildleadership works, Aruman. The guild leader---um, LEADS. If the followers don't like the leader or the leaders methods of doing things, they can LEAVE or even get thrown out. Either way, cutting ties IS an option and it's not an option they took. So, as I have stated, those people should bear their own weight instead of it being heaped upon Furor. A leader without followers is generally found solo. Furor had followers, Aruman. They were there for their own reasons, whatever they may be. They were not there because they were FORCED to be. You really need to get over that idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has nothing to do with me personally.  I think it's idiotic that people stereotype people who are in a raiding guild as incapable of seeing both sides of the fence, or thinking objectively about an issue.   People say &quot;uber player&quot; like it's some offshoot of homo sapien, some natural order of human being who is completely different than the normal, reasonable human beings that play casually.<br />
<br />
I do think it is well worth noting that you seem to insist you know what fun is.  That's a personal thing to each individual.  It's neither of your knowledge nor any of your business.  Nobody can claim to really know what &quot;fun&quot; is -- at least not for anyone but himself.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, can you quote for me where I said anything about fun or enjoyment levels?  I had fun playing EQ without a guild, just doing LDON and whatnot, and I have fun in a guild.  Did you have a point or no?<br />
<br />
I would bet that hundreds of thousands of the EQ players out there that Sony claims they have define &quot;fun&quot; in ways quite unlike you do.  And their money is every bit as good. Their happiness in the game is no less valuable, either.<br />
<br />
So designing things to appeal to those other guys is just as legitimate as it is to design them for people like you.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, have you been around for the past couple of months when we've all been gnashing our teeth over game balance?  Game design and balance doesn't have anything to with anything besides making the experience challenging and rewarding for all those that play it.  That means everyone from the once a week player to the 5-8 hour a day player needs to feel challenged and rewarded over the long term.  It doesn't mean the design needs to be some supreme communist state where everyone has equal gear.  <br />
<br />
Balancing does not equal &quot;instant gratification&quot;.  If you know the only route to get item x or spell y is to raid for it, then go for it.  If you're like Eoin and you don't WANT to raid for it, but still play alot, then you have no room to whine.<br />
<br />
More time invested = better gear that is also reward that is proportionate to the risk of severe, painful death you face, and the degree of difficulty of the encounter.<br />
<br />
Seeing things only one way doesn't necessarily mean you've come to a blinding insight; you could just have gotten used to things as they are and have a lack of vision.  I think Sony has reached that point.  I think you might be echoing Sony's hitting a dead end in your own vision too.<br />
<br />
I don't have a vision for EverQuest.  I know the goals of game design, or what they should be ideally, anyway.<br />
<br />
Personally, I consider myself a hard core raider, and I still agree with Eoin and others that I think are getting at the idea that there are many ways to have fun, and all should be accomodated for and rewarded.  Right now, if you want to really advance, the design of the game limits you to a single one.  Unless you just want to rack up AA or something as a kind of mini-game in itself(yawn).<br />
<br />
Yep, I agree wholeheartedly.  Every player should absolutely be rewarded and have as much fun as possible.  That does not, however, mean every player should be rewarded in the exact same fashion (read:  ancient spells, uber gear, etc) regardless of time invested or &quot;risk&quot; faced.<br />
<br />
I think Eoin is saying Sony might do well to think outside the box for a change.  It's advice most of us could use at least sometimes.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's comical to blame others for your own inability to think.<br />
<br />
Additionally, proclaiming an inability to think in no way undermines anyone else's argument, or even addresses it.<br />
<br />
Yes, you DO bite out a lot at people, insult them for no reason, and jump all over their cases over nothing.  So be it, but you can't blame anyone for noticing.  <br />
<br />
Most of the rest is yet another rant, but the majority of it points toward and comes down to: &quot;I don't have a vision for EverQuest. I know the goals of game design, or what they should be ideally, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, you know what's fun and ideal for YOU.  And who would argue with you on that?<br />
<br />
It's insight into others that you seem to lack.  And, with that, it follows that you necessarily lack insight into games in general, and it seems this one as well.  You are not everyone, nor are your goals everyone's.  <br />
<br />
There is no inherent reason difficulty has to be defined only in terms of hours spent, nor how many people you do a raid event with.  EQ did not always set 72 people or more as the ideal way to get great rewards.  Huge raids are not a law of nature or something chiseled into a stone on a mountaintop by God himself.  There is not a thing about them that is inherently virtuous or that gives credence or worth to the players in them.  If the idea is that great rewards are necessarily related not to difficulty or creativity and cleverness, but only to the use of large numbers of people in ways that may or may not be terrible difficult or creative or clever, then it's a flawed, narrow, lazy system of granting rewards.  It is just &quot;A&quot; way, not the only way possible.<br />
<br />
However, we've gotten so used to taking for granted in this game that it has to be that way, that many are caught somewhere between astonishment, confusion, and anger if it even gets mentioned that a game is whatever you want it to be, and you can make it whatever you want.  Making things only work for one kind of person just means you have a lack of imagination or don't want to spend money coding.<br />
<br />
Funny, but raiding is kind of the EQ religion.  It can provoke fury and astonishment if you don't bow to that particular god when others think it's the beginning and end of all things and the best thing ever.  <br />
<br />
But some people just -- believe differently.  Don't get too shaken up about it.  It's a pretty big wide world outside that front door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Balancing a game around hard core gamers is at best laughable. Since when are they deciding factor in a game we all pay for? <br />
<br />
/google define:balance<br />
<br />
 harmonious arrangement or relation of parts or elements within a whole (as in a design)<br />
<br />
<br />
What i see here is a request for imbalance. Balance would imply that all party included in the equation are recieving equaly from the solution. &quot;F the casual gamer&quot; is nothing along the lines of the balance you ask for. As stated before, there is a whole VAST world of people that are between casual and hardcore and i dont think im going out on a limb when i say they are greater in number then the hardcore gamer like yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but thinking your more important then a atleast significant portion of a gaming/EQ community is nothing short of elitism.  If you want hardcore gaming content then stick with EQ cause its obviously the path they are on now that the vision is lost, but most people looking foward to WoW is cause its NOT hardcore gaming enviroment, that is promises a rich world of lore and adventure like EQ used to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think its important for you to consider that most people do not stay in EQ cause of this new raiding enviroment. They stay cause of the memories and friends they made BEFORE such content as PoP and even SoL. Everquest was a HUGE game filled people very happy to play it the way it was. People that understand why a boat is better then a book.  That understand the thrill of running a young toon from qeynos to freeport or what a epic truly means.<br />
<br />
This is why i object to furor working for blizz designing anything and this is why i dont like him. He is the community embodiment of all the PoP+ content that IMHO has ruined a good game and turned into a raid fest, where if your not in a guild, you got nothing.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
This mysterious &quot;they&quot; you're bandying around includes the &quot;hard core gamers&quot; (still not clear what exactly that means -- Rambo-style headbands wrapped around the foreheads and a bowie knife clenched in their teeth while they canni?), which is part of the player base.<br />
<br />
This is the last time I&quot;m going to bother to talk about design issues because it's obvious your swollen sense of entitlement is making it impossible for you to understand the words I'm putting down here.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about making the game more fun, or better, or more rewarding for those types interested in raiding.<br />
<br />
I am talking about designing the game so that the most challenging and rewarding encounters are those that take many people working together as a unit a long time to master.  Then, once you have the pinnacle challenge of the game designed, begin scaling the rest of the content to that, in terms of difficulty and quality of loot.<br />
<br />
Has EverQuest pretty much done this on a basic level?  Sure.  Is there room for improvement for the party of six that spend a few hours together every night?  Sure, I suppose there's room for a bit.<br />
<br />
That's all I'm talking about.  I'm not talking about the violins-and-roses lovefest you've so melodramatically romanticized, Litgruv.  I'm not talking about making the game more fun for one &quot;they&quot; than the rest of the &quot;they&quot;s.  <br />
<br />
Game design is all about proper scaling of risk versus reward.  And this scaling only makes sense if you do it from the top down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you know what's fun and ideal for YOU.  And who would argue with you on that?<br />
<br />
Who's talking about &quot;fun and ideal&quot;?   You're the only one that has mentioned anything to do with an incredibly subjective term as &quot;fun&quot;.  For the record, I don't necessarily find raiding &quot;fun&quot;.  But it's the best way I get to &quot;hang out&quot;, so to speak, with my online friends and get the best possible upgrades for my character.<br />
<br />
It's insight into others that you seem to lack.  And, with that, it follows that you necessarily lack insight into games in general, and it seems this one as well.  You are not everyone, nor are your goals everyone's. <br />
<br />
No, it's insight into others that I have in abundance.  Ergo my cynicism.  Again, I'm not trying to impose my goals or ideas of enjoyment or fun onto everyone, or holding my ideas up as &quot;right&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no inherent reason difficulty has to be defined only in terms of hours spent, nor how many people you do a raid event with.  EQ did not always set 72 people or more as the ideal way to get great rewards.  Huge raids are not a law of nature or something chiseled into a stone on a mountaintop by God himself.  There is not a thing about them that is inherently virtuous or that gives credence or worth to the players in them...it's a flawed, narrow, lazy system of granting rewards.  It is just &quot;A&quot; way, not the only way possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly.  It would be nice if someone came up with another operable paradigm through which the best rewards could go to all people equally regardless of their time invested, or &quot;creativity and cleverness&quot;, while each person still retains the feeling that they were receiving the best possible loot for them. <br />
<br />
When someone causes that paradigm shift in the MMORPG world, I'll applaud them loudly.  But until then, raiding is the big way to get the best possible items and spells in Everquest, and that probably won't ever change.  <br />
<br />
However, we've gotten so used to taking for granted in this game that it has to be that way, that many are caught somewhere between astonishment, confusion, and anger if it even gets mentioned that a game is whatever you want it to be, and you can make it whatever you want.  Making things only work for one kind of person just means you have a lack of imagination or don't want to spend money coding<br />
<br />
So, EverQuest now only works for one type of person?  Cool, me and half a million raiding automatons playing EverQuest!  Kick ass!<br />
<br />
But some people just -- believe differently.  Don't get too shaken up about it.  It's a pretty big wide world outside that front door.<br />

By the way, I've only been playing Everquest a couple years now.  When exactly did it change so that raiders got the best rewards out of their efforts?  You alluded that it hasn't always been this way, and that you could get the best rewards without raiding.<br />
<br />
EverQuest is what it is.  Do I think Ancient spells are kind of nonsensical?  Uh, yeah.  I can't think of another way in which Sony developers so drastically reduce the availability of a certain upgrade like they do with ancient spells.  Yeah, casual gamers get the hose on these spells.  I won't insult anyone or mitigate the gravity of that by saying, &quot;Well the spell doesn't matter anyway&quot;, or &quot;It's just a convenience spell&quot;. <br />
<br />
However, IN EVERQUEST, in the GAME YOU PAY FOR every month, you KNOW that the best rewards go to raiders.  I had my LDON tunic damn near completely &quot;tricked out&quot; before I ever joined the guild I'm in now, and I felt like king **** with 3300hp (with no raid gear except a Wicked Mail I'd had for a long time).  I feel like king **** now with 4800hp too, but it doesn't change how I felt then about my tunic.  We've had a couple of those chain tunics in the Ikkinz raid damn near rot because I don't want to replace my Incorporeal Chain of the Spectre. (the Ikkinz tunic went to alts)<br />
<br />
To me that says that there is rewarding content for people who can't raid.  I was/am damn proud of my LDON stuff, because it's a 'trophy' of how I achieved goals I set for myself.  I admire people who have nice LDON gear or lots of ornate they farmed/bought themselves.  I guess I might be a strange duck in that I don't feel like I'm &quot;better&quot; than anyone else in the game because I happen to be in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
EQ is designed to be addictive, and the devs do that through small, easy-to-reach goals that people can achieve on a daily basis, either through farming research items to get more spells, AAs, regular levels, and more recently LDON.  <br />
<br />
My basic point is that if you're not feeling rewarded playing the &quot;everyday casual&quot; EverQuest, maybe you're not playing the right game at all.</div></div><hr />

I am talking about designing the game so that the most challenging and rewarding encounters are those that take many people working together as a unit a long time to master.  .<br />
<br />
You mean Zerging ?<br />
