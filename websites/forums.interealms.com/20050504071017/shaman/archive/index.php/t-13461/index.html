<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think an AA point per zone that you were previously flagged for that are now free-access zones would be a reasonable return on the time invested.  Yes, I could've gotten a LOT more than 6 AA for the time invested in all that key/flag crap.  But I can't think of anything else (that's likely to happen) that would make me feel less cheated.  Can you?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with you. We should get some sort of compensation.<br />
<br />
It really bothers me when VI makes things easier. It's not like this game isn't insanely easy to begin with. I just love how they take all of our hard work and throw it right out the damn window into a public toilet and flush it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard it would be elemental access for those who had all the other flags.<br />
But I dont believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it is indeed elemental access, won't that make the people who already have elemental access upset because of the Noobs who will get a free ride to the elemental planes after they had to go to such efforts to get flagged?  And to follow the progression will they then give PoT access to those elementally flagged?  What then do you give to the players who have recently gotten PoT access?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how about a useable charm? perhpas one that reads &quot;increases in power per flag you get&quot; but only count zone access flaggs?</div></div><hr />

AA XP based on what flags u have.<br />
<br />
PoV/PoS Flag = 1aa<br />
BoT/CoD=2aa<br />
<br />
etc or a similar system up to 3 or so :P Might make it actually worth it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like the AA idea. I hope they dont do something like give a lameass item out or do anything like elemental access for having completed ALL the flags. What if someone had all flags (below elemental) excluding HoH (for example). He would be totally denied of the benefits of someone who had aquired one more flag?<br />

3aa for each flag imo.</div></div><hr />

5 TT raids x 2 hours<br />
7 Hedge trials x 2 hours<br />
About 16 PoJ trials x 1 hour<br />
7 AD raids x 2 hours<br />
About 20 PoS named raids for key parts for Bot x 2 hours<br />
============<br />
120 hours of back flagging.<br />
If they want to give me AAs in compensation, they owe me 60aa for my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Charm idea...pretty good..actually<br />
<br />
AA idea...aint going to happen..and if it did...it would be very minimal and not even worth it.  You cant compensate everyone for XXX hrs spent doing whatever...<br />
<br />
Couple ideas i have also heard thrown around<br />
<br />
1) Titles<br />
2) Changing name colors<br />
<br />
Have also heard suggestions of a gate type item to the circle of stones in PoT if you have all of the flags being given out for free<br />
<br />
not supporting or condemning any of them..just saying things i have heard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They better not just reward those that have ALL their flags.  I have three flags, and I don't think that I should recieve no compensation for them, if they are compensating people. I don't think I deserve as much compensation as those who have all their flags, but I definitely do not deserve none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm not flagged for any Tier 2 planes.  And at 59, that really does'nt  bother me.  My thinking was that I'd get it when I was ready.  But I cannot agree when the changes they are making.  Sure, it'll make alot of those higher levels happy to be able to go in with their friends and Guildmates..but it seems to belittle all the efforts that those who worked long and hard to GET flagged.  Even at 59, I'm not ready for Tier 2.  I don't have Torpor, or Malo.  Heck, I dinged 59 last week, and I only have the new group Charisma spell (woohooo).  No PoX or VoB.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me that all of you who worked tirelessly to get flagged should get a decent reward.  Not to mention if they really do open up the tier 2 planes, put a level restriction on them appropriate to the areas.  We have to be 47 to enter PoT....fine and good.  Make tier 2 at least 60 and higher.  Or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

If its something lame like another silly title I won't be too happy. If the award for all flags is elemental planes acces.. what about those that have the flags AND already have elemental planes access, what will they get? My guess is the only thing they can give out that people will agree on is exp.. or maybe a unique aa skill? Or perhaps a unique item that has some usefull click effect on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love the charm idea!  Increasing in power with each flag you receive would benefit those of us who have all the flags and people that only have 1 flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well put. Sounds like the right choice to me. Charm to increase HP perhaps? 80 HP per flag doesn't sound overpowering :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Assuming SOE doesn't completely hose the RZtW encounter by opening Tactics, I would rather earn my ticket to the Ele planes than get a free ride as a reward.  However, I have a funny feeling that random trains from the curious and even lag from additional people in the zone may potentially make the encounter much more difficult than it was ever intended to be.  That would be enough to justify a free ticket to &quot;skip&quot; that encounter IMO.<br />
<br />
Potential broken encounters aside, I like the idea of a unique set of AA's or some hefty AA point compensation for the hours upon hours of work that has been put into backflags etc. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The way I see it, VI can go two ways on this:<br />
<br />
They could either treat flags like the old illusion masks, which my human druid uses to this day to become a DE druid.  They give certain things (maybe special things like a title) to everyone who has a flag during the patch, and then *poof* flags are gone.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, they can convert the flag quests in to normal quests, and leave them in the game for players who are currently unflagged to complete at some point later, by just adding one more step to the end of them where people with the flag hail the NPC or something, and he/she gives them a normal quest reward (no titles or anything special).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It better be 15-20 AA per flag to make up for all the zones I won't be able to use anymore cause of all the lvl 55 druid trains</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just a question that I haven't seen anyone address yet, what happens to people that are flagged after the change? Since I didn't see Sony say they were removing the flagging encounters, only the need for flags.<br />
Getting flagged I understand takes a lot of time, but does it take as much time the second, third time around? when some guilds are flagging the stragglers. Do these people deserve the same privledges as people that actually did work hard?<br />
If someones already brought up this point I apologise for the doubling up. I haven't seen it yet and would really like to know what people thought on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yah I like the idea of a nice charm that increases in power by how many flags you have completed.  That would kick some ass and be a fair compensation in my mind.  Plus it would be easy to implement.  Just put an easy quest in the game for the charm.  Anyone could do the quest and get the charm, but it wouldn't do em any good unless they had flags to make it work!  Excellent suggestion!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true, but they could just as easily make it available for anyone as they could change this flagging stuff :shrug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kkrush's Reward Hour!<br />
<br />
Idea: Set up Gnome NPC in PoT who can &quot;read&quot; your flags. Have the gnome give you a NO DROP rune/paper/stone/gem/whatever that can be turned in to another CLASS-SPECIFIC NPC, for a piece of &quot;Tier Armour&quot;. Each zone would be for something different, as there are enough slots. Make it for slots that are goofy to replace, like hands, feet, arms (?). Lore/NoDrop goes without saying, to avoid flag-farming. <br />
<br />
If gear is not your wish, then go to another class-specific NPC who might give you a spell?<br />
<br />
All else fails, you can give the flag items to another NPC who gives you massive (it had fuggin BETTER be) experience for them. <br />
<br />
 The higher the flag, the more xp/better gear or spell. Ubers might not want the gear or need the spells, so the aaxp should be a welcome thing. (provided that the PoT and Elemental flags give more xp than the POJ trial flag) Middlists who are still stuck in front of the Elemental door would probably like a good spell or gear, while people who just barely have PoS/PoV flags would most likely love spell or gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">/wave Rafeeky  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One can have POP and not LOY. Charms will not work unless the slot was made avail for everyone.<br />
<br />
The slot is available for everyone. You just can't get anything (currently) to put into unless you either a)have LoY, or b)Play on FV.<br />
<br />
All they would have to do is make one charm available outside of LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">flags will not be removed. You will still need flags to go to the elemental planes. <br />
<br />
Or else they open elemental planes to all people having at least one flag for tier 3...and Tower of solusek ro access if you have a tier 2 access.<br />
<br />
this could be interesting...but I don't believe they will do it :)<br />
<br />
really I have no clue...<br />
<br />
and about people having access to time...they don't care...Furor is going to delete his chars in 9 days anyway...(see FoH site)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I am happy with my effort and time i put in to get all my flags, with only one kill away from elemental planes, the opening up of these zones is a trivial matter. I wanted the flags, not to gain access to new exp zones, but to work my way forward to the elemental planes, each flag was a step closer to elemental. Nothing really has changed, everyone will still have to gain all the usuall flags to be elementaly compliant.<br />
<br />
Though Naagruz did make a valid point, all the extra people in these zones could make flag mob encounters a little laggy, hopefull to have RZ dead by the time this goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1) As I noted in the other thread, I seriously doubt that this will remove the need for the &quot;planar progression quest mob&quot; kills to continue past Tier 2/3.  I think its quite likely that you'll still need Aerin'Dar, for example (along with the Honor Trials) to enter the Temple of Marr - even when HoH-A becomes an open plane.<br />
<br />
2) The reward cannot be an item.  By the time the patch with these changes hits, I'll be in Tier 4.  The &quot;frontrunner&quot; guilds are in Tier 5.  Any gear that would be likely useful to someone in Tier 2/3 would be beyond useless to them; any gear they (or even I) would wear would be unbalancing to people not at my part of the game.  Also, unique gear would be perceived as highly unfair - SOE *did* learn the lesson about putting in good items and then making them unavailable to later customers with the whole Sleeper Script nightmare (okay, okay - there was that mage root earring in CT and a couple other things ... but you know what I mean, I hope ...).  For what its worth, though, you can equip a charm without owning LoY.  In addition to the FV server, there is one tradeable charm (no, its not worth getting - and is a pain to camp ... kind of like using Torment, actually).<br />
<br />
3) The reward cannot be more planar access.  It would be impossible to divide fairly among the flags.  For example, would HoH-A access be worth, say Tower of Sol Ro?  Would Torment + Tactics be worth Air?  And again, this would not reward anyone who already *had* further planar flags; the reward will be something that applies to everyone.<br />
<br />
4) AAXP is almost certianly what we're getting.  I expect 1 AA per flag; I'd be pleased and a bit surprised to get 2.  We won't get more.  Keep in mind that SOE feels (correctly) that people got more than just flags from flagging encounters - which is true.  Even Terris and Behemoth drop some pretty nice loot (Knucklebone Beaded Veil and Self Contained Force Barrier come to mind as worthwhile, respectively).  This will benefit everyone who does not already have their AA tree complete (and it wouldn't surprise me if they add some new AA in which you can spend the same number of points as the maximum that can be awarded in this process, just because - if they do, note that it will suck).  This should give 6 AA, assuming 1 per flag and counting Valor/Storms as a single flag (PoV/PoS, HoH, CoD, Torment, Tactics, BoT) - which is enough to buy a 3rd rank Archetype AA, and is therefore a &quot;strong reward&quot; in SOE's eyes.  Not what a lot of folks want, I am sure - but really, its not *that* bad.  Having done these flags anyway (and see point 1), I'll take 6 free AA for the trouble.<br />
<br />
5) They could surprise me and do something stupid - like a title, name color, etc.  This would make me cry, but I'd go on with life.</div></div><hr />

So, which is it? Is the game insanely easy or is it a lot of hard work?<br />
<br />
LOL this is the best chuckle I've had on these boards in a loooong time  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">If they give us any kind of an item, some will like<br />
it and some will absolutely hate it. One person's<br />
treasure is another person's trash.<br />
<br />
If they give us AA points, we'll be able to decide<br />
how best to spend them ourselves. That's the <br />
best suggestion I've heard so far. How many points,<br />
is a matter for discussion.<br />
<br />
Making Storms, Valor, Thunder, etc. have a minimum<br />
level requirement of at least level 60 would help <br />
keep them from being overpopulated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Not everyone killed &quot;boss mob&quot; to get access to the alternate zones. What about all the people who did the alternate access quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Bah... People already in the zones already had thier rewards... they have been in those zones much longer than the &quot;newbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think any sort of &quot;reward&quot; given because they take away needed flags to a couple of good xp zones is laughable and stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I like Kkrush's idea. Take all the viable options and roll them into one big ball. Would probably take at least a few npc to setup but allowing people to select thier own peice of equipement or aa exp should give enough options that people can find something useful to them.<br />
<br />
For the quality of the item they could have it go all the way up to elemental planes quality if they wanted to since they should be able to vary it based on flags. Make bob the flag reader give out an item. Them make joe the ring guy, tom the arms guy, sam the boots guy etc give out the appropriate peice of gear based on the class and the level of the item they got from bob. Also since people are going to have to be figuring things out there should be a way to give the item back to someone and get the what ever back so you can get a different item.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd just rather they left it alone. Call me elitest if you want or what ever. The alternate access quests are good enough. It no longer requires a huge raid for to get into any of the zones they are going to be changing. Reports are even that all of them give an entire group access. Having been to these zones most are walks in the park like PoV/PoS and a dread what they will be like when everyone out there can just zone in and try the zone. BoS is a horrid zone on my server, not because the zone it's self is bad but because so many people have access to it and there is such fighting over the named everyone knows can drop runes that it's constantly filled with complains about training, camp stealing and just down right ugly behavior.<br />
<br />
I think most likely it will probably just end up being an aa point or 2 per flag that you no longer need for zone access.<br />
<br />
It still have to wonder what this is going to do for flagging for elemental planes access and likely how badly verant is going to screw that up when they do make changes.</div></div><hr />

Give me a break, we ain't getting sh1t for our prior flags. I don't want crap given to me anyway. They opened up the zones so folks would have other area's to exp in. Most of those zones were dead anyway, and most of them will continue to be. The gimps will all stay huddled in PoN and PoV no matter what. Quit freeking out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well, let's have a quick look what i've done for flags :<br />
<br />
PoJ trials, 7 attempts over 2 days within first week or two of PoP for me (was 61 with spells and 40ish aa). <br />
Since buffed about 30-40 guild groups, and participated in various trials (even as a damage dealer at 65 a few times) to flag guildies.<br />
<br />
Hedge run: got away lightly here, only done 5-6 of these.<br />
<br />
Xanamech: 6-7 successes, don't think xana ever wiped us, the gnome went berserk an pulled a mega train once though ;)<br />
<br />
BoT keys: got my first medallion when minis were slowable, first shaman in alliance with BoT flag, since done ~30-40 minis and ~7 lords to flag guildmates.<br />
<br />
AD, we beat him with 44 first attempt in mainly NToV gear. wiped a few times to him even with 60-70, spawn seems to vary a bit -being chain feared with 500Mr at 65=not funny ;), but 5 postive kills overall, we have a fairly reliable strategy now ;)<br />
<br />
Behemoth, our nemesis ;) 6 tries before it clicked. a few were utter wipes, a few were let down by failures in one or two key areas, once we killed MB but lost all rezzers, and gnome died due stupidty ;) have won last 3 tries.<br />
<br />
Grummus, took 4-5 times to get strategy down, then 3 wins in a row.<br />
<br />
Terris: 2 initial wipes with 60ish (overconfidence and gargs getting amok in healers both times) Then won it with 42 mainly core raiders 3rd try, once again it clicked. beat her again with no deaths since.<br />
<br />
Also, have spent a goodly amount of time gearing in NToV/SSra/ST(+key work). this has included a lot of pre-pop progression and first kills on:<br />
Most of NToV, all of ssra except emp (keys in progress), KT. Statue/idol/aow, most of tougher luclin minis (Grieg,IV, BP etc), whole bunch of first brood kills and ST raids to get 30 or so primaled melee.<br />
<br />
Also raided a crap load of tier3 minis for runes etc to get casters up to strength (least I got a full poP spellbook before the floodgates open)<br />
<br />
PoP has been our Spur; we have spent a lot of time gearing to meet the PoP challenge. Behemoth would wipe us, we'd walk off, mutter, refine strats, get stronger and return..and get wiped. I feel for our guildleaders who have lkept the alliance strong and morale high even despite heavy wipes<br />
<br />
So not only has it been the timesink of flagging and backflagging, but also making the raid core strong enough to kill for tier3 access...<br />
<br />
So, reward all this please ;) Oh wait, I have already access to relatively quiet tier3 zones...where we can wipe to RD at 6% with 50 people and 2 CoD pets in peace..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The charm idea is great, however it is also creative and would make an actual charm that made sense.  Therefor, the idea really isn't along SoE's path of thinking :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">You will still need all the flags to get Elemental access.  All their posting says is they will remove the access requirement for those zones.  So basically they are just giving everyone free access quest versions of the flags, not the kill versions.  <br />
<br />
I like the charm idea.  Eight zones will be opened up to everyone:<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Create an easy quest, on which doesn't require any named spawns, maybe just a simple collect common item A, B, C, D, and E and turn in to NPC, like the museum quests.  The reward being a charm that has the following stats:  2 AC 2 Stats/resists 10 hp/mana, and then an additional 1 AC  +1 stat/resist +5 hp per flag sounds very reasonable.  So those having every single flag above would have a charm that was 10 AC, 10 stats/resists 50 hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Maybe continue the flagging ability to include all zone flags, which would put the charm at 15 AC, 15 Stats/Resists, and 75 HP/Mana for those with Plane of Time access.  This seems like a very reasonable item, it takes a TON of work to get all those flags and this item would be very comparable to items that people with those flags would already have.</div></div><hr />

This looks like a Velious 2.0 when people realized that they didn't need Kunark armour to go to the Kael Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I heard it would be elemental access for those who had all the other flags.<br />
But I dont believe it.<br />
<br />
I don't believe they will make getting into the Elemental Planes that easy, but if they do... /boggle</div></div><hr />
