<br />
   Tuesday, December 17, 2002  <br />

   <br />
 <br />
   <br />
   <br />
STUDENTS PAID THE PRICE when administrators at Pima Community College in Pima, Ariz., feared that &quot;gangbangers&quot; might enroll in a gun safety course and possibly improve their ominous aim. <br />
<br />
Classes were cancelled after David Bruce, chair of the Administration of Justice Studies, announced that the administration wasn’t &quot;too excited about picking up the morning paper and finding out that some gangbanger took their firearms class at Pima College.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruce, a 27-year veteran of the institution, said the course will no longer be offered in the future, citing liability issues and lack of funding. At the same time, several students have indicated their displeasure concerning the cancellation. <br />
<br />
David Barber, a former California resident, said he learned about Arizona firearms laws through the class and also received quality firearms training that otherwise would have been unavailable to him. <br />
<br />
The class instructor said the reason the course was cancelled was due to &quot;shifting political winds.&quot; Chester Manning, an nra training counselor and former department of public safety officer, said the class proved valuable to students planning a law enforcement career. <br />
<br />
&quot;The class was offered at a lower price than classes in the private sector, making it more affordable to college students,&quot; Manning said. &quot;Now I guess they’ll have to get their training from some tv program or some individual who may or may not know anything about safety. If we’re going to teach people how to be police officers, we’ve got to make sure they’re able to shoot.&quot; <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Common Sense in California <br />
<br />
People familiar with the gun politics situation in California might think the headline above is an oxymoron. Be aware, however, that common sense does exist in the state, it’s just not exhibited by many public officials there. <br />
<br />
In the battle against proposed restrictive ammunition taxes designed to further harass law-abiding gun owners in the state, the California Rifle and Pistol Association (crpa) recently called for a tax credit for California gun owners. <br />
<br />
According to crpa officials, the tax credit would reimburse gun owners for the social value of firearm ownership, which causes dramatic reductions in, and serves as a tremendous deterrent to, crime and violence. <br />
<br />
crpa officials said the fbi has confirmed that over 99 percent of firearms in the United States are never misused in crime. Yet California Senator Don Perata recently called for a tax of five cents per round of ammunition to &quot;offset the cost of gun violence.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;crpa believes this proposal is ridiculous,&quot; said Chuck Michel, crpa’s attorney. &quot;But if Boy Scouts earning a shooting merit badge should pay a tax for the actions of a gangbanger shooting a liquor store clerk, then why shouldn’t law-abiding gun owners get a tax credit for the tremendous public benefit their firearms provide? <br />
<br />
&quot;That tax credit should be five times the amount of the gun ban lobby’s tax proposal, since the savings from crimes thwarted by firearms are at least five times greater than the cost of the misuse of firearms.&quot; <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Slippery Slope in Action <br />
<br />
In other news Down Under, the National Coalition for Gun Control has called on Australia’s police commissioners to ban semi-automatic handguns nationally. <br />
<br />
Convener for the National Coalition for Gun Control Samantha Lee said the commissioners should call for a national amnesty on handguns, implement a buyback scheme and make them a prohibited weapon. <br />
<br />
&quot;After the Port Arthur massacre on April 25, 1996, the police commissioners got together and produced new firearms laws that saw the banning of all semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, but not semi-automatic handguns,&quot; Lee said. <br />
<br />
She said it was critical the police commissioners amend the &quot;loophole.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yet another example of the big lie of incremental revocation of liberty in action. It’s like gun banners in America saying they just want to &quot;regulate&quot; the sale of guns by private individuals at gun shows, knowing all along that they don’t intend to stop until all private ownership of firearms is banned. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
More Facts on Bellesiles’ Fiction <br />
<br />
As if having his award-winning history book moved to the fiction aisle in most bookstores wasn’t enough, Michael Bellesiles, author of Arming America, is finding himself in even more hot water. <br />
<br />
The National Endowment for the Humanities has withdrawn its name from a fellowship for Bellesiles, an Emory University history professor. <br />
<br />
Chicago’s Newberry Library &quot;was in error when it awarded an neh-supported fellowship&quot; to Bellesiles, neh Deputy Chairman Lynne Munson wrote recently to Newberry officials. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because the name of the National Endowment for the Humanities represents a standard that Professor Bellesiles’ application (for the fellowship) did not meet, we are revoking the neh’s name from the fellowship,&quot; she wrote to James Grossman, vice president for research and education at the Newberry Library. &quot;Please remove from all Newberry materials, including your Web site, any association of Professor Bellesiles with the neh.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bellesiles also is taking some heat closer to home. Emory University has appointed a committee of outside experts to further investigate accusations of research misconduct by Bellesiles. <br />
<br />

Annie Get A Gun <br />
<br />
A recent study used by gun-banners to scare women from owning guns actually makes the opposite case to anyone with half a brain. <br />
<br />
American women and girls are five times more likely to be murdered than women in other industrialized nations, according to a study released by the Harvard School of Public Health. <br />
<br />
In a Reuters report, the study’s lead author, David Hemenway, used the statistics to push for more gun control to protect women. Reuters even quoted gun ownership statistics from the Brady Campaign Web site. <br />
<br />
If the premise of the study is, in fact, true–that American women are more likely to be murdered than women in other nations–isn’t that actually an indication that more American women should own guns and practice their unalienable right of self-defense? Seems like a slam-dunk to us. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
German Shooting Prompts Calls for U.S. Gun Registration <br />
<br />
In a move that defies all logic, a minor u.s. gun-ban group is attempting to capitalize on a heinous mass murder in a school in Germany. <br />
<br />
The so-called Coalition to Stop Gun Violence somehow believes that since a 19-year-old German took firearms legally owned in Germany into a German school and killed 19 German teachers and students, somehow registering the legally-owned firearms of peaceable, law-abiding Americans is the obvious answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is needed is a national policy–such as extending Brady background checks to all gun sales, handgun licensing, and handgun registration–to standardize the crazy patchwork of state laws, and to stop illegal gun trafficking,&quot; said Joshua Horwitz, the group’s executive director. <br />
<br />
What is actually needed, we believe, is a little compassion from gun-ban groups, who can’t even wait for bodies halfway across the globe to assume room temperature before cranking out their pre-prepared press releases aimed at killing the Second Amendment a little at a time. <br />
<br />

Ode to an Incomplete List <br />
<br />
A serial rapist brutalizing women in the Fort Worth, Texas, area prompted the Ft. Worth Star Telegram to print a list of suggestions from local police to help women protect themselves from such assault. Police suggested the following safety tips: <br />
<br />
    Keep exterior lighting on at night;<br />
    Check outdoor lights each morning to make sure they have not been unscrewed;<br />
    Keep blinds closed to prevent anyone from seeing inside;<br />
    Keep all doors and windows locked. Deadbolt locks are  recommended;<br />
    Keep a cell phone beside the bed programmed to call 9-1-1;<br />
    Keep garage doors closed and take garage door openers into the home so an attacker cannot break into a vehicle, get the garage door opener and enter the home;<br />
    Jog or walk in pairs;<br />
    Invest in a can of pepper spray or a whistle;<br />
    Get to know your neighbors. <br />
<br />
Those are all very good suggestions. We’re assuming, however, that the newspaper must have run out of space before printing the final tip that was almost certainly on the list provided by local police:<br />
  á Get a gun, learn how to use it safely and shoot the attacker if he attacks you. <br />
<br />
Now that sounds more effective than a whistle! <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
California Court Upholds Local Gun Show Bans <br />
<br />
Try as they might, Californians seeking to overturn local ordinances banning gun shows have met with little sympathy from state courts. <br />
<br />
The California Supreme Court recently ruled that state law does not prevent local jurisdictions from banning gun shows at fairgrounds or other public properties. This decision upholds bans in Los Angeles and Alameda counties prohibiting the sale of firearms at gun shows and swap meets. <br />
<br />
These ordinances were challenged by a pair of lawsuits claiming that the bans violated a state preemption law reserving the regulation of firearms to state government. Also, the Los Angeles County ordinance was challenged on the basis it violated the right to commercial free speech. <br />
<br />
Originally filed in federal court, the cases were referred to the state court in an effort to clarify the question of preemption. Next stop for the litigation will be the 9th u.s. Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear the commercial free speech argument. <br />
<br />
This same court overturned a Santa Clara County gun show ban five years ago, ruling that the restrictions violated a form of protected free speech.</div></div><hr />

 Gun Control<br />
vs. Gun Rights<br />
<br />
WHAT’S THE ISSUE? <br />
  <br />
A recent spate of deadly school shootings — including the April 1999 massacre of 14 students and a teacher at a suburban Colorado high school — have added momentum to gun control measures long pending before Congress. Among other things, proponents of stricter firearm laws are calling for mandatory child safety locks, tougher background checks, and other controls that they believe will curb the rise of gun-related violence. Such proposals come just months after a host of cities — including New Orleans, Miami, and Los Angeles — filed suit against firearm manufacturers, blaming the companies’ marketing practices for violence caused by guns. <br />
<br />
HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOU <br />
  <br />
Legislation approved by the Senate in 1999 would have applied a three day waiting period for background checks required by the 1993 Brady Gun Act to gun show purchases. The House later approved an amendment to limit the background check to 24 hours, after which the weapon could be sold if the check weren't complete. (However, the House then killed the bill in July 1999, leaving the fate of gun legislation again in doubt.) Guns sold after the enactment of the proposed legislation would have been sold with safety locks – a factor that critics say could drive up gun prices. In addition, lawmakers continue to want to limit the import of high-volume ammunition clips manufactured for weapons currently sold in the United States.<br />
<br />
<br />
HOW THE INTEREST GROUPS SEE IT <br />
  <br />
Gun rights groups say such legislation would infringe on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. They say stricter background checks at gun shows would slow weapon sales, as the waiting period would outlast the gun show itself. Some gun manufacturers have volunteered support for safety locks, but the National Rifle Association has criticized the measure as another attack on gun owners. The NRA, a prominent voice in the gun debate, says firearm control measures wouldn’t be needed if lawmakers would enforce current law.<br />
<br />
Gun control advocates, including Handgun Control, support even stricter provisions. Among other things, they are calling for a limit of one handgun purchase per month, a move supported by the Clinton Administration. Such groups also advocate raising the legal age limit for ownership of guns to age 21 from the current age of 18. Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) has announced his support for raising the age limit. <br />
  <br />
IT ALL BEGAN . . . <br />
  <br />
The most recent debate over gun control gained momentum after the April 20, 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. However, the issue of firearm regulations has been a perennial issue before Congress for several decades. Historically, the debate over gun control has peaked following prominent acts of violence committed with guns, such as the shooting deaths of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King during the 1960s and the murder of Beatles icon John Lennon and an assassination attempt on President Reagan during the 1980s.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MONEY <br />
  <br />
Gun rights groups contributed more than $3.7 million in soft money, PAC, and individual contributions during the 1999-00 election cycle, with more than 90 percent of the money favoring Republicans. That's more than $13 million in contributions since 1990. [see gun rights contributions ] The National Rifle Association  was the predominant donor of the gun rights lobby, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the interest’s giving over the last decade. Gun control advocates, meanwhile, contributed more than $394,000 in PAC and individual donations during the current election cycle, nearly 95 percent to Democrats. Since 1990, such groups have given $1.3 million in soft money, PAC, and individual contributions, 92 percent to Democrats. [see gun control contributions]<br />
<br />
In addition to political contributions, each side of the gun control debate spent large amounts of money to lobby members of Congress and the Clinton administration on the issue. Click here to see the latest lobbying figures available for gun control and gun rights.<br />
<br />
Besides political contributions and lobbying expenditures, the National Rifle Association is one of the handful of special interest groups that also spends millions of dollars on independent expenditures and special communications costs. . These are unlimited dollars spent explicitly advocating the election or defeat of a federal candidate, such as taking out newspaper ads or sending pamphlets to membership. By law, these expenditures must be reported to the Federal Election Commission and the group or individual making the expenditures cannot coordinate with the candidate they benefit. Between 1991 and 1998, the NRA spent nearly $12 million on such expenditures, with about $7.3 million spent in favor of Republican candidates.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE PARTY LINE <br />
  <br />
Historically, the debate over gun control has generally divided Democrats and Republicans along party lines. Thus, it’s no surprise that GOP lawmakers, chief opponents of new gun laws, were the primary recipients of contributions from the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups. Democrats traditionally have led the charge for stricter gun measures – a fact reflective in the contributions they receive from gun control advocates. However, there are prominent members of both parties who cross partisan lines. Most recently, Rep. John Dingall (D-Mich.) threw his support behind a GOP-led gun bill in the House while Rep. Constance Morella (R-Md.) stood with Democratic leaders in support of tough gun controls. The issue has become so contentious for House lawmakers that Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) declined to enforce party discipline on the subject.<br />
<br />
THE PROCESS <br />
  <br />
Senate: Just weeks after the Colorado school shooting, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), bypassed traditional committee debate and approved immediate floor consideration of S. 254, the Senate Juvenile Justice Bill. The bill, ultimately amended to include tough provisions on background checks and safety locks, was approved by a 73-25 vote on May 20.<br />
<br />
House: The House rejected legislation loaded with gun control provisions similar to those approved by the Senate in May. However, House Republican leaders split the gun debate into two separate pieces of legislation –- one focusing on youth culture and violent crime and another specifically dealing with gun shows. Among the more contentious points of debate, gun-rights backers passed an amendment limiting gun show background checks to 24 hours, rather than the Senate-approved mandate of three days. If the check is not completed within 24 hours, the sale automatically would be approved. Unhappiness with that amendment  –- among gun-control advocates who viewed it as too weak and gun-rights advocates who thought it went too far  –- led to the bill's demise. <br />
 <br />
<br />
HOW THE VOTES WENT <br />
  <br />
The Senate approved new gun control measures by a vote of 73-25 in 1999. However, lawmakers voted three times on proposed background checks at gun shows, first voting against a three-day waiting period, then approving a 24-hour waiting period, then gave final approval to the mandatory three-day background check. [see Senate vote chart]<br />
<br />
The House in 1999 voted 218-211 in favor of an amendment that would limit background checks at gun shows to 24 hours. Lawmakers, in a 193-235 vote, voted down an amendment that would have mandated a three-day waiting period. The House then voted to kill the bill by a 280-147 vote.

   <br />
FOR AMERICAN GUN OWNERS who haven’t gotten energized for the upcoming elections, the ultimate inspiration to get involved can be found in two words–England and Australia. <br />
<br />
In those two nations, formerly-free people can tell you about the real nature of &quot;gun control&quot;–where all schemes, no matter how benign-sounding, lead to the same ultimate end: forced disarmament of peaceable individuals by government. And make no mistake about it, if pro-gun forces are defeated in this fall’s all-important House and Senate elections, anti-gun politicians who have been quiet for the past several months will come out of the woodwork with more restrictive gun control schemes than ever before. <br />
<br />
A LESSON IN FORFEITURE<br />
Be it in the form of gun owner licensing and registration, or safety requirements, or gun storage, or mandatory training, each step in England and Australia was followed by another step, and another, until law-abiding gun owners were forced into a final step–forfeiting their personal property, and with it their liberties. <br />
<br />
Mass forfeitures of registered firearms began in England in 1988 following a murderous rampage by a deranged individual in Hungerford. The government banned whole classes of pump and semi-auto shotguns and rifles. Then following another rampage, in Dunblane, Scotland, by another madman in 1997, Britain criminalized possession of large caliber handguns, then all handguns. <br />
<br />
In Australia, it was private possession of all semi-auto rifles and semi-auto and pump shotguns that was criminalized following mass murders committed by a deranged loner armed with an illegal semi-auto rifle at Port Arthur in the state of Tasmania. <br />
<br />
In both nations, because of the brutal acts of lone individual criminals, legal private property of all citizens was declared contraband, then confiscated. The rationale used for this theft of freedom was twofold: That disarming all citizens of their firearms would deprive lone sociopathic mass murderers of the tool with which they killed; or that the forfeiture of firearms by innocent law-abiding people would prevent criminal violence by an always-lawless underclass. <br />
<br />
Invariably, the media and politicians said that disarming the public was for its own good. Nothing could be further from the truth. The wholesale loss of liberty in England and Australia will never stop the murderous acts of single sociopaths. How can it? The answer is obvious. <br />
<br />
If curbing violence was the promise of &quot;gun control,&quot; it has proven to be a cruel lie and a fraud. In both countries, victims of criminal violence are piling up. <br />
<br />
Ever since gun confiscation orders were instituted, England and Australia have rushed ahead of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of sheer violence by their criminals against the now-disarmed and vulnerable public. In terms of the likelihood of people becoming victims of crime and violence, England and Australia now rank either first or second in the indus-trialized world, far outstripping the United States in virtually all categories. <br />
<br />
According to the International Crime Victims Survey conducted by the Dutch Ministry of Justice, England, Australia and Wales consistently won the dubious honors of having the highest burglary rates and the highest rates for crimes of violence such as robbery, assault and sexual assault in the 17 top industrialized nations. <br />
<br />
Conducted in the year 2000 with interviews involving 35,000 individuals, the survey was summed up as a shocker in the British press. The Guardian reported the study &quot;shows England and Wales at the top of the world league with Australia as the countries where you are most likely to become a victim of crime.&quot; <br />
<br />
THE ANSWER: MORE GUN CONTROL<br />
Violence and Shootings–all marked by the mindless brutality of utterly lawless criminals–are controlling and crippling every aspect of modern British society. Yet, self-defense with any of the few firearms allowed for private ownership is a serious crime. <br />
<br />
As armed violence has increased, the British and Australian politicians and their media elites have promised yet more gun control. In Australia, they are after all handguns. In England, with very few categories of firearms left for legal private ownership, it’s now bb and pellet guns they are after. <br />
<br />
As always, the new ban is sought based on a murderous rampage, but this time, in 2002, the political notion of innocent gun owners paying the price for the acts of madmen has been taken to an even more bizarre extreme by Prime Minister Tony Blair. An April 28 headline in The Sunday Scotsman announced, &quot;Prompted by shootings in Germany, Tony Blair orders crackdown on convertible air guns.&quot; <br />
<br />
This call to &quot;control&quot; air guns was keyed to the murderous acts of a deranged expelled 19-year-old student in Erfurt, Germany, who killed 17 schoolmates on April 16 with a handgun. That mass killing led to Germany tightening already draconian gun control laws. But what on earth does that have to do with British citizens who own air rifles or air pistols? <br />
<br />
Citing those murders, The Sunday Scotsman, said, &quot;The government is now planning further controls on the lethal weapons (air guns), including an across-the-board ban, or at least a registration scheme designed to stop them from falling into the hands of youngsters and high risk buyers.&quot; <br />
<br />
But air guns owned by citizens who would agreeably comply with a &quot;registration scheme&quot; have no connection with guns used by armed, violent criminals. Criminal predators have guns, and they always will. In fact, criminals in Britain now have an estimated 2 million illegal guns, including machine guns, smuggled from Eastern Europe. <br />
<br />
Yet, Tony Blair, under intense political criticism for his utter failure to deal with armed criminals, would once again punish the innocent. <br />
<br />
The Scotsman warned that, &quot;The shootings in Germany have brought fresh urgency to a gun control debate which was stimulated in Britain by the murderous rampage of Thomas Hamilton through a Dunblane primary school six years ago ... .&quot; <br />
<br />
After the murders, Parliament moved in 1997 to ban private possession of all handguns except .22 caliber. There was a &quot;buyback&quot; scheme and licensed gun owners were told to hand over their property. Also included in the &quot;buyback&quot; were all nature of items associated with shooting–everything from holsters to scopes. <br />
<br />
As for small caliber handguns, they were indeed moved out of private homes. The government permitted licensed owners of .22 caliber pistols and revolvers–under strict police supervision–to keep them under government-supervised security at approved gun clubs. Licensed handgun owners were allowed, under very stringent circumstances, to visit their guns. <br />
<br />
But when Bill Clinton’s good friend Tony Blair became prime minister with his Liberal Party in control of Parliament, those remaining small caliber handguns were forfeited as well. People were paid for their property, but their property had been taken by government edict. <br />
<br />
KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE &quot;WRONG&quot; HANDS<br />
In all, the government took 162,000 registered handguns from licensed owners. The government said the new ban–this confiscation from secure government-approved centralized locations–&quot;prevents legally held guns from falling into the wrong hands.&quot; But government hands were, indeed, the wrong hands. This was simple theft by government. <br />
<br />
The final day for licensed British handgun owners to turn in their remaining handguns was Feb. 27, 1998. The Home Secretary proudly announced, &quot;The government fulfilled its pledge to remove all handguns from the streets of Britain today.&quot; Ironically, these were guns that were never on the streets–they were in good people’s private homes. <br />
<br />
When the last registered handgun was forfeited by the last remaining licensed handgun owner, the Blair government said it &quot;has put a firm brake on the development of a dangerous gun culture in the u.k.&quot; But the so-called &quot;dangerous gun culture&quot; that Tony Blair stamped out was made up of law-abiding citizens who had answered to the &quot;harmless&quot; call for licensing, registration and whatever other restrictions the government demanded. The banned &quot;gun culture&quot; included Britain’s Olympic competitors who were forced to practice their sport on freer soil–in France, Switzerland or the u. s. <br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the level of violence and the brutal nature of that violence exploded against the newly-disarmed civil populations. Headlines from British papers tell the story: <br />
<br />
&quot;Handgun crime soars despite Dunblane ban&quot;… &quot;Police move to tackle huge rise in crime&quot;… &quot;London gun murders tripled in 2001&quot;… &quot;Steep rise in violent crime&quot;… &quot;Top gangs getting more guns, warn police&quot; ... &quot;Handgun crime up despite ban&quot;… &quot;Gun crime rise in London&quot;… &quot;Gun crime trebles as weapons and drugs flood British cities.&quot; <br />
<br />
AN EPIDEMIC OF CRIME<br />
The London Evening Standard reported on Dec. 19, 2001, &quot;Gun crime in London is rocketing, with increases of almost 90 percent in some firearms offenses, Scotland Yard reported today. New figures show London murders with guns increased by 87 percent in the first eight months of the year com-pared with the same period last year.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Daily Telegraph of Jan. 3, 2002, reported, &quot;Police fear a new crime explosion as school-age muggers graduate to guns … the number of people robbed of personal property at gunpoint rose by 53 percent … . Ballistics experts warn that firearms are now cheap and easily available.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Telegraph reported &quot;the number of young people committing serious crimes, including murder and grievous bodily harm, has almost doubled in seven years.&quot; <br />
<br />
Various news outlets covered the story from a different perspective, but their conclusions were the same, very bad news–terrible news for ordinary and unarmed British subjects. <br />
<br />
All of this was magnified for the world in a stunning report issued by the un Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute in July 2002, which found England and Wales to be far ahead of the rest of the Western world in terms of violent crime. <br />
<br />
The headline in The Independent laid it out in very simple terms: &quot;Britain is now the crime capital of the West.&quot; Among the findings reported were that &quot;nearly 55 crimes are committed per 100 people&quot; and that &quot;England and Wales also have the worst record for ‘very serious offenses’ ... .&quot; <br />
<br />
With half the innocent public falling victim to crime, the issue of unbridled street thuggery has overwhelmed all else in terms of British domestic issues. All of this in a nation where personal self-defense–armed self-defense–is a crime. The inevitable response of government to its failed gun control schemes? Calls for more gun control, of course. <br />
<br />
ATTACK ON OTHER LIBERTIES<br />
But there’s more. And here’s where those who don’t own guns–even those who hate guns–should take notice. In addition to calling for more gun control, the Blair government has pressed for laws erasing many of the ancient civil liberty protections that were adopted from English Common law and incorporated into the United States Constitution. Unlike the u.s., Britain has no constitution protecting the rights of the people. <br />
<br />
If the Blair government succeeds in its wish list, citizens will lose the right to choose trial by jury, the right to remain silent, and the right against self-incrimination. Hearsay evidence –gossip–will be admissible in criminal trials. And double jeopardy–the 800-year-old legal principle that prevents government from taking a second, third or fourth shot at trying a defendant–will be lost. <br />
<br />
Under the Blair proposals, the new law destroying double jeopardy will be retroactive, so that old cases where defendants were acquitted can be reopened and retried, and perhaps retried again. Among the legislation put forth by the Blair government in a White Paper is the use of pre-videotaped testimony, negating the individual’s right to confront an accuser, and to challenge that testimony in open court. <br />
<br />
And the Blair government wants sentencing in criminal cases to be based on something other than firm law, where punishment is tailored to individual defendants at the whim of judges. If Blair succeeds, British courts will fast become inquisitions. <br />
<br />
There are some who might believe that such expediencies would be good for our own country. But imagine Charles Schumer or Hillary Clinton as u.s. Attorney General zealously prosecuting defendants accused of violating some new gun control scheme dreamed up by the likes of the Brady Campaign (hci) or the Violence Policy Center, or Americans for Gun Safety. <br />
<br />
And imagine all those honest gun owners and dealers who were persecuted during the batf abuses of the 1980s being recharged and retried today. <br />
<br />
Our unique Bill of Rights–including the Second Amendment–protects us all. Where Americans are &quot;the people,&quot; Britons are still mere subjects, with no protections of a Bill of Rights. They have no Second Amendment safeguard, so the assault on firearms ownership will not end until not one single private person possesses legal arms of any type. <br />
<br />
The Handgun Network–the British equivalent to the Brady Campaign–has said, &quot;Of course illegal guns are a big problem … but we mustn’t forget that almost all illegal guns start out legal, so its not so easy to draw a neat line between the two … creating a safe society has got to be about cutting down on illegal and legal weaponry.&quot; <br />
<br />
On its Web site, the Handgun Control Network published an extract in which it admitted crime had gone up since the gun forfeitures … but said, &quot;Gun control advocates never predicted that the ban would immediately rid the country of all gun crime.&quot; <br />
<br />
Of course, that is a flat-out lie. <br />
<br />
If anybody ever thinks that outlawing firearms from the hands of good, decent citizens creates &quot;a safe society,&quot; the example is indeed in England, which proves itself a beacon to armed criminals whose level of violence make their American counterparts meek in comparison. <br />
<br />
No (SELF) DEFENSE <br />
The real threat OF deterrence by an armed citizenry, which certainly exists under most American law, is not possible in Great Britain today, not only because of the firearms confiscations, but because using any of the legally held firearms left to British householders in defense of self, family, or property is also a crime. <br />
<br />
Witness the story of Tony Martin, a 54-year-old farmer, whose home on a 350-acre rural tract had been repeatedly burglarized and robbed. In fact, thieves had broken into his home and outbuildings at least two dozen times. On the night of Aug. 21, 1999, Martin heard burglars inside his home and confronted the criminals with a shotgun. He wounded one thief and killed another. A third house breaker got away. <br />
<br />
The dead burglar had a history of crimes of violence and crimes against persons and property. He had been arrested for 29 different crimes including burglary, theft and assaulting police. The two other career criminals had been hauled before the court on criminal offenses 52 times and 35 times. <br />
<br />
But it was Tony Martin who was prosecuted with the greatest zeal. The Crown Court found him guilty of murder and sentenced him to life in prison. Although the Court of Appeals (akin to our u.s. Supreme Court) ultimately reduced Martin’s sentence after changing his conviction to manslaughter, Martin is still in prison, serving seven years total. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, the surviving wounded burglar, Brendon Fearon, was consulted by officials of the Home Office–in prison–as to whether or not Tony Martin could be subject to parole. Further, on July 2, 2002, the London Daily Mail revealed that the government had given £5,000 of taxpayers’ money to burglar Fearon (now a free man) to fund a lawsuit against Tony Martin. <br />
<br />
This is the &quot;safe society&quot; created by the work of Britain’s gun control fanatics: <br />
<br />
Good people in jail for defending their homes against violent criminals and drug addicts. <br />
<br />
Good people living in fear of the rule of a heavily armed and ruthless thug underclass. <br />
<br />
Good people disarmed and helpless. <br />
<br />
Evil people armed to the teeth. <br />
<br />
Good people paying the price for criminals and madmen. <br />
<br />
That’s gun control. It will prove out in America, if citizens ever buy into the notion that there is strength in being defenseless. <br />
<br />
And it could prove out in America if law-abiding, peaceable gun owners decide to sit out this fall’s elections or cast their vote based on some other social issue or subject. <br />
<br />
This November could mark an important turning point in American history–a time when we could head down the dangerous, tragic road taken by England and Australia. It’s a time when nra members and all freedom lovers must set other issues aside and again Vote Freedom First. <br />
<br />
Between now and next month, take the time to find out which candidates support your rights, then throw your full support behind those candidates. <br />
<br />
And don’t forget what could happen if you decide to forego your right to vote this fall. In fact, if you need a reminder, just take another look at England and Australia. <br />

IN POLITICS, ONE RULE COUNTS: The side with the biggest numbers wins. Nothing else matters. <br />
<br />
That goes for elections, and it goes for votes in legislative bodies. And, above all, it determines whose political ideology controls the governing agenda. <br />
<br />
In the case of the U.S. House of Representatives–in this coming election–if the Democratic party ends up with the biggest numbers, absolute control of legislative power will fall to a majority of lawmakers zealously long-dedicated to erasing America’s firearm freedom. <br />
<br />
NRA’s Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre calls the cadre of powerful anti-firearm legislators who want to control the machinery and direction of the U.S. House of Representatives the &quot;F&quot; Troop. Those who will hold all the leadership power–should the Democratic Party take the majority–are all rated &quot;F&quot; in NRA’s political preference charts. <br />
<br />
And these &quot;F&quot;s are hoping that the media will lull firearm-rights voters into staying home on election day. In story after story, over these past months leading to the coming 2002 off-year Congressional elections, the national media has been pushing the notion that gun control is now a dead issue with the Democratic party–that the decades of embracing every gun-control scheme and blaming peaceable gun owners for crime or the acts of madmen are things of the past. <br />
<br />
Gun control isn’t dead; it’s dormant. It’s hiding. It’s camouflaged. <br />
<br />
In the world of political numbers, every peaceable gun owner in America must consider a paramount set of numbers–the &quot;F&quot; Troop. There are currently 151 Democratic party NRA &quot;F&quot;s in the Congress–hardly a majority overall, but an overwhelming majority where it counts: in leadership and in lock-tight control of the committees that spawn gun control in any form. And many of the &quot;F&quot;s have a huge power advantage in seniority. <br />
<br />
Top on the list of the &quot;F&quot; Troop–in terms of sheer power to move anti-gun rights legislation, pack committees and energize the media against gun owners–is Richard Gephardt (D-Mo., 3rd Dist.), the man who would become the all-powerful Speaker of the House. Should Democrats gain a majority, Gephardt will reward the broad political support of his anti-gun-rights lobbies. <br />
<br />
In action, as Minority Leader, he has proved a shrewd practitioner of the gun-control philosophy that marked the Clinton-Gore years–the notion that innocent, peaceable, law-abiding firearm owners must relinquish their gun rights, a step at a time, while armed, violent criminals are never held accountable for crimes they commit under existing tough Federal firearm laws. <br />
<br />
Denying existing law and encouraging non-enforcement always paves the way for the lie that the nation needs more gun control laws. <br />
<br />
Dick Gephardt–along with the other members of the &quot;F&quot; Troop powerbrokers–must be judged, first and foremost by how highly the ban-the-gun crowd values them, and what exactly those endorsements and candidate ratings mean. <br />
<br />
Gephardt is rated 100 percent by the American Bar Association’s Special Committee on Gun Violence, which supports outlawing and confiscating broad classes of now-legal handguns and semi-automatic long guns; granting broad powers to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission to ban firearms and ammunition unilaterally under bureaucratic safety criteria; amending Federal Firearms law to encourage injury lawsuits against individual firearm owners and those engaged in legal Federally licensed commerce; enacting laws to license all handgun owners and register all privately owned handguns; and enacting punitive taxes on purchases of handguns and handgun ammunition. <br />
<br />
Gephardt is rated 100 percent by the Coalition to Stop Violence, the former National Coalition to Ban Handguns. <br />
<br />
And he rates a 94 with the Brady Campaign (Handgun Control, Inc.), which is currently pushing to convert the National Instant Check System into a permanent firearm-owner registration database and would enact laws criminalizing all private sales between individuals not made through NICS. The Brady Campaign also supports bans on private possession of handguns through ever expanding &quot;junk gun&quot; legislation, and was directly responsible for government confiscation of registered semi-automatic rifles owned by law-abiding California gun owners. <br />
<br />
Next on the &quot;F&quot; Troop political power food chain in the U.S. House is Nancy Pelosi (D-Ca., 8th Dist.), a close political ally of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.). If the Democrats take the majority, Pelosi is in line to become House Majority Leader, with broad power to move or stall legislation. In 1992, she was co-Chair of the Democratic National Platform Committee, which rubber-stamped firearm registration and licensing along with gun prohibitions, all proffered by Handgun Control, Inc. There are rumors as well that if Dick Gephardt runs for the Presidency, Pelosi could become the Speaker. <br />
<br />
If the top leadership would be a bad dream for gun rights under an &quot;F&quot; Troop-dominated Democratic Congress, the makeup of the critical committees would be a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Crucial for the future of firearm ownership is the Judiciary Committee where gun control legislation is usually spawned and incubated. <br />
<br />
If the Democrats wrest control of the House, Judiciary will be chaired by U.S. Rep. John Conyers, (Mich., 14th Dist.), who has been a consistent and fanatical opponent of Second Amendment freedom since coming to Congress in 1964. Conyers, who favors universal registration and licensing and a confiscatory ban on all handguns, will doubtless push the legislative envelope, and with his majority rule will be able to move any legislative agenda he chooses. <br />
<br />
Currently, of the 16 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, 15 are rated as NRA &quot;F&quot;s. Most of these people are not simply passively anti-gun-rights, they are aggressive opponents. Most despise the membership of the National Rifle Association. Most of these people have 100 percent ratings from the political groups and lobbies pressing for firearm bans and forfeiture. If their party takes the majority, they will be joined by still more NRA &quot;F&quot;s, and will be a solid unstoppable voting block. A switch in parties could mean a flip in the ratio with 21 Democrats versus 16 Republicans, or worse. <br />
<br />
Democratic &quot;F&quot; members of the current Judiciary Committee, such as Conyers, Jerrald Nadler (N.Y.-8th), Martin Meehan (Mass.-5th), Robert Wexler (Fla.-9th) and Anthony Weiner (N.Y.- 9th) are major sponsors of all nature of anti-gun rights legislation from bills demanding universal firearm owner licensing and registration, to measures designed to ban private ownership of firearms through the bureaucratic back door, to criminalizing now-legal and innocent sales between private individuals. <br />
<br />
And some–like Conyers who wants to turn convicted felons into a powerful political machine by restoring their voting rights–pursue soft-on-criminals agendas, and receive 100 percent approval ratings from organizations that believe punishment is not an answer to criminal violence. <br />
<br />
When funding for an expansion of Project Exile came before the House, in April 2000, John Conyers was joined by Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi in opposing the get-tough-on armed violent criminals initiative. <br />
<br />
Among those Judiciary Committee members who voted against funding for Project Exile were many key members of the Judiciary Committee &quot;F&quot; Troop. <br />
<br />
Although gun control legislation ordinarily originates in the Judiciary Committee, the ascendancy of Hollywood’s Congressman, Henry Waxman, to the chair of the House Committee on Government Reform would create an additional breeding ground for all means of anti-firearm-rights legislation and oversight. <br />
<br />
Waxman–in this current Congress–has proven himself the major consistent water-carrier for the Violence Policy Center, which demands confiscatory bans on all handguns and self-loading rifles, and the VPC is directly linked on Waxman’s Congressional website. <br />
<br />
Today, in terms of balance, the Government Reform Committee’s Democratic side is dominated by 14 NRA-rated &quot;F&quot;s out of 19 members. With a flip in the majority, Waxman’s agenda will be virtually impossible to stop. <br />
<br />
An &quot;F&quot; Troop, led by Henry Waxman, John Conyers, Nancy Pelosi and Dick Gephardt, gaining majority status in the House and linking up with the Senatorial anti-gun-rights forces led by the likes of Chuck Schumer, Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, should be a horrifying prospect to every peaceable firearm owner in our nation. But most don’t know about this danger–with the all-out media campaign to lull people into apathy. It is up to NRA members to awaken their friends, colleagues and neighbors to this very real danger. If the Democratic party takes the majority, the &quot;F&quot; will rule.</div></div><hr />
