<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in CT last night and died twice due to mobs attacking me when invised.  I know for a fact that it didnt fade (my other computer tells me if it is rather loudly), and all 5 other members of my group had been able to run past the mobs without a problem, even I had run past them one way without a problem.  If I had been on my horse I could probably understand it, but I wasnt :(  The only difference between us was I had used my invis and the other 5 were all Chanter invised.  This has actually happened to me before in CT as well.<br />
<br />
I can tell you one thing, next time I am in CT I am gonna get someone else to invis me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You sure you weren't on a horse?  Sometimes there's this bug that makes the horse icon disappear after zoning even tho you're still on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definately wasnt - first time I was on a CR so didnt have my bridle with me, the second time I had clicked the horsey off to run to the zone (have been attacked coz of me horsey before).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some mobs just seem to have an anti invis aura or something, the best example I can think of is Straithbones (especially the healers), con them whilst invis and they are all Indif, go near one and poof invis goes as they agro =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's that nasty troll funk what gives you away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have often speculated whether or not some mobs have the ability to detect invisibility based on how close you get to the mob and also on length of time near the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Similar thing happened to me in lower Guk recently - I was running to the King room using invis (obviously no horse), when I heard a &quot;Frooaaak&quot;. When I stopped running a bit further down the corridor there were 3 or 4 frogs chasing me BUT I was still invisible as none of them had hit me yet.<br />
<br />
I assumed at the time that a froggy shaman had buffed them with see invis - can mobs actually do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, mobs can buff other mobs with see invis.  Kronenbourg, if you were running through the Courtyard, there is a see invis mob that spawns there, maybe you got closer than your groupmates?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">some things see invis but not right away, too, ex minotaurs in lguk. if you run right by them you are safe, but if you stand still to look at your map yer in trouble...</div></div><hr />
