<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's pretty early to ask, but are the spells dropping like dimes in GoD now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, i was in KT all last night, and we saw 2 spells drop my slw spell and a pally spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One should probably look at how commonly named dropped spells pre patch, and how commonly they drop them now. Don't look at it as X hours in Y zone, that wont cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well we killed all mini named in Kt and all we got was the two spells, and the normal stuff they drop (gear and augs)<br />
where as after last patch all we got from killing all the minis was 1 necro spell.<br />
this is not counting the turnin stones which i dont have a count on how many we got. but it was more then last time as well IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got Talisman of Epuration off Fierce Cragwalker in Natimbi, but i'm sure that doesn't count.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, y'know, if they added level 60 spells to the mix on common named's loot tables out there... There would be even more level 65's bottomfeeding off natimbi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed 2 named in the sewers last night:<br />
First dropped - Slot 7 Augment (regen2) and Bard spell (rottage)<br />
Second dropped - New arms on Gorg and SK spell (our SK is very happy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">3 hours in Ferubi last night and killed Hexxt N'Vak Tkan who dropped Wizzie spell Black Ice and Zerker Tome, and killed Pxet Elite Blademaster, who dropped a lvl 60 druid spell.  <br />
Makes me think that the Elites don't drop GoD spells since they are really quest npcs, only the other named do, like Hexx Gkon, Hexxt Pzik Shiaak, the above Hexxt, Pxet Vzanki Kzan, Rav Ptvin and Rev Hunter.<br />
Didn't see anything off trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They need to add the spells to raid targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They need to get rid of the damn level 60 Luclin spells that have been bugged since the day GoD was released.</div></div><hr />
