<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tnit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just come back after a long break from EQ, around 8 months. I have a 59 monk and a 45 shaman. I really have a limited knowledge of both of these classes benefits in PoP. Trying to get some advice on which to play or whether just to start a whole new class that it more wanted/needed in PoP. With shamans I am wondering if it would be possible to solo and if they're wanted in groups. Monks, on the other hand, I am wondering whether they are wanted at all after their nerf. Either class I go with I will only have around 130-140k to equip. Any advice would be great. Thanks</div></div><hr />

First off play the Class that you like, I personally love my shaman, and have a whole array of other chars including 50+ ones, and i am told shaman can solo PoP at higher lvls meaning 58+ or so in tier 1 my necro gets slaughtered trying to solo at 54 though but have not played him in months lol,<br />
<br />
Secondly How in the sam H*** do ppl get 130 to 140k ,,, I consider myself fairly well off but if i stripped all my chars i could not come up with that :(  * enough whining from me ) hehe</div></div><hr />

Lots of bazaar time.<br />
<br />
You just need to watch what items go for and hope you find some good deals.  I personally have been very fortunate finding strange deals.  Watch what people auction.  I have seen people selling noctivangant blades for 250pp (they easily go for 3kpp).  That is an extreme example of course.  Mostly I might buy something for 200pp and resell it for 250pp, just a small percentage increase, but the really good deals can make some nice money.  People don't like to run a trader all the time, so they just take what money they can get.  I will invest the time to let my trader sit there overnight while I sleep, and all day while at work.<br />
<br />
Don't think badly of me, I am not one of the people that completely overprice things just trying to make a buck (Like selling Torpor for 100kpp).  If I have something and I see people that just have it way overpriced, I will totally undercut them, sometimes by thousands of pp.  Over time you build up your bank account and buy more expensive items.  Buy for 10kpp and sell for 12kpp.  Still a small percent, but it is 2kpp profit.<br />
<br />
I do other things also.  Like, checking most vendors when I pass them.  Buy hides, silks, and other items cheap from them and resale them for profit.  I also spend a very little time on tradeskills making leather padding and silk items, which other tradeskillers need.  I farm certain items some times also.<br />
<br />
I am only level 25, with a 32 Warrior alt.  I have never been on a raid, never got any items or money from my guild, and have been playing total for less than 7 months (usually just on weekends).  But, I have a lizard, solstice earring, and other nice items with a healthy bank account left.<br />
<br />
Just be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The other thing is to simply to do a spring cleanout every so often, I'm a notorious packrat and terrible for hoarding and hanging onto junk that I pickup in my travels, but a few days ago I finally stuck everything that was tradable and I had no immediate use for on a vendor at cheap prices, made a good 50kpp in a couple of hours =)</div></div><hr />
