<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of my cleric friends was complaining last night that Yaulp 6 wasn't stacking with Spirit of Bih'li.   Has anyone else noticed this problem?  I assume it's the atk components, but Lucy indicates no stacking problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a huge pain in the ass...  I couldn't even find &quot;Spirit of Wolf&quot; in my book, I had to use the new menu thingy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also - any one else notice Talisman of the Boar is listed under strength buffs?  fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's what the new menu thingie is for - finding those lost spells on page 50.<br />
<br />
As far as the Yaulp thing - dont know. I always kick my clerics before grouping and if they yaulp, they dont get in the group.</div></div><hr />

This was fixed on test after the live patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spirit of Bi Li has stacked with Avatar for a couple weeks now, I wonder if they messed up Yaulp when they fixed Avatar?  :)</div></div><hr />
