<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sicel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, been a while since i have been on this forum, but im glad to e bacl:D  Anyways, I am a level 26 ranger and i was just wondering if there were any good quest's out there for a new bp and also some jewelry. I am pritty ubba for my level. i have a Cnti LS, some jagged sword that gives dex and ac,  and close to same dmg/delay. I have worked dragon breech legings, and some nice sholders and sleeves and stuff. But my BP SUX and i kinda want new rings/bracers and stuff. So any quests/ items that arnt above 2000pp each would be cool. I have a CCS and some other decent items to sell/trade so i think i can get quit a bit of money to buy items... thanks for your help guys:p</div></div><hr />

Well, lets see...you didn't say what bp you have, so I'll throw out a couple of suggestions...I was wearing Treeweave up until 52 when I got my Barbed ringmail, both of which are really good BPs.</div></div><hr />
