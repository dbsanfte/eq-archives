<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fear not, weary and jaded gamers! The SOE dev team has come up with a solution to your problems! No longer will you freeze in the POK! No longer will you see what the ground looks like from the wrong side! Not once more will you be stuck in a tree, stuck in a wall, or molested by those offensive LDON wall tapestries! Quests? Consider them fixed! Angry feedback messages? Consider them addressed! Nay, I beg of you, REJOICE! For there is a new login screen that looks futuristic and streamlined! Fall to your knees and pay homage to this ... this ... well, whatever the hell it is.<br />

Thank you. I feel much better now. Pudding, anyone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it does look nice.  After seeing Call of Heroes at a friends house this weekend I was reminded how 'tired' looking EQ can be.<br />
<br />
Not saying that fixes everything/anything. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I heard it broke EQW. Im afraid to download it seeing how eqwindows.com is not working right now and I cant stand native EQ windowed mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Apparently they intend to retain the EQ playerbase by offering good deals on dual accounts. I would strongly suspect they'll re-inforce this by sharing the same log in structure for both games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, it 100% prevents EQW from working, last I heard.<br />
<br />
It looks nice, but, y'know, I'm one of those guys who occasionally runs the tutorial to get a reminder of how the game used to look. I'll tell ya, I kinda miss the Kunark era design of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The most interesting thing I noticed with the new login is...<br />
<br />
They switched the positions of the &quot;Don't Order Omens&quot; and &quot;Order Omens Now&quot; buttons.  Originally, &quot;Later&quot; was on the right, with &quot;Order Omens&quot; on the left.  Now, &quot;Skip&quot; is on the left, with &quot;Order&quot; on the right.<br />
<br />
Am I Mr. Conspiracy Theory or are they trying to catch people?  Cuz I had gotten so used to clicking the right hand button every time it asked me EVERY PLAY SESSION, that I almost accidentally hit the button to Order Omens. <br />
<br />
Those sneaky devils!  Hehehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
www.eqwindows.com (http://www.eqwindows.com/)  is back and has been for a week or so. I'm sure JustSomeDude will fix EQW once this goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always thought that on Login it would have been good to inform people when servers are down and how long they are down. So when I read this post, I half heartedly thought they might have added this, oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well it didnt break EQW totaly, just cant seem to use my mouse, unless others are having worse issues. I doubt this will take long to fix.<br />
<br />
I dunno i think it looks good, the old one was getting tired, plus i always notice that i can exit the game considerably faster, which is a good thing. Though i never go past the log in screen anymore :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only good thing about the new log in is they *finally* put a &quot;log directly into the freakin same server you've been logging into for 4 years without having to go choose it&quot; button.<br />

Other than that, I think it's kinda ugly.</div></div><hr />

That is a dead link when I click on it. Are you sure its back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does it still require you to sit there for 5 minutes while it checks to see if it needs to upgrade any files, despite you having done just that several times already after crashing while zoning?</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: well they do have a site up now I guess.  It's just http://eqwindows.com isn't linked to www.eqwindows.com</div></div><hr />

None are working for me, might be flooded, im sure everyone and their mother is looking for a eqw update and if its been released, you know everyone is getting it.</div></div><hr />

         Ugly is a bit weak to describe the new login</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was zoning from EW to GD and it crashed me, then EQwindows won't work.  Sneaky bastards.  I also noticed the buy Omen button was switched....</div></div><hr />

I couldn't log in, so I clicked the button to view my account. It spawned a web browser for eqlive and I logged into that successfully. So, I went back to EQ and tried, and tried...... eventually I had to change the password (back to what I had just logged into EQ live with) and then it let me log into EQ.<br />
<br />
Now it says I don't have all the expansions that I own downloaded..... quite odd, but I'll humor it for another few minutes at least...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that could mean that one of your ini files got corrupted.  One of them keeps track of what you have and haven't seen before and if you are getting that warning for the first time now then something is wrong with the file that should have told it you had seen that already.<br />
<br />
Try moving your eqclient.ini file and letting it recreate it.  <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try adding HardwareTnL=FALSE to the file but I think that would effect later then what is happening to you.  <br />
<br />
I'm really not an expert on this stuff but I know that I couldn't get in at all until I added the hardware line to mine and that seemed to fix me.  And I once had a corrupted jenarie.ini file that made me crash every time I logged in that character but I could log in any other character fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, I'm still using eqw and haven't had a problem with it.  Not sure if you already downloaded the new screen if it will mess it up, but I just automatically pass the patch message screen, so my computer hasn't downloaded it yet, and I'm having no problems running eqw (unless you count that I can't get past natimbi without having EQclient crashes while 2 boxing.  Zoning into and out of natimbi does this everytime).</div></div><hr />

<br />
(as Bill Lumbergh) Yeah, I'm gonna have to go ahead and say that thaaaat didn't really work...yeah.<br />
<br />
I thought this new patch fuxxored EQW?  I might have to go back to using it and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">By the way, one good piece of news.... for those of you who thing the SoE splash page is taking too long, or the &quot;warning, gameplay might change as you encounter retards&quot; message...... you can click through them to the login screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">something is wrong with the file that should have told it you had seen that already.<br />
Anyone know what I might have to change in my EQclient.ini file so that EQ thinks I've already seen this seizure screen?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can usually keep doing it until they patch the game proper. I usually only run the patcher once after every patch, and bypass it every other time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You know what, they are improving a road near my house that everyone knows we really, really need.  Badly.<br />
<br />
And yet they still persist on working on roads elsewhere in the city, some of which are clearly not as needed as this one.  It's really annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and download the files from the link on the message...you get the old login screen and all works good.<br />
<br />
<br />
and just incase there are people that still don't know...make shortcut and past this as the target(make sure its the right dir)<br />
