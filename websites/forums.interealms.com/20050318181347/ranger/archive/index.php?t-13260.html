Everyone else i speak to has SoT already as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raenewae</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its all just due to a poor random number generator.<br />
<br />
I've turned in 3 parchment,  recivied 2 call of the rathe, and 1 SoT.<br />
<br />
You have a 50/50 chance of getting either when you turn in a E. Parchment.  As CoR and SoT are the only 2 spells we get in levels 61/62 that are not hand me downs from another class / expansion.<br />
<br />
Thank god they fixed it so that you cant get those spell, is all I can say.</div></div><hr />

Other rangers in the guild also got multiple CoR before finally getting their SoT scrolls.</div></div><hr />

You really should be able to turn the spell back in for another one.</div></div><hr />

I've turned in 8 spectrals i think, 4 copies of er and 4 or sop.  Got lucky and swapped a copy of sop for somebody's extra frozen wind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i turned 1 in pre change and got CoR (figured i'd risk it and i might get lucky)<br />
<br />
Next day i won another parchment (after the change) and got SoT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabine</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 parchments, 4 copies of Strength of Tunare.<br />
<br />
My math says the chances of that happening are about 6%.<br />
<br />
I think I am giving up on burning more parchments for Call of Rathe - it is a spell that I will never cast on myself, and I get only about 3 people per raid wanting CoE as it is today.<br />
<br />
I think etherial parchments are better spent at the druid spell trade person for a shot at our new root spell.  I think the extra druid spells we get trying will be easier to find homes for than a zillion copies of Strength of Tunare.<br />
<br />
If you are on Terris, and have the reverse problem and have lots of CoR, and need SoT, look me and/or Silvan up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astroshak</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try casting Identify on the parchments.  According to someone in my guild, who got his info from some unspecified mesage boards, casting identify gives some clues as to what spells you get from that vendor.  If you are recieving many a CotR or SoT, try handing them in to a different vendor, or having identify cast on the parchments.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten any parchemnts yet, or I'd try this myself; but its worth a shot . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvanoshi</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/Cheer, on 4th Scroll i was rewarded CoR.  I may not be working to fast for levels since i still need EQ and AM 3, but once i get 62 ill be ready to buff.  Like Sabine said, if you need SoT look me up.  Would really love to trade for a spell i dont have, but we can work out something different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me, since rangers only get 2 spells from ethereal, isn't it a waste to keep handing in parchments to the pathfinders? Pretty soon there is going to be a surplas of SoT and CoR while the other classes who get 10+ spells between level 61 and 62 are still going to be short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jhodin</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers don't want to have to wait any longer for their first two spells than any other class does.  If everyone had that mindset there definately would not be any great excess of ranger spells in the bazaar for purchase.  Our getting all of our spells faster is simply a product of our having fewer spells.</div></div><hr />

/who all ranger 61 65<br />
<br />
/t Random_Ranger_01 Heyas. I got an extra copy of SoT. Might you have an extra copy of Call of Rathe you'd trade?<br />
<br />
Random_Ranger_01 tells you 'Ill be in PoK in 2 minutes.'<br />
<br />
This isnt that hard, people.</div></div><hr />

   I dont get here often but I could use SoT if you have a spare copy I am even willing to buy it from you.  See you guys in game.  By the way look me up so I can get a few guild groups my luck has been pretty bad latly so I been holing up in seb to build them aa's up.  I still have to do trial but wanted to get EQ first.</div></div><hr />
