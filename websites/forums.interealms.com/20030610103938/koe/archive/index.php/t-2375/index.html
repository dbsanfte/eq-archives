<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of you newer players in KotE may not know me.  It is also likely you have heard a lot of negative things about me.  Allow me to introduce myself to those in KotE who do not know who I am.  I am the Guildleader of The Corps.  I am a paranoid asshole with a nasty temper.  I hold grudges longer than most anyone on the server and I don't like people outside my own guild being anywhere near our raids.   That said, I am also honest (to the point that it gets me in trouble) and will fight for my friends rights to enjoy this game to the bitter end.  I also consider myself to be a fair and honorable player, never stealing another's camp or gimping another's raid.  For all my well earned negative reputation, I do bust ass for my friends and treat my enemies as fairly as I can.<br />
<br />
Ok enough beating my own drum.  Keepers of the Elements has alway been a guild that my guild and I have held in the highest reguard.  You have the same sense of honor that I do and the same sense of honesty, even posting your raid times publicly (which is something I am far too paranoid to do).  Unlike me, however, you are infinitely more diplomatic and friendly.  I have always been careful to never plan raids that might conflict with yours and busted my ass to make sure an atmosphere of total courtesy exists between us.  Whenever we have raided and a KotE member has asked to tag along they are treated like our own.  I do this out of sincere admiration for the guild you have created and the strong sense of honor and truth you instill into your players.  If the Corps ever went belly up, this is the first guild I would come running to to join.<br />
<br />
The reason I say all this, other than my tendancy to write huge posts, is that I want KotE to know that the Corps is at their disposal in the capacity of getting your next cleric epic.  Furthermore, I will personally support you in any way I can should you ever end up on the wrong side of CT again (and lets face it, thats probably inevitable) to the extent that I would halt a raid to come running to your aid.  For all intents and purposes, we will back you 100% on this issue, you have but to ask for our help.<br />
<br />
If anyone wishes to contact me reguarding this issue my email is below-<br />
phazael@excite.com<br />
<br />
I will also gladly provide my home phone number to some KotE officers if you feel that is pertinent.<br />

My dealings with the Corps, both on raids and with those who wear the tag has always been on a mutually respectful and honorable basis and I for one appreciate the relationship the two guilds have with each other..  <br />
<br />
Thanks again Jice and see you and the Corps around Norrath.. :)</div></div><hr />

I know Ralzion/Zamael and Mitzeypretty well and the times that they have let me tag along to meet some other members I have also found the Corps to be a skillfull bunch. Here's hoping that something good comes out of this CT mess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I think Jice is a complete asshole....<br />
<br />
Ok, well, Im just jealous that The Corps got my cleric... Evertorn ;)  Otherwise, truthfully, I am proud to know a guild like The Corps.. when I see someone with thier tag I know I can count on a competent player with a good sense of honor... <br />
<br />
And these dark days of Veeshan... how could you possibly ask for more?....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jice is many things.. honest to a fault.. he demands the best from his guild because that is what he gives to them.. i know many times in grouping with Jice that it is difficult for him to bite his tongue...but he does when in a KOE group.. my respect for that is great.  <br />
<br />
Yep, he has his own set of opinions. but he does his job remarkably well.  Thank you for your display of support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ive seen Jice's name... and I do know one member of the corps...<br />
<br />
But you know what really impressed me ... was Jice kinda just hanging out and visiting KoE with the Ixlblat raid.<br />
<br />
That is cool<br />
<br />
<br />
and the armor aint bad either...<br />
<br />
heheh<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only time I ever really had to bite my tongue was when you lept off the the bridge in KAel and brought 5+ giants back to us. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lept!!! i was pushed!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Jice are you in ToV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I saw two wurms and did a head count of surviving KotE and decided to back around a corner and FD.  Attempts to drag corpses kept agroing the wurms, so I popped a gate potion and called it a night.</div></div><hr />
