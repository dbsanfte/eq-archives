     On my server this zone is pretty much empty. 1 or 2 people in it if that. <br />
     Does anyone have any input? Has anyone hunted here? Any parchment drops? Any loot? Hows the exp? etc etc etc. <br />
     My normal grp doesnt want to do this from rumors. If I can get some positive feedback hoping to convince them to go there. <br />
<br />
    Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres a thread about this on the Safehouse,  some seem to say its too hard too be worth the exp, and some say its not very good exp but its fun becuase its harder.  <br />
<br />
They mention something about mobs actually hitting faster when slowed, because of a slow cap and screwed up rounding or something.  <br />
<br />
They said giants are best for exp, but they hit hard (900) and fast....had some drops i believe.  They are 60+<br />
<br />
Thats what i remember from the thread, alot of it was rumorish also, but it seemed mainly ifyou want great exp this is not the place to be, if you want  a zone to yourself and a challenge then this is the place for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are many animal type looking mobs here, who con dubious to rangers, and assist each other if agroed.  No faction hits though that I have seen.  Did not try fear as PoP mobs hit bit hard imo to fear kite with our wimpy 20 sec resisted fear.  I prefer to shoot arrows.<br />
<br />
The Norrathians stranded here are quest givers I assume, but you need to build faction.  There are giants about as well, who are kos to you.<br />

The mobs didnt have a load of hp and we were low on warriors/clerics at the time.  2nd boss we tried we got to 40% before our MT died (and only warrior) died and we whiped, so they are killable, just damn hard.</div></div><hr />

That one 2hander we can use would though. I just don't remember it's name.</div></div><hr />

He said there were only a couple things in the zone that he was KoS too, which was most likely the giants.  Everything else left him alone.  Not sure what his exact faction was, but definately not KoS.</div></div><hr />

The NPCs were amiable I believe but I didnt find any quests.  I did find a guy who told me a very long history lesson on the plane of storms though.  He talked about froglokss, giants and storms.  I highly reccommend going through the history of the place if you havent already.  It is a nice history lesson of the plane, something Verent doesnt do much of  =)  He was in the back of the tunnel, going to the zone out.  He had a name also, not just random_named_npc_08</div></div><hr />

I couldn't hunt with my guild in Growth because of faction, but Karana-ans can? I was under the assumption that all 'good' planes would have faction hits, with the excuse that evil gods don't give quests in their planes and actually encourage their followers to test their strength, or are at least indifferent to the idea.</div></div><hr />

If you hutn against your own goddess then you deserve the faction penalty.  If I was the designers if you strcuk tunare youd be stripped of your ability to cast to.</div></div><hr />

U are kos to them, but dubious to all the trees, frogs, snakes, flowers. they are all social though and assist each other. they do not assist though if you fight giants. Giants give fraction hits. U lose their giant factoin and gain factions with the shipwrecked people. Theres a quest with one guy in cave which involves killing giants....try it out urself...</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have been saying that about EQ ever since I started playing.  DSP sat empty for months before someone said &quot;Hey!  This is good XP.&quot;  Now the zone is jammed pack often enought.  I'm not making fun of you, or belittleling you, it's just an observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my only question is do the giants and other mobs  summon? and how many HP they have? PoV is so overcrowded on my server its not uncommon to have over 100 people there for hours on end and theres just not enough mobs to support it so i been lookign for a new spot. how would these giants compare to the golems or fungus beasts in the cave in PoV?<br />

PoS is more fun and exp is excellent, though bit harder (not counting trians in PoV though). also thee are excellent exp area in other planes but not so easily available as yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverbrain</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got flagged the other night, and headed off with my group that stayed on (ench, clr, dru and me (rng)) and hit up PoV for a bit, see what was there.  Then headed over to storms.  The zone in was clear of any real people.  a list of folks in the zone showed 2 of the elite guilds on inny (AV and LoD) were killing in the zone.  We walked around a bit, talked to some npc's and eventually left.  PoV was our spot, picked up a rogue and war and went quite a ways out (could find it if you paid me) The mobs there hit me max 584 (yard trash) some enraged, none higher then lvl 62 though.  The exp was exceptional, 1.5% - 2% aa per kill.  PoS imo is not a pickup type place, its raid based.  PoV on the other hand seems to be a pickup spot for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The frogs in the forest near the bees are KOS to me, though all the other frogs are only Dubious.  Those particular frogs can be mez'd though, as well as slowed, snared and rooted and they dont summon, though they hit for 600.<br />
<br />
The Bees have a faction, but I started out KOS to them anyway, and haven't seen a way to raise it.  They do however have some very nice random drops (RGB v2 and a nice cloak with a cold DD mod).<br />
<br />
The forest giants seem to proc a mana tap on hits, which makes tanking them a serious pain for hybrids.  They were also slow bugged when I last fought them, so anything more than 40% slow had the opposite effect.  Hamonry works on all the mobs in this area easily.<br />
<br />
The giants on the coast seem to be weaker than the ones in the forest, but their &quot;village&quot; area has some just stupid pathing issues.  We single group cleared most of it, but wiped when we gave Pergeus the Strong a go with 6 (cleric, shaman, ranger, warrior, monk, mage), though we got him to about 30%.  We came back with 12 and demolished him.<br />
<br />
Also, fighting on the coast, we did have the trees assist the giants against some of the group members.  Pulling the giant past the tree would switch the tree from Dubious to Threat.<br />
<br />
I tried to solo one of the fish near the mouth of a river my first day there while waiting for others to arrive.  It hit for 358, double attack, and thought it wasn't super high in HP, it was a bit more than I could handle with pure melee and no slow (EC wouldnt proc).  Fortunately, it didnt summon when I left the water and got a COH to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet played around in the desert very much.<br />
<br />
And lastely, there seems to be an event that causes absurd amounts of undead to spawn in the zone, all KOS and See invis.  We went in the other day for some experience and I had well over 90 of them on track.  They were in groups of 10+ running around killing anyone that got into aggro range (which was huge).  We killed a few, but it wasn't worth the risk of the huge trains and social aggro from everythign else in there.  It basically cleared the zone for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ralence</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed some odd things in Storms in the last week or so.<br />
<br />
  First trip, we were killing the giants, and I had ridiculous amounts of resists.  Of course, with new harmony, resist=aggro, so it caused quite a few problems in our monk-less group, not to mention large amounts of ranger deaths.<br />
<br />
  The giants we did kill weren't that hard, but the real problem is, the exp wasn't that good.  Toss in the /real/ long respawn time, and it really wasn't worth the effort.<br />
<br />
  The also seem to corpse camp, it's possible the ones we were killing were just bugged, but after our last wipe, we waited at GY for corpses (20 minutes), and then ran past where we were to get to another area, and the giant that killed us was /still/ in the same spot, it was at least 45 minutes, and he hadn't reset.<br />
<br />
  I went back a few nights ago and did the frogs near the tornado, they weren't that bad, but again, exp wasn't as good as PoV, and respawn was 1hour +, so we had to resort to going back to the cactii, scorpions, and armadillos in the desert.<br />
<br />
  So far, I agree with what's been said, PoV seems to be the exp area, and PoS is geared solely for raids.</div></div><hr />
