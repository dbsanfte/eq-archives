<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">since last weeks patch i lost a few audio sounds attached to spell casting<br />
<br />
in todays patch they are all flopped around <br />
<br />
<br />
when i cast cannibalize i get the the sound of casting dots <br />
<br />
when i cast dots .. i get the healing spell sounds <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and on top of all that ... <br />
hmm let me  try to explain it .. <br />
i guess you call it a microphone that picks up the sounds from ingame .. normaly its in a fixed postion where your player is <br />
<br />
now the microphone is attached to where the camera is <br />
so if your swing wide in 3rd person view .. you hear whats near the camera .. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i think george lucas said &quot;sound is 51%&quot; <br />
<br />
well i just lost 51%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Me too Ceno - this is the first I've seen it discussed though.  The good news is, my Canni cast went silent. :)  That alone was enough to prevent me from posting a bug back to Verant.  Unfortunately my heals also dropped sound.  Only my buff casts were still audible.  But if you're saying the rest of the spell sounds are messed up now too, maybe it's time for a fix (haven't been back online since the patch).<br />
<br />
Krup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have the problem too, though like Krup I've been torn about whether to /bug it or not.  I hate having to hear my canni non-stop but at the same time I WOULD like to hear the other spells /shrug.  I don't know, some day I may /bug it but for now I'm just enjoying the silence.  Maybe when I get canni 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same thing has been happening to me. Notice the new music too? Too bad for me it just keeps playing and playing and playing, even after the load screen, when I'm actually playing. Had to turn the music sound off. :(<br />
<br />
Also, I seem to get kicked to my desktop whenever I camp. Anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't got PoP yet, but I did notice that the file EQTheme.MP3 was being downloaded, so I re-enabled the sound. <br />
<br />
I found that for me it's now working properly without any glitches or stuttering. :D <br />
<br />
The theme plays right through until you enter a zone with it's own background music. I forgot how good some of the tunes were (especially for Midi files) The new MP3 version though is really good. <br />
<br />
What's the PoP MP3 like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">bah manks are blonde *grin*<br />
<br />
go look in the grey part u can download the mp3 files<br />
<br />
most are definate background music.  not as good as the soundtracks for m&amp;m VI.    hmmm vrant should give us an ingame mp3 player LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you look at that post in The Grey you'll see I had downloaded the files after I posted this you dumb ogre! (2 above yours)<br />
<br />
The new music is really good much better than the previous stuff.</div></div><hr />
