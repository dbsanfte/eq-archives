<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok ready any time now. My ac is really around 950-960 self buffed btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's really pretty good gear, actually.  Kinda hard to give up 20 wis when you're at 191, but an iksar bp might be a good idea (or at least try it).  Other than that, i'd say that getting ss/thurg mq legs would be the best upgrade for you right now.  Maybe an ss bracer, too.  Same with your arms, if you can find an mq to buy. But thurg/ss legs alone would boost your mana pool by about 150, along with better ac and some hps.  Oh, and maybe your helm, might want a slime covered rubicite coif.  Most of my suggestions are for hp gear, obvioulsy, if thats what you want to work for.</div></div><hr />

YOu don't need regen 58+ just use kraggs and canni 4. And your 2 lvls from it ( very fast if you know where to hunt)</div></div><hr />
