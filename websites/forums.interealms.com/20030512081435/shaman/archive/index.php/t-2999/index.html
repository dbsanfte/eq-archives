Thanks for any advise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'm not a high lvl shaman and most of your stuffs are a lot better than mine.<br />
<br />
But reading posts here, I think you can still swap in some cheap stuffs up there like Black Sapphire Electrum earrings, Vah Shir Claws Earrings, Crystalline Spider Eyes, 6ac 65hp ring, Obulus shroud, Elder Wolf Hide, Tattered Mantle, Coldain Skin Gloves.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you wouldn't survive Cannibalize V.</div></div><hr />

Face, Mask of War, Or Golem's Jawbone<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians AC: 12 CHA: +5  WIS: +2  INT: +2  HP: +35  MANA: +35  SV DISEASE: +6  SV POISON: +6 of elusians in umbral planes.<br />
Tae Ew Ritualists Mask AC: 6 CHA: +7  WIS: +7  INT: +7  HP: +40 MANA: +45 Effect: Invisibility (Casting Time: 5.0) Out of Cazic <br />
<br />
Neck, No clue<br />
<br />
One of the ww talisman or a beaded slime necklace from CT<br />
<br />
Ears, No clue<br />
<br />
If you like quests and trade skills go with a earing of the solstice for one ear and the sanctum guardians earring for the other. <br />
Earring of the Solstice AC: 5 STA: +5  WIS: +8  INT: +8  HP: +55 MANA: +55  SV FIRE: +5  SV COLD: +5  SV MAGIC: +5  Effect: Flowing Thought I (Worn)<br />
<br />
Sanctum Guardian's Earring AC: 5 STR: +10  STA: +10  CHA: +10  HP: +50  MANA: +80  SV DISEASE: +15  SV POISON: +15<br />
 <br />
You can buy the parts for the earring of solstice but you actually have to be a master smith for the sanctum guardians.<br />
<br />
Runed Earring of Veracity AC: 6 STR: +6  STA: +6  WIS: +6  INT: +6  HP: +20  MANA: +20  Effect: See Invisible (Worn)<br />
That should be with in your reach altho the later ones probably aren't.<br />
<br />
Raptor Tooth Bauble Slot: EAR  FINGERS  AC: 2 STA: +10  CHA: +3  WIS: +10  HP: +45  MANA: +45  SV DISEASE: +12  Effect: Counteract Poison (Must Equip. Casting Time: 1.5)<br />
Nice piece from ct.<br />
<br />
Earring of Pain AC: 6 STA: +10  WIS: +5  INT: +5  HP: +35  SV DISEASE: +5  SV MAGIC: +5  SV POISON: +5 <br />
Another nice CT earring<br />
<br />

Shoulder, Death Watchers Shroud <br />
Ranged, Finish the 8th crudgel<br />

Nice things to have till you can get solstice / ct ears.  6/65 ring to replace that wis one.  Death mask of elysians is nice too, 12 ac 35hp/mana.<br />
Anything to replace that shawl =)</div></div><hr />

Boot: Vindi Boot<br />
Ear: Ivandryls Hoop (if youre not barbarian)<br />

Ring1: 6ac 65hp ring<br />

These are some things I prefer, certainly not saying they are the best, but if your guild will/can tackle NToV than all more easily attainable.<br />
