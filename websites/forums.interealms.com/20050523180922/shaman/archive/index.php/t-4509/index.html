<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting a serious case of the soloing blues from soloing blues.<br />
<br />
Sure the Grim caves are great exp at 41 and GREAT loot. (shhhh dont tell anyone)<br />
<br />
But I am in serious need of some grouping action. Every Dungeons I go to these days is sparse and HARD as hell to find a pickup group in. <br />
<br />
So Im thinking of going from the TENE MTNS, to the City of mist, but i just KNOW there will be 4 people there and I will have wasted a trip.<br />
<br />
So what the hell are the popular dungeons these days for the 42 level range?<br />
<br />
I am so lonely (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe try SOLB or Lower Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I DID!!!<br />
<br />
And there were 3 level 60 people in EACH, I swear they were the same 3 people too.<br />
<br />
FARMERS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Popular?  Karnor's Castle.  Always people in there.  At least on Karana.  CoM is usually BYoG on Karana as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can usually find a group in /gu.  I spent most of my low 40s at Tene Mtns, with the occasional foray into Dawnshroud Peaks for groupage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">at 41..dreadlands is kind of the place for pickup grouping....but the exp is crummy, the loot is crummy, and the groups are crummy.<br />
<br />
most dungeons are bring your own group, i think if you really wanna group you're headed for an outdoor zone, unless you can grab some friends and take em to any of the above mentioned zones.  At 41 I brought a 41 monk friend with me to sol B, and we did a level a day there off the pool area to abou 47 or so - was lots of fun.</div></div><hr />
