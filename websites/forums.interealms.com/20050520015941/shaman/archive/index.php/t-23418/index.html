<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's another DPS idea that's a new spell line that I thought might work to aliviate problems:<br />
<br />
summonable pets that only last a predetermined number of minutes more than 3, but not more than 15.  Each pet would be the spirit of a warder and have a differing function.  Each of these &quot;timed&quot; pets would have a component of a meat part from that animal (most meat can be bought from vendors now)<br />
<br />
Level 45 Summon: Wolf Spirit<br />
            Summons a rogue wolf with approx 750 hps and deals approx 20 dps<br />
Mana cost (depending on how long it lasts) about the same as pet<br />
<br />
Level 50 Summon: Chokdai Spirit (or Scaled Wolf Spirit, but chokdai is more what they look like)<br />
             Summons a ranger chokdai with approx 800 hps and deals approx 25 dps, casts snare<br />
<br />
             Summon: Aligator Spirit<br />
             Summons a Paladin Aligator with approx 800 hps and deals approx 25 dps, casts stun<br />
<br />
             Summon: Tiger Spirit<br />
             Summons an SK Tiger with approx 800 hps and deals approx 25 dps, casts cripple (or something like that)<br />
<br />
Level 55 Summon: Bear Spirit<br />
             Summons a warrior bear with approx 3K hps, 1000 AC and deals approx 30dps, taunts (well)<br />
<br />
Level 60 Summon: Spirit of the Great Wolf<br />
            Summons a great Rogue with approx 1.2K hps and deals approx 60 dps<br />
<br />
Level 65 Summon: Spirit of the Great Aligator<br />
            Summons a great Paladin Aligator with approx 1.5k hps and deals approx 40 dps, casts a stun<br />
<br />
             Summon: Spirit of the Great Chokdai<br />
             Summons a great Ranger Chokdai with approx 1.5k hps and deals approx 40 dps, casts a snare<br />
<br />
             Summon: Spirit of the Great Tiger<br />
             summons a great SK Tiger with approx 1.5k hps and deals approx 40 dps, casts cripple (or a Debuff like it)<br />
<br />
Level 70 Summon: Spirit of the Great Bear<br />
            summons a great warrior bear spirit with approx 5k hps 1200 AC and deals approx 30 dps and taunts (well)<br />
<br />
Level 50 Summon: Essence of the Spirit Realm<br />
            summons a spirit hammer<br />
            30/70 1HB Magic Damage: +5 no rent<br />
<br />
Each pet when summoned would cast an insta spell buff called &quot;Materialization&quot; or something like that, that spell would wear off 1 min before it was about to poof with a wears off message like &quot;So-and-sos spirit begins to wane&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not an elemental player, I'm - I guess - pre elemental.  But I do see the disparity with Shaman and other classes desireability in groups (hence why a 7 months ago I was never lfg cause everyone wanted me, and now I have to go try and get my self killed solo in hard to get to locations in order to not be bored) But because I'm not in the upper crux of shamanism I'm not sure how best to tune these spells, but I think you get the jist of them.  These would be better than normal DoTs for 2 reasons, first is they could go from mob to mob in a fast pull group, doing their damage across multiple MoBs. The other reason is of course the ultility.  They have a vulnerability that DoTs don't have, and that's that they can be killed, thus wasting mana.  I want the Bear pet to not replace a tank so I dunno where to put its stats, but I do think it should be able to taunt semi ok (ie get something off us after a slow with a taunt or two) Lemme know what you think of this and http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23370 maybe one of the devs will pick something like these up.<br />
<br />
Thanks for considering my ramblings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) the timer already gimps the pet, but the HP means they won't last that long<br />
2) I got to about level 50 in your description and thought I was looking at altered mage pets <br />
3) If you want to flush out the idea make the highest level one cast/proc malo or slow.<br />
4) with the low HP the casters resists become much more important (as a pet shares it's owners resists) A single ice comet could take out the pet (up to 65) otherwise<br />
5) Short duration pet - probably has a longish recast time, meaning we need to keep it up all the time if we would use it.  As is, it's not worth it.<br />
6) the level 70 spell should make a BL our short duration pet complete with his own warder  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">interesting idea, but are these with our other pet already out too? or just 1 at a time? there would need to be some big difference between these and our normal pet to make it worth it (ie bigger damage less hp , or a pretty reasonable tank type but no dps.) it could be replace our desease dots, it would basically be a graphic dot that last the full 3 mins say but could move target which is a good idea for fixing dots. but might be abit hard to pull off, you can obviusly have more than one pet, so it could be possible to could it like spirit call but work on your normal pet comand?<br />
<br />
personally an idea i like is to change rabid bear and bear form. Make bearform a kinda of rabid bear, so get double attack attack perhap a % to mellee skills, of coure lower amounts for the lowest one like 50 double attack 30 att, 3% to melle. going up to astral bear form (oow) at 200 double attack, 150 att, 20% skills. sort of thing, it be a high mana, short length (possible fa like).<br />
<br />
then make the rabid bear aa a summon beserker pet, this would have the same dps hp of a dc pet, but you need a spirit essence (spirit stone?) no drop no rent lore. that only drops from animal that can be dc`ed. Shaman get a ok pet  but hvae the same trouble a druid would have to get it.  with an enhanced version for OOW equal to new dc levels.<br />
<br />
thats my hope anyway.</div></div><hr />
