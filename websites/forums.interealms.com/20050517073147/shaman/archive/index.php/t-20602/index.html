<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ran into this on the monk board.<br />
Never thought of it seems like a decent idea, bards get a 50% slow. Althought it also seems like it could turn into a FA curse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, it's kinda funny to read the bards coming over to the monk board to post, angry at the idea that someone is suggesting that one of their abilities be pimped out.  Very ironic; monks, who got their primary ability (pulling) pimped out to bards in PoP, are suggesting that one of the many exclusive bard abilities (overhaste) gets pimped out to shamans, who have had damn near EVERYTHING pimped out to someone or someTHING else (avatar or equivalent -&gt; primals/prismatics/beastlords, heal over time -&gt; clerics, str/sta/dex buffing -&gt; beastlords, etc..).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting Idea, but I do kinda see where bards might get touchy if it was some MGB that approached thier %.  <br />
<br />
I kinda got a kick out of  the monks asking for some 'innate monk' buff that a group would get if a monk was in thier group. Personally, I've thought that our old Frenzy line might be a fun one to make into a group buff if some attk and haste , maybe more skill points (like a 50pt boost to double attack) was added. I used to kinda like that line back when I was little and it sucked out all our mana but let us regen quick, haven't used it much since. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still find it funny to see posts from people who have no clue as to how a shaman works, or the inherit downside to some of the proposed and already implemented boosts to other classes. I almost wish for the game to go back to Kunark era, when we were gods hehe. Gods who couldn't get their spells to drop of course, but man we were definately a must have class back then.<br />
<br />
Edit: dont mean anyone here, meant some of the posters on the monk post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the idea of giving shamans a 10-15% overhaste. Either a new buff (but please not another single target, long recast buff). If making it a single target, long recast thing is considered essential to prevent it being overpowered, add it to FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well lets see. Overhaste might be nice to let us stack with a enchanter better. But the idea of yet another single target haste that lasts for 15 min with minimal gain ( 15% is not alot ) really turns me off. Now if its a group haste along the lines of ToA with a 30 min timer, then we are talking a lil more excitment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Group overhaste would not fix our problems and would give us a little to MGB on raids while stealing a third of the bards' role. Does not look good to me.<br />
<br />
We need a big improvement in healing, some way to deal damage on things that die in under a minute, the same buff improvements everyone else got and something to do on raids (improved healing will already help here).<br />
<br />
None of this requires making another class stack worse then it does at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'ld give up the STR and AGI components on FA for an overhaste. As long as it didn't stop the bard overhaste from landing, that is.<br />
<br />
Or just replace the old Velious 'Spirit Quickening'. Utterly useless spell (even during Velious), after all... who's going to use a 20%, pet only haste on their pet at 50 when they got a 40% haste at 44 that last nearly twice as long?<br />
<br />
Remove the target restriction on SQ, make the duration at least 30 minutes, remove the STR and AC buffs, keep it single target and change the haste component to a 15% overhaste (scaiing to 20% at 65). Then replace the Luclin's Acumen of Dar Khura with a group version of that overhaste that last an hour.<br />
<br />
That wouldn't even be adding NEW spell... just fixing ones that were freaking useless from the very second they were implemented. And the bards still would have a more powerful version available for those grouped with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Better still, change the effect of call of the ancients to be overhaste instead of a lame regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tarhug has something there. As is, the Ward has little practical use as long as the melee disciplines are limited both by timers AND endurance... Turning it into an overhaste instead of an endurance regen would kill 2 birds with one stone by fixing a useless aa at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As long as we are daydreaming: I would love a ward that increases poison damage or DoT damage for everyone in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wuwu, the drive to take a once-proud debuffing and damage dealing class and castrate them into botted buffwhores continues.</div></div><hr />

WoW. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bards have absolutely no reason to whine. Anyone whoes ever seen them swarm kite 10-15 mobs at once or every single guild on his server trying to recruit more bards knows that one little ability of thiers isn't gonna change the way they play or thier desirability. More haste would be good, but its hardly a bone big enough to get excited about or to whine about either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SOE and to an extent VI before them have no creativity.<br />
<br />
Here's how I would view the 3 primary healing classes:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
*Weakest of the healers but most offensive in the damage department through a combination of melee and spells.  This compliments their stat buffs ability and the lore behind the class.  Their ace in their hand is slow.  Second best tanks next to clerics.<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
*Second best healers and second best damage dealers behind shaman.  There damage coming completely from spells.  They do with snare what shaman do with slow--mitigate/avoid damage.  Weakest tanks by far using fig leafs to protect themselves.....<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
*undisputed healers in all areas.  Weakest of the damage dealers, except against undead where they are the strongest or at least equal to shaman.  Best tanks of the bunch, being able to take damage more readily due to being a plate class.<br />
<br />
When I think of a shaman I think of one mean SOB when riled that can, take his club and beat the hell out of you, while cursing your sorry ass to hell.  Unfortunately that isn't the case.</div></div><hr />

I really want to be nice to you.... But, sorry you are clueless. <br />

FYI I am ALL for nerfing charm kiting. AE kiting is already fixed and does not work.</div></div><hr />
