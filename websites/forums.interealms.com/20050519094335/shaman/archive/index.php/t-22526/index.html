<br />
go to the bazaar<br />
<br />
down to the arena part<br />
<br />
shout about how uber you are<br />
<br />
and then come back and tell me how long you live.<br />
<br />
self buffed<br />
<br />
use all of those uber resist spells we have.<br />
<br />
try and see if you get that epic dot off.<br />
<br />
tell us what they think of dog dog.<br />
<br />
use your AAs.  VP will probably be resisted.  Spirit Call will be out run till it wears off.<br />
<br />
try it against anyone.  any class.<br />
<br />
use the alchemy.  put up the DS<br />
<br />
heck, ambush em.<br />
<br />
but more than i want people to try and detirmine the hate generated by DoTs, i want more shaman to try this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pardon.  did i say anything about class balance?<br />
<br />
did i even use the term PvP?<br />
<br />
homie, let me be the first to tell you arena play is not PvP.  not even close.<br />
<br />
duels are not PvP.<br />
<br />
learn that please.<br />
<br />
complacent shaman have often thought that it was either poor preparation, or ebayers, or lack of skill or god only knows what; that had their brothers dying.<br />
<br />
it is not.  it is because the shaman class is gimped by Sony.<br />
<br />
and next time you wish to put words in my mouth that i never use, be sure to give me the neg rep bump first.  because yours is incoming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How does a duel proves our class is broken when this game wasn't really designed to duel all the way.<br />
<br />
You are right, in pvp (or duel same for me tbh) resists are the devil.  But the environment we fight against is not THAT resistant as PC's.<br />
<br />
I am not the one saying there is nothing wrong with our class but you can't proove that with duel facts... ( unless you play on pvp server then you got a point about your gameplay)<br />
<br />
Just my 2 copper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, i disagree.<br />
<br />
the arena measures us, and defines the boundries of our abilities.<br />
<br />
at 65 we have gone 15 lvls without a melee upgrade. (soon to be 20 lvls)<br />
<br />
our interupted spells, (while ogres have a very small advantage, see how many spells you get off), and then tell me mobs are not going to more interupted spells.<br />
<br />
quick fights.  think about it.  if mobs have lower hit points, but do more damage; do you think root rot is going to be a viable experience path with Sony in the future?  NO, root will break, the mob will run faster than sow (or faster), and you will be doing CR.  Regardless of the damage spells you cast.<br />
<br />
our pets are a joke.  and i think we only get the upgrades thru a limited use AA.  limited, as in not a constant use; spirit call.  sure our pets can interupt spells in trivial content, but in non trivial they are worthless.  the speed bump is no long to let you get composure, it is so you can gate or run to the zone line.<br />
<br />
do what i asked, go to the arena.  then report.  <br />
<br />
even if you die (often) but are happy with your performance; report that</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You tell us to go to the arena to &quot;see how long you live&quot; against other classes.<br />
<br />
Hyena Shaman says &quot;Because PvP is the measure of class balance, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You slam that post, saying nothing you said was about class balance, you weren't using PVP to measure anything, heck, you didn't even use the word PVP.  Umm, arena is player versus player btw, may not be the type of PVP where you can get attacked at any time, but it's still PVP, by definition.  Asking shaman to go against anyone, meaning any other class is also, in my opinion, asking us to see how the shaman class compares to others. Aka, class balance.<br />
<br />
Then, just two posts later, you disagree with someone else and say &quot;Well, I disagree... the arena measures us&quot;.  If you are going to be belligerent, at least make up your foolish mind.  Also, go read about the rep system, how it works, and probably more importantly, think about how many people care about it, and what a ridiculous empty threat that was.<br />
<br />
Regardless, yes, shaman have their problems, it's not just how a shaman is played.  Yes, there are fundamental problems, we've been left behind for quite a while, and that's about as far as I agree with you.   The rest of your post is pure drivel, typed out with no other intent than to incite.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, I can USUALLY stick VP on someone with high Disease resist if I Mal Decay them. I used to do it all the time on Fire Birdies. We are talking the MA here, who gets charmed and charges the clerics, heh. stuck it 5 of 6 times on one guy who was over 300 DR buffed. <br />
<br />
I am not much of a dueler on my Shaman. I used to duel some on my Paladin, but it usually wasnt fair. Back in those days, Pallys owned the Duel world, especially if you did Soulfire over and over to get 5 more charges of insta-CH. Had one mouthy dorf cleric tell me he could whuup my ass, but when his roots didnt stick, he was toast, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can pretty much kill anyone but a bard.  I've dueled all casters (necros are most annoying) and they can't beat me.  I've dueled all melees and they can't defeat me.  I've dueled all hybrids (SKs agreed not to use HT) and killed all but bards.  Druids are weak.  Clerics are a pain, but I can outlast them generally and kill them after a long time.<br />
<br />
I am over 7300hp self buffed though with over 300 in each resist.  When I walk into the arena, people usually back out through the gates.  They find it disheartening to get me down to 50-60% health only to have me cast a HoT and heal it all back while I run around for a minute.<br />
<br />
Dueling is not about skill or which class you are (other than being a bard).  Dueling is all about gear.  Let me repeat that.  Dueling is all about gear.  Healing classes have a distinct advantage though, since you can repair the damage done to you.  If you have terrible gear and terrible resists, then you can't beat someone who is better geared.  You do have a chance against those with a similar level of gear though.  Using pets and rabid bear at the right times can work to your advantage though.<br />
<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, they did put in the new PVP changes for spells last patch, so maybe bards will fall before me now.  Maybe the dynamic of PVP will change some.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Everquest was designed around an intricate mesh of classes that covered gaps in eachothers strengths in order to combat MONSTERS.<br />
<br />
In order for PvP to be balanced in Everquest's web of intermeshing classes (at least as they were back in classic before SoE screwed with em and landed aliens on our butts), it would have to be performed on a large scale of at least one person of each class versus an equally leveled, equally equipped group of the same classes.<br />
<br />
One on one is in no way a measure of class value.  Certain classes are better for DPS, where some classes are support.  No way is a DPS class gonna lose to a support class in a duel if both people are good.<br />
<br />
There's another point.  Very few people are good at PvP... why?  Because the game wasn't designed for it.  All the necros who get mad and say come duel me I'll shut you up, make me laugh.  Of course you will, your class is set in a way that gives distinct advantages over other classes in one on one Player vs Player combat.<br />
<br />
PvP on PvP servers is basically Everybody resists Everything, priests outheal your damage, and non shaman AA's kick your butt.<br />
<br />
I don't see why I should feel bad because I can't shout for people to come dogpile on me in the arena and, as a priest class, kill them all singlehandedly. <br />
<br />
You want to test your PvP skills, come with me in a time warp to pre-rep patch Ultima Online, or the first few months of Asheron's Darktide, or heck, even same-class mirror matches on Shadowbane.<br />
<br />
EQ is PvE.  Not PvP.</div></div><hr />

Haha I can beat you?  Is it the need to test your skills against something unpredictable?  What is it about dueling that turns you all on?  Not flaming or anything just don't understand.  I have never felt the need to duel and the only time I have dueled is when I wanted a free ride to my bind point when I was a younger shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gear is a large part of it sure. And in a fight the best geared person can win alot of the time. But again <br />
<br />
Gear doesnt = skill at playing. <br />
<br />
And I suck at Pvp. But they sucked more and thier class and Gear were not suited to kill a shaman.  <br />

My epic works fine.<br />
<br />
Dog dog does his job and then goes away. I expect it and use it to my advantage.<br />
<br />
RC and CannV are the AA's I find most useful. I don't have VP or Spirit Call and don't miss them much.<br />

I've killed mages, wizzies, rangers, sk's, pally's, warriors, druids whatever.<br />

I use the skills I have. I play smart. I survive while everyone else burns up their manna bars.<br />
<br />
Now I'm still not sure why my performance in the arena directly reflects my class balance. Seriously, I probably spend less than 1 percent of my time in EQ in PvP. The rest of it is where we should be evaluating my performance.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm not endgame. I know the problems are comming. I've stated in other threads that I can see the tip of that iceberg in ldon and my limited GoD experience. And as I've said before. I'll enjoy this ride while it lasts. When it's done, I'll wave goodbye to the nice person in the station and be on my way. I suggest you do the same Bonestomper, and if you've reached the end of your ride and it appears broke, get off. Don't just sit in the car and whine to the rest of the people in line that the ride sucks.</div></div><hr />

How can a duel not be PvP?  I thought it was &quot;Player vs Player&quot;, unless a duel is actually a player vs npc...<br />
it is not. it is because the shaman class is gimped by Sony.<br />
Gimped compared to what? Other classes? How can you say a class a gimp unless you have something to compare it to?  That's class balance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Do you even know what PvP stands for? From this statement I'm guessing no.<br />
<br />
He should probably clarify his definition of PVP to be something like &quot;Playing on a PVP server&quot; rather than just PVP since, obviously, a duel is technically PVP.<br />
<br />
However, a duel (or arena battle) is very much different than playing on a PVP server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i ran my first shaman to 40 on Vallon Zek when 50 was the limit.  Vallon had to many politics and game design issues, so when Sullon Zek came out i went there.<br />
<br />
ran the Sullon Zek shaman to 52, when 60 was the limit.<br />
<br />
moved to that wacky Pvp server they only had for a short time the whole time it was on.<br />
<br />
i will explain how duels are not PvP.<br />
<br />
first, and foremost; PvP is non consensual.  the other side does not have to ask, does not care if you are OOM, and you can't run 10 feet out of the PvP arena and be safe.  the best thing on a PvP server was to catch a guy in a fight against a mob, and maloXX him during the last blow, then root him and lay on the dots when he is already half dead and oom.  after that, if he does not say &quot;gg&quot;, you have to put him on ignore as he rants.<br />
<br />
second is preparation.  in the arena, you get the option of sitting in a nice safe spot and buffing to your hearts content.  in PvP you either try and keep everything up, or check the /who after every mob to see who is in the zone and might attempt to give you the dirt nap/.  more over, you have an idea of the class you are going to face.  on a PvP server, most people go anon just to hide what class they are.  and never show a guild tag when in hostile zones they are trying to cross.<br />
<br />
next is gear selection.  PvP servers do not wear the same gear as normal servers.  look over some magelos for idea.  heck, people changed gear (or bagged it) the second they saw potential PvP on pvp servers.  and kept a full set of gear in the bank if they saw a bad PvP CR coming up.<br />
<br />
now we will try and cover the &quot;skill&quot;.  PvP servers have &quot;jousting&quot;.  Jousting is best accomplished with a high damage, high delay weapon where instead of leaving the attack key on and tanking a slowed mob in the face while you channel spells.  instead you have to manually hit the attack button when your opponent is in range, and circle him (with the attack off) until it refreshes so you can get back in melee range and attempt to hit him again.<br />
<br />
then there is spell selection.  on the more ugly PvP servers (exp loss or perma death, or loot rules) shaman keep gate memmed.  you lose a spell slot constantly for an escape.  years ago, in the old world; shaman traveled with sow and that other movement spell that would terminate if attacked or attack when they were moving across the world (think the age of boats here)<br />
<br />
insta clickies.  a godsend on a PvP server against players that dispell.  heck, think Split Paw eyes even.  <br />
<br />
faction.  there is no faction in the arena.  all of the PvP servers had, at one time or another; faction issues for killing other players.  you had to pick your targets for where you wanted to go, and often times it screwed classes that needed lots of decent faction with many races(think Pally epic)<br />
<br />
there are a ton of differences.  i think it is still that shaman would shrink themselves and grow their pets so that against a throw or bow and arrow, they could keep the pet (normally snared against a ranger) between them and their opponent and have the pet eat the arrows due to line of site issues.<br />
<br />
then you had the issue of weither or not you would even spend the mana to cast a pet on a zone you were just trying to cross.  years ago the old world was huge, now in a couple of clicks you can go from Halas to Aka Anon in 5 min when it used to take 2 hours. (if the boats were even working)<br />
<br />
invis.  heck druids were nasty in pvp because they got invis so early and shaman did not get see invis until so late.  when you can't see someone, that gets the first shot off; they have a great chance of beating you.<br />
<br />
i think the analogy would be normal game is your today's polite biker.  arena game is your custom machine and PvP is your tatooed biker freaks.<br />
<br />
the biggest reason people play PvP is because of the constant rush of the possible unknown.  then many are people that like to beat something better than the a.i. of a suped up moss snake.  and a few people are the ones that want to ruin your gaming experience - repeatedly.<br />
<br />
but in relation to what i was saying.  there is a fun factor that is often considered on this board.  the arena was added to the game to be &quot;fun&quot;, when you are geared to long fights over time, fighting someone who is geared to burst DPS (especially when the whole game is going that way), it is not a fun experience.  on Prexus, the arena is where raiders seem to hang out before raids for a few min.  the difference in gear is such that nothing sticks (a constant complaint in PvP)<br />
<br />
and sure it is possible to kill many people that do an excellent game against mobs.  people that have no clue about resists, spell lineups, aa abilities, clickies, buyable potions, alchemey availability, and the specialist that just does an excellent job in a group because he does his job and leaves the others to do theirs.  (he sticks in and hits the taunt button knowing a heal had better already be on the way)<br />
<br />
now then, of course there is something i want to take issue with.  <br />
<br />
that would be calling us a &quot;support class&quot;.  because what you are saying is we are not a melee class (no improvement in skill for 15 current lvls is a joke), not a DPS class (not mana efficient),  not a pet class (dog dog is a joke), and certainly not a healing class (behind clerics, druids and perhaps pallies).  what you are saying is we are one trick ponies of slow and i think we all know we are losing that race now too.<br />
<br />
but what you are really saying is 'support class' = 'buff bot'<br />
<br />
and that makes me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I rather enjoy this talk about dueling Shamans.  I have yet to experience the arena.  The dueling chatter is much more refreshing from &quot;Shaman hate&quot; jibber jabber.<br />
<br />
They don't like seeing shamans in the arena because they have to work to kill us and because we can hit them with an XP death, causing the inconvencience of getting a rez.  Shamans more than most other classes, because DoTs are our main source of damage, where necros have pet DPS and druids nuke.<br />
<br />
Arena PvP can be fun, but it gets old on my server.  The only people who ever seem to be in the Arena on Vazaelle are Time-geared Wizards and Rogues, with the occasional mage, necro, or bard.</div></div><hr />

Against people in Time and later gear (even with a lot of EP gear) that's not true.  None of our dots will land.  I beat all melee by chaining Velium Strike and using pet.  I run when I need to heal.  Bane doesn't land, BoS doesn't land, BoU doesn't land.  It's a waste of mana and time to cast them.  If they have particularly high CR, I end up meleeing (with Staff of Flames or Hammer of Hours) them and letting my DS kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I was chilling in the arena and nobody would fight me because they all knew I had over 7000 hp self buffed with a pretty hoss DS. Then some necro started killing lowbies int he arena whiole I sat out and watched. I then recieved a tell from one of the lowbies offering 3000pp if I were to kill said necro using only DoTs (so he loses exp). I was like an assassin for hire omg. I got to test the DoT hate AND I got paid how sweet is that? I bet that necro lets those lowbies loot their corpses next time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">bonestomper, nicely put :)  However, I would stay away from this, &quot;(no improvement in skill for 15 current lvls is a joke)&quot; because have any casters or priests gotten melee upgrades (I don't know but I can't recall any, except the cleric bash upgrade)?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, sounds like you have either been on a PvP for way too long :) ....or done a lot of research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You know the one thing I think is odd about PvP, raiding and Shaman is that while we suck in individual PvP and PvE Raid stacking, I have found that in a battle of around two PC armies of around 20 characters each, Shaman are a total force multiplier. You would think that a class that is so helpful in a PvP battle would also be useful in a PvE battle.  Just goes to show HOW different the two types of games are I guess. <br />
<br />
The only problem is that this hardly ever happens on a PvE server and from what I read, most PvP involves ambush ganking with less than 6 characters involved.</div></div><hr />
