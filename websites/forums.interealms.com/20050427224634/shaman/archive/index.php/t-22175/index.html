<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently was helping my wife and a friend get their talisman pieces in Plane of Water.  They wanted to pull the Triluon from the zonein.  Problem was, we had trouble getting them single, and with me as the only healer, we couldn't really take them double.  But if you get in the water with them they both aggro.  So I figured out a way to get one single.  Nothing earth-shattering, I know people do this all the time to split mobs near a zone-in, but I thought I'd pass it along in case some folks don't know the technique.<br />
<br />
Summon pet.  Doesn't matter if you buff him, he will be a sacrificial lamb.<br />
<br />
Target a triluon, then target the other one.  You should be able to use a key to switch to previous target and switch back and forth now.<br />
<br />
The other group members hide in the entrance room around the corner, or even outside the zone, to avoid aggro.<br />
<br />
Sic the dog on one of the triluon.  Switch targets.  The second triluon will come for you.  Hit him with Malicious Decay and Virulent Paralysis (you do have VP3, right?)  By this time your dog is dead and the second one is coming for you, so zone out.  Malos and one of our longer-lasting roots might work as well if you don't have VP.<br />
<br />
At this point, your friends wait until the second one has pathed back out of aggro range, and attack the rooted one.  You zone back in to help.<br />
<br />
Key is to NOT damage it; if you damage it, it will start to summon, which can be a pain.<br />
<br />
[EDIT: I originally said 'hraquis' throughout instead of 'triluon', qhor corrected me.  Just got mixed up, sorry.]</div></div><hr />

hraquis are on the lower level near krzzik/hydrotha/ofossa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zurack36</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried soloing this many times...really need mezzer but..you could cast malos on one of the 2...they will both come ROOT one and zone...come back.. slow and kill..then take second out. It worked with me..They hit hard and fast...cast Q on yourself b4 u pull..)<br />
PS use pet as a scarficial lamb and let him slow them down on first pull so you are not interupted during root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for what it's worth, there's a profusion of single-pullable triluons on the upper level of powater (in the griohin room).  invis, eb or whatever, swim down, stay on the left wall until the first tunnel, swim in and hang a right, hang a second right and you'll be looking into the triluon room.  a couple sharks wander there, and there is a sponge trap on the floor, though it's easily avoidable once you know it's there.  kill the wandering sharks first (soloable but they break VP occasionally, so slow them and keep a root spell or clicky available) - they can drop shimmering fish gills for farwater items.  then pull triluons until you get your drop or die, the respawn's 40 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Gahh, you are correct, that's what I get for doing this from memory.  I will fix the initial post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another way to do this:  Do the exact same thing you just did, BUT keep the mob with VP rooted.  if you refresh it as soon as the button pops up, it should never break root.  And you can then keep the tank up on the other trilion which has been single pulled.<br />
<br />
I've doued this way with a war for a while trying to get his gate piece and never had a problem.  It also helps if you tank is able to tank 2 unslowed mobs for about 30 secs though (the time to get them split and then the first slowed), though YMMV.</div></div><hr />
