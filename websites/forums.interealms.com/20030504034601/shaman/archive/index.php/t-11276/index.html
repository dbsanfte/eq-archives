<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed that the mid level PoP spells for shaman (poison nukes i believe) were Vendor sold NO DROP - and only sold in PoK - meaning you HAD to buy the expansion to use the spells.  (the 61 + vendor spells were not no drop - but to reach 61 you had to buy expansion anyway ).<br />
<br />
My guess - Vendor buyable in a new LoY zone.  I can't see them making it a mob drop tradeable spell - because then people who did not buy the expansion can get it.   <br />

Vendor sold NO DROP from LoY zone - mark it down ~~</div></div><hr />

When hailed and talked to he gives you a quest to bring him something now empty, that used to numb feelings but leaves emptiness. My guess was a bottle but the broken bottle that i found he just ate, and wielded like a barroom brawler. He ate everything else i gave him so i'm still looking. He said i'd not have to travel far so i'm still searching nearby, killing zombies on the beach, etc.<br />

I spoke with NPC Grennik Neltrin in a hut behind the lighthouse and she seems to indicate that you might give her the pureblood (and perhaps some other item(s)).

you say, 'Hail, an impassive sea spirit.'<br />
An impassive sea spirit sways back and forth, rocking with the tide.  You are nearly mesmerized by its periodic fluctuation, when it speaks, 'I watch you as you watch me, and I wonder.  Do you realize how to become empty of wishes, of dreams, of hope and sorrow?  What do you know, strange one, about the virtue of null emotion?  Do you understand how to be as unwavering as the ocean itself?  Can you envision yourself as the pebble in the river?  Can you mute feeling?  Do you [dare to learn]?<br />
<br />
You say, 'I dare to learn'<br />
An impassive sea spirit says, 'We will see, Imhottepp, we will see.  If you are a willing pupil, then demonstrate that you have begun to comprehend.  Bring me something empty that previously numbed feeling and therefore brought emptiness to it's possessor.  You should not have to travel far.<br />

Which fits in with the clue: &quot;Bring me something empty that previously numbed feeling and therefore brought emptiness to it's possessor. You should not have to travel far.&quot;<br />

It's an empty flask.. that once had rum.. and rum numbs feelings because it gets you drunk.  Pretty sure I got it off of a drunken pirate guy.</div></div><hr />

After handing in the flask, the spirit gives you the rock as asks &quot;Are you ready to become as impassive as the sea&quot;. Respond by saying &quot;I am as impassive as the sea&quot;. The text afterwards suggests that you need to kill small elements in the sea and return the essences to him. When you are ready for the challenge, simply give back the rock he just gave you (Clear Rock). However, nothing happens when you hand in the rock. He doesn't give it back. He says nothing. Nothing nearby spawns. Nothing comes up on track. The GM who was watching me could not solve it and put it up on the list of broken quests. He refunded by flask and bid me good day.</div></div><hr />

I think Xanden may be on to something, SoE has a new idea for shammie quests....we turn in our item and at some unspecified time in the future, maybe two...maybe three hours, the mob gives our spell to some random druid walking past who can then sell it for10K to a shammie....</div></div><hr />

Cast BoN on the drunk (you wont get an LoS error) and then root rot him in the street.  Loot up, reinvis, rinse and repeat.  At 56, I got ZERO adds from inside the buildings.  There are 4 (i believe) drunk spawns on the first row of houses on your right when you zone in.  The adjacent Boardwalk strip has 2 or 3 more.  Also 2 or 3 more in the houses in the middle (across from the large WHITE tavern). <br />

How to get New Shaman Spell<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
Here is some minor help in getting the new Heal spell for sham lvl 44 w/o<br />
giving it totaly away.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Hint #1)  u talk to the sea spirit &lt;-- easyier to find with an euduring<br />
breath item<br />
<br />
(Hint #2) He gives u a riddle to solve, Not Hard if you are Observent&lt;--<br />
look closely<br />
<br />
(Hint #3) Based on what you think the item is,(if u figured it out) search<br />
for a matching name.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps those who wish to solve a quest w/o it acaully being ruined.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Are you saying you've actually managed to get the spell?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes the quest was broken yesterday and probly still is,  they even took out the sea spirit, I asked a GM about it aswell, and get the usual respone &quot;we are aware&quot; &quot;dont know when it will be fixxed&quot; But Yes i did get this spell a few weeks ago on Beta(test)  before they revamped it (3 times i think it was) Go figure how it can stop working suddenly. Granted I dont have a shaman on any live servers so never tested the quest out on em.<br />
<br />
So as it stands, The spell quest is not avalible til they fix it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">We already know what the answer to the riddle is...<br />
it's the Empty Flask... which IDs as smelling faintly of rum.  Which if you re-read what the underwater spirit says, you'll see that an empty flask that once contained rum is a perfect match.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't finding the trigger item.. the problem is that once you had that in and get an item back... the quest is broken from that point.</div></div><hr />

This is wrong . . at 43 I was able to pull some of the Drunk Pirates solo .. gotta be careful . .and pick and choose what you pull . .sometimes gotta clear it .. but they were all blue to me - easy kills.  Pulled with slow, then dotted with VoS, then tanked with wuffie  :D  <br />

At 47 I did this solo and only occasionally had to deal with 2 mobs AND the guardians/patrolman are doable at 47 solo.  Now that I'm 49 (xp is nice and still nothing green) with the new pet and DoT's it's pretty easy.<br />

I get about 1% per kill and on avgrage about 300pp per 30 kills  the gem drop rate is awsome and the low agro and such is very nice.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Doter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I'm a 53 Iksar shaman and I get MASIVE agro here.  I was invised exploring, and I whent into a corner to reinvis (was on one of the boats) there was a mob that was just barely in range of any of my spells I'd guess.  I cast invis, got agro on both of them the moment I started to cast.  They hit VERRY fast too for mid 100s.  I managed to channel off a gate though, taking over 1000dammage DURRING the casting, including a bash! GO go power channeling!  So I didn't die, but it was huge agro range.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm the iksar agro range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Soriathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">52 Shaman here<br />
<br />
What I've noticed is that everything can agro through walls in that zone, but you also can cast through walls in that zone so use that toward your advantage. ALSO, the whatever SCOUT's have a normal to large sized agro range, unlike the small to non-existent agro range of the other mobs in the zone. What I did was I inis up prior to entering the zone, then run up to the first row of houses. Stand AGAINST the building across from the houses and unlick invis, this will agro 1-2 lightblue/green mobs from inside that building (that are on almost ontop of the wall, aka 1-2 feet away from you through the wall). Kill them with root dot or whatever. Then invis up and go into any of the 6 buildings target, come out, get against the building wall, and cast a Slot or DoT to pull. Make sure when you pull that one of the wandering guards isn't gonna cross in front of your pull path. then make sure to move along the wall to line the mob up with the wall as well and k33l. Invis, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
If you do it right, you'll never EVER get an add except for the 1-2 mobs that will agro through the wall from inside the larger brown building.<br />
<br />
As far as agro near the boats, don't go there. Not necissary, the drunken pirates aren't near boats, they are in the houses just as you enter the zone, past the scouts and to the right.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys. BTW on drop rate. I've killed about 8-10 or so and no drop yet, but my guildmate Knibble got her drop a little past mob #14.</div></div><hr />

It appears to me that instead of waiting on one BIG patch to fix things, they are changing things ( although who knows what they are ) on a daily basis. It also wouldn't surprise me much to see the second stage of this quest get fixed only to change the first part. <br />
<br />
We as Shaman have endured alot of negatives about or class and skills, it was only recently when they eliminated the minuses from our potions, they finally added a Grand Master Prize in Alchemy, but still suffer from a midlevel spell ( 39 Remove Curse ) being unattainable as a soloable mob until roughly late 40s and then even though a few hours spawn the spell is not common loot. ( What group will want to sit in that cave killing green aliens for hours when there is not xp or loot to be had? just to give you a chance to get the spell ?? ) And through all the adversity we have prevailed as a class that is welcome in any zone.<br />
<br />
So don't be too disappointed if by the time the quests are fixed you are high enough level not to use/need the spells. Just my 2 cp.:confused:<br />

If you've got your flask, the hardest bit is done - drops off the drunks in dulak's harbour for those who don't know - in the huts to the right as you enter the zone is where i got mine, took a few hours<br />
<br />
go to the spirit at the back of the inside of the upturned ship hull (pos 690 neg 150 if memory serves - i marked it on the map so i could find it again easily) and talk to it, give it the flask, it gives you a rock - talk a bit more, hand it the rock back<br />
<br />
at the opening to the ship hill spawns 2 tiny elementals &quot;flotsam&quot; and &quot;jetsam&quot; - they agro immediately - kill them, loot their no drop items and hand them into the spirit, spirit returns spell: stoicism<br />
<br />
the battle here was utterly trivial to a 47 shaman and 55 beastlord<br />
<br />
the spell itself is extremely cool and the effect draws lots of oohs and aaahs from people who havent seen it before <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I didn't know about the ranger's glade as a temp, so I was on my own.<br />
<br />
Already had the flask and the spirit was up so I tried it.  Here's what I posted on the casters realm board.<br />
<br />
Just in case people weren't able to get onto the Crucible (like me) lately to check on the progress of the quest, here ya go. <br />
<br />
It's fixed, and I completed it last night. I'm quite sure a lot of people have already done it, but since I couldn't check the board, I didn't know for sure. <br />
<br />
the sea spirit was back up, so I gave it a shot. <br />
<br />
Find the &quot;an impassive sea spirit&quot; in Gunthak, underwater, just north of the undead beach under the hull of a sunken ship. Hail it, and turn in &quot;an empty flask&quot; (random drop off drunken pirates in Dulak Harbor) and get back a Giant rock of some kind. says it's giant sized but won't fit into a rallic pack, and it's heavy. Hand that right back to the spirit and two elementals spawn behind you (flotsam and jetsam.) They could be single pulled at 49 and hit for just shy of 100 on me. I just pulled with slow (stuck first cast on each,) ebolt, then sick dogdog and jbb from there. They each dropped their own essences. Turn in those to the original impassive elemental and voila! Stoicism. <br />
<br />
I did the whole thing solo at 49 (started at 47 though) and it wouldn't take someone very long to do the whole thing now that it's solved, as long as the flask dropped quickly. <br />
<br />
And yeah, this spell's already made a big impact on my solo'ing career.<br />
Hope it helps, and yeah, I'm 50 now and it's amazing for killing downtime.... just need a better cani then #2  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Two glowing rings around your wrists while casting, followed by an interesting glowing beam / StarTrekTransportBeam type effect, followed by a glowing band of light around your waist while it's active.  Quite impressive, and an excellent spell in general.  I'm quite pleased  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Well, spent almost an hour and half so far killing drunk pirates and haven't gotten the flask yet.  But this spell will be mine, oh yes it will be mine..<br />
<br />
Oh, on an interesting side note..the recipes for int casters to research shm/clr/dru spells are live on test and productions servers both.  Unfortunately, the recipe books aren't on the production servers yet, but that will probly change with tomorrow's patch.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting is that ANY int caster can research ANY wis caster spell.  Should provide a decent alternate avenue for getting pox/malo/torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">I estimate it took me between 5 to 7 hours to get the empty flask.  I did not camp it straight but the longest I camped straight was 3 hours before it dropped.  Not happy, relieved this part is over and worried about bugs on next turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">I did it on Innoruuk for myself on Sunday night, March 9th then I did it again with a friend on Tuesday March 11th.  Worked just fine both times, I can only guess the reason for it not to work is turning in the wrong thing, being invis while turning in, giving to dogdog, errr something along those lines.<br />
<br />
To answer some questions, the impassive spirit can be on top of the boat.  The first time I did the quest I couldn't find him in the boat either, but as I was leaving I found him pacing on top of the boat.  I hailed him to make sure he still was giving the quest and he was.  Did the turn-ins from there and worked just fine.<br />
<br />
Also, he doesn't despawn after use, he stayed up both times for me.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Just got my copy last night on Brell, only took about 2 hours of killing the drunks wasn't to tough.  The turn in and following elemental fight was very easy for myself at 51.  Love the spell, cool graphic to boot, now to get that other pain in the arse spell lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Got mine on Zeb tonight.  The flask dropped off of the first drunken pirate I killed.  The one I killed was in a house opposite the dock in the SouthWest corner of the zone.  The house is white and nondescript.  The bar was vacant of drunken pirates when I looked.<br />
<br />
Loc of &quot;an impassive sea spirit&quot; is:  695, -297.<br />
It's closer to the lighthouse with the vendors than it is to the beach.  Very close to the West wall.</div></div><hr />
