<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone ever heard of this program, EQW? It allows you to run EQ in a window, so you can use any windows application while playing EQ. A friend of mine just started using it, and has a firm belief that VI can't detect it, but I'm just paranoid. Anyone else have experience with this program?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, I use it. It's great! I'm actually able to duo 2 accounts on the same computer with EqW.<br />
<br />
Also, it doesn't matter if Verant can detect it or not...it's not illegal/bannable.<br />
<br />

<br />
Verant can basically ban you for whatever they want.  <br />
It's their game.  <br />
<br />
Legally they have NO ground to stand on.  The EULA would need to be presented to you BEFORE you buy the game in order for it to hold legal grounds.  Agreeing to a contract AFTER you buy the product is BS.<br />
<br />
As far as EQW goes, your chances of being caught are slim to none.  You'd still be coming off the same IP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been using EQW since the day it came out.  Unless you talk about it in game, there's no way for VI to discover you're using it.  I did notice something weird once though.  When I re-installed one of my pc's I accidentally installed EQW to the EQ directory.  After that every single time I zoned I dropped to server select.  After moving it to it's own directory, no problems.  So unless you put it in your EQ directory or talk about it, have no fear.   Like others said, if you set it up right and have a good enough pc, you can run 2 EQW and have a blast.  GL to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've run EQW for a couple months now- it's great to be able to get IMs or do some surfing during downtime without having to flip over to the other PC.  :)<br />
<br />
Haven't tried two EQ sessions at once- I guess I'm just not that hardcore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have thought it would be possible for Verant  to detect whether you were running in a window using a few lines of code which basically did the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Detect resolution of your windows desktop<br />
2.  Detect resolution of viewport being drawn into<br />
3.  If (1) and (2) are not the same send a packet to server indicating this.<br />
<br />
However, I wouldn't have thought it was in Verant's commercial interest to reduce the number of people using 2nd accounts by banning for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use it to keep an eye on my email and to check maps, etc. in the background similar to Bigguss. I only have a 32MB video card, so the only time I run 2 accounts with it is to do item transfers. Even then I need to set EQ to the lowest resolution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My XP PC is P3 850 with 512 MB ram, and a Geforce 32mb. I can run 2 EQW flawlessly, but you kinda have to restrict alot of stuff to make it run. A few changes need to be made to the eqclient.ini and eqw.ini. In eqclient.ini be sure to turn OFF velious armor. In eqw.ini under background set VSYNC=TRUE, and UPDATE=FALSE. Next, before you goto connect on EQ goto options, remove ALL luclin models. On the next screen turn off mip mapping, texture compression, set resolution as low as possible, and texture resolution to low. Then lastly when you get on EQ goto display, make sure you're running lowest possible resolution, particle density off, 3d sky off, and clip plane all the way down. Be sure to not hit F10 and goto full screen as it lags like mad. When i'm running 2 chars this is how I setup my backup (utility) class, and the main class i'm playing (my monk) is identical except I run at 800/600 in full view to see what i'm doing better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The point that I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter whether or not they can detect it, because they don't care.<br />
<br />
They have said in the past that they can't stop people from playing in and window or minimizing EQ, especially on Win2k/XP, and they don't care, but they still won't change EQ.<br />

I've been using it for about a month now. It's great for running two accounts. <br />
<br />
A couple of tips,<br />
<br />
<br />
 Make sure that your windows desktop is the same colour depth as EQ (I suggest making it 16bit)<br />
 I find that I had to turn off sound on both accounts to stop it chugging (I think its related to the general crappy sound I'm getting in EQ anyway)<br />
 <br />
<br />
I run my desktop at 1152 * 864. My main account is run at 1024 * 768 (My shaman), and my second account is run at 800 * 600, druid/trade mule.<br />
<br />
As far as Verant banning people it's not in their interest. They would be losing at least 2 subscriptions for most people if they did that.<br />
<br />
Now ShowEQ on the other hand that's a whole different ball game! ;)</div></div><hr />

I would have thought it would be possible for Verant  to detect whether you were running in a window using a few lines of code which basically [snip]According to the EQW discussion board, supposedly it is pretty trivial to tell if you're running EQ in a window, if and only if they run some code which does some very shallow yet illegal sniffing in your computer.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is technically true, or legally true, but it was the claim I read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A guildie of mine was having trouble a while back where he couldnt play EQ in normal fullscreen...it would always drop him to desktop but if he used EQW then it was fine, so he emailed them (he didnt say he used it so they couldnt just ban him on the assumption he did) and got an email back later saying that EQW was perfectly ok as it doesnt really change gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Great! Thanx for all the responses, everyone! But I have one problem. I am able to get as far as the server selection screen, but when I hit &quot;Play EverQuest,&quot; the EQW Window jumps off my screen and everytime I move it back to the middle of my screen, it and go back to EQW as the active window using ALT-TAB, it jumps back off screen. Now here's what I've done so far. I've made sure that the EQ resolution is the same as my desktop (tried both 800x600 and 1024x768 on both). Made sure my desktop color is the same as that of ingame (16 bit color. Also tried 32 bit). I'm find until I select &quot;Play EverQuest&quot; on the server select screen, but it's then that it jumps offscreen. I can see the corner of the EQW window on the very bottom right of my desktop, but if I click the window to try and move it, it puts me into the game, and I have to alt-tab back out. Right clicking the taskbar item and selecting move does nothing. EQW is installed in a seperate directory. Perhaps moving it to the EQ directory would help? Sorry if this is at all confusing. Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

When you say you run 2 accounts, do you run from the Same EQ directory or do you have to have 2 complete sets of the files? <br />
<br />
You an run two accounts from the same set of files so long as you have two valid accounts, but I run mine from two sets of files so that I can have different global settings for my main and my alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ShadoWynd,<br />
<br />
I think I follow you!<br />
<br />
If you can see part of the window, wait until it gets as far as the char select screen then press ctrl-alt-r to relase the mouse to windows. then you should be able to move the eqw window about. Just click on it and press ctrl-alt-r to regain your mouse in eq.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work I think there are settings in the eqw.ini file that you can set not 100% on this<br />
<br />
I hope you can follow me :p<br />
<br />
[edit - changed my mind on cause of the problem ;) ]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, I got it working. I ended up moving the EQW executable file to the Everquest directory and it seemed to resolve the problem. Thank you all again for all the info! This is great!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">if youre running multiple eqw sessions, having them point to different eq file directories will speed up zoning, load times, etc.</div></div><hr />
