<br />
More reported chats from mission control.... <br />
<br />
Brenlo &quot;What's a Shaman?&quot; CRGuy: Hmm, I seem to have received an email from err... wait a sec... Shay-men? Is that right? It's spelt funny... <br />
Dev1: Nah, don't worry about it. None of us play them... Any emails from l33t druids? <br />
Brenlo: Nope, nada. <br />
Dev1: *sighs in relief* Ok, we're cool then. <br />
Dev2: Awesome. Hey, you still play Stumpyrunt Halferdrood right? <br />
Dev1: Yeah, still my main! <br />
Dev2: Cool, what level now. <br />
Dev1: 34! I r l33t. <br />
Dev2: Grats!! New spells, woot!! <br />
Dev1: Thanks bro! <br />
*Devs 1 &amp; 2 high five* <br />
Brenlo: So, about these Shay-mens then? Anything to worry about? <br />
Dev1: Nah. What's their beef anyways? <br />
Brenlo: Some stuff about being short changed on heals, buffs, damage, slows... Hmm, quite a list. There's loads of figures and analysis and stuff too. <br />
*Enter Dev3, stage right, carrying doughnuts* <br />
Dev3: Oh god!! Throw it out! Like they KNOW how this game works, right! <br />
Dev1: Yeah, man, like they have experience! Pfft. Just say it's... <br />
Devs 1, 2 &amp; 3 in chorus: &quot;WORKING AS INTENDED&quot; Bwahahaha! <br />
*There is much merriment and doughnut gobbling* <br />
<br />
Brenlo: Ok, circular file for that then... <br />
*sound of shredding* <br />
Brenlo: Hey Dev3, how are the new AAs for GoD coming along. I mean for these Shayamalan dudes... <br />
Dev3 shrugs: Dunno, I just came over from SWG. I only got this gig cos Absor's dog quit yesterday. He'd been dealing with it till now. Ah, screw it, we'll just give them a new Disease DoT... <br />
Dev1 (laughing): Make it really mana efficient! <br />
Dev2 (hysterical): No, make it last like 2 and a half minutes!! <br />
Dev3 (guffawing): Hehe, love you guys! <br />
*More laughter, but the doughnuts are all gone* <br />
Dev3: Heh, just to shut them up, I might give them something new... <br />
*silence, of the stunned variety, descends on the room* <br />
Dev3: Force push!! Hahahahaha!! <br />
Dev1: No, ANCIENT Force push!!! <br />
*Dev2 wets himself laughing* <br />
Brenlo: So, whose turn is it to get the doughnuts? <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so I made some of that up... <br />
<br />
It was chocolate eclairs, not doughnuts...</div></div><hr />
