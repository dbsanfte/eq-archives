<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pestario</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I crated a second account to level up a Shaman to partner with my 55 Necro. So while leveling up my Shaman on the second account  I started a Bezerker to level along with him.<br />
<br />
I am hearing bad things about Bezerkers now, What would be the best partner to level a Shaman with from 1 to 55?<br />
<br />
The Bezerker seems ok but im hearing there is nothing special about them. Would you recommend a monk? something else? Stick with the Bezerker?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their ability to tank, heal themselves via taps, and pulling/scouting abilities with FD make me think that this is the best partner for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monks are viable pullers.  Berserkers are probably viable tanks, and have snare and stun to boot.  Either one is a good choice for a partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would worry about the tanking power of a chain wearing class at higher levels. I think SoE has made it very clear they are a high DPS class, but more like a rogue then a monk.<br />
<br />
Do they even get taunt ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rangers and monks both tank fine for exp purposes, with tanking AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But how about that rogue?<br />
<br />
Have you in your life ever seen a rogue tanking in BoT or PoE ?<br />
<br />
On screw it im going to make a Zerker and find out =p</div></div><hr />

Monks are ok, to 2box with, but the lack of taunt can be a pain.  I like my SK better, or even a Warrior.  Something that can keep taunt off you and can dish out some DPS.  You can heal them just fine if they can keep the mobs off you while you slow/heal.  Sometimes with monk it takes a bit to get the mob off you while you slow, and if you wait to slow until monk has good agro, cuts it close on healing sometimes.  I would say paladin or SK or Warrior is best since they all do pretty good DPS now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as chain tanks are concerned, rogues actually have higher defensive skill caps than rangers do, go figure.<br />
<br />
Duo-wise I still vote SK for a partner.  Plate tank + snare + FD + a stupid amount of basically mana-free aggro = $$.</div></div><hr />

Really ?  Every rogue i meet that isnt time gears is significantly lower in HP and AC then their melee brothers. Simply cause they dont get hit so they focus on stats and such relative to damage. Only rare is it that i see a rogue that is either the uber rogue for his guild or is simply in a Time/High elemental flagged guild do they have high HP and AC. I dont know, maybe you guys that think rogues can tank well might be looking at it from a 65/250AA/Time perspective which is not really going to help this guy i think. I mean i remember getting into PoP and seeing a vast difference in how well a ranger could tank anymore. I agree once they get their gear up high enough and really the Def AA too they do alot better, but again, this guy isnt going to be there for a long time if at all.<br />
<br />
I might be wrong though</div></div><hr />
