<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dynlos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI all just wanted to ask a question,  I am lvl 15 and own a few twinked items but i dont have another main.  What would be an affordable set up of equipment for my lvl or a few lvls ahead.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S.  If it's a long list leave it in the format <br />
Head:<br />
Feet:<br />
etc.   <br />
<br />
Gotta go cut the grass brb in a few hours:eek: !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's important to know your race!  Iksars have armor limitations, as well as their own racial armor available to them!<br />
<br />
If you are a barb, I would suggest a set of medium banded.  Stuff isn't that bad to start off with and can also be used in the totemic armor quests.<br />
<br />
Everything's been kinda turned on its ear with this new focus item stuff, some things might be more attractive now than they used to be.<br />
<br />
Some other decent stuff at starting levels:<br />
<br />
neck - blackened alloy medallion<br />
ears - imbued ivory (for barb) or forest loops<br />
belt - strawspun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would expect forest loops to be out of his price range.  The vendor offers 285p for them, so you probably won't be able to buy any for less than 300p.<br />
<br />
When I was lvl 15 300p was more money than I thought existed in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good equipment = anything you don't have to pay for.  <br />
<br />
Kill things and take their stuff.  ringmail, bronze, etc.   Any thing you spend on gear would be better spent on your spells, and saving for a rainy day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dynlos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for your help everyone i am a barb btw also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree  snapdragon<br />

Da ogre got it right...  Save joo cash for da spells.  If joo got extra cash ofter dat the fill up da empty slots wid banded armor then just start upgrading stlots as joo can.<br />
<br />
1) spells<br />
2) one weapon of each type  (pierce, 2hb, 1hb) to work on skills.<br />
3) fill all da slots with somting with ac<br />
4) upgrades.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Banded is good armor until you 20s 30s when you can upgrade to Totemic.  A full set will cost around 100p so it's pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Banded is a good place to start, I wore banded until 24-25. It cost me about 2pp per AC, roughly 87pp for a full suit give or take from a blacksmith.  At 15...I'm sure 87pp is quite a bit. Upgrade pieces gradually, start by seeking out some banded, then move up to Totemic, RyGorr, Jarsath, Seb scale, JB whatever else comes next. <br />
<br />
Use your money for spells early on the money will eventually come, I didn't have 1000pp until well into my 30's. The money will come and I got my Forest Loops for free as I killed the Giants that dropped them. I also got a Strawspun belt for free. <br />
Money will come, build your character gradually if you don't have access to a higher level main character or rich friends/guild. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember:<br />
Money comes with levels, Power comes from spells, and well women like a Shaman with a big spear and the means to use it !!      *wink*</div></div><hr />
