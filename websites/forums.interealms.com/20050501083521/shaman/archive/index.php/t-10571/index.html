<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Racs34</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail brothers and Sisters.<br />
First off I currently play a bst , as I approach 58(should have in 3 days max) I am concerned about my tankability. <br />
At 58+ can a beast still tank? <br />
It should be note that my normal partner is a 56 necro so his dots and pet really help out in the dps area. <br />
Anyways getting back to my original question, is it feasible to believe that a bst/necro  can get to 60+ as a duo with the beast  tanking? <br />
If not then what other class would you recommed? I was thinking about a shammy however since i play on F.V. i would have to delete my BL in order to lvl up a shammy. <br />
So i guess my question boils down to this, do you think a bl/necro combo or a shammy/necro combo is better suited to duo all the way to 65. <br />
<br />
Any and all feed back is appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I think that a shaman/necro duo is one of the most effective in the game. This does NOT mean that I think you should delete your BL (*note i wrote that before i saw the 3 days played thing).  I dont really see a bst tanking 60+, but straight up tanking in teh face isnt always what you want.  In PoP, at least past teir one planes, mellee duoing isnt a great idea. The most effective duo I have been in was chanter/ranger with the chanter charming and ranger almost matching the chanters pet in DPS hehe. Overall, PoP (which is what i assume you mean by 60+) isnt overly friendly to duo'ers, but good group formation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't delete your beastlord.  I play a beastlord as my second character, and although he is not quite high enough for me to testify on their 60+ tanking ability, I can say that beastlords appear to be much like shamans in their DUO ability.  They go good with just about anyone (except pure melees).  I've talked to some beastlords in my guild and they say that some of their best duos have been with other pet classes.  I'm not sure what tactics they use, but beastlords and necros are both extremely versatile classes, so I am sure you can find something that works :)<br />
<br />
edit:  I had an idea.  If you are duoed with a necro, then you will have both snare and sow at your disposal.  This makes aggro-kiting an easy possibility (i.e. you piss off the mob and run it in circles while your pets chew it).  Pull the mob with your big poison dot, hit it with drowsy, and run it in circles while the necro applies dots and whatever.  If you lose aggro, hit it with your quick ice nuke, a poison dot, or drowsy.  You will always have enough mana for drowsy, so its a great aggro-getter.</div></div><hr />
