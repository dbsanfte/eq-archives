<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yakie Unforgivensun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally got flagged for PoS after many attempts and was strolling around the zone well I didn't look to far around but I was noticing the frogs in the tunnel towards zone out tree and well I was wondering if they are fearable at 62 and how is the exp if so?  Also do the NPC's in the tunnel do they assist the frogs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chromite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No they are not fearable (by any spell... they are too high level)<br />
<br />
Yes they are good exp.<br />
<br />
Yes the NPCs assist them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yakie Unforgivensun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">However, the frogs in the 'forest giant' area ARE fearable and snareable :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ditopher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they're fearable? I've been bow kiting them all this time =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">NEVER had a fear to land, i see necros snare kiting them<br />
but never fear them, i thought they just to hi lvl snare and there mr for root/snare isnt bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kruull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are not immune in the Forest but I usually have to use the J stick to get it to land and even then its rare, so snare bow kiting is the way to go :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I root and shoot, to much moving with just snare.<br />
Need new root to make this useful<br />
<br />
Snare to pull, root, maybe DOT.starting shooting arrows, root breaks then ill normally tripple nuke there ass reroot and shiit.<br />
Can kill 9% AA frog in 5 minutes but using up alot of mana.<br />
Non nuking takes approx 9 minutes or so, i know eagle eye lasts anyway.<br />
Am3/EQ/Blesses arrows/1600 attk/primal bow<br />
Crits 1, yeh i know i need more crits hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meecham Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Always thought any mob over lv 55 was immune to all fear spells?  Could be wrong, cant remember where I got that idea from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see people talking about root/shoot or bowkiting the frogs in POS.  I know some of these frogs summon and are quite nasty.  If I was to attempt this on the wrong kind of frog it would probably have unpleasant results (i.e. dead ranger).<br />
<br />
So, could anybody post a bit more info about where the frogs are that don't summon and would be good for a ranger to solo?  Is it any frog in the forest area?  Frogs with specific names?  Etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The &quot;nature&quot; beasts (trees, snakes and bears) do not assist the lorok frogs.  I am told the giants do not assist them either but I have not personally tested that theory.  The Lorok Frogs assist each other.  The best place to kite (snare/arrow/nuke/root version since fear does not work as previously mentioned) them IMO is the slightly more wideopen area by Relv the Mysterious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reandn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks guys.  I'll give them a try next time I've got time to kill while LFG.<br />
