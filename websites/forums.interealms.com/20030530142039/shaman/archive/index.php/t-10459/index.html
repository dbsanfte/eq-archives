<br />
But my question is, can casters bind in the dorf town in CC?  Can melee and hybreds?<br />
<br />
Don't know if it's been asked or answered.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind grinding here, but my brother in-law plays a paladin and would hate to have him run from Thruga every time he died.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can bind outside the Orc Fort in EW.   if on good faction in Thurg, you could bind at the hut with dwarves not far from the orc fort, so that you would have a reduced risk of an orc or something waiting for ya at your bind point.  <br />
A bind at zone to GD would minimize travel without sacrificing much in safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or at worst case, you can go to Kael Drakhel and bind just inside the zone line.  It's a short walk to the Orc fort in EW.  I had my bracer mule bound there at first before I moved him to Thurg to make it easier to do the quest.</div></div><hr />
