Shaman have a wide variety of spells, potential group roles, and solo and group tactics.<br />
<br />
The Medicine Cabinet forum here has a lot of great shaman info and I'd suggest browsing it and reading up.   www.eqshaman.com is a good site with our spells, skills, quests, and other goodies.<br />
<br />
But since I'm a rambling machine...<br />
<br />
Some common stuff (in my experience):<br />
<br />
Spells to cast and some tactical info:<br />
<br />
- Long-term Buffs.  If solo you'll want to buff you and your pet up good for melee.  Grouped you'll want to buff your group as much as you can balancing how much time and mana it takes with encounter difficulty and what your group really needs.  We have a LOT of buffs, they generally take a while to cast, and it can take a while and a lot of mana to fully buff everyone.  Some buffs don't affect your pet (you can research that here via search) so don't waste your time.  You might read up on pet dual wielding and how to feed it weapons for maximum pet damage output (I'd call this pseudo-buffing your pet, I guess).<br />
<br />
- Short-term buffs.  If you're grouped and not with an enchanter you will be responsible for hasting melees.  It's important to make sure you have mana available for this as melees really like haste and it greatly enhances group damage output.  I like to try to redo haste without my tanks calling for it...but most times they need to remind me...and trust me, tanks will *always* let you know when they need haste!  ;)  Depending on your solo style you'll want to haste your pet and probably haste yourself too.<br />
<br />
- Slows.  If solo you will almost always pull with a slow to reduce the damage you and pet take.  In groups you will almost always slow the main tanks target asap to reduce damage the tank takes.  Some tanks cannot firmly establish early aggro or a target is particularly dangerous and prone to aggro vs slow and in those situations you might wait til a critter is at 90% to slow or you will almost always get aggroed.  If you have no mezzer in a group and have adds you typcially deal with them with root or 'pet mezzing' (usually be someone with a pet stronger than ours).  Regardless, a good shaman will, IMO, get adds mezzed as quickly as possible to reduce damage taken.  You can debuff mezzed targets without them breaking (and it shifts critter aggro from the frail chanter to the more durable you) and slowing rooted targets is more important as they can still deal damage.<br />
<br />
- Heals.  Pretty obvious solo - keep you and your dog alive.  IMO when soloing you want to avoid taking tons of damage yourself but depending on your style, gear, and targets results will vary.  I say you want to keep damage on yourself light because you want health for canni to reduce downtime.  You'll typically always have a regen type of spell on, mostly to support cannibalizing, which helps.  In groups you will usually be a backup healer and most good groups try to keep damage focused on the main tank.  So, your backup healer job is to touch up the nontanks that get damaged and keep the cleric healed (so cleric doesn't have to aggro by healing themself), and help out with the main tank if the cleric is lom.  Also, since it takes 10 seconds for a cleric to cast cheal you may need to toss a heal on the MT if he's getting brutalized to keep him alive while cheal is firing (it sucks when your MT dies during a cheal casting).<br />
<br />
I will also frequently cast regen-line spells, which are generally a bit costy, on group members that take infrequent damage so they can slowly heal up (usually more efficient than repeatedly healing), on necros so they can convert health to mana more safely, on the MT if there's significant time between pulls, etc.<br />
<br />
I've been the only/primary/co-healer in several groups...it can work if you reduce damage through good slowing and have a good group.  It's easy to do in a small group and viable in full groups too.  I prefer to have a cleric but I'm willing to push the limits of my limited healing (I'm only 55th so I don't have any big heals or HoTs yet!).<br />
<br />
- Malaise-line.  At your level and in many cases you don't need it, but against particularly resistant bastage, boss type mobs, and higher cons you will often want to lead with a malaise-line spell to drop a critter's resistances, thus making it easier to land all subsequent spells.  In many cases landing a Mal helps all casters in your group.<br />
<br />
- Cannibalize.  Your best friend.  A good shaman, IMO, should never be at full health or mana unless you're in total downtime.  There's always something that can be cast or refreshed.  You should always be cannibalizing to produce mana while running a regen-line spell to regain health.  It likely varies from shaman to shaman, but I try to stay around 80% health and cannibalize any extra health away for mana.  As I once read, and agree with, a shaman that's at full health is an inefficient shaman.<br />
<br />
- Offense.  We have a variety of offensive spells including long-term disease based DoTs, short-term poison based DoTs, curse-based DoTs (LDoN bought), cold DDs, and poison DDs.  We also have root and we have a pet.  This gives us a lot of options solo and grouped.  Some like to &quot;root rot&quot; (keep critter rooted and DoT it to death), some like to sic pet and DoT/DD, you send the pet, and some mix in melee to various degree.  There are like other ways to mix it up too.  It's really something you have to experiment with and determine what best works for you.  <br />
<br />
Grouped you'll want to always have a pet and use it to assist the main tank.  Our pet isn't that strong and usually can't tank a critter all by itself, so it's not the best choice for 'pet mezzing'.  But, the pet does do damage and over a long fight is a great way to contribute to group damage output.  Depending on your group makeup, mana supply, and length of fights you might throw a DoT or DD to deal some damage.  Again, styles vary.  I personally like to keep a lot of mana available for emergencies, utilities, heals, whatever - but I will never go full mana - I'll nuke or something before I'll go full mana.  Other shaman may prefer to be more active in group DPS on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
- Utility.  You may be responsible for keeping your group SoWed, or keeping up Pack Shrew indoors, helping those blind Erudites and Humans see with ultravision, whatever.<br />
<br />
- Bear Form.  I'll mention this since I had someone's 50+ shaman alt ask me what it does the other day.  Bear form gives you some extra wisdom and improved regeneration.  It's pretty much a good thing.  I tend to always use bear form when grouped since I'm support-oriented and want maximum possible wisdom and regen when grouped.  When I solo, however, I will often not use bear form so I can admire my handsome barbarian self using different viewing angles.  I don't think you can slam in bear form and I'm not sure if it affects your melee abilities in other ways.  I want to think that your melee is less effective in bear form but don't quote me...my melee sucks regardless since I group so much and haven't fully developed my melee skills so it's hard for me to tell.  :-/<br />
<br />
Shaman have many potential roles and responsibilities in a group.  We are very good at enhancing our groups for heightened efficiency.  Therefore, we generally need to keep mana on hand to be able to cast our various spells.  Cannibalizing helps us maintain a good supply of mana but one still needs to manage their mana well and attempt to anticipate upcoming mana expenditures while also being ready for emergencies.  Of course when you're solo you can do whatever you want but I'd think anyone would want to keep downtime to a minimum so similar thoughts apply.<br />
<br />
My advice to you would be to try soloing some light blues feet wet and try out the various approaches to soling, then refine your tactics against more worthy dark blue oponents.  Some shaman are excellent soloists - but even those that aren't like me can easily handle a light blue with pretty little threat.  Once you start to get a grasp for your spells try some grouping and focus on slowing, which is usually the shaman's primary and most important group function.  In a group just about everything else you do is gravy - but balancing your casting, filling in the gaps, and doing those little extra things to enhance your group is, IMO, what defines a good shaman.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />
PS - As I often do, I have probably written too much.  If you manage to read all of this I hope it helps!</div></div><hr />
