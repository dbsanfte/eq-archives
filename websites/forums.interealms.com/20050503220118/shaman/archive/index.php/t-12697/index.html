Healers are all very concerned about a healing problem that has always existed but has gotten much worse in the last round of patching. There are times when it appears that the server and client are not in sync about how many hit points someone has. A heal will land, you get the &quot;You have been healed for 6000 hit points&quot; message, and then in a little while you'll seem to die, with plenty of hit points. Usually it's &quot;Pain and Suffering&quot; claiming the victim. <br />
<br />
This bug is very dangerous if you are soloing and healing yourself with Kragg's Mending  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2435&amp;source=Live) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But there are doors to fix!  Think of the doors!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, lay off the freakin' doors.  You think they should NOT fix doors because there are other bugs?  You think the graphic artists who are tweaking the world models to fix the doors could somehow be pressed into service to fix a CH code bug?<br />
<br />
It's annoying seeing all the people who think they know how to run a game development house pick on the doors as some kind of indication as to how SOE's priorities are screwed up.  It's like criticizing the school cafeteria staff for improving their food when the test scores at the school are going down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I avoid Spawnweek personally, I get enough bitterness and vitriol from some of the people here that I don't need to go looking for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The problem really isn't the developers.  It's the complete and total lack of testing BEFORE the patch goes live.  Apparently the people on Test don't have the same setup as the rest of us or the people in charge of reading Test's bug/feedback info are illiterate.  I just don't understand how anyone could not notice the huge update delay on HP just from one mod rod, manastone, mana robe, canni, or heal.</div></div><hr />
