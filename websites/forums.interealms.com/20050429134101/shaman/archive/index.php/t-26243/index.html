<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been testing different playstyles while grinding/PLing and decided that given my access to really good high damage beatdown weapons it doesn't make much sense for me to go with the ambush build without all the necessary talents to make it shine.  I spent about 30 min this morning running around on the trogs in the Badlands just rolling up and beating them down with the ss/evis tango and it was sick. <br />
<br />
I'm using the Hand of Righteousness out of SM plus the Black Menace dagger. In 4 short levels I'll get a Thrash blade which should last me until ST/BRD.  I'm going to respec yet again (10g- sigh) and go combat to adrenaline rush then dump everything else into Assassination. If I'm going to fight like a combat rogue I may as well spec like one.  My only complaint is that it doesn't leave me with a very &quot;roguely&quot; feeling as I just run up and beat stuff to a pulp.<br />
<br />
I also think I'm going to go sword spec instead of mace spec since I want max dps and I'm on a PVE server.  Regardless, I guess I can't fight it any longer. It's just so much easier to play this way in PVE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bonesnapper is equivilant to thrash for damage, has great stats, and mace stun is a serious, serious bonus, you have AR and BF yet? What level are ya? Seen the wootness of two baddies + bf? It rocks. remember BF not only hits another person, but speed increase for all attacks.<br />
<br />
The other day while waiting for a guildie to come for SM twink, some jackass 50 alliance rogue was killing people and then running into instance, tried to get away from me, stunned him three times within about 8 seconds, he never got near the entrance.<br />
<br />
Thrash is like 124 damage I think, right? Kind of bummed, only two maces I know of that are upgrades from level 48 snapper, Ironfoe and Mass of McGowan. On a bright note, I want to get the cruel hand of timmy, we know how to get it now, just sounds funny cause my roomate is named tim.<br />

My rogue dinged 41 this morning and is leveling at an insane clip.  I've resumed having a 50+ paladin on auto-follow behind me for free kings + healing.  Blade flurry is going to be great because I pull as many mobs as I can at a time- I can't wait.<br />
<br />
As for stuns, it isn't of any benefit to me in the PVE game.  I could not care less how much damage I'm taking as it just means I heal a little more on the pally. The faster I kill = the faster I catch up to my crew on my new main.<br />
<br />
Thrash is like 124 damage I think, right?<br />
Yeah and it has a great proc (extra swing). I want max dps. I was bummed to find out the Phantom Blade was main hand only- was dreaming of wielding both those bad boys, oh well.  Hopefully I'll get lucky and the Cerulean claws will drop for me when I get dragged through MR to get my thrash blade.<br />
<br />
I still feel like a rogue sellout though.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, still very much a rogue. Some of the greatest fighters in sci-fi books duel wield, and they do not generally wield daggers either.<br />
<br />
The beauty of the build, coupled with very high stamina, makes me very good at killing all classes solo, but it gives me much more use and survivability once you are uncovered, and you will be uncovered.<br />
<br />
I may be starting to come around on the crusader enchants too. Seems as though lately I am almost always under the effect of at least one, if not both hands. I rarely need to heal when twinking anymore, another 60 rogue does.<br />
<br />
Another thing, if you can, get an &quot;admiral's hat&quot; I think it is called, I got the pattern, not made one yet, but, pretty sure you can buff for 20 stamina with it, have to wear it to keep buff on self, but if the twinker uses it, can take it off after buff, 15 minute duration, 15 minute cooldown, heh free 20 stam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mill, I'm having second thoughts on the 31 pt combat build vs. a 30 pt assassination build.  Seal Fate + Cold Blood seems awfully nice for generating combo points, esp. since SF is bugged at the moment and is giving 2 cp's instead of 1.  I'd still play combat style but would not have combat talents other than imp ss.  How does combat build compare to assassination build in terms of raw dps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, I decided to try out the bugged Seal Fate to see what all the fuss was about before I respecced into combat.  So I respecced to a 30/2/0 build, picking up Seal Fate/Cold Blood.<br />
<br />
Wow, just... wow. I went from 100 dps to 150 dps.  With ss + remorse I have a 57% chance to start each fight with a crit and 3 cp's.  If I weren't so lazy I could start with cheap shot and have 57% chance to start each fight with 5 cp's.  I started getting pissed when I'd get ss crits when I had more than 2 cp's already banked because they got wasted.  My crit evis's are now doing mid 700's and they go off nonstop considering how ridiculously fast cp's build.<br />
<br />
Mill, have you tried seal fate in its bugged state? This is 100x more abusive than the paladin seal of crusader ever was.  I'm going to ride this horse until the new patch arrives, no question, then take another look at the combat talents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dps on level 56-58 mobs in strath, average about 400 spike to 600 or so, never any lower then 350. Have a combat log of me killing SM crap but that would not be the same. will try to remember to get logs of a strath or scholo run.<br />
<br />
SF still no where near a ful combat build for sustained dps and survivability.<br />
<br />
4223 hps now on rogue, actually gained agility switching crap around too.<br />
<br />
<br />
reinstalled cosmos, dps meter works way different now, hmmm..<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea it's what I keep trying to say. The dps mods calculate differently. CTMod is way different than cosmos. Also Iz keep in mind that your play style, having a bot paladin, no pvp make your build a lot more viable. Assasinate is pure evil in PvE but doesn't hold up to a combat build in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">cappi you sure not reversed? I totally kick ass in pve, and pvp. I just cannot drop casters/hurt peeps quite as fast.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea an assasinate build - when you don't need to tank is far superior for PvE than a combat build. Especially when you factor in the broken seal fate. After that bug is fixed, I couldn't say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Absolutely demolished a few 60 rogues last night, a 60 warrior, several 60 priests, was a good time, raided stv, killin newbs is fun, but there always is a counter attack, they eventually zerged.<br />
<br />
In one battle, single handedly killed a 60 priest, finished off a 60 rogue, 60 warrior, 58 mage before I bought it, it was lovely.<br />
<br />
Hps up to 4223 now. if wear my pure stam rin can ge to 4273, wee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Okay, did respec #4 after the seal fate fix to try out combat (swords). I made a phantom blade to test it out until I get my hands on a thrash blade.  All I can say is... wow yet again.  Every time I respec I find a more abusive way to play the rogue.  Blade Flurry rocks so hard and when you combine it with Adrenaline Rush and Slice and Dice... ouch.  <br />
<br />
I don't build cp's as fast as I did with seal fate but my damage is less dependent upon big evis's.  The sword spec talent, precision and dual wield talents all provided superior sustained dps even when out of energy or cp's. I'm def. going to stick with this build unless and until I can get a really disgusting dagger to go back and try out an ambush/stab build again. Only suck part is how expensive all the respecs are getting hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All you need to do now is try mace spec with bonesnapper main hand and you will have tried just about everything, and you owe it to yourself to try. Mace stun is a huge, huge deal in pve, and pvp. Happens quite often and really screws people over.<br />
<br />
Some more equipment upgrades, a point here, point there, up to 4313 hps now, + 115 agil and + 215 stam. Still all AH but for some mid level outdoor blue drops.</div></div><hr />
