<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, since alchemy looks like it'll never get an upgrade to boost us beyond 200, I'm looking for a decent tradeskill to do.<br />
<br />
To me, it looks like it's either tailoring or smithing.<br />
<br />
What are you other shaman doing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I probably won't get any above 200...but pottery seems nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I briefly considered pottery for the spiritstones, but I think I will stick with blacksmithing instead. The new chain armor may not be as nice, but that new plate armor is definitely marketable.<br />
<br />
The spiritstones/faithstones are great now, but since they dont require blue diamonds they will flood the market fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could get alchemy and one other trade skill above 200.  Racial/class trade skills don't count towards the only-one-trade-skill-above-200 limit (like alchemy and tinkering).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">alchemy and tinkering hey.... so a Gnome Shammy could get 201+ tinkering, alchemy AND smithing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've almost cast my lot with smithing.<br />
<br />
I'm just about a bajillion pp short atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've got Tailoring going rather well and will likely continue.  If I had to start from 0 on Tailoring again...not sure I would. PIA trade, but one to be proud of.  Sorta wish all trades were like it.  Not too fond of 1 hour grandmastering pottery, fletching, etc. (exagerrating a bit :))<br />
<br />
If you go Smithing.  Make sure you hit the forges and at the very least max out banded (175) before the next patch. (should take less than 1kpp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Borgax,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on the 175.   I heard about this earlier today, and maxed it out.  It cost a LOT less than 1k.  I think I went from 112 to 175 for about 300p.<br />
<br />
So, I have to ask...where did you hear about the banded change for the next patch?  I've been trying to track that rumor down and let the rest of my guild know before someone has a nasty surprise.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The smithing trivial levels on FS and banded armor have been lowered on Test, which makes it likely the changes will go live next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*chuckle* Like to see someone gm pottery in an hour :)<br />
<br />
After 148 when you start needing dropped components it goes up alot slower. In fact It took me longer for 148-168 in pottery than it did 148-168 in smithing.<br />
<br />
Mastered most of the tradeskills now(haven't gotten started on tailoring as i am trying to bump smithing to 200 before the nerf on trivials). Gotta say pottery seems to be the best looking for me atm.<br />
<br />
Always wanted a tradeskill for my shaman that would let me gate to my hometo..</div></div><hr />
