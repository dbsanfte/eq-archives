<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiktak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For Kunark, months before I was talking about it, reading every bit of information on it and bought it the moment it came out.  It was a huge change to EQ, level 60!!!<br />
<br />
  Velious, while no more level changes, a whole knew vast world to explore with so many quests!!!<br />
<br />
  Luclin, biggest let down in the history of mankind.  If there is one thing you remember from the release, its the 3 months of PURE lag in all zones.<br />
<br />
  Planes of Powers, fufilling n00bies dreams everywhere!!! alowing anyone to have their own level 60 character with tons of AA points!!!!!  I was so shocked when &quot;The Karnors effect&quot; was able to spread to PoI PoN and PoD so quickly.  I like to refer to these zones as &quot;KIND to newbies&quot;  Karnors Innovation Nightmare Disease.<br />
<br />
  So on the eve of an expansion where there will be days of dreadful patching and repatching, 2 whooping spells!!! a whole 2!!!! and a bunch of zones for my alts to play in.  Oh wait a minute!!!! I left out charms ****!!! !!!!! !!!! !! ! ! ! ! !  ok honestly i dont care that much for charms, just makes my stats buffs even more useless.  Hmm i seem to be forgetting something about this expansion...........what could it possibly be...........well you can be a frog that starts in Grobb...........but thats complete bull**** and sony is too ****ing balless to give them any GOOD ability.  Look at Iksars, natural AC and regen, but they cant wear most kunark armors, i think the complains about the armor scared Sony to trying things like that to new races.  So they created the Kats of Norrath.  Completly useless horrible selection for any class besides good old roleplayers.<br />
<br />
  I sit here, ready to go explore new laggy zones where there will be 500 n00bs trying to farm ultra rare loots that will be nerfed with in a few weeks after release because they're too common and too easy to get.<br />
<br />
  And keeping the spirit of this evening N W O<br />
<br />
Thats the bottom line because Tiktak said so!!!!</div></div><hr />

Granted, from the previews we’ve been showed, things like new monsters and new spells are limited to say the very least, but the expansion still has things I like.  The extra bank space is on the top of my list. The new guild tool will make guild life a lot easier, especially for guild officers.  And I like the new froggie race.  <br />
<br />
If people are so jaded that they bitch and moan about new content, then that’s their problem.  I find new content to be exciting even if I don’t have use for it all.  If I wanted to play a static game that never changed I’d be playing Diablo online.</div></div><hr />

ROFL - do you have any idea how elitist you sound in your post?  And how silly it is to be elitist over a game than you have no more or less right to play than the next person with a few extra bucks to spend each month?  Are you just an &quot;EQ Legends&quot; wannabe on a &quot;Regular EQ&quot; beer budget (no offense Mill ;) )?<br />
<br />
More zones is always good - it relieves the pressure on other zones as a lot of folks head out to try their luck in the new worlds.  Crowd relief is always welcome.  New zones are always welcome.  A new race will be fun to try out.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, I'm not looking forward to the upcoming week (or more) of patches as this (probably) untested piece of software hits the streets. :(  And I suppose you will be one of the 2000 out of 2250 on a server trying to crowd into the new zones on the first day . . . Good luck with that! :D<br />

  Oh and to clarify, I'm looking forwards to the Bank space, the charms and the new zones to explore.  I wont make a Froglok for a few weeks because....well its just too flooded to actually have fun.<br />

I guess you had to play back in the days of pre kunark to understand how  simple the game has become now.  Didn't really sound eliteist to me, people have been complaining about this for years.<br />
<br />
Anyways, 5 new zones, and some minor enhancements hardly seems like something to call an expansion.  New bank space..../yawn, havent been to the bank in months.<br />
<br />
New race.... oh boy another 3 months of guild mates playing twinks instead of dedicating time to their mains that we worked hard to equip.<br />

The only thing I'm looking forward to is the guild managment function, which should be quite nifty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quit for about 2 years, beginning a few of months into SoV, after most servers had just started to clear NTOV, headed into Mischief, started Sleeper en mass etc.  60s were still rare at that time, and with the crappy exp rate (people took weeks to get through 59) if you met a 60 player, odds were that they were a decent player, and had probably seen a lot of the game<br />
<br />
but I read boards every once in a while and I assumed that people were engaging in hyperbole when they talked about noob players who leveled to 50+ in overthere, DL, and Karnors, and who had never been inside a dungeon<br />
<br />
lo and behold, I come back to eq a couple months into PoP and what do I see?  LITERALLY people I speak to who have NEVER been inside a dungeon.  cant find their way to seb from TT, cant get from FP to Highpass.  have never taken a boat anywhere, cant run from thurg to kael, can't find UP from DSP.<br />
<br />
people who lack basic skills, bards at 55 who dont know what charm kiting is, druids who forget to snare mobs every number of pulls, monk who think it's cool to out agro the tank.  these people are lvl 1-63.<br />
<br />
it's anti-intuitive, you'd think that skills would get passed down as the game matured and the playerbase would get smarter... after all this game aint rocket science, you basically have to know a half dozen things to play competently... but as the game as gotten easier, and leveling has gotten much easier people seem to have gotten lazy<br />
<br />
but this makes sense from a marketing perspective.  when I started playing (mainly day 1 of release, but some on my brother's beta account) there was a different type of player... more nerdy for sure, who'd probably been an active MUDer, beta tester for games or other techie.  EQ was hard but the players were smarter and more determined to explore the game.  One of the reasons no one wanted to throw money at MMPOG back in 1996 when smed started developing eq or even 97 when UO launched is... nerds dont make up a big percent of the populace and no one anticipated the game being popular with the masses.<br />
<br />
point is, yes EQ is dumber but that's the future of MMPOG.  to make money everyone has to be able to play and BE GOOD at the game.  The karnor, PoP mentality is the future of EQ, EQ2 and anything else that the SD office of SoE will produce evermore</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kinda with you that EQ is dumber/easier now. But its because of the way EQ is designed. Levels/AA/equipment matter much more than your &quot;skill&quot; and all of these things are implemented to take many MANY hours to get. And because of the extremely stupid decision of punishing deaths hard many players will realize that the best use of their time is to take the path of least resistance. You cant really blame anyone for that.<br />
<br />
For instance I think the Hole is an awesome looking zone and I would love to take my shaman/ranger duo on a trip there to see how far I can make it. But first problem is that the ranger cant get back out without some sort of port. Annoying. And then there is wierd pathing, aggro through walls, healing through walls and finally if I die somewhere deep inthere it could take a long long time to get the corpse back. So this combination of bugs, one-way passages and very hard CR makes it really not an option after all.<br />
<br />
This is what dumbs down EQ not the players. I know it sounds strange suggesting to make the game even &quot;easier&quot; but I really think it would make the game much more fun if they lessend the amount of exp you loose when dying and made it easier to get your corpse back. Of course this is not a problem for the ubers that can do anything they want but it is a problem for the adventurers amongst us.<br />
<br />
I seriously hope WoW somehow manages to be a more intelligent game that keeps people playing because of fun challenges and not because everything takes forever.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I dont wanna be a legend at anything, and my budget doesnt come in to play either, make good money and stuff. Just too lazy anymore to play the long sessions and hang out with lots of people. Why I playing a necro now, groups not needed. Only plane I will ever visit now is if they make a zone called &quot;Plane of Underacheivment&quot;<br />

Hmmm, gate potion comes to mind to get the ranger out. And CR isnt so bad at all, make a halfling rogue (brell follower), bind outside and wait for the action.<br />

 Hmm, this is a game is it not? Shouldn't people be free to have fun as they see fit? This little thing pissed me off to no end the one time I was in a  raid capable guild. Who's business is it anyay to tell people what characters they have to play?<br />
<br />
Sadly, it is EQ's fault, I understand where people get these ideas, I simply think it is silly. Can't imagine being locked in to one character forever because of others guilting me in to doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe that is why there is so much damn frustration in EQ, because people can't even think about doing something different, starting over, playing against the grain, without being shunned by the militant guilds out there, who kick ass on mobs.<br />
<br />
It is all perspective, I looted a braided cinch cord last night, and I felt all badass, haha! Just a few pixels different that getting billy's uber belt of ass smacking off mob_101 in temple of joe bob's horrors.<br />

<br />
There are always options, especially in The Hole, where a Brell Rogue can replace a Necromancer and their coffin stash.<br />
<br />
There is no sense of accomplishment grinding in PoP, I can count the times I've exp grinded in PoN on one hand. PoD I've done a bit more simply because there are usually guildies there.<br />
<br />
I get the most jollies from the &quot;Seb Group,&quot; me, Monk friend and Enchanter friend. The exp isn't nearly what you would get in PoP (not even AA) but it feels like much more of an accomplishment to dungeon crawl through the disco, facing challenges (as someone said, the game ain't rocket science but 8 Frogs will get the blood pumpin') and getting loots than it does standing against a zonewall in Po* casting Turgur's without ever having to actually move. Just ignore the big black bear rug at disco2.<br />
<br />
That's my favorite part about PoP, everyone is there.<br />
<br />
Regarding LoY, I don't really care. I'm past being pissy about Grobb and I could care less if people want a new toon to twink and run around in a bunch of new zones that target a level range that already has a bunch of empty zones.</div></div><hr />

Well, as a member of a guild who is pharming VT atm, I AM looking forward to all the patching!  It means faster upgrades for me and my homies!  Ideally, they would repatch every two days.  That would be about perfect.  *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
  There is no law that says you have to play the same damn character everyday for years.    <br />
<br />
No, but if you are in a high level guild you kinda have to play your main just to keep up!  I'm serious, u miss a couple days of raiding and you could be 3 or 4 flags behind!  Or you could have lost out on from 10 to 50 items that dropped!  Seriously, unless you are ready to quit your main anyway and no longer care, it's hard to make a switch to the twink since PoP came out.  <br />
<br />
[quote]  Cant be bother paying 20 dollars for some extra bankspace and the ability to dye my armour [quote]<br />
<br />
Well 20 bucks is absolutely nothing to me compared to the value of entertainment I get from this game.  Trust me folks, with most of us, it's never been about the money it costs to play EQ.  I figure this game has SAVED me probably $10,000 that I otherwise woulda spent in the bar or something over the last three years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I dont disagree that EQ has been superb value for money - doesnt mean I am gonna throw 20 dollars down the drain for an expansion that I dont believe has anything I want in it.

.<br />
Thats the problem with PoP. <br />
<br />
Last night we had 2 groups in Fear to finish up the Pally epic when we got jumped by about 10 MoBs.  No chanter and a TT and GL debuffing us to nothing.  Had to ghetto mez and kite stuff as the melees beat down the baddies.  After 20 min we finally got control and killed them all, with no deaths. <br />
<br />
You cant do that in PoP.  With MoBs that hit for 300+  your dead in 10sec.  You can't even get into situations that get even close to alot of the old world encounters cause SoE has designed PoP as either a zerg fest or a DL type situation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">EWWWW the attitude please.  Who can blame anyone for wanting to level as fast as possible when there is an overwhelming sense that the game doesn’t even start until you are 50+ (these days it’s closer to 60+)?  There are almost no guilds that raid below 50, it’s almost impossible to get a pick-up group to go to a dungeon zone and most of the worthwhile quests are for higher level so what is a sub 50 player to do?  Exp Grind.. So that’s what they do.  They grind, grind, grind, get to 50, join a guild and then go have fun.  No wonder so many at that level don’t know what the hell they are doing.  But it’s not because the game has been made easier, or leveling faster.  If you spend three months grinding from 1-50 in the standard zones you learn just as much as you would if you did the exact same thing, but it took you 6 months.<br />
<br />
With that in mind I think some of the recent changes have actually helped. Making it easier for lower level players to get to distant zones allows them to spread out and experience new and different content.  The LFG feature in the new expansion is another feature that should help sub 50 players broaden their horizons.  Think of all the wonderful dungeons for 25-40 level players that are completely empty most of the time.  The new LFG tool will allow new players to find other brave souls who want to do a little exploring and break out of the exp grind rut, not to mention a little diversion for your own character or alts.  <br />
<br />
So next time you are heading to Paludal or Dreadlands or Dawnshroud or LOIO with your alt grab a few noobs and head to a cool dungeon instead.  You might have to teach them a few things, but it’ll be a lot easier to teach em at 25 than 55.</div></div><hr />

That is a load of ****.  There are so many quests geared towards mid levels including full suits of armor.  On older servers there is very easy access to C3, HP buffs and free equipment.  This ruins the early aspect of the game.  I remember when I started playing EQ I was freaking when I got MAGIC!!! Mesh armor for my ranger.  I never tried to hard core game my old characters, I slowed down, had some fun, got my self a full suit of Ivy Etched, got a Short Sword of Morin got that other Spear thing, and camped everything I wanted. <br />
<br />
  Dont let the low game pass you by, once you're 60, everything else becomes &quot;easy&quot; and boring.  I could never restart and have the same fun I did that first year.  Now I have fun in a different aspect of the game, the high level.  I left a large, good guild, to go join a smaller closer nit guild thats fun to be in.  <br />

Play the way you want to play.  If you want to hang out in K-I-N-D go for it, ill still think less of you, but if you want to try something challenging, I'll respect you.<br />
<br />
There is a level 60 paladin on my server that is hella annoying but I respect how he plays the game.  He will not get level 61, or go to PoP until he is satisfied with the strength of his character.  He wants all of his skills maxed, trade skills maxed, and so on.  He plays the game to have the most fun that he can at his level, He and his character benefits from this.<br />
<br />
Another friend is a level 59 bard.........who played the KIND way........you can see where this is going.  I can twist 2 songs!!!!<br />
<br />
Oh well, have fun arguing over everything.  And if you've got nothing productive to say, shut the hell up.</div></div><hr />

I'm doing it myself.  I played a 59 monk Pre-Luclin, fairly uber with ToV stuff (Was the second or third monk on the server in terms of equipment)  And deleted one day because of a brain fart.<br />
<br />

I have no problem with fast experience.  I DO, however, have a problem with the newbies that rush up and don't learn their character and we suffer because of it.<br />

One flying example would be: Here (http://www.berthall.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=7794) <br />

Warning, it may get a little vulgar.<br />

Fast experienec is great.  I love it.  I went to level 31 in less than a week (And I'm burned out now, I've taken a break again =p).  It's just that it works against the experienced players when they're dying left and right because their cleric doesn't know how to heal.  Or their warrior doesn't know the concept of mez.  Or their enchanter summons a pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to sound elitest, but after playing since April 1999, I have a basic idea of what is needed from the classes to get the job done.  And I expect my group members to know how to play decently also.  I don't see anything wrong with wanting to go somewhere in terms of experience.</div></div><hr />

As a guild leader the guild management tool is great. YaY to booting the 300 twinks added over the years /grin!<br />
<br />
More bank space is nice, added invo slot so I can get mo HPs, to riding a leeezard instead of a horse!=p<br />
<br />
I took my friend out to lunch today and spent 25 bucks... 20 bucks for more fun online with EQ well worth it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">/shrug.  I've always said killing any mob in EQ is about the same as killing any other mob.  Just some you can kill solo or in a small group, and the others you have to have a huge number of people and wait around for hours before you actually do anything.</div></div><hr />
