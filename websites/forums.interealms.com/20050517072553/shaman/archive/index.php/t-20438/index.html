<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">last night me and several other shaman hada sit down, and talked. <br />
i came up with this idea. it was met with both &quot;omgz thats cool!&quot; and<br />
&quot;would be nice to have&quot;.<br />
<br />
the idea is.<br />
Spirit Rending (or Soul Rending, spirit assault)<br />
it will cost 4/8/12/16 (this should replace our GoD endurance aa, seeing as how we does not effect endurance)<br />
<br />
casting time : 3 seconds<br />
refresh : 1 hour 15 minutes<br />
effect: each level of the aa, increases the life to damage ratio to wich you do when you &quot;suicide&quot; your life points into a target.<br />
its sorta like the necro lifeburn.<br />
first lvl damage to life will be .35, then scaling up too 1.25 when one fully maxed out.<br />
this will NOT bring you to 1, infact, it will kill you. a rez will fix that, but each time you use it, you permanently lose 1% exp.<br />
its unresistable. <br />
it is not effected by focus effects, save one extended range. the damage will be done over 3 ticks. so a heal over time will havea chance to save you (very low infact, because the aggro from this spell WILL kill you anyway)<br />
cast on you : soandso has Rent you with the spiritual assault<br />
you cast it : your life expels into a spiritual assualt<br />
<br />
a fully buffed elemental shaman is around 6-7k hps. will do average 5k each tick for three ticks.<br />
this will make those extra &quot;useless&quot; shamans on raids usefull &quot;ends&quot; to a raid mob.<br />
it will add dps that we WOULD have had with dots (can't use them, resist rates and aggro associated with them is rediculous) in a 3 tick burst towards the end of a mobs life.<br />
<br />
this is a very good endgame aa, most shaman still raiding velious told me &quot;i wouldn't use it for the simple fact my Hps aren't that high, and im more needed to just live&quot; while a shaman about to enter time said &quot;man that sounds good, but you sure you have to lose ex and die ?&quot;<br />
<br />
gimme some feed back. i wanna hear what you think. o by the way.<br />
this would encourage guilds to actually have thier shaman in on TRIALS and other encounters where we are useless, its basically the shamans' &quot;ACE&quot; up his sleeve.</div></div><hr />

otherwise pretty cool, I am certain you could get away with this bad boy and live in a lot of circumstances and dont see what the obsession with shaman and all these suicidal aa ideas is. necro LB got enhanced when necros kept dying to frenzie why the hell should shaman get the same type of aa and not be allowed to live?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No offense, you obviously put some thought into this, but I'm not sure why so many people have a sudden infatuation with unrezzable deaths, or deaths at all.  The berserker forums are rampant with them.   Maybe you think that SOE will give it some thought since it has obvious drawbacks to using and maybe that would keep it from becoming overpowering, but there are better ways of balancing than causing unrezable character death from a skill use.<br />
<br />
Whats next?  &quot;Breath of Discord - you can kill any mob in game, but you can never play your shaman again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Forgive my negativity, but there have to be better ways to improve the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I don' t think its that bad of an idea, because if I follow you correctly, then when you would use this ability your health would drop to 66%, then 33%, then dead, over 3 ticks. But a simple heal will prevent you from dying. Q yourself just before, and maybe throw in a tnargs if you have to.<br />
<br />
It's not bad. For the higher shamans that would = a good bit of damage. However, that is the only people it would appeal to. I myself am doing the GoD trials atm(vxed/tipt) and I feel almost worthless. And I hear that further in, entire zones are unslowable. Great, who will want a shaman there? WIth this they might actually take you just so they have that extra dmg on a boss mob...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i see what your saying but, the mana burn for wizards is never used.<br />
its more of a &quot;FLASHY&quot; thing, a wizard can do more damage with nukes than with manaburn, necro's get alot of use out of LB, but we have nothing that catches the eyes of people in almost anyway.<br />
crits on DoTs are sent straight to you, not emoted.<br />
<br />
and on the edurance matter, i think its just gunna stay a HP heal, because seriously, SoE dev's aren't too worried about the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">see what i said, some loved it, others were like &quot;***&quot;<br />
this aa i suggested is just that a suggestion.<br />
something to roll around in your head to start your own ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">um when ever you die an exp death you permanently lose 4% exp...since the highest res you can get is 96%.<br />

<br />
You don't lose 4% exp, you lose 4% of about 6% at level 65 or 0.24% total exp per death. This is why I find it funny when people bitch about say a 90% res, post 60 thats 90% of 6%, even pre 60 its 90% of 10%. Yup you're losing a whole 0.36% over a full res, but deal. Oh and 96% isn't the highest, but using a 100% res to get exp back is a waste, its used after looting gear to get mana back/cancel res effects. <br />
<br />
As for the idea as a whole I don't really like it. Theres a class with a suicide skill in FFXI and I think its pretty lame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello all,<br />
<br />
     Getting back on topic, Kurth I actually think the idea is pretty cool. It gives a reward/risk combination that has a shaman feel to it. I like the idea of doing more with my hit points. Let's face it, we barter our hitpoints every cast of canni, every cast of turgur's, every click of the cann5 hotkey... I use my hit points to tank, make mana, etc. Why not use them for some damage as well? Granted, the idea can use some work, and I am certain people would rather see balencing issues addressed (and certain AA's we already have fixed/revamped/altered) over AA idea's being implemented. But there's no way to break new ground then to innovate and dream is there?<br />
<br />
Let me contribute, and perhaps hijack the thread with my modification of the idea. I'm going to take it in another direction, but keep the same feel. Check it out<br />
<br />
Spirit Channeling 5/10/15<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
This grants the shaman the ablilty for a short time to fuel his spells with supernatural haste, and negating the cost of the spells at the cost of the shaman's life force.<br />
<br />
How it works:<br />
When you activate this AA, after a casting time (2 secs maybe?) for the next 7/16/30 seconds. All spells you cast will have a 30/45/60% spell haste applied to it. The lowest a spells casting time can be reduced to is 1 second. All recast time for spells during the period of time in which this AA is active is reduced to 0. No mana cost is deducted from the shaman's mana pool for any spells casted by the shaman during this period of time. After a successfully casted spell, the shaman would instead take damage equal to twice the amount of the mana cost of the spell. When this AA is active it will take up a buff slot (and operate much like Quiesscense does) and may end the effect by clicking it off or simply waiting for it to expire. <br />
<br />
So what do you think? This idea incapsulates both Kurth's idea of trading life for damage (although not so directly), but offers much more versitility then the original suggestion. I imagine that in a situation where you need bring some dps, you could activate this AA and begin chain casting Velium Strike, or use it to get that incoming crowd of mobs malos/slowed, act as super spot heals for a few seconds, etc, etc. Of course I believe the idea could use some tuning, but that's the whole reason I decided to share it with you all. <br />
<br />
Please, critique but don't flame or bring in any other trolling to the thread.<br />

<br />
and yeah I forgot the math on 96% res but eitherway coding in perma exp loss would be a headache the devs dont want to deal with I am sure, since its NOT like sacrifice where you simply cant get a res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OOOOOOHKAAAAAAAY this is not overpowered at all, nope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     Thanks. It's an AA idea I've been rolling around in my thinking cap for awhile. I like the potiential versitility an ability like that could bring to almost any situation. <br />
<br />
@Khozik:<br />
<br />
     While I respect your opinion that the AA idea in it's current form may be overpowered, you neglected to contribute anything meaningful to the thread in the form of critque/refinement of the idea so it's more balencing (at least in your mind). If you care to post why it's so unbalencing and perhaps what could be changed to make it less so, then I'd like to hear it. Otherwise, please let people who care to contribute in a meaningful way take the floor on this thread.<br />

Giac here is your slightiest hint.  <br />
<br />
And yes many of the players are spitting off nonsense that they don't see as planned for EQ in Gates of Discord. <br />
<br />
Patch March 10th 2004<br />
&quot;The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes. You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power. We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.<br />
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines.&quot;<br />
<br />
Main tanking high DPS mobs in an end encouter.  Endurance will be shaped better to reflect the need for guilds to manage these areas of GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Indalecio hmm that is a really interesting idea that would give us the ability to burst DPS or Burst heal as needed ... you have to have a pretty long refresh timer as you could go indefinately like this <br />
ex.<br />
VS 1 or 2x, heal self 1 or 2 x, VS 1 or 2 times,ect <br />
<br />
with getting casting time down to ~3 sec for VS and ~1-2 sec for Tunargs this would be a bit over powered for a 30 sec duration<br />
(or at least SoE would think so)<br />
<br />
... or have it so that during the duration you cannot be healed directly (like DA) but hots and regen would still heal and could land (unlike DA)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">@Sownow:<br />
<br />
     I see your concern, and I've been thinking about what I would set the ablility refresh rate to. I'm trying to find a number that would be low enough to go for maximum recycle and regularly improve dps or the like, but yet be high enough so you'd have to think about saving it for severe situations. If I had to take an initial stab at refresh time, I'd say 15 minutes sound like a number that meets these needs. <br />
<br />
     As for the 30 second max duration being overpowered, you may be right. What do you think the maximum duration of the AA should be? If I had to pick a number, I'd tenitively say 20 seconds would be a comfortable maximum.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that you're taking damage from every spell you cast with a mana cost during this time. If you have to heal yourself, you have to waste at least 1 second doing so plus the damage is factored in AFTER a spell is successfully casted. So let's say I activated the AA, and Velium Striked a couple times. I want to heal myself now, so I'm going to Tnarg's Myself. I get healed for 1300, but now since the spell has been successfully casted, I take damage equal to twice the mana cost of the spell. Tnarg's mana cost is 450, and 450*2 is 900 damage. So, I've wasted precious active AA time to heal myself for a net total of (1300-900=400) 400 hit points. I haven't even brought myself another cast of Velium Strike with that (which comes out to 600 damage per cast). <br />
<br />
The only other way I'm going to heal myself is with Quiescence. Ok, I cast Q, it lands, I take 468 damage. Q will be able to heal me at that point, but I'm wasting time waiting for the ticks to hit. Unless I moderate my casting and/or Chain Tnarg's myself to a comfortable life total, I'm going to have to be careful. I cannot just blast away until the time runs out, I must be strategic. <br />
<br />
Of course, someone could always take up the task of healing me during the active time of my ability, however, that's one person healing me that was supposed to be doing something else. The easiest comparison I can draw would be the Enchanter's charm ablility. Chanters can charm mobs for massive dps, but it's very hard for the chanter to keep the mob under control by his/herself. The group, or raid realizes this and aids the chanter by debuffing the resists of the mob, snaring the mob, rooting/tanking/mezzing it when the charm breaks, etc. Playstyle is altered because the benefit of having the Chanter charm is worth more then the effort of helping the Chanter with the Charm upkeep. Thus, having another person/s heal me during the active time of this ability doesn't make it broken. It merely streamlines the process of using the ablilty.<br />
<br />
I devised this AA to be workable in a solo, group and raid setting, with obvious strenghs and weaknesses given your setting, and current situation with gear, focus effects, AA's and playstyle. The more your shaman progresses in terms of these attributes the better this AA will be. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your comments. Others?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In truth, I would much prefer to see our current spells upgraded to keep in line with the new content we are encountering.<br />
However, if we are just shooting the ****, I think an ability that let you disperse your mana to all your group members much like divine arbitration does for hitpoints(except it is only your mana to all group members)would be cool, situational, not overpowering and finally give us some form of group mana regen(although not much). In most cases it would take an average shaman's mana pool, say 3kish and give 600mana to ea group member(regardless of melee or caster). In high end situations, 5-6k mana pool could provide up to 1k mana to ea caster in the group but leave the shaman manaless, or even 'spent from the ordeal' by having their spells greyed out for a period. A last ditch situational spell or aa ability. You could call it, Smells Like True Spirit or whatever.<br />
<br />
Oh, and using it makes you die with an unrezzable corpse? jk.<br />
<br />
Another spell I would like to see is Daluda's Spiritual Locomotive. It is a zonewide ae the shaman casts that causes 5 points of damage and gives sow to all npc's in the zone it is cast in. Ok, it's not very useful but would be a helluva lot of fun to watch.  ok, jk again.</div></div><hr />
