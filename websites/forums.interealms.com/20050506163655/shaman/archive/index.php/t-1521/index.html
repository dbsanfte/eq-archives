<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at my initiate and disciple symbols of cazic thule (which cast spook the dead, and panic animal) recently, and noticed that they have added iksar to the races that can use the symbols.. so what I'm wondering since they bothered to add iksar to them finally, did they add a regent of cazic thule symbol quest somewhere recently? that perhaps cast normal fear?  I picked cazic thule as my deity on the expectation, that by the time i hit 55+ they would probably have added in the regent of cazic thule fear casting item.. I mean it's been 1.5 years since they added the disciple and initiate quests from what I understand, you'd think they might get around to it.  Wow, it would rock to get the snare spear from veeshan's peak, and be able to fear kite while also being able to slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doubt it, I think they changed those the same time they changed the iksar cudgels to be fleshy usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fear on a clicky item would officially make Innoruuk for the snare clicky item the choice of dinosaurs and Cazic Thule the best choice of dieties. :p Since I'm not either, I just hate you all. ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It makes sense that the third symbol would have the 4th Level Necromancer spell Fear (18 seconds duration) on it, to match Clinging Darkness on the Innoruuk symbol. I'm sure it would have its uses, but I think it would be fairly balanced by the fact that, without a really good snare, you're not going to be doing much dungeon fearing.<br />
<br />
Any ideas for what the later Rallos Zek and Tribunal symbols should cast? Here are some I could think of:<br />
<br />
Tribunal: Hammer of Wrath, Summon Heatstone (makes sense for the race), Elemental Defender<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek: Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III (I know, pretty boring, but would be good to open a fight with)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fear + Spear of Construction = endless fear kiting.<br />
<br />
I already know a shaman who uses his spear of constriction and then his panic animals necklace to fear kite in ME and WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've found uses for spook the dead/panic animals many times, especially when teamed with a ranger (btw you can go back and get the first symbol after getting the second one, that is why I have both).  Since verant is going back and fixing 2 year old &quot;bugs&quot;, and hurting our abilities, here's hoping that they go and finish 2 year old quests to actually do some good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How hard will it be for me to get the factions to do these quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It isn't that hard to faction Paineel as an Iksar. <br />
<br />
Just spend some time in The Warrens and Stonebrunt killing Kobold's and you'll eventually get the faction you need for the quests.<br />
<br />
Of course the easiest way is to go guard killing in Erudin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the yaulp currently on the RZ symbol is ridiculous, and i hope they don't continue that line. IF they do, i'd suggest:<br />
<br />
Yaulp 4, cast time 0.5<br />
<br />
sounds like a lot maybe, but anything less with a 'normal' casting time would be pointless and never used. yaulp 4 isn't that powerful afterall.<br />
<br />
or maybe they could upgrade it to a small stun maybe (Cease or Stun) or something else. just please make it remotely useful.</div></div><hr />
