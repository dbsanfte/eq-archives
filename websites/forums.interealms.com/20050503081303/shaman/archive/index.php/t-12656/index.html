<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oxobos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm sure this has been discussed numerous times but i wasn't able to find any other threads.  i'm pretty new to eq, only been playing for five months now and i have pretty decent gear for my lvl (49).  i was talking to a higher lvl shammy the other day and he told me that i need to save the 8500pp and buy a horse, it would be the best investment i could make.  can somebody please tell me why having a horse is so good and is it worth the 8500pp?  it's taken me a very long time to save up the 8500pp it's going to cost to buy one.  any and all help is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A horse or a lizard mount is the best investment you can make if you hunt outdoors, and as most of the tier 1 and tier 2 zones are outdoor zones, you'll be spending a lot of time outdoors. The reason is, as long as you aren't moving or attacking, you are meditating. At your level, you may still be meleeing but at some point, our melee capabilities are so pathetic that many of us don't turn autoattack on any more. I stopped sometime in my 50's. I still tanked mobs. I just didn't swing a weapon. ;) Another, and possibly more important reason, is that a mount allows you to swap spells without drawing sitting aggro. This is very handy, as haste or regen or something is always fading, so it's important to be able to swap a spell without getting the mob's attention. Sony is a bit wishy-washy about whether or not the meditation benefits are &quot;intended&quot; but even if that was taken away, the absence of sitting aggro is still useful. As far as which to buy, horse or lizard, I personally like the lizard better since the head is always out of the way. True, you can always shrink yourself down twice on a horse to get the head to disappear, but with the lizard, it's not an issue. The base price for the lizard is slightly higher though, as all the colors cost the same. Whichever you decide to get, I think you'll enjoy having it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speaking from personal experience, I have just recently bought a horse.  I was holding out because I didn't know if it was worth it or not, but after grouping in PoP and seeing the massive aggro of slow and then not being able to sit down till the mob was 50% without drawing aggro.  I will definately say it was worth the 9k, not only due to the extra mana regen, but also the lack of aggro you get for medding/memming spells.</div></div><hr />
