<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... what?<br />
<br />
They want us to show solidarity, so I have to ask, what would our new direct heal be? What number of hit points for how much mana? What is the recast? What heal would make us all happy?<br />
<br />
If we can show them exactly what we want, apply it to the data we have, and prove it won't be overpowering, we can help them help us.<br />
<br />
So ... what do you want, exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, we wanna be unique.  How bout a super quick heal for spot healing/saving lives.  Like 1 sec....<br />
<br />
And to prevent the uber vs goober argument, don't have the heal a set number.  Have it be 20% of the life of the receipient.  So if you are healing a 10k warrior, it will be 2000.  If it's a 6k chanter, it will be 1200.<br />
<br />
If it's a 5k warrior (yikes), heals for 1000.<br />
<br />
Just an idea, be gentle....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1800 heal with a 1 second cast time and 5 second recast OR a 1800 heal with a 3.75 second cast time, IF they implement the Spirit Shifting AA suggested by veeshanMurtak in the thread &quot;A summary of Shaman problems&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Want to see some SUPER happy high level shaman?<br />
<br />
Make ONE change to an EXISTING spell and you will THRILL them.<br />
<br />
Change cast time on Mending of Kragg as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Cast time = 10 - ((Levelofcaster - 58) * .66)<br />
<br />
So, at Level 58, when we first get the spell, cast time is 10 seconds.  No change to what already exists.  But as the level of the caster increases, the cast time DECREASES.  <br />
<br />
At level 65, cast time on Mending of Kragg would be 5.38 seconds . . . and that is BEFORE any Focus effects or AA's kick in.<br />
<br />
This would have the effect of not rendering &quot;lower&quot; level shaman overly powerful yet still give those struggling post 65 shaman the help the so desparately need.<br />
<br />
Just my $.02</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty sure focus effects dont count for percentage heals. I could be wrong tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make that -1 second per level over 58 and it would be a good heal - your proposal heals a tiny amount more per time then Tnarg's (5% more) and takes longer until the initial hit, thus it is less of a patch heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i like that heal a % of max  target hp idea, could give to all preist .<br />
cleric get a heal 80%, druid 60% shaman 40%. not a heal that percentage, but takes it from thier max hp. this way it scales with the person you healing too:) corse might need fiddling with but i like the idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Sudedor's idea. I think that would work best in the long run  :p <br />
Piwacket Magicat =^.^=<br />
Heart of Bristlebane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Remove the percentage portion of Kragg then so that Focus would kick in.  Just make it a strait 1900 pt heal.  Maybe switch the level requirements around a bit.<br />
<br />
The real point I want to get across is that we don't necessarily need to have a &quot;new&quot; spell, just some tweaking of what we already have.<br />
<br />
Yes, perhaps -1 second per level would be fine.  I just used .66 per level to illustrate the point of scaling the speed of Kragg as level increases and the player gets closer to the zones and encounters where speed counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, perhaps -1 second per level would be fine.  I just used .66 per level to illustrate the point of scaling the speed of Kragg as level increases and the player gets closer to the zones and encounters where speed counts.<br />
And I am saying it needs to be more to be viable ;) . Of course if we ever get another 5 levels added Kragg's would then cast in negative 1 seconds, crashing servers left and right.<br />
I just do not see the need to add complicated coding like that when you can just add a new spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If that coding is considered complex they need to fire all their coders.  Today.<br />
<br />
Why not take something useless (like Kragg) and make it useful.  The more pieces to the puzzle the harder it is to put together.  Adding a new spell would simply create more pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do we even know the structure of the game allows for spell haste dependant on level? This is not some small 1000-lines-of-code program that you can change on a whim - there is things that have been thought of in advance - such as adding new spells and there is things that require a reworking of the game engine.<br />
<br />
Now, I am not sure if scaling a spell's casting time with level requires recoding parts of the game engine but I simply fail to see why anyone would want to make Kragg's scale that way if we could just add a new heal with whatever numbers we want - which we know would work.<br />
<br />
The one thing speaking for a scaling Kragg's is that it would continue to scale with more levels - in which case it would probably be instantly broken.<br />
<br />
Edit: I disagree with Kragg's being useless. It is a fine spell at 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">By that arguement how do we know it does NOT allow for such a change?<br />
<br />
Outside the box man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Keep it simple, I say.  1800 hp Tnargs upgrade, same cast/recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
Keep it even simpler.  Give us Sylvan Infusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Live).<br />
Not much coding work there, just cut and paste to shaman 65 &amp; change the name to Kragg's Infusion or something like that.  Focus effects work on it &amp; I'd be happy.  We won't be replacing clerics or druids in GoD with it, but this would be an effective blast heal.<br />
<br />
We still won't be in the druid Cheal chain on raids, but we WILL BE effective patch/blast healers.  It is level 65, make it drop on a GoD trial (where it will be most needed), and I think the majority of our healing problems would be solved (Breath of Trushar still needs fixing) WITH a minimal amount of work necessary from SoE. <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sudedor: Thinking out of the box is fine when you can actually gain someting by doing so. There is no need to make adjustments in a roundabout way, the coding of which may or may not be supported, if you can implement anything we have asked for so far just fine within the current system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I thought I had a pretty good idea from this thread...thinking outside of the box, but not many folks responded.<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20166<br />
<br />
I still think it's a good and balanced idea and some folks agreed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont see where that spell is any different than the incomplete heals already in the game - except that yours is 65% instead of 75%, and yours has a 3.5 second cast. They work the same way. It heals a maximum percentage or a maximum hp amount - you just listed the percentage first.<br />
<br />
Yours is 5000 heal or 65%, with a 3.5 second cast.<br />
<br />
Druids best incomplete heal now is 4680 or 75%, with a 10 second cast.<br />
<br />
Think yours is a bit too much to ask for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">read his suggestion again - it is not like the current incomplete heals - its does no heal FOR up to 65%, it heals TO 65%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">actually in is original post his does say up to a max of 5k, i disagreed with that part and think that it should just heal to 65% no cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think these &quot;TO x% heals&quot; are useless. Shamans stack bad enough as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yes to be honest the new changes to heal are almost the amount i want, though an aa to aid HoT would be handy, or let then be affected by aa we got.<br />
to be honest backup healer is all i want, i hoping theyll look at are damage abilities now as dots have problem for short fights too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1200HP heal upfront<br />
300 per tick for 4 ticks.<br />
4 times the Aggro of a normal Heal spell.<br />
<br />
Cast 1.0 secs, recast 3.0 secs for 600 mana ...<br />
<br />
That would only just save a chanter or tank and bring the mob down on top of us (untill the chanter could land the Mez or tank could regain the aggro).<br />
<br />
Its effectively swapping out HPs (thru aggro) to whomever needs it.<br />
<br />
The other idea I liked was an AA for a transfer of 2000HPs for Shaman to targeted PC ... insta cast, but on a 60+ sec timer.<br />
<br />
Both of those would suffice for fast emergency heals ... 3.7sec cast on Tnarg's just don't cut it no more ....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Akerius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">so is this thread just about end game upgrade heals? cuz i think that midgame should be changed around too. i just think that a priest healer class having the same best heal as a hybrid, paly, kinda sucks. shaman get greater healing at 29 and then superior healing at 50something. 51 i think? palys get greater healing at 39. so for 12 levels or so a priest heals as well as a hybrid. but shaman also get the heal over time that snares and slows the target right? yeah it heals, but has a big side effect. chain casting canni2 while trying to slow mobs and heal the tank and trying my hardest to stay above zero mana. then after a few pulls need to take a med break cuz oom and low health.<br />
<br />
i say we should get better fast heals and the imcomplete heal be moved up to 80 or 90 percent or atleast cap at 5 or 6k cuz 1.9k wont cut it. thats just 26% of complete heal's cap. yeah 75% or 5.5k hp incomplete heal. and maybe get superior heal at 44. clerics get greater heal 5 lvls b4 shaman. why not have them get superior heal 10 levels before shamans instead of 17 lvls b4. not like it will be a threat to clerics. clerics will still have the better heals and even the group heals and complete heal. i have both a cleric and a shaman and i know if my cleric had trouble being the group's healer, a druid or shaman would probly have an even harder time. <br />
<br />
so basicly higher cap for 75% heal that is more along the lines of 75% of the cap on complete healing. and get better patch/fast heals so that we can heal more than just a lil better than hybrids.</div></div><hr />
