<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in bit of a muddlement trying to figure out which one of these I want.. I have the Shimmering Terror Hide, but since I like tanking.. would the extra 11 raw AC be worth banking the Terror Hide? <br />
<br />
I've done a search through the forums on Chetari but while few people recommend it, I just wanted to see some discussion on the choice.<br />
<br />
Now, understand during raids and such on ToV I would definitely wear the Terror Hide, but for normal grouping and solo'ing is the AC better?<br />
<br />
Even in raids, I'm normally the only Shaman present.. however, on the big raids we have a lvl 60 that can normally make it if that makes a difference in the discussions.<br />
<br />
btw.. Magelo is:<br />

Also, other minor concerns:<br />
Mask... Bone mask or Spider eyes?<br />
Range... Stone Idol or Goranga?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you tanking a lot? Are you fighting AE mobs? are you fighting high level mobs where the AC makes little difference?<br />
<br />
imo 11 ac makes little difference compared to 50 hp for example. I dont worry about wis at all really as long as im over 175 but then I have torpor and c3 on nearly all guild raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I'd wear the shimmering cloak over a bonecrafted shield as far as the hp/ac was concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Currently i am a big fan of the Shield of Arisen Cultist<br />

<br />
its good balance between ac hp and resists. I picked one up for 100pp which i think was a mispricing. If you think of it as a shield it is quite weak. but as a back slot item it's quite good. phatties cannot wear unfortunately. but iskars and barbies can wear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Split the difference get a ancient seahorse cloak.20 ac 25 hps.Not so much of a sting from the hp loss of shimmering and still get the AC benefits youre looking for.You know better then anyone what your normal play style is.If youve decided a AC boost is in order then i wont dispute ya. But gaining 12 raw Ac processed to 18 on your stats for the cost of only 25 hps and 4 str and 4 dex which are about worthless for ya anyways seems like a no brainer to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am pretty sure you cant even use the chetari shield. Its small races only. <br />
<br />
Get a Cloak of the Maelstrom or a Ancient Seahorse if you want hp's and want to spend under 5k.</div></div><hr />
