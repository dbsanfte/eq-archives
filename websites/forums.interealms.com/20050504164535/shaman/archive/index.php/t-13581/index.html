<br />
Still, I can't see anyone getting groups at 55 in tier 2, unless its with a close group of friends. Most likely the only level 55s will be 2-boxed with a 65 to PL them. So hopefully it'll be kinda self-regulated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">guys, there is no elitist attitude in saying people should be 60 for PoV...at least if the guy saying that is thinking about the difficulty of the zone, not about thinking 'lev 55 are newbs'<br />
<br />
I can understand some classes could be usefull in a group in PoV at lev 55...BUT, for some it would be deadly for the group...<br />
<br />
i.e.: a 55 war: it s already difficult with some warriors level 60-65 to keep them alive when you have an unslowed mob hitting them before being slowed...and usually they can t keep aggro and then the ench gets hit a lot...without arcane rune and with less then 1500 hp he will be squizzed quickly...<br />
<br />
I think there are very good people at level 55, but the problem is the zone IS very dangerous and the ability of the group to survive and the speed of the group to make xp is dependant usually on the weakest link of the chain...if that link is too weak, I can predict a lot of problems...<br />
<br />
Of course you can always say I know one 55 war that is better equiped than some 65 war..., but if we are talking about an average, then 55 is low for tier 2</div></div><hr />

Screw you!  First off I suggested 60+ for tier 2, not for all PoP.  Further how am I an elitist if I am in favor of the flag removal?  If you think a 55 shaman, for example, can reliably slow level 62 golems in PoV, you're full of it.  I've seen people under 60 lfg in Valor and just get laughed at - a 55 simply can't contribute to a group fighting mobs 7 levels his senior.</div></div><hr />

My group is mostly level 60, but one is only 58 - so I'm so elitist I'll be excluding myself from these zones until all my group is ready.<br />
<br />
Lower level chars have a wider choice of places to hunt now than they have ever had, and those places have to cater for a small fraction of the pre PoP population.  We don't need access to tier2/tier3 and its going to get crowded in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 55 is only good for one class really in Tier 2, and that is Clerics.  Shaman won't be able to slow at 55.  Level 55 tanks in Tier 2 would be nothing but mana sponges.  Any melee class would be hindered in dmg output.<br />
<br />
If you are below 60 in Tier 2 now, you probably will sit LFG for a long time.<br />
<br />
Also, if you think you belong in Tier 2 at level 55, then you really need to get a clue.  At 55, you would be nothing more than a liability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, if you think you belong in Tier 2 at level 55, then you really need to get a clue.  At 55, you would be nothing more than a liability.<br />
That's not for you to decide. That's for the &quot;group of friends of the level 55&quot; to make that determination/judgement call. And if they're really friends (RL or very close guild companions) I doubt they'd tell the level 55 &quot;you're too low level for us, we don't want you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just because someone isn't &quot;level 60 with a buttload of AA's and uber gear&quot; doesn't mean their friends won't want them along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Valg yer the only one who thinks 55's should be in tier 2.  That should tell you something... idiot.</div></div><hr />

I'm the &quot;only level 55 shaman in the entirety of everquest&quot; who thinks that way. Why not remove the blinders and realize that not &quot;every level 55&quot; posts here.<br />

<br />
If people want have a 55 in their group killing 62+ mobs, that's up to them - I see no problem with it if they want do it. A 55 in the group could well be better than having a gap in that group, though in some cases they could be more liability than help.<br />
<br />
At least with the restrictions being 55/62, not 60/65, people have that choice.<br />
<br />
Finaljustice, did your guildie know whether someone can get into the previously flagged zones earlier than levels 55/62 if they still get flagged, as before? Or is the level restriction a hard one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree with Mardark.  I mean, if 90% of the mobs con red to you, you should not be in the zone.<br />
<br />
60/62 would seem reasonable for Tier2/3.<br />
<br />
In reality, until you hit 61, there is no real need to explore Tier2.  Tier1 will give fantastic experience at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">55/62 is fine. More than Fair.<br />

I love how people say You have to be this level to do something..<br />
<br />
I was in seblis at level 42. The first week of Kunark. The paladin we had went LD... So I tanked. Sure it hurt like hell. So what. It was a challange.<br />
<br />
I will gladly invite My level 55 guildies to Storms. Sure some people will say they cant contribute. Those are the same damn people who say all we can do is shut up and slow and go sit in a corner. <br />
<br />
Is there more risk having a 55 tank In storms. Yes. Will he get the snot beat out of him. Yes. But, the benifit of saying sure come group with us, rather than go LFG you casual Punk ass newb, far outweighs a death or 7. <br />
<br />
Plus at level 55 They won't be 55 for long in Storms or Valor.<br />
<br />
Oh and I have landed slows On +7 level mobs just fine. So has ever other shaman that has uttered the words Hey yall... Watch this... (Grins)<br />
<br />
There will be more people in your prescious zones. And for a littel while it will be more dangerous. So?  Maybe you will meet the people ballsy enough to play there at 55, and find that they can be fun to play with.<br />

<br />
The difference between level 62 and 65 is huge. New spells for casters, new damage tables for melee. If you really think it's &quot;0.001% better&quot;  or &quot;only 5% less dps&quot;, then you're nuts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Notice how the only person stating that a 60+ cap would be unfair is under 60? As a shaman, in bad gear, with no AA's it is EASY to level to 60 in tier 1. Groups have to have you. If you are in tier 2 you are a liability, you can't slow almost anything, you have a small mana pool, no useful heals, lower end buffs, and are taking a slot away from a shaman who EARNED the right to be there by leveling.<br />
<br />
You have no business being there powerleveling, because again, with the crowded nature of PoV and most servers, you are just taking exp away from people who put the time in to get the levels needed to be effective there.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with anyone being elitist, so you can drop that attitude right now, it has to do with the fact that this game is, for the most part, designed to be done in steps... skipping steps can often mean you are gimping someone elses chances to a degree. Level up to 61 - 62 in tier 1, then move up. You'll find if you go to tier 2 to early, and do get a group, you won't be effective, and therefore, if any of the people who where in that group hear you shouting for a group, they are going to suggest that you can't do you job, even thought you may have leveled up since then.</div></div><hr />

So much hate.  So many unhappy people.  Has EQ turned us into this?  The flame factor seems to have gotten out of hand lately.  Is there no new content to discuss?  Is all that's left to EQ message boards -constant squabbles over the length of the stick our carrot dangles from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">55 is fine for Tier 2, You have to realize, POP mobs have gimp AC. A 55 to 59 Monk/Mage/Rogue/Ranger could easily handle this. Not to mention the fact that there are lower level mobs comparable to PoN/PoD harder mobs in grassy part of PoV. Even wasteland, I could see a 55 Warrior easily tanking after a slow. Hell I've been with some 60+ warriors in such ****ty equipment they might as well been 55. Besides the point of all the upgrades to exp for fighting higher level mobs was to test our limits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Here's my thoughts on the matter.<br />
<br />
I think if they are going to unlock the tier2 and tier3 planes, they should just make it 60 across the board.<br />
<br />
I'm far from an elitest.  I was one of the people encouraging lvl51's to play in PON, back when people laughed at that.  And you know what?  They did just fine. :)<br />
<br />
You really need malo to be effective in the higher planes.  Most of that stuff resists insanely.  That, or group with a tasher or mage with mala.<br />
<br />
It's a moot point, really.  If you don't have the gear and/or abilities to handle the mobs, people won't group with you.  Unless it's a friend/guild group, and then, hey, more power to you :)<br />
<br />
Tier 1 is a fantastic place to level for under 60 and I encourage it's use!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Oh and as a second thought, while were at it, if we are going to push for a 60 limit. I don't want to see any warriors with lamentations, no wizards in robes of the oracle, and no shamans with no torpor and a polished tin mail tunic. They are as detrimental as any 55 would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Heyas,<br />
      I think some people are missing the point, those who say it is ok, are justifying it with the fact that the lower lvl peeps will be grouped with their friends or guildmates.  In effect those low lvl peeps will not affect those who feel that the low level player doesn't belong there.  If they die a horrible death, so what, it was their choice to be there.  If there freinds/guildies die in the process, so what, it was their choice to bring the lower lvl player along.<br />
     Please don't look at my lvl, and think that I'm saying it is right because I want to get there quickly, I really don't care either way.  In fact, just the opposite.  I assumed the flagging process was a way of giving the hard core / high end players a reward for their effort.  I read about peeps complaining that it was an unfair advantage for the uber peeps, but comeon, thats life. Thats like saying that the person who works the hardest in practice (at a sport) doesn't deserve to win the most.  Well the cold/hard truth is that if they play more, group with the good players, and work on the large group strategies; they probably deserve the &quot;perks&quot; the we (who dont play as much) dont get/see.<br />
       Having said all that, some people seemed to play way too much EQ, and need to go outside and get some fresh air.  Feel free to bash away, but schpleef BE NICE, I know you can do it!!! heheheheh.</div></div><hr />

I had a L56 SK pulling fabulously in CoD (guild-breaking key quest?) the other night for my abnormal exp trio, but he would have been &quot;squizzed&quot; if not for the L65 SK that kept ripping the pulls off of him.  I don't see tier 2 as a really favorable option for most L55 players simply because they will be nose-down in the dirt more frequently than if they had chosen a zone of similar level to exp in.  Getting killed has a way of making people look elsewhere for exp and the option belongs with the player.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Really about the only class that can contribute to a tier 2+ group under level 60 is a cleric.  If you need to cast on, tank, or attack mobs, your level is more important than your gear.  Someone mentioned mob ac as being the determinant factor, but that's not the case.  Even a mob with very low ac will be hard to hit for a melee that it cons red to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Rikax it depends.  If you don't mind being a d00d, leeching exp, and causing group wipes, valor is fine at 58.  If you'd rather help to preserve the integrity of the game, wait until 60 with malo, or 61 without it.  Even at 61 (hell even at 65) not having malo or malos makes slowing tough and risky, but there's nowhere else in the game for exp at that level.  At 60 you can still get great exp in places like velks, katta, FG, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Test yerself, I slow yellows and red fairly consistantly in PoD Courtyard (well they were yellow and red now they are dark blue/white) without Malosi. Sometimes i'd get a string of resists, but that happens against blues too.<br />
<br />
You can't just lay a blanket statement based on level. For instance, my friend in the resident uber guild on my server has a 59 Froglok Paladin with better weapons and gear then 80% of the server. I'm sure he can handle tanking in PoV.<br />
<br />
Group composition also plays a part. If you are a 57 Shaman, and group has say a 60 beastlord. Have beastlord do slow on inc, then you slow afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Aye, why cant a 58 shaman be accepted? Slowing _larvae_ which are not level 62 should be very good exp and minimal resists, and the same heal as a level 61. <br />
<br />
I think 55 is borderline low, but as someone else has stated how much 46 warriors tank in PoD?<br />
<br />
P.S. Rikax, at level 60 when i got flagged, I was slowing and _soloing_ larvae without a bit of problem, thats without malo/torpor, but with horse and epic. IMO at 60 I still managed to slow golems without a problem therefore 58's who cast Malosini shouldnt have it any different from me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hail,<br />
If people want have a 55 in their group killing 62+ mobs, that's up to them - I see no problem with it if they want do it. A 55 in the group could well be better than having a gap in that group, though in some cases they could be more liability than help <br />
<br />
I agree with this to a degree.  I have no problems bringing friends who are under the zone level average, poorly equipped or AA'd to zones that would normally be beyond them.  <br />
<br />
I enjoy romping through PoI on occasion, dragging a group of upper 40's to low 50's friends deep into the zone when ordinarily they wouldn't be able to leave the graveyard on their own.  No way does anyone (excepting a cleric maybe) in their 40's get a group in PoI w/o a friend.<br />
<br />
Like Snoww, I enjoy the challenge of doing something differently than most.  Is it efficient?  No.  Is it dangerous?  Usually.  Is it fun?  Sometimes very much so, other times it just gives me a headache.  :p <br />
<br />
That said, I'm not worried about my friends.  I can control the situation and if we wipe, it is no big deal.  Dying in these zones is no big deal, and I can't see any valid reason to train or disrupt the play of others just because my group gets in over their head.  But not everyone plays that way, as we all know.<br />
<br />
I foresee being seriously annoyed by repetitive trains to the zone in Valor and Storms by the group of mid-50's people who are trying to band together because everyone 60+ will have nothing to do with them and the only thing that is open are the Undead Vassals or Giants that are too much for them.  Same thing for BoT with 62's w/ no titles trying their luck there.<br />
<br />
We all know that there are different levels of skill among the players on our servers.  There will be groups of younger than average people who WILL be able to use tactics, skill, and GRIT to make it in Tier2.  I have no problems with them, OR even with the ones who will be helped along by their higher level friends.  <br />
<br />
I DO NOT like the fact that I'll be subjected to the next generation of Dreadlands/Velks club people who are now seeking to get exp and avoid death at all costs in Tier2-3, no matter who they train or disturb in pursuit of their goals.  Those are the players that are now going to be all over the place and the reason I would prefer to keep the flagging system in place, or at least use a higher level standard for unflagged access.<br />
<br />
Tier2 on my server already has more than its share of idiots.  Tier3 less so, but the quality of player (speaking skill-wise &amp; courtesy) is getting worse every week.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness Tactics will still be viable.  Other than one or two accidental trains at the zone-in (which I was able to avoid) by a soloer, the quality of player there is generally pretty good and I've never had any serious problems because of others while I was inside.  I SHUDDER to think what a group of inexperienced players could do the zone when all the tunnels/corners are camped in the pit.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

But then again, they need to fix aggro ranges on mobs like the spawned TZ and VZ anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with 55 in Tier II.  I don't particularily think a 55 shaman has any business there, and I sure as hell wouldn't invite one to a group if I was playing another character there, simply because their resist rates would be so high, and with no Malo . . . not worth having them along.  An unreliable slow is pretty worthless, might as well grab a bard for slow before you grab a 55 shaman.  I remember what it was like at lvl 61 in PoV.  I needed Malo to make slow regular and predictable.  If I didn't use Malo, I'd bounce over half of my slows.  Bouncing slows hurts, and when it matters to get the mob slowed fast, you don't have a lot of time to dick around with bouncing the slows.  <br />
<br />
Anyway I think sure, let em in at 55, but then again, we let lvl 46's go to PoFear and they're also pretty worthless in that zone.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it, if you are too low of a level, no one wil group with you, you will be sitting around lfg not doing anything, and not taking any of the mobs away from those more capable of handling the zone. If you have high level friends trying to pl, well then the person doing the pl'ing has a right to be going after the mobs, what should you care if he's grouped with a 55 or 65. And if all the lower level people decide to group together because they can't find a group, why should you care. If what you say is true about their level being too low, then they will die enough to realize on their own to stop coming. Or, if they survive, it probably took them 15 minutes to kill the thing and now have to med for 10 minutes, so you know they will not get in your way too much, its like level 30 druids kiting HG's in Rathe for 30 minutes lol.

True, however it is an indication of the ability of a character.  No matter your skill, slowing level 62 golems in Valor (just an example) at 55 will be an excercise in futility.  As I said above, about the only mid-50's (or lower) class that can contribute to a tier 2 group and not be a liability is a cleric.  Every other class needs to cast on, tank, or attack mobs that are high red cons to them in that situation, making them a liability to their group.</div></div><hr />

Glad to hear about Tactics flag.  Level limits are a good thing, I agree they could have been a little higher however - exp only drops off in Tier one once you hit 62 really.</div></div><hr />

Level 55s with go LFG for hours and will quickly find that they will need to find other level 55s who will take them into XP groups. These level 55 groups in PoV/PoS/BoT will kill so slowly or take so long to recover that the XP will be worse than Tier 1. I have played with a level 53 Cleric in PoV before - he said the XP was good but not like the second comming of christ. A lot of people think that once in PoV/PoS the XP flows like water - that is not the case and a group that low will see diminishing returns on the amount of downtime they spend.<br />

Level 55 is too low for tier 2.  60 is questionable for tier 3.<br />
<br />
Not because a level 55 cant contribute, and shouldnt be able to hunt with their 60+ friends, but because a group of level 55s cannot hunt there.  Try it.  Make a group of level 55s.  Not a level 55 tank with a 65 slower and healer, not a 65 tank and cleric who can handle unslowed mobs... a level 55 group.  The first mob that resists slow will tear thru the tank faster than the cleric can heal -then it will eat the rest of the group.  These are mobs that required me to malo to land a slow at 62 (when I finaly got flagged) -my resist rate without malo was 75% or higher.  They hit (double and quad) for 500 and some have 300 pt procs as well.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have friends in the low 50s who I would love to have come hang out with me.  I have been trying to pull together a group to get them flagged -now I can just wait a couple more levels and they can join me in  the fun spots.</div></div><hr />

And how many tries does that take on a bright red tier 2 mob?  Maybe if your group has a 65 tank from a top guild on the server this would be ok, but by and large your job is to get that mob slowed within 10 seconds of your group engaging it, or at best your group's xp rate will slow to a crawl, and at worst your tank will die, causing a group wipe.  I hate to think how much you slowed down that group..  I'm sorry to break it to you, but this is exactly the reason some of us have for arguing for a 60+ limit on the zones in question.</div></div><hr />

This is true, but the alt quests won't allow you to progress in the PoP content.  Same about when they take off the flags, you'll have to do the main quests to progress to tier 4.  I'll be interested to see what they do with the other areas in the zones, like PoNB and HoHB.  I'm thinking that you'll have to go through the regular zone quest content to get access to those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">A lot of fair reasoning and arguements being produced.<br />
<br />
Schpleef, larvae at 60 give 9%-10% AA exp per solo kill. The only exp i could get like that was firebone casters in PoD, which nearly always resulted in my death as the second one nuked me down. That to me is good exp for the risk you put into it, which is minimal. AND training the entrance with a non-kos mob is not going to be a problem for anyone. Vassal's are easily done by a group of well-played level 58 characters, and would probably reap the exp rewards from it.<br />

The level requirements should be set lower than the average xp player for the zone, but I'll be glad when they're over 51. Just yesterday, there was a level 46 druid running up to random people in Tranquility outside Storms/BoT saying &quot;hey you got any room?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">This seems to be a rather polarizing issue.  <br />
<br />
My personal feeling on the matter is that as long as the requirement for Tier 3 zones is 62+ then all is well.  Why?  Quite simply, there are a limited number of camps in these zones, and to have those camps tied up by an underperforming group of level 58 characters that is struggling on each mob they fight (and completely unable to defeat the minibosses that spawn in their camps) would be a real shame.  I suppose they could zerg the minibosses, but that still leaves the problem of them getting everyone else killed when they die in populated locations (or worse, train).  At least a group of 62's would be a reasonably competent group. <br />
<br />
The tier 2 zones are much more open and also much more forgiving of weakness.  If you choose to have a level 55 shaman in your group, fine, at least you aren't hurting anyone but yourself (with exceptions -- inner in pov often trains outer, and that would only increase with a weak group).  Still, people having the ability to enter a zone does not mean that they will get grouped so it might all work out in the end anyway.<br />
<br />
My real problem with this is the wasted time that I spent on these quests and helping others with these quests.  All I can say is that the &quot;reward&quot; better be good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I have to say that I agree with the school of thought that 55 is rather low for tier 2.  I really think those who are upset with this idea and think it should be lower really must not understand the whole level vs. agro/resist/mana pool thing.  Personally, after getting flagged for a few places and almost having my BoT key done I am rather disappointed that they are taking away the flags.  I think it is a great sense of accomplishment and in a way a rite of passage.  Having said that, I also do see the point of wanting to make it level based as there are some guilds I have seen where they have some people flagged and others not and once they have a decent raid force they stop trying to push others through.  This will address that issue.  <br />
<br />
The main issue that I have with removing the keys and flags is that there is at least a measure of strategy involved in getting through some of the flags/keys and along with that comes some knowledge and maybe even some maturity.  I am sad to see this go.  There seems to be a growing number of people (at least on my server) who really don't understand this part of the game.  They don't seem to get the fact that it isn't always smash and bash and heal.  <br />
<br />
I have spent countless hours trying to teach teenagers not just how to accomplish certain tactics but WHY you need to use them (I am talking basic ideas) and even in some cases dealt with the ... &quot;you're not my mother, you can't tell me what to do&quot;... (/guildremove DA) It was nice to be able to go into a few zones in the game and not have to worry about some of the less informed players of the game. Now, I am not saying by ANY means that ALL teenagers are like this AT ALL!! I have my own teenager who plays a level 65 Warrior and people are amazed when they find out how old he is.  I know he is not the only one.  I guess what I am getting at here... in oh so many words... is that having the flags removed has many of us concerned that this will open up these areas to this type of player... one who just comes in the second they reach that level bringing a lack of understanding about certain fine points of the game and social understanding and those zones will now become like LOIO or DL is on our server.<br />

I keep hearing negative things about DL, specifically, the people that go there, someone said elsewhere something like &quot;the DL crowd&quot;....can I ask what this means? I play on FV, smaller population, DL never has more than 15 there at peak hours (which i consider 6-11pm-ish), less than 10 off peak (11pm-12am and later)and I solod there for about 2/3 of the time from 40-48. I get the idea that since DL is easy as hell and great xp, that you mean you don't learn the skills or something you need to know? If so, while it is easy, in my opinion, if you are not being PL'd, then you are learning what you need to know. As with any new zone, it don't matter where you were before, new zones mean new mobs, which means probably different strategies, which might take a bit to get down, which means learning different tactics. For example, I don't think I ever memmed a malo spell (yes I'm a newb :) )before I went to DL, but I learned real fast after I duo'd with this guy who was getting beat on bad, yelling at me &quot;will you malo the thing already and stop bouncing your slows&quot; lol.

Now lets add a level 55 caster into the mix.  Will get resists a ton ... It will kill you faster then the tank can pull it off of you.<br />

So here is what will happen ... the lower level guys wont get groups with the 60+ people so what will they do?  They will form their own groups.  They will use all thier mana per mob and then they will get an add.  They wont be able to handle it and the cleric will die.  Rest of group that is still alive will run to zo with a nice big train.  <br />
<br />
Since lower level people will have easier access to bot more people will move to HoH and CoD.  CoD is already a zone that is very bad with trains.  Add into this lower level people who cant handle the mobs or just more people trying to get to camps using invis and the trains will make BoT look appealing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I've known shamans at lvl 40 that can play better then some lvl 55+ I have met.  So to me other than actually being able to land a spell, zones with lvl caps still have their fair share of pinheads.  LVL caps or not...trains are everywhere.<br />
I'm 55 and if I can't land a slow I wont last very long there.  I don't have time to play as often as most and the fact I live in mountain time restricts my access to MANY raids.  So I am glad they are opening them up so it gives me more zones to shout lfgs in.  Whether you send me a tell to invite me is totally up to you...and that's all there is to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">ROFLMAO, most of you guys are missing the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want the lvl 55 in there, he/she can't do anything....all their spells will be resisted...etc..etc...etc...etc...<br />
<br />
It is purely stupid to keep harping on this crap.  If the lvl 55 shaman gets in there and goes lfg for five hours without finding a group, what the hell is that to you?  Come on guys, you are just being sore asses because you had to get the flag.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know.  You are worried about trains etc..etc..  Well you will have to worry about that for about a week, just like you did in Tier 1 plains until people found out that it just doesn't work.  I can remember the rants about people training GY's and all that as soon as PoP came out.  Yes, it will happen again in Tier 2 and 3, but it's not going to last to long.<br />
<br />
Just give up the whining and bitching, it should be no skin off your back whatsoever if the low lvls come into the zone, it will be irritating at first, but it will calm down.  Most people know that if takes them 15 minutes to kill a regular xp mob (and that's the lowest one in the plain there in) will get the picture and move to a place that is better suited soon enough.  It doesn't take a genious to figure out that hey I might have gotten 2 % points of xp off that one kill, but it took me 15 mins to kill it, where as I could of killed 4 critters in PoI and got 4% xp in the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just let it go, it's going to happen, get used to it.  You don't have to like it, but don't hold against the people who take advantage of it.  I won't.<br />

51 through 60, even though they were &quot;smoothed out&quot; a while back, are still much more difficult than the levels before, and from what I've ascertained, after (from what friends tell me and what I read here and on other EQ related forums).<br />

Nope, I'm all for the removal of flags.  I'm a sore ass becuase I don't believe the &quot;they'll see they can't hack it and leave&quot; and &quot;nobody will group with a level 5x character&quot; arguments.  This assumes some basic intelligence of people.  They'll stay, and just as beggars find people who actually give them stuff, many lowbies will find groups.  Just as tier 1 zones are like Aamtrak stations, people will keep thinking that maybe their 50th try, their 100th try, at soloing Mob_01 as a melee, will be successful :D  Its going to be quite a circus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">One of the posters asked what &quot;the DL crowd&quot; meant.<br />
<br />
Basically, there is a path of least resistance in EverQuest.  It starts in Lake Of Ill Omen, proceeds to Frontier Mountains, carries on to the OverThere, shifts to the Dreadlands, and then glides into Karnor's Castle.  If you follow this path, you can reach a very high level very quickly with very little effort or difficulty.  While &quot;effort and difficulty&quot; are not always entertaining, dealing with difficult situations makes you a better player.  Those zones are all &quot;outdoor&quot; (use your horse, use SoW) zones in which you do nothing but wait for mobs to arrive in camp and kill them.  The mobs tend to fall into the &quot;low damage, low hit point&quot; category.  In addition, because the zones are so open the attitude that its perfectly acceptable to train with no warning, or train with a warning becasue warnings make it right, is ingrained into players. There is really very little to learn about your class in those zones.  It isn't a sin to play in them or anything, you just won't become a great player by doing so.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the bottom line is that this path of least resistance is very attractive to some players and those players tend to be annoying to many of the old-school players.  It isn't a compliment to be considered a member of that group.  :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just *know* someone is going to quote that and say its an elitist attitude.  Maybe it is.  I have extremely high expectations of the people that I group with.  I want them to be all they can be.  An army of one.  Something like that.  Insert a catchy slogan here.</div></div><hr />

I actually really enjoy most of the PoP zones.  I particularly liked PoI, and really wish there was a bigger version of it with higher level mobs and more &quot;special&quot; mobs (ones that AE heavily, for example, or cast stuns on players).  I think it would be fun.</div></div><hr />

Goody for you. But ya know what? Once the flags are removed you'll at least be able to make that choice yourself instead of facing an artificial road block/time sync imposed on you by the designers. You'll be able to visit these zones of your own volition. It's entirely up to you to decide whether or not you want to engage in content you paid for.<br />

<br />
Drajjen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">First, to address the level issue.  Level-requirements for zones have always been more permissive than good sense would indicate.  Level 46 people in (obviously) pre-Planar gear found Fear to be brutally difficult when Fear opened - if you find old message boards, or just talk to players from that time, they'll tell you about 6, 8, or 10 hour CRs in which most people generated multiple unrezzable bodies.  As gear has exapanded in this game, that has changed somewhat.  A &quot;well-dressed&quot; level 46 can frollic with their guild more-or-less safely on Fear now.  But the entrance requirement for Temple of Veeshan is also 46 - and I for the life of me can't think of anything a 46 of any class could do there.  These requirements are fine.  True, most level 55 players will be dead weight on Tier 2, but I think that certain classes can do okay - and, more importantly, small guilds taking a group to Tier 2 can now bring along a slightly lower level friend.  A level 56 or 56, say, beastlord or paladin isn't going to be a detriment to an otherwise level 62 group in Valor.  Level 55 warriors, shaman, and enchanters just won't get groups there when they arrive alone - that will not be a problem.<br />
<br />
Also, kudos to SOE for keeping Tactics closed.  Its not about elitism.  It IS about wanting the zone with the hardest, most complex triggered event up to that point in the game to have fairly tight controls on who can enter it.  Besides, you want PoTac access, kill the Diaku.  Its not a hard quest, keys 6 people, and is nice XP while you wait for the ogres to pop.<br />
<br />
However, I have to say that I'm still disappointed.  So far as I know, there is no evidence that my concerns about these zones have been addressed - and, really, these are concerns whether or not they open the zone.<br />
<br />
1. One group can blow Halls of Honor trials.  Intentionally or otherwise, that's bad.  If its an accident, its annoying ... if it is on purpose, it gives guilds the ability to stall the progress (read: &quot;cockblocking&quot;) a guild ahead  of them in Planar Progression.  Generally, that has been difficult to do in the past; some people tried to do this by controlling Vex Thal shard spawns, but since those mobs repop like normal experience mobs, there was little chance to prevent the higher-power guild from getting a shot at them sooner or later.  With the long reset timer on the Honor Trials, one guild dedicated to &quot;catching up&quot; or just griefing their betters can effectively stall progression indefinately (for reference, this would stall access to Temple of Marr/Tower of SolRo/Tier 4)<br />
<br />
2. Unless it has been changed (for obvious reasons, I'm not interested in testing it myself), some &quot;an Undead Inhabitant&quot; still do not path once moved from their spawns.  The possibility of  level 66 mobs (that may see invis) with AE 2k dot/snare and huge melee being parked at a zonein/zoneout/graveyard is a serious issue.<br />
<br />
3. One group ... or more likely 2, can blow the Carpin script in CoD.  This is more likely to be intentional than not, but see the Honor Trials for why this is a problem (for reference this would stall access to Bertox/Tower of Sol Ro/Tier 4 - it would have stalled Saryrn access, but thankfully flags can be out of order now).</div></div><hr />

Had to comment on this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference between level 62 and 65 is huge. New spells for casters, new damage tables for melee. If you really think it's &quot;0.001% better&quot; or &quot;only 5% less dps&quot;, then you're nuts.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is NO difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee aside from a point or two in damage bonus. No such thing as new tables, the only classes who are really upgraded in those levels are the ones who cast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">I think SOE has found an effective way to address some of the problems people had with removing the flag.  The reason they stated for removing flags was to allow guids/friends to hang out together better.  If a group of friends wants a level 55 in thier PoV group, that is no problem.  In fact that happens to a certain extant already(push a friend thru trials and let him group with you...a kind of PL really).<br />
<br />
So here is what will happen ... the lower level guys wont get groups with the 60+ people so what will they do? They will form their own groups. They will use all thier mana per mob and then they will get an add. They wont be able to handle it and the cleric will die. Rest of group that is still alive will run to zo with a nice big train.  <br />
<br />
For this to be true, tier 1 zones should be overrun with late 40's type people, as that would be far better exp than DL.  Thing is tho, they cannot realistically do tier 1(maybe PoJ ZO, but nothing else), those that tried failed, and now it is rare to see pre 50 people in tier 1(outside of PL's).  There are still a few idiots, but nor this ravening horde that some seem to think are going to descend on us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Notice how the only person stating that a 60+ cap would be unfair is under 60? As a shaman, in bad gear, with no AA's it is EASY to level to 60 in tier 1. Groups have to have you. If you are in tier 2 you are a liability, you can't slow almost anything, you have a small mana pool, no useful heals, lower end buffs, and are taking a slot away from a shaman who EARNED the right to be there by leveling.<br />
<br />
You have no business being there powerleveling, because again, with the crowded nature of PoV and most servers, you are just taking exp away from people who put the time in to get the levels needed to be effective there.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with anyone being elitist, so you can drop that attitude right now, it has to do with the fact that this game is, for the most part, designed to be done in steps... skipping steps can often mean you are gimping someone elses chances to a degree. Level up to 61 - 62 in tier 1, then move up. You'll find if you go to tier 2 to early, and do get a group, you won't be effective, and therefore, if any of the people who where in that group hear you shouting for a group, they are going to suggest that you can't do you job, even thought you may have leveled up since then.<br />
<br />
Oh, well excuse me. Just let me back off so other people can have all the fun. This game isn't all about you. If someone wants to go to tier 2 at level 55, who the hell cares? What are you going to do about it? Nothing! What makes you think that just because you're 5 levels higher you've earned the right to level there??<br />
<br />

I went ahead and emboldened the part of what you said that you might have missed while saying it. I'm sure, though, you feel that bards, druids, rangers, and wizards shouldn't be allowed in these zones at all, since those classes can kite, and a small percentage of kites result in trains. Right?<br />
<br />
Yes, there will be fools going LFG in their 2 at the minumim level. They will be ignored. Bored, they will either try to solo near the ZO and die, or leave the zone for greener pastures. There will be those like myself, who accompany their friends. Dunno about you guys, but i've only had a small handful of Turgur's resists in CoD, though Malosi bounced like one of those little rubber balls.<br />
<br />
And, lastly, maybe Saryrn is just special, but I see extrememly little of the OOC arguments you describe. I regularly run through Dreadlands (KC AA isn't half bad solo), hunt plenty in PoD, PoN, and PoI, and only occasionally do I see leet contests and KS arguments. Matter of fact most of the retarded crap that scrolls on my screen comes from the Shaman channel.<br />
<br />
But, here's a little trick I learned in my days of wearing cloth and patchwork while swinging a splintering club - You can turn off OOC, Shouts, and Auctions. Imagine! If some piddlish argument across the zone is annoying you... Turn it off. Imagine that!<br />

Not really. Consider how long I've been playing (day of release), then consider my highest level is only 55.<br />
<br />
Playing 4 at a time isn't that difficult. Buff Warrior with Cleric &amp; Shaman. DS Warrior with Druid &amp; DS potion, then...<br />
<br />
1) Pull with Shaman (slow)<br />
2) Engage with Warrior while:<br />
2a) sending in dogdog<br />
2b) Epic DoT'ing with Shaman<br />
2c) Snaring/Arm DoT'ing with Druid<br />
3) JBB with Shaman<br />
4) Lumy (if outdoors) with Druid<br />
5) clicky boots with Cleric (if outdoors)<br />
7) Celestial Healing/Stoicism as needed<br />
8) wash, rinse, repeat<br />
<br />
Hotkeys do most of the work really.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind I don't always 4-box.<br />
<br />
So again...I'd still consider myself a casual player, but mainly based on the amount of time I play, not really the number of toons I play. Your opinion may vary, and that's ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but its not as irrelevant as you would think.  Lets say we make the requirement 60, like a lot of people want.  In this case, a small guild attempting to kill PoStorms giants (while the BoT keys won't be needed anymore, loot like Entwood Maces and Waning Light Katars are still good) might have problems, especially if a couple of their clerics are 59, 58 ... or even 55.<br />
<br />
Zones might get used primarily  for exp grinding or for raiding, but very few zones in EQ have only a single purpose intended for them.  The lower level cap has a purpose, just like the lower level cap of Temple of Veeshan has a purpose.  People who are suboptimal for experience groups in these zones will (within a couple weeks) stop going.  There are few, if any, levle 46 LFG in Nightmares; that same approach will not change just becuase the zone name says &quot;Valor&quot; instead.  But that doesn't mean that there are not times when it will be an advantage to some guilds, groups, and players to have a level 55-60 present in these zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Imho tier 2 should be a level 60 req, plain and simple, as stated, the only time I have a sub 60 in my group is if they are a friend and I don't mind sacrificing a bit of the groups optimisation to get them some great xp.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you think a 4k tank is going to cut in pov?<br />
<br />
IMHO (I'll probably get flamed for this view but oh well) since the flag requirements are going, surely having a level 60+ requirement on tier2/3 UNLESS you actually have the flag would make sense?  Go do a pov/pos trial and bingo, your twink gets access despite being sub 60.  Makes sense to me, after all, if you have friends that are going to let you mooch there xp, surely they will get you through a trial too?  And this also solves the issue of those getting suck in 61/62 and unable to get through the trials, hitting a progression brick wall in the process.<br />
<br />
No disrespect to anyone, but leveling is stupidly easy as it is, sub 60 xp in pov/pos just strikes me as wrong, its so fast that you really don't get the chance to learn your character.  I refused to touch pov/pos as my cleric till 60 when I felt I rightfully deserved to be there without being a liability.<br />
<br />
I'll add, when I'm clericing, having a sub 5k hp tank is quite literally scary as hell, its like a damned rollercoaster ride waiting for the yawn/slows down whilst keeping the melee upright.  Watch me and how often Kog's horse goes poof because I'm scared I'll need to start ducking and mashing SR.  The lowest melee I've had yet was 4.6k (Was an SK), and I was mentally exhausted after an hour of it.  Anything lower and I'd just be getting a replacement and gating, its not worth the headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I was thinking more along the lines of 60+ for Tier 2, and 62+ for Tier 3.<br />
<br />
Level 55 is only good for one class really in Tier 2, and that is Clerics.  Shaman won't be able to slow at 55.  Level 55 tanks in Tier 2 would be nothing but mana sponges.  Any melee class would be hindered in dmg output.<br />
<br />
If you are below 60 in Tier 2 now, you probably will sit LFG for a long time.<br />
<br />
Also, if you think you belong in Tier 2 at level 55, then you really need to get a clue.  At 55, you would be nothing more than a liability.<br />
<br />
/agree I have a level 60 friend with 80 aa (monk) and he usually xps in pod because no one wants a 60 monk in pov/pos.. he's in a decently strong guild as well. (cov faction stuff seru etc..)</div></div><hr />

I love how people say You have to be this level to do something..<br />
<br />
I will gladly invite My level 55 guildies to Storms. Sure some people will say they cant contribute. Those are the same damn people who say all we can do is shut up and slow and go sit in a corner. <br />
<br />
Is there more risk having a 55 tank In storms. Yes. Will he get the snot beat out of him. Yes. But, the benifit of saying sure come group with us, rather than go LFG you casual Punk ass newb, far outweighs a death or 7. <br />
<br />
Plus at level 55 They won't be 55 for long in Storms or Valor.<br />
<br />
Oh and I have landed slows On +7 level mobs just fine. So has ever other shaman that has uttered the words Hey yall... Watch this... (Grins)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bro, I don't want to be mean, but it's obvious you've never been in pos. At 62 I slightly slowed a giant there and our 65 tank (he's mid range as far as gear goes probably around 7.6k or so raid buffed and he was raid buffed).. we had a hell of a hard time with those giants, a REALLY hard time, and I was unable to slow sometimes for a very long time and we wiped a few times.. <br />
<br />
A level 55 warrior mt in pos will soon be a level 54 mt in pos. Level has something to do with taunt too I believe so most likely even a 65 shaman/cleric will get summoned and eaten.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, 59 will suck unless in castle or pon mephids (almost always open)... if you get an offer to join a group with a 65 paladin (check the guild to be sure he's decent =] ) .. join it you will do ok, specially if there is a mage chanter or bard around.. xp will be great in pov for you (most things will be red)..</div></div><hr />

Had to comment on this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is NO difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee aside from a point or two in damage bonus. No such thing as new tables, the only classes who are really upgraded in those levels are the ones who cast.<br />
<br />
Well, that's not what they say on Monkly Business:<br />
<br />
http://jumpspot.net/eq/monks_by_level.html<br />
<br />
Observe levels 63 and 65. &quot;Improved damage table&quot; on both. Also, the monk fists are 15/20 at level 65 vs 14/26 at level 60, though obviously most monks would have epic or better anyway at that point.<br />
<br />
Aside from that you get improved mitigation for tanks as the level disparity changes, you get better resist rates for everyone (we all know that level &gt; resist gear).. the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Now if Monkly Business is wrong, then I stand corrected. I would like proof though if you're going to claim that.<br />
<br />
Till then, my point stands true: a 65 will be a lot more efficient in a group than a 60, player skill not being accounted for.</div></div><hr />

Who can't cast? warriors whoes level is needed for the better taunt? *I heard*.. monks whoes aggro range depends on level (65 pulls better than 60 I have 2 close friends 60 80 aa and 65 27 aa, they both recognize)... rogues I don't know much about, everything else casts unless I missed someone? Also hps increases by level so that should help warriors too (as far as level &gt; all goes).. rogues I'll ask some of my friends tonight, however I do know my guild really wants rogues at 65 asap and they also want sos whatever that does =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Not really. Consider how long I've been playing (day of release), then consider my highest level is only 55.<br />

Playing 4 at a time isn't that difficult. Buff Warrior with Cleric &amp; Shaman. DS Warrior with Druid &amp; DS potion, then...<br />
<br />
1) Pull with Shaman (slow)<br />
2) Engage with Warrior while:<br />

2b) Epic DoT'ing with Shaman<br />

So again...I'd still consider myself a casual player, but mainly based on the amount of time I play, not really the number of toons I play. Your opinion may vary, and that's ok.<br />
<br />
No need to explain yourself bro.. casual is a very broad range and an ambigious term..  ie what if I play 20 hours on every wednesday and don't play the rest of the week? or I am 6 boxing for 1 hour a day I just like to get my group going and leveling at once w/o bother (the true soloer) =] or just like to challenge themselves. or have the money and know they are going to play 6 chars to 65 and want to save time doing it.. OR what if I don't xp at all, EVER, but I log on for 5+ hours every friday/saturday/sunday with my 65 cleric and raid? <br />
<br />
I play a LOT whenever I have free time I play, so about 20+ hours a week.. but if I die, loose a roll, not get any loot, I have yet to be mad.. a non casual player gets furious.. so that's my definition..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Too funny about there being no difference between a level 60 to 65 melee except for a couple of points of damage LOL!!!! We have both in our guild and let me tell you that damage taken by a level 65 warrior is quite a bit different from a level 60... clerics use quite a bit less mana on our 65th compared to our 60th MAs.  Some of our level 60's tanking the Prime Executioner ate up a good amount of mana and absolutely needed to use Defensive.  At level 65 same warrior took much less damage without even using Defensive skill.  I know this because he sits in the same room with me as we play and I have watched most of the fights.  The level change makes a big difference.   :) <br />
<br />
Also, I think one thing I have heard a lot from friends and guildies is that the quality of the /ooc and /shouts is what a lot of people don't want to see go down.  I am not totally against the removal, I just have big concerns and would prefer at this point they not take it off.  As long as they have the level caps then that helps some and I can appreciate that it will help some of our guildies be able to participate at a higher level.<br />
<br />
I wonder though what this will do to the game?  With the difference in the experience gain they will have to keep raising the bar on the game... I think taking off the flags just makes it have to be raised that much faster. Yet another way to get more money out of us I guess hehe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Ok, to start off I'm at 59 right now, decently equiped.  I personally don't plan on going to tier 2 until I'm 60, but I might.  This is my choice though, not because I don't think I could make it there or someone else thinks I'm too low a level.  Just as peeps going there as soon as they hit 55 is their choice.  I didn't hit tier 1 zones until I had hit 54, even though I had a 47 friend routinely going there.  Removing flags was a good thing in my opinion though.  But take a look around tier 1 zones these days.  There are a lot more groups of low 50's and high 40's grouping and looking for groups.  I'd say average is 47-55 for the most part grouped.  Most 55+ are either soloing or duoing.  I routinely get someone around lvl 48 asking if I have room for them while I'm there soloing.  I'm 11 lvl's higher!?  What could someone that far below me offer or contribute.  I'm sure these same questions are going through the heads of those of you at 65.  Well occassionally, when I'm bored I let them join me.  Sometimes it's an experience I'd sooner forget, and sometimes it's just not that bad.  It's all based on the player, their equipment, and their experiance lvl.  How many people have grouped in upper tier planes with someone they just know was off of e-bay?  Give people a chance and don't prejudge everyone, they might just pleasantly suprise you.  :)</div></div><hr />

That's absolutely correct. You can only taunt a level 60 or higher MoB at level 60. A level 59 melee with the taunt skill cannot rely on that skill alone to taunt a MoB of higher level. <br />
<br />
Not many people know this, but it's a nice bit of knowledge to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />

Its got to be black and white?  What if I said that I understand that even the most knowledgeable, best equipped 65's will at times train?  You'd have no argument left.

Besides if you are whining cause a bunch of level 55's are in PoV/PoS, then go to Sanctus Seru and kill the Report Mobs.

Rogues and warriors are on the same damage table, we move onto it at level 50(it's the monk pre-50 table). Monks also move onto a new table at 50. All three keep those tables through 65. I'll repeat it since there are so many ignorant about melee life:<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee class except a point or two of damage per hit<br />
<br />
Final, come on:<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there a difference between a level 60 tank and a level 65 tank who has level 60 gear? I don't lnow, that's someone else's arguement. Is there a difference between a 65 tank with 65 gear and a 65 tank with 60 gear? DAMN SKIPPY! <br />
<br />
<br />
Melee don't get new gear upon dinging 61, 62, 63, 64, or 65 to match the upgrades other classes get with spells. There is no such thing as &quot;65 gear&quot; or &quot;60 gear&quot;. In fact, for warriors specifically, the vast majority will have the same cultural mix n match armor at 60 as they do at 65.<br />
<br />
Just as an example, at 60 my warrior had 50ish more HP(hell he was at ND2 to the other war's ND3 for that matter) and roughly 300ac than my guild's other MT does at 65(Make no mistake, the other warrior is no gimp). Gear has nothing to do with levels.<br />
<br />
What you are saying is you only want to group with elemental equipped warriors. Fine and dandy, but just admit you're being elitist about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Too funny about there being no difference between a level 60 to 65 melee except for a couple of points of damage LOL!!!! We have both in our guild and let me tell you that damage taken by a level 65 warrior is quite a bit different from a level 60... clerics use quite a bit less mana on our 65th compared to our 60th MAs. Some of our level 60's tanking the Prime Executioner ate up a good amount of mana and absolutely needed to use Defensive.

The level change makes a big difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Were their AA's the same? Was their gear the same?<br />
<br />
Highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
<br />
warriors whoes level is needed for the better taunt? *I heard*.. monks whoes aggro range depends on level (65 pulls better than 60 I have 2 close friends 60 80 aa and 65 27 aa, they both recognize)... rogues I don't know much about, everything else casts unless I missed someone? Also hps increases by level so that should help warriors too (as far as level &gt; all goes)<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, monks are not the cornerstone of pulling anymore, welcome to planes of power, harmony, and lull. Also, at level 60, a warrior gets all of his taunt caps removed. As for hitpoints- that's all in the gear(see above). There is a suprisingly SMALL increase in hitpoints for 60-65(again, pay attention to what the warriors are saying).<br />
<br />
Don't worry Nerun, I didn't skip you.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Observe levels 63 and 65. &quot;Improved damage table&quot; on both. Also, the monk fists are 15/20 at level 65 vs 14/26 at level 60, though obviously most monks would have epic or better anyway at that point.<br />
<br />
Aside from that you get improved mitigation for tanks as the level disparity changes, you get better resist rates for everyone (we all know that level &gt; resist gear).. the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Now if Monkly Business is wrong, then I stand corrected. I would like proof though if you're going to claim that.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, I don't know hardly any monks that dual wield past 60. The quality of 2h weapons these days make them the premier damage dealing option(this isn't just for monks, it goes for warriors, knights, even quite a few RANGERS will use 2h if you take a look around).<br />
<br />
As far as the damage table i believe that is completely false. If they were really 3 damage tables ahead of warriors do you honestly believe they would have complaints about warriors outdamaging them? In case you don't pay attention, monk damage/delay ratios are always superior to the weapons available to warriors. Go ahead, check up on monkly business, look into those complaints about damage.<br />
<br />
Now, about increased mitigation. HI, THERE IS NO MITIGATION INCREASE. There are no different mitigation tables(again, if you knew the subject you'd realize this is one of the big items warriors have been asking for to tune them up, as there is no mitigation difference between any of the classes), the only difference in mitigation is caused by skill. That means  if you had a cap of 252, you would mitigate exactly the same as a warrior with the same AC.<br />
<br />
Finally, resists. Well, those do make a small difference. Tell me, how often does the resist difference between 60 and 65 come into play while you are exping? For melee? Remember, resists don't have to go both ways, they aren't trying to cast on mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Till then, my point stands true: a 65 will be a lot more efficient in a group than a 60, player skill not being accounted for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh, now here's the thing. Your whole point ^. But you're purposefully skipping one of the most important parts: player skill. <br />
<br />
You KNOW there are level 65 melee who are idiots. I know you know that, or we aren't playing the same game or even living on the same planet. Moreover, saying all 60's are worse than any level 65 is just as bogus. <br />
<br />
What that boils down to is that you're taking just as much of a risk letting an unknown 65 in your group as an unknown 60. You would be better off examining their magelos or better yet looking at their titles. AA makes a huge difference(hey, khozik..ask your 60/80aa and 65/27aa to use the same weapons/gear and parse damage dealt/taken).<br />
<br />
I can STRONGLY advise you to stop believing everything you see at monkly business, they do very little in the way of giving evidence to back up their statements. <br />
<br />
Why don't you go over here:<br />

There is no difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee class except a point or two of damage per hit<br />
Level plays a part in it.  You'll miss more, and hit for less on average, when fighting a higher level mob.  This is separate from mob-to-mob differences in ac and such; just a level vs. level thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">For melees, chance to hit and chance to be hit is related to the relative level of the mobs, much like chance to resist spells is for casters.<br />
<br />
So with a level 60 and level 65 tank in the exact same gear and the exact same skills, a 65 will take less damage and deal more. Level *does* play a part.<br />
<br />
And even if it were only &quot;1 or 2 points of damage per hit&quot;, that you're referring to from having an improved damage bonus - that adds up to quite a lot in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">The other part you're skipping is that all of the 2nd tier exp mobs are blue to a 60 and a 65, and a large amount of tier 3 are as well.<br />

The differences in those zones are small enough for those levels that minor equipment changes can make up any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Just one comment Jharassik.  As you point out, most melee that can are going more and more to 2 hand weapons.  The damage bonus from 60 to 65 for 2 handers does go up more than 1 or 2 points.  Does not invalidate any of your points, just thought I would point it out for completeness sake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That statement is wrong. <br />
Even though there is no mitigation table for every class, there is a armor-type mitigation table for each of the 4 armor types(silk, leather, chain, plate. Silk having the lowest mitigation and plate the highest). If you want proof of that just look up one of the last patch messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Hadd, let me clear it up for you. Rogues and warriors are on the same damage table, we move onto it at level 50(it's the monk pre-50 table). Monks also move onto a new table at 50. All three keep those tables through 65. I'll repeat it since there are so many ignorant about melee life:<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee class except a point or two of damage per hit<br />
<br />
Final, come on:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee don't get new gear upon dinging 61, 62, 63, 64, or 65 to match the upgrades other classes get with spells. There is no such thing as &quot;65 gear&quot; or &quot;60 gear&quot;. In fact, for warriors specifically, the vast majority will have the same cultural mix n match armor at 60 as they do at 65.<br />
<br />
Just as an example, at 60 my warrior had 50ish more HP(hell he was at ND2 to the other war's ND3 for that matter) and roughly 300ac than my guild's other MT does at 65(Make no mistake, the other warrior is no gimp). Gear has nothing to do with levels.<br />
<br />
What you are saying is you only want to group with elemental equipped warriors. Fine and dandy, but just admit you're being elitist about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Were their AA's the same? Was their gear the same?<br />
<br />
Highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, monks are not the cornerstone of pulling anymore, welcome to planes of power, harmony, and lull. Also, at level 60, a warrior gets all of his taunt caps removed. As for hitpoints- that's all in the gear(see above). There is a suprisingly SMALL increase in hitpoints for 60-65(again, pay attention to what the warriors are saying).<br />
<br />
Don't worry Nerun, I didn't skip you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, I don't know hardly any monks that dual wield past 60. The quality of 2h weapons these days make them the premier damage dealing option(this isn't just for monks, it goes for warriors, knights, even quite a few RANGERS will use 2h if you take a look around).<br />
<br />
As far as the damage table i believe that is completely false. If they were really 3 damage tables ahead of warriors do you honestly believe they would have complaints about warriors outdamaging them? In case you don't pay attention, monk damage/delay ratios are always superior to the weapons available to warriors. Go ahead, check up on monkly business, look into those complaints about damage.<br />
<br />
Now, about increased mitigation. HI, THERE IS NO MITIGATION INCREASE. There are no different mitigation tables(again, if you knew the subject you'd realize this is one of the big items warriors have been asking for to tune them up, as there is no mitigation difference between any of the classes), the only difference in mitigation is caused by skill. That means  if you had a cap of 252, you would mitigate exactly the same as a warrior with the same AC.<br />
<br />
Finally, resists. Well, those do make a small difference. Tell me, how often does the resist difference between 60 and 65 come into play while you are exping? For melee? Remember, resists don't have to go both ways, they aren't trying to cast on mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh, now here's the thing. Your whole point ^. But you're purposefully skipping one of the most important parts: player skill. <br />
<br />
You KNOW there are level 65 melee who are idiots. I know you know that, or we aren't playing the same game or even living on the same planet. Moreover, saying all 60's are worse than any level 65 is just as bogus. <br />
<br />
What that boils down to is that you're taking just as much of a risk letting an unknown 65 in your group as an unknown 60. You would be better off examining their magelos or better yet looking at their titles. AA makes a huge difference(hey, khozik..ask your 60/80aa and 65/27aa to use the same weapons/gear and parse damage dealt/taken).<br />
<br />
I can STRONGLY advise you to stop believing everything you see at monkly business, they do very little in the way of giving evidence to back up their statements. <br />
<br />
Why don't you go over here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">For a melee, how often you hit a mob is also determined by level.  That combined with the damage table changes from 60 to 65 will make any melee provide a better contribution.  A 65 plate class will tank better than a 60 with the same gear.<br />
<br />
This all said, if you are in Tier 1 at 55, you can be to 60 in a week easily.  You just have to hunt the right mobs.  When you are slowing a mob, level makes a huge difference.  Also, a shaman with Malo will be much more benifit to a group in Tier 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
If you are 55 and bitching about not being able to hit Tier 3 or not able to get a group in Tier 2, your complaints will fall on deaf ears.  Do you have Malo/Torpor?   Maybe you should work more on camping things that you can sell, or might possibly drop those spells you will need when you ding 60.  And guess what, the sooner you start, the higher the odds are you will have them or the resources to buy them when you are 60.<br />
<br />
There is more to it than just leveling fast.  It helps greatly if you have Torpor/Malo when you hit 60.  Especially if you are in a small guild, and certain raids are totally dependent on having a Shaman with Malo (or Mage with Mala).<br />
<br />
With all the concern of effectiveness at 55 in the higher tier planes, I think people overlook little things like rare spells they are going to need in a few levels.  And waiting, hoping they will just fall into your hands is probably not what you want to do.<br />
<br />
So for you 55's wanting to hit Tier 3 ... maybe you should be spending more time trying to hit the Emp in Seb, than sitting in PoV/PoS with LFG tag up for hours at a time.   Its your time, try to use it effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">The other part you're skipping is that all of the 2nd tier exp mobs are blue to a 60 and a 65, and a large amount of tier 3 are as well.<br />

Shaman below 60 will not be able to slow on the first and probably the second cast, therefore the group will be rezzing the shaman after each pull (and probably the group as well). I think the initial few weeks after the change there will be some lvl55-60 spamming for groups in PoV/PoS, but when they don't get in groups or get spanked several times it will go away. I do believe the level restrictions to enter these zones without a key should be 60 though, maybe 62 for tier 3. Not because I feel I have earned the ability to get in and others have not, but because there really is not much benefit to a level 55-59 player in tier 2 and even less in tier 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a basic fact that all of these arguments have not even touched on which makes more sense for the restrictions to be 60/62. (For the record, my highest level character is 44) That fact is available xp content. As hinted at by others, there is a great deal of xp content available to other players up to 60 on Tier 1. In fact, that content is more &quot;efficient&quot; than that of Tier 2 for the under 60 players. <br />
<br />
60+ characters are far more limited as to where they can get xp. It is not fair for them to have to compete with the 55-59 players for mobs to hunt. It doesn't matter how well the under 60 players can play, how much dps they can do, etc. What matters is that they are taking away from the higher level players. Those players do have a right to play and there should be content in the game reserved for them. I know that I get resentful when higher level players farm my xp mobs for loot. (Perhaps level limitations should work both ways......)<br />
<br />
So I would support the higher level restrictions solely for the purpose of channeling players into different zones to keep them all utilized and give EVERY player the chance to play the game, even those 60+ elitist d00ds! ;)<br />
<br />
All of this banter matters not since SOE has already decided to make the access 55/62.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">There is NO difference between a level 60 and a level 65 melee aside from a point or two in damage bonus. No such thing as new tables, the only classes who are really upgraded in those levels are the ones who cast.<br />
<br />
This is a very, very large fallacy. Level plays an enormous part in almost every aspect of combat in EQ. <br />
<br />
Take a level 60 warrior and a level 65 warrior (any dual wield capable class really), equip them identically and place a non weapon in their mand hand. Have them both attack the back of a level 65 mob with their offhand weapon only (to eliminate the damage bonus as a difference in damage output) and parse the damage. It will NOT be the same. The higher level warrior will hit more often and his hits will be for higher damage.<br />
<br />
If you take a level 65 warrior and a level 60 warrior with identical gear and have them tank the same level 65 mob for a long period of time, you will find that the higher level warrior gets hit less often and for less average damage per hit. That's not even taking considering the hp difference, just the raw DPS they recieve. Tanks inherently know this. Ask your favorite tank.<br />
<br />
Take a level 60 caster and a level 65 caster and have them cast the same spell over and over on a level 65 mob. The level 65 caster will land spells more often.<br />
<br />
The same is true of resisting spells cast on you by the mob. I don't know if this is accurate after the resist change awhile ago, but it used to be that each level you gained increased your effective resists by roughly 12 in each resist.<br />
<br />
The effects of level in EQ are huge in anything related to combat. The only time it is irrelevant is if you don't actually have to interact with the mob. Healing, buffing, evaccing...those sorts of things don't require any level comparison with the mob, but almost everything else does.<br />
<br />
Level also affects aggro. The lower level a person is, the easier it is for them to do draw aggro for the same raw hate value. A level 55 cleric is going to draw more effective hate from casting a CH than a level 65 cleric would, even if the amount healed is identical. <br />
<br />
Level also affects the aggro radius of a mob. <br />
<br />
Now, does all of that mean that tiers 2 and 3 should be closed for anyone but 60s and up? Not in my opinion, no. There should be a level limit, but it should also be very liberal. 55 is ok for tier 2, and 60 is ok for tier 3. It will be for the most part a self regulating thing. Most level 55s will be essentially excess baggage in tier 2. <br />
<br />
There is also the fact that leaving some leeway for friends to group together and have fun, regardless of the difficulties, is an important aspect to promoting the overall health of the game.<br />
<br />
BTW, there is no way in hell the average tank is going to be able to tank anything in PoV below level 60, even 60 is pushing it without some seriously nice gear. A level 60 tank in PoS is asking for a whole lot of hurt. If the tank cannot last 10 seconds from full health to death against an unslowed mob, no amount of healing skill will keep him alive.</div></div><hr />

I guess the part that I'd disagree with is that it's somehow related to level. All the people making the arguement that lvl 55 = train are at least implying that the lower levels are bigger idiots. Judging from what I've seen lately in Tier 2+ zones, that would be difficult. <br />

HI, I am my favorite tank. I know the exact opposite to be true. I've been playing warriors for almost four years now, I've tanked everything from orc pawns to  ntov to ssra to pop. I think I *may* have some idea about what is involved and how it works. How many days /played have you spent tanking?  <br />
<br />
No really, follow the links i provided to the steel warrior boards and actually look into what you are saying. The fact that you put dual wield into your argument automatically means you have zero clue about the state of tanking right now. <br />
<br />
Tanks do not use dual wield. For once thing, it's crap damage compared to 2h now..and for the other, how often do you think a 105% hasted tank dual wielding 20 delay weapons gets riposted?<br />
<br />
<br />
there is no way in hell the average tank is going to be able to tank anything in PoV below level 60, even 60 is pushing it without some seriously nice gear. A level 60 tank in PoS is asking for a whole lot of hurt. If the tank cannot last 10 seconds from full health to death against an unslowed mob, no amount of healing skill will keep him alive.<br />

I was lucky enough to get flagged pretty quickly after pop. I was fully capable of taking on two unslowed giants at 60 and surviving. Let's examine why that could be:<br />
<br />
&quot;without some seriously nice gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Levels mean dick compared to what gear means. A well equipped level 60 will blow away an average 65. An average equipped 60 with good AA will blow away an average 65 with little AA. <br />

Many mobs here are light blue.  Even the dark blue ones give very little aaxp at 65.  Sony needed people to buy PoP, and they knew that many wouldn't, after the Luclin fiasco (I sure as hell wouldn't have) if not for the bait tactic of a new level cap and easy exp.<br />
All the people making the arguement that lvl 55 = train are at least implying that the lower levels are bigger idiots<br />
Absolutely not, and I'm sorry if I come across that way.  Firstly, most sub-60's won't be in tier 2.  Secondly even the most skilled sub-60 will have to either train, feign, or gate when they realize they can't kill that bright red mob.  Its not elitism, its realism.</div></div><hr />

I don't see tier 2 as a really favorable option for most L55 players simply because they will be nose-down in the dirt more frequently than if they had chosen a zone of similar level to exp in.

Please point out where I logically linked dual wield and tanking. I did not. I didn't even mention tanking and dual wield in the same sentence. Notice the use of paragraphs in my post. Paragraphs are often used to break up writing into logical elements. If you go back and look at it closely, you will see that the paragraph that mentions dual wield does so in the context of damage output, not tanking. You might even notice that I specifically mentioned attacking the back of the mob. Hard to do that when tanking, no?

I don't like grouping with mages who refuse to summon pet toys if my pet dies.<br />
<br />
I don't like grouping with wizzies who overnuke so much that you and the cleric spend more time healing them than the tank.  Or that evac the group when the group is perfectly alright but they get scared.<br />
<br />
I don't like grouping with anybody who I have to ask for buffs from 5 times before I even get a response.<br />
<br />
And I especially hate grouping (on my alts) with shammies who don't know what canni is.  Who think that it's a waste.  Who think that it's more important to nuke and dot than to buff the group.  Who think it's more important to melee than backup heal.  And especially the ones who don't slow.<br />
<br />
etc etc etc....<br />
<br />
Does this make me elitist, oh yeah!  But I am far from elitist based on levels.  I'll take a level 58 monk who knows how to pull over a 65 who's clueless anyday.  And the same goes with any other class.<br />
<br />
My position on the flagging.  It shouldn't be removed.  Why? Because flagging is a reasonable way to control access to the higher tier zones.  Getting through trials is based as much on skill as on levels.  If I'm a good player then either a) higher level friends will get me flagged, b) Friends around my level will get me flagged, or c) I'll form a group to flag myself with other competant people.  BoT and other keys/flags, it's the same thing.  Talent controls access to these zones as much as anything else.  Yes...there are great players who can't get flagged, and that's unfortunate.  But the quality of the average person lfg in the higher tier zones is MUCH greater than that of the people lfg in tier 1, on average.  I've noticed lately a steady decline in the quality of player however, especially in tier 2 zones.  If these zones are opened up without flags/keys, this will get much worse.  I'm not talking about the level 55's who are competant players who'll some of them get groups, and some of them decide it's not worth it and leave.  I'm talking about the level 62's who can't get flagged because every time they go into trials with a decent group THEY screw it up because they're an idiot.  The level 62's who will go running around and training everybody screaming &quot;help me&quot; as they pull 5 mobs onto your group that already has 2 or 3 in camp...on purpose...because they don't want to die.<br />
<br />
And for those of you that think that it's still hard to get to 55+ to what will be able to get into tier 2, think again.  A friend of mine ran some tests with identical newbie dwarfs to see how many kills it took to level up with the exp changes etc that have been made lately.  It takes less than HALF the amount of kills to level that newbie dwarf now than it did when my friend leveled up.  Not to mention the lack of hell levels, lack of corpse runs to teach basic CR skills, ease of getting rezzes at any level.  Many players leveling up don't have the time/experiences to learn and grow because of how rapid it is.  There are way more n00bs at all levels now than there ever were.  And if they take the flagging requirements away it will only get worse and worse and worse....<br />

<br />
You may play a warrior Jharrasik, but you aren't the only one who does.  <br />
<br />
Level does make a huge difference in a warrior's ability to both take and deliver damage.  Slap a 60 tank in front of Vindi or some similar mob, and then stick a 65 tank in his place and, without them even swinging and assuming the exact same gear, see what happens.  Level owns hard in EQ, always has, always will.  <br />
<br />
Certainly, levels in no shape equal skill, which ought to be obvious to anyone who's played for any amount of time.  Skill is really the wrong word.  There's little &quot;skill&quot; in EQ.  It's mostly paying attention, being conversational, knowing your class and how to move about.  If you do those things, you got &quot;skill&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with level restrictions on these zones though, provided they get the level limit right.  It's just that people are always wrong when initially assessing what levels can adequately function in a zone.  I heard this about Karnor's, Sebilis, Chardok and Howling Stones.  Inevitably, I later found out I was wrong and that folks could successfully hunt there at lower levels than I thought they could.  <br />
<br />
These lower level folks will get groups with friends, or to help form groups that otherwise would not exist.  I would rather have a group that's not maximally efficient than no group at all.  <br />
<br />
There's tons of cool people who aren't raid-equipped, and there's tons of raid-equipped people who are as numb as a bag of hammers. <br />
<br />
I'll take the cool fun people over the dumb ones anyday - and you got to group with them to find that out.  <br />
<br />
Some of the most fun groups I've had where ones where we weren't optimal, and we had to adapt and play sharply to survive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between level 62 and 65 is huge. New spells for casters, new damage tables for melee. If you really think it's &quot;0.001% better&quot;  or &quot;only 5% less dps&quot;, then you're nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">So lemme get this straight...<br />
<br />
You can't land slows or any other debuff, and your backup healing is still unmeasureably weak...but you still have alot to offer?<br />
<br />
When all offensive ability of  shaman is neutralized and the backup heals are a joke, that leaves buffing as our primary duty in a group..<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless one counts idle group-chatter while soaking xp counts as &quot;something to offer&quot;, a 55 shaman in PoV is going to be one of two things, 99% of his time. <br />

1. LFG<br />
2.CRing.</div></div><hr />

Hey Man...  just a point of clarification:<br />
<br />
Off-Tank = Tank Mezz or have a tank other than the MA/MT pick up an add and melee it while the rest of the group focuses on killing the first one until it's dead and the group can move focus to the added mob.  The defensive comes into play because, obviously, it allows the secondary tank to last longer without needing heals and since the off tank is only one focused on the add the aggro is all his.<br />

That's for the &quot;group of friends of the level 55&quot; to make that determination/judgement call.

<br />
Just because someone isn't &quot;level 60 with a buttload of AA's and uber gear&quot; doesn't mean their friends won't want them along.<br />

As I said, the difference between a level 60 and level 65 character with the same gear is so small, slight increases in gear(more ac, more hp) or better aa(ns3/na3/cf3/flurry etc etc etc) will more than make up for any difference.<br />

I think if they leave the flags in and then if you hit 63 before passing trials you can go tier2 without flag...maybe even hit tier3 if lvl 65 without collecting all the stuff from PoS.<br />
<br />
I still shudder when I see a lvl 55 and under melee in tier1...the exp is not bad if you have a good group of 60s in tier 1..it blows with a bunch of mid 50s<br />
<br />
A cleric under 55 even in tier1 means I have to heal while the cleric meds unless the group all wants to afk a couple times an hour</div></div><hr />

Result: Works like a charm. Can get aggro, hold aggro against a BL, and no problem for a single shaman to heal. Now how this would look without lvl 65 buffs, and a 65 shm to do the slowing I don't know. But at least in this configuration he had no problem tanking the planarian larvae and undeads (hitting up to 500).<br />
He does miss quite a bit against the red mobs, but max damage is not the point for a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because a 55 may be allowed in there doesn't mean everyone else in the group will be 63+.  The odds are more that the group will be all under 60, since knowing the need of level will be more disregarded by the lower level people in the first place.<br />
<br />
This means a full graveyard.  It wont make many trains, because they will never make it anywhere to train.  They will die long before that.  Its your level 55 druids/wizards who go out in PoV and try to quad an unsnareable mob the first time that cause a train.<br />
<br />
The rest of the trains will be about normal, and after a month or so, the low levels will be smart enough to stay in Tier 1 until at least 60.</div></div><hr />

Hint: Just because the 55s are allowed in the zone does not mean that you are &quot;STUCK&quot; with them and forced to group with them =p Dont join groups with 55s in it if you dont want to group with them.. seems simple and cut and dried to me. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

He's using an anklesmasher (with snare proc) as main, and a swiftblade or RZ  as secondary.  The nice thing is that the snare proc generates aggro even if resisted (the undead in PoV are immune to changes in moevement speed).</div></div><hr />

And despite his patch heals being quite small, it's still very useful for me to be able to just hammer the &quot;healing water&quot; button on the second box while I get adds slowed.  <br />
<br />
Basically, my boxed druid does 3 things for me:<br />
 - buffs (skin line)<br />
 - DoTs (insects line w/ -100 resist check)<br />
 - patch heals<br />
<br />
All three of these things would still be useful in tier 2.  Only thing he wouldn't be able to stick is the occasional nuke I toss in when he's at full mana.  But that's ok, since he could just mem the previous dot in the winged death line (drifting death).<br />

Gart, I think you have the wrong discussion. Raid tanking is that door over there, this conversation is about the difference level makes to tanking trash in exp groups.<br />
<br />
I guess it wasn't obvious enough, so I'll clarify. I was talking about ALL aspects of combat being affected by level, not just tanking. If I had replaced the word &quot;warrior&quot; with the word &quot;ranger&quot; in my initial post, would that have made it more obvious? Notice I even put in parens (any dual wield capable class)?<br />
<br />
Those aren't incredibly unlikely scenarios...they are test scenarios. I listed them because those are simply the best scenarios to find the exact difference caused by level for melee damage output, melee damage absorption, and spell resist rates (both casting and recieving). There is a simple rule to testing - Isolate the variable you are looking to find data about and test.<br />
<br />
The difference between a level 60 and a level 65 character is NOT so small. You don't have to take my word for it, I've given you 4 different methods to test and find out for yourself.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In regard to the raid tanking comment...I have a question: is the same combat engine used on raids as is used in xp tanking?</div></div><hr />
