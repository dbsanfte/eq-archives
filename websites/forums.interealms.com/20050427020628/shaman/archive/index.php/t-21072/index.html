<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all -- 2 b0x a 60 Warrior and 60 Shaman.  Where would ya'll suggest for a &quot;safe&quot; (since I'm 2- boxing on 2 computers) place to 2-box xp to 61 to get that new pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd suggest flies in PoD they're pretty safe at 60.  when my warrior was in his high 50's to 62 i did PoJ enforcers tho.  <br />
<br />
Just root one and kill the other. (you'll understand when you see the enforcer room)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any tier 1 spot would do really. PoN has a number of good spots, nightstalkers or by the waterfall should be fine. PoD flies as mentioned. PoI zone in, but avoid archaics like the plague and watch out for trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Itstak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I two box a 65 Warrior and 65 Shaman also. The 3 camps I would reccomend are Veksar, Inner Acylia Caverns and Chardok B. Just get the warrior a 10 dose gate potion for leaving some of these zones though. Some very nice drops in all of these zones, so why not level and get a few gear upgrades or some nice traders supplies to raise that Shaman's bank account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nadox might not be a bad spot for ya, PoJ basement isn't bad (good gem drops and eth parchments) PoD underbulks, pon treants, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Caves in PoJ aren't bad, but can be a pain with adds occasionally.  I'd wait until 61 to go there, with alpha dog, that can tank them pretty good if you happen to get an extra on the pull.  Eth parchments drop a lot there (had up to six in one session).</div></div><hr />
