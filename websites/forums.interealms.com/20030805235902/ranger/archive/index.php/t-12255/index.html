We had a group +1 consisting of me (51-52), 52 Warrior, 52 Rogue, 52-53 Cleric, 53 Enchanter, and a 57 Mage in the group (had a 54 two-boxed Druid with us for Chloro, extra healing, getting us out of Dodge ...).  We didn't make it overly far into the wing, and without the Mage pet to eat HTs from some of the skels, we probably wouldn't have made it as far as we did (Warrior couldn't take that much damage and pets are expendable).  After the drop, we went down the ramp and straight and set up in the little stone tunnel between rooms.  Could have possibly moved up farther (not entirely sure as that is as far as I moved up.  Warrior would have a better idea as he was pulling).  But just where we were, we took a couple of deaths (well, just me that I can remember ... I have my sit key in the same place as my kick key on two different key banks ... bad things happen when you think you are standing up but are really sitting back down so you try to stand up again to find that you are sitting back down ...  Didn't go very well for me).<br />
<br />
The only thing that kind of floored me was once when we were in the North wing (minus the mage) and the Enc went down (standing too far up and the critters agroed on her.  It was bad).  The rogue called for everyone to take different mobs so that we could hold agro when the cleric healed.  Don't know what he was thinking, but at least I had my head on straight.  Snare, Taunt, pull, root, repeat for the other mob.  Killed the repops as they happened before we could get the Enc back with us.  You'd think that after playing with me for four years (used to do the same thing with my Cleric when things got tight), he'd know what all we are capable of.  His response aftwards?  &quot;Or Hob can do that.&quot;  (Hob is referencing my Cleric Hobbletoe by the way.)  Someday he will learn ...<br />
