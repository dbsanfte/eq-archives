First shammy to 60 gets it hehe, im 58, next closest is 56 i think, but we have some inactive shamans at 59 that might come back soon.<br />
<br />
Anyway I have this week to try and get to 60, as i wont have much play time after this week.<br />
<br />
I was planning on sitting in one of the planes and hope to get a good group, but is there anywhere to solo that i will be able to get decent exp without epic or jbb, only horse, or is PoP the best?<br />
<br />
I will stay on for as long as i need, probably 10 hours a day /grin<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think with 10 hours a day for 5 days you should be able to reach 60,  at 1 blue per hour that would be just enough hours to cover you !! IMHO PoP should be the way, Try get a group together and go camp inside the castle in PoD pulling the deathbone Mages. The spawns are nicely spread but you will need CC from a Bard or Chanter. At 57 I get 10% exp per hour / hour and a half. BTW The Crypt Guardians at the very top round the corner are un-mezzable so mem up Paralyzing earth /Root. We did this with a 60 Beast tanking ;p so a 'REAL' tank should pose no threat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">update: IVE now got 77% through lvl 58, got 3 yellow in one day in PoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Way more than a blue per hour in PoP.  58-60 in 50 hours is no problem.<br />
<br />
At 58 I was seeing 2.5 blues per hour at the hobgoblin camp in Plane of Nightmare.  Get in hobs, docks or hedge and you will fly.  You'll need some higher level friends to do really well at those camps, and stay away from the Scourge hobgoblin 8^)<br />
<br />
Gloom nightmares are easy to slow, easy to tank after they are slowed, and amazingly good XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for info weissblau :) i havent been able to get many groups in PoN atmt hough... in fact none at all, ive just been duoing with a 55 necro in PoD and that is great exp :)</div></div><hr />
