<br />
I targeted yeldema the 32k melee only dragon and ran to SG zoneline. I started slinging arrows for a good 1/2 hour and kept summoning more. I kept hitting for dmg and was outside the aggro range of the dragon. Eventually  this got boring and I camped out. Wish someone else had been there close enough to see how low on hp the dragon got.</div></div><hr />

The key is that the item was working as intended when they put it in the game.<br />

The archery machine gun was not working as intended.</div></div><hr />

But still, I felt it was a bit of poetic justice for us, even for just one night, considering how long Archery has been &quot;broken&quot;. I had a necro tell me about this, right before Talendor was pulled. A mage quickly summoned me a bunch of arrows, I got up on a hill and started firing away. It was absolutely incredible, I've NEVER gotten such a rush as firing those shots at him. Made me want to go solo Klandicar or something, lol, the feeling was THAT powerful.<br />
<br />
And yes, my group got the experience for the kill. :D <br />
<br />
Was great, even if only for the one night. Just wished I'd thought to have logged it.</div></div><hr />

I tend to button beat when using archery, and as it came down the cliff a stream of arrows went shooting out of my bow. I experimented with it, figured it out.<br />
<br />
In answer to your question, no Ice Burrowers do not summon, nor do Tantor or Stronghorn. Would assume icehackle doesnt <br />
either, but have never seen him up.<br />
<br />
Some numbers i heard about from other people on The Tribunal ranged from 1-2k per second with am3 and decent bows.</div></div><hr />

Atleast last time i tryed to mess with him. I wouldent try to solo him again heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I didn't get summoned by the ice burrower.  <br />
<br />
Tantor didn't summon me either when I played this game on him-- although if you are lev'd you have to watch it... they'll get you even if you are 1000 feet in the air within &quot;melee radius&quot; of them.  <br />
<br />
Iceshackle-- didn't summon me-- but his aggro radius seems to be twice as large as the velium hounds.  He hits HARD and FAST, as any velium hound does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, it seems like some people come here just to complain about what everyone else is doing, and there are a few people I see over and over again posting about how what someone else is doing is wrong. LAY OFF. It may raise your self esteem to think your oh so great knowledge of EQ is better than everyone, but go prove it somewhere else.<br />

It's getting old fast.</div></div><hr />
