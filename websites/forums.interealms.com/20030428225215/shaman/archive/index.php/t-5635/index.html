Well,  pretend he used a potion here.<br />
<br />
Why can't us shaman have a potion that wards off death and brings you back to life.  Whats wrong with a potion that takes a 180 skill to make and gives us maybe ~90% rez?  Make it cost 300pp if you want.  <br />
<br />
Just a wonderful thought for PoP.<br />

Personally, I *LOVE* the idea of a rez potion.  ... might even make it worth burning a few thousand plat to get alchemy maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I forwarded this to Alan Vancouvering:<br />
<br />
Alan,  I was reading on the shaman's crucible forums about some alchemy ideas, and one that really struck me was the idea of a high skill level shaman rez potion.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to find a cleric in some out of the way places -- especially as the game world continues to grow, and a rez potion could be a nice seller for shaman plus add some spice and reasons for high level alchemy.  Potions are a 1 shot deal, and so are rezzes, so they'd be a perfect match.  Possibly make it an 88% rez at lvl 60 or something to that effect, and base it off level like the shaman damageshield potions and have it cost roughly the same price as gate potions.  At a 200 skill trivial it would require a lvl 64 shaman to trivialize it, etc.  <br />
<br />
I think it would be nice to have it as 1% increase from 60 - 65, and then 2% drop off each level from 60 down.  e.g. a 93% rez at lvl 65, and drop 1% per level to 60, so 92% @ 64, 91% @ 63 ... 88% @ 60, and then down 2% each level below 60. 86% at 59, 84% at 58, ... down to a 2% rez potion at lvl 15, and 1%, or even 0% below lvl 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*PAYING* for stat buffs?????<br />
<br />
ROTFLGSDGGMAO<br />
<br />
No.  It's &quot;harness plz thx&quot;  Unless you're a Druid porting noone on Karana is allowed to charge for casting spells.  Clerics don't get jack for rezzes, even from Druids.  Chanters don't get diddly for clarity.  No, I've never, ever, been paid for any of the spells I've cast.  <br />
<br />
I think a res potion is a fabulous idea, as it's so easy to get caught in the middle of nowhere without a cleric.  If you make it expensive it won't hurt clerics any, but it will help everyone else, plus giving us something to make money on.<br />
<br />
Nice idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just dont think everyclass should have the ability to rez themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is a great idea, however....<br />
<br />
How would it work? Currently the person casting the rez spell has to cast it on your corpse. Would you have to be at your corpse to use it? Potions before now have always been target-self (to my knowledge which is quite limited on this subject still). however, this would suggest making the potion targetable to a corpse. While that sounds easy i bet its not. Not only that, but people would be buying these for &quot;ports&quot; to a corpse almost like a second bind point. Not to mention, what happens when you have multiple corpses?<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like the idea.... heck I like any idea that might actually create a use for skill past 75. <br />
<br />
To people whos say it might be used as a cheap gate to bind and back, weeeeeell I think you need to consider A) IF this did ever go in it would prolly be more along the lines of 30 - 50 percent rez (knowing how much VI loves alchemy prolly less) and B) most likely have either rare dropped components or be very expensive making them useful to only a select group of clients causting in the 300 - 500pp range just to produce C) the triv will likely also be set so as to make failing part of its creation no matter what your skill like 200 with a max skill of 198 (with stone) or maybe even 250 so you will fail more than you can make to start.<br />
<br />
It would be VERY nice to be able to keep these on every monk, SK, and rogue that has ever encountered my corpse :)<br />
<br />
Like many other ideas this would be a great addition to Shaman and alchemy but if they wont give us a heal cause the clerics whine, imagine what they'll do when they here we will have rez in a bottle.<br />
<br />
Great idea. Dont hold yer breath this is Verant and Alchemy we're talkin about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A) IF this did ever go in it would prolly be more along the lines of 30 - 50 percent rez (knowing how much VI loves alchemy prolly less)<br />
<br />
While i agree with you, leaving a already rezed corpse behind is quite common to get to and from one place already, but it requires a cleric or pally or someone that can rez to be there. Just because exp-timers have expired doesnt mean the corpse cant be rezzed. The fact that it would be 1,50, or even 100% is moot in this case cause thats not what people would be using it for most of the time in the scenario i am describing. The situation i am describing is quite common when venturing into VP. Leave a corpse outside so that its easy to get out of the zone once you are inside.<br />
<br />
B) most likely have either rare dropped components or be very expensive making them useful to only a select group of clients causting in the 300 - 500pp range just to produce C) the triv will likely also be set so as to make failing part of its creation no matter what your skill like 200 with a max skill of 198 (with stone) or maybe even 250 so you will fail more than you can make to start. <br />
<br />
Yep, this would definitely cut down on its use of this, but i would imagine clerics aren't going to like it anyways. <br />
<br />
Honestly, i think its a great idea, but there are a lot of questions and problems that arise as the result of such a potion. I'm willing to bet that if one of us thinks of those issues, so will verant. Might as well be ready to think about solutions to those problems before hand. Just playing devil's advocate here. The idea is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd say the best way to introduce a shaman rez potion would to have it require imbued gems.  <br />
<br />
A fitting recipe would be imbued opal(Rodcet, prime healer), imbued rose quartz(Erollosi, love), heliotrope(used in gate potions), and lucern(used in regen potion)<br />
<br />
Or if mixing in the gems directly in the bag sounds uncouth, add a step a la blessed dust of tunare karana, so you have blessed dust of rodcet, and blessed dust of erollosi.<br />
<br />
At any rate, none of these would get made without a cleric's say-so.  And, this would put the production cost around 110pp per attempt, and 2 clerics in cahoots with you.<br />
<br />
It's be reasonable to make such a potion self only, and you need corpse targeted.  <br />
<br />
Or a more painful idea... make an essence emerald part of the alchemy combine (yuck)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As long as the rez from the potion is the 90% one, and has a very long cast time(say, 60 seconds), and can only be drunk by the person who wants the rez, I don't see a balance problem arising.<br />
<br />
Make it take some expensive component, as well as an essence emerald.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Potions have not ALWAYS been self only and it is not a coding problem to make them targetable.. also.. i think summon corpse potions would be a nice idea, we have them on sullonn and people liked them on legends =)<br />
( summon corpse potions on sullon are targetable )<br />
<br />
<br />
so rez and summon corpse potions .. and maybe some cute illusions would really own and make alchemy worthwile again.<br />
<br />
you could park a twink in the bazaar and one a guild whipes out you can make mad cash if the have no necro online =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, i didnt know that, Ineluk. Sounds quite cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Component for a rez potion: essence emeralds<br />
<br />
Makes us dependant on another class (i.e. more difficult to make and VI may see that as a good thing)<br />
<br />
Also, make it with a very high trivial number and LORE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lore eh, can only have single dose version and can only make one at a time. but probably only verant would allow it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
.. i really think we don't need such a potion.<br />
<br />
<br />
fixing alchemy cost would be nice, ok, but greedily asking some potions that would give us more abilities and powers to? When will we see threads asking for some &quot;berserker potions&quot; to dual wield and double attack? Or for some MB potion?<br />
(you think i'm wrong? well... do you remember clarity potions we were asking? we got it, and that's not enough, now we'd like rezzes?)<br />
<br />
<br />
I always wondered why we were able to make DS potions, or ITU potions, while it could be logical for us to only be able to create potions that match our spells (i.e. buffs, regen, haste, levi, EB, healing, ....)<br />
(ok, ok, i won't cry because we can do it lol, and i like these ones. i almost always have a ITU potion on me)<br />
<br />
<br />
Potions should be &quot;shammy in the pocket&quot;, not an extend to our already great list af capacities!!!<br />
<br />
Most important is to ask to fix the skill! Here should be our priority!!<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, i agree that some rezz potion still could help. finding a cleric to rez is not always easy. <br />
But please, ... i'd rather see these one storebought than crafted with alchemy.<br />

(you think i'm wrong? well... do you remember clarity potions we were asking? we got it, and that's not enough, now we'd like rezzes?)<br />
<br />
To be fair, we didn't get clarity potions. We got a useless potion that no one makes because it's too expensive.<br />
<br />
I mean, really, who would spend 100pp to get 3 mana/tick for a very short time, when you can buy 4 hour KEI for the same amount?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's a breeze potion.  For the cost, I bet you could hire a level 20 chanter to follow you around.  But yeah, KEI is a better deal.  ;)<br />
<br />
This will never happen because?  Because then DRUIDS would have to have a rez, being the other priest class.  Nope, will not happen.  I would love to have it, but it would mean that shamans would have to take a boot to the head in some other area to balance it out.<br />
<br />
Tho I'd happily send every single PoP spell to date (other than the dots) straight back to VI wrapped with a big bow and a note that says &quot;thanks but no thanks&quot; in exchange for rez potions.<br />
<br />
Won't happen.  More's the pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just to throw a wrench in things, but you fellas know there's a rez potion in game already that drops off the goo in Dragon Necropolis down in the paebala area in the cellar.  It's a 60% rez, 1 charge LORE item.<br />
<br />
It's not stackable, sure, but it's not that hard to get either, and for the trouble, it's worth having one to carry around on you.<br />
<br />
If you can get one from DN (Amorphous Mass) I think the mob's called, why not get one from alchemy?<br />
<br />
Then again, there's been an invis potion in game for years that we can't make either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Chukrasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Kind of an old post, but there's a side to the topic I didn't see discussed.  Instead of a rez potion, why not a potion that increases the rez timer?  We might be asking for a bit much with rez potions, maybe this is a reasonable middle ground.<br />
