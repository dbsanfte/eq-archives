<br />
I am a level 51 Shaman, with average gear.<br />
<br />
I've got a friend who is a level 52 druid, and we've decided that we're gonna try dueling each other.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any suggestions on what tactics I can use?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated:)<br />

<br />
Buy some pumice. Click off your 2 junk buffs so when he dots you, they are in your top 2 spots. Use the pumice to remove his dots. Use the pumice to strip the druids buffs. Keep the pumice in a hotkey for easy casting. (when the charges are all used, replace with a new pumice from your bag) Send your puppy at him.<br />
<br />
Debuff the druid and start stacking the dots. Heal yourself when you need to and melee him in between. Try to keep him rooted and slam to interrupt his spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sounds cool to me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for that.<br />
<br />
Got a couple of questions though....is it worth blinding him initially. I know that he's got better resist gear than I have, his resists are gonna be just over 100 buffed. Is it worth leading with malosi? Will it stick with his magic resist being just over 100?<br />
<br />
Also, he's obviously gonna try and root my pet. So, I guess it's best to keep the pet until the time comes to send him in. What spells do you think I should have memmed initally?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, do you think I've got a good chance of winning?:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got a couple of questions though....is it worth blinding him initially.

<br />
Back when I was your level, resists weren't the same in pvp. Root and blind would never stick. Nowdays even with great resists, I can land blind and root with relative ease. Of course I lead with malo which helps.<br />
<br />
I would surely try to land malosini a couple of times after you have stripped some of his buffs off. If it gets resisted then screw it and start dotting.<br />
<br />
Insidious decay is unresistable (If you have that spell yet) then stack all your disease dots.<br />
<br />
I won't lie to you though...I used to hate druids until I learned how to fight them. Pumice, pumice, pumice.<br />
<br />
The key is to keep his dots in your tops spots so you can dispell them without dispelling your good buffs like regen and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thats cool.<br />
<br />
New happening though, we're thinking of doing a trade off, he's not gonna bring his resist gear as long as I don't have doggy.<br />
<br />
good/bad idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mastahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dont worry about his resists. Shinerbear hit the nail on the head and gave you perfect advise. Keep doggydogg in the picture. Lead with Malosini, sic pet to keep him occupied/disrupted, pumice the crap outta him and stack the dots. Melee all the while to assist in disrupting him. Always keep those top two spell slots open so you can dispell anything he hits you with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where does one acquire Punice? Is it sold, farmed, or a ground spawn?<br />
<br />
Also, what is its effect and does it stack? And how many charges does it have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where does one acquire Punice? Is it sold, farmed, or a ground spawn?  <br />
<br />
It's sold by vendors in most cities. The same vendors that sell cloudy potions and food crystals and such. It's full name is crystallized pumice.<br />
<br />
It is a 5 charge stone with Pillage Enchantment. (removes buffs) In the old days it used to be called egg-shaped pumice and had an instant casting time. About a year ago Verant nerfed it and gave it a casting time and re-named it crystallized pumice. It's still effective though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A Druid V Shaman fight should be easy for the Shaman.<br />
<br />
I play on a PvP server, even druids quite a bit higher then me make me laugh in PvP, there hard to kill for sure (as the run off) but they haven't really got the power to take a Shaman down.<br />
<br />
What they got to attack you with?<br />
<br />
DoT's and DD's<br />
<br />
Your resists should be around 120 at your level self buffed IMHO, if there not... well maybe I'm just affected because I'm on a PvP server, but my resists have ALWAYS helped in PvE to.<br />
<br />
Some of his DoT's he will not land because there resistable, he then has virtually unresistable DoT's, which can be stipped off easily with either pumice or cancel magic etc.<br />
<br />
Dispell his DoT's, heal yourself when he nukes you.<br />
<br />
The above advise about having your two top buff slots free is sound, if you have your SoW boots then SoW should be your first buff after that to make dispelling snare (if you want to) easy, and also to help with keeping your buffs up through dispells.<br />
<br />
So hes DoTing you and nuking you, you are dispelling his DoT's and heling his nukes, which costs you far less mana.<br />
<br />
While this is happening your pet is chewing on him making it difficult to cast, may have been snared or rooted but those will wear off or can be dispelled.<br />
<br />
Dispell his buffs when you can, pretty soon he'll be oom, you'll have a pet and probably half your mana.<br />
<br />
Get Mal to stick, may as well keep casting until it sticks, when it has stuck your quick acting DoT's will stick and he hopefully will have no mana to cure.<br />
<br />
All the Druid can do at that point is die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">shrug I dunno about dueling all that much but I would assume dog dog would be little to no factor if the druid knew what he was doing.  assuming he wold snare and root dog and move on to you since dog dog, not sure how well that work since the old resists on pets is based on players now.  <br />
<br />
Normal druid tactics would be snare, root, Dot and run out of range.  reapply when needed.   so that what you need to be ready for.  <br />
<br />
Other thing i would look out for is nukes since druids can nuke for quite a bit of damage so keep an eye on your life.<br />
<br />
Since you on PvE server I'm assuming the druid isn't all decked out for duels and may not be totally prepared to what you can do.  But Oe ebolt should be making him run really low on life before he knows what's going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stick dog on him at once, then Insidious Decay and Plague, that'll hurt him good and you'll still have plenty mana for healing etc. Your best bet is to kill him your disease line of DoTs considering they will stick easier and you should have more mana than him in a longer fight. I'm assuming this is an arena fight where noone ports out to med up :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is assuming your going for an Arena off lake rathe fight.<br />
<br />
If the Druid is at all clever, or in fact not completely useless, your DoT's will not be of any use at first, they have both counteract poison and disease from level 29 so will not have a great deal of trouble removing your DoT's.<br />
<br />
Let the Druid take the offensive. <br />
<br />
Let him DoT you and then remove it.<br />
<br />
Let him nuke you, and then heal it.<br />
<br />
Dispell his buffs, dispell him constantly.<br />
<br />
I would like to add that your pet will be a HUGE factor in this fight, do not let your pet get isolated from yourself and taken out, if he snares and or roots your pet, so what? You can dispell them if you have your pet set up right, or just wait for them to wear off.<br />
<br />
Time and mana he spends casting on your pet is time and mana in which he is not casting on you, he has TWO targets to worry about.<br />
<br />
On a PvP server in PvE the resists on pet are based on the casters resists, in PvP it is based on the level of the pet I &quot;think&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat, dispell his buffs, ALL of them.<br />
<br />
If you knock his SoW off he will be in trouble trying to reapply it, you have got your epic SoW boots now haven't you?<br />
<br />
Play the mana game with him, cause when hes oom and you have a pet, mana and a **** load better melee damage then him its the end for your tree hugging friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Assuming you have your boots (and if not, go get them immediately! for  shame!)... run right at him and click your boots about 350times (be sure YOU have all your display stuff turned off).<br />
<br />
In the ensuing lag sic dogdog, pumice then boots, then pumice, then boots... you get the idea.<br />
<br />
You'll either lag him out, or have him screaming with laughter at the &quot;ice skating ogre&quot; graphic on his screen. Either way, it'll buy you some time to knock his buffs off. Then Ebolt him till he begs you to stop.<br />
<br />
BTW, at least on PVE servers, this technique also works remarkably well with bards. I would assume that on PvP servers, it's common to turn all that sissy bluebie visual aid stuff off... at least I would if I could stomach PvP. /shrug anyway... This technique, done properly, screws up their finger wiggling timing terribly and makes them susceptible to things like root, bash and blind (a TERRIBLE thing to do to a bard... if he can't see where he's running, he'll run into something and stop eventually.)<br />
<br />
I don't duel often, but when I do, I try to use my RL brain to make my toon smarter than the game mechanics. I didn't design lag, but I know how to use it.<br />
<br />
If you object morally to this, then by all means don't do it. But it IS part of the game that we all have to deal with (can you say Naggy raid lag? I knew you could. /grin)<br />
<br />
Good luck and don't worry about the snare at all. Get rid of his sow. That's the key toward the end of the fight cuz you'll pound him into treepulp in straight melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Would like a writeup of how the fight went if possible, did our suggestions help you open up the O'l can of whoop ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1. Better to have Dogdog and let him wear his resist gear - dogdog is good in PvP. <br />
<br />
2. Do not buff Dogdog at all (just project alpha) - he will try to root / snare dogdog - if he does, just either cast cancel magic (or use pumice) to remove the root / snare<br />
<br />
3. Aim to get him oom - remember, once a druid is oom he is useless. Pumice his DoTs where possible, heal self where necessary. Cast low mana spells (blind is really good in PvP) to preserve your own mana. Melee as much as possible - dont use bearform, wear a shield so you can bash to interrupt his casting<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Use your disease based spells - cast insidious decay first because it cannot be resisted, then use scrouge and plague. If he tries to cure disease, you can reapply insidious decay as necessary to &quot;protect&quot; your other DoTs.<br />
<br />
5. Cast annul magic on him as often as possible - it will strip all his buffs. Druids get some quite nice buffs, and taking away his SoE, Natureskin, strength, Damage shield, etc<br />
<br />
6. Make or buy as many stinging wort potions as you can afford. If you have 2 or 3 x 10 shot stinging wort, you WILL win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Give doggy 2 gnoll lariats and harness him, then do what everyone else said(junk buffs/pumice, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">2 Questions:<br />
<br />
1: What are stinging wort potions.....and what is their use?<br />
<br />
2: what are gnoll hide lariats.<br />
<br />
And I haven't fought him yet, so I haven't been able to test your strategies out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1: Stinging wort potions give a 300 HP buff effect called Calimony, it wears off slowly over the course of 6 mins but ye can use em to heal yourself, also I think they can be used to stop you getting mezzed, not 100% sure of that as I haven't used them yet, I will be using them in an upcoming PvP tournament this Sunday.<br />
<br />
Go to the Alchemy section for a full write up.<br />
<br />
2: Gnoll hide lariats are dropped by a couple of Gnolls in Black Burrow and by Gnolls outside and inside Splitpaw, if you give your pet 2 FS weapons, he will duel wield, if you give him two Gnoll Hide Lariats, he will duel wield, his damage will stay the same and he'll also be proccing stun quite a fair bit in your Druid friends face.... Yummy :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for the answers...BUT<br />
<br />
My pet is only the lvl 49 pet, so he can't duel wield..aM I right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also how much do stinging wort potions cost if your alchemy is only 21?:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You don't need a pet.  A couple nights ago in Seb I was sitting at zone in waiting for the melees in my group to get a CR and rez at Pickler (I gated out so I was just dandy) I was full hp and mana.  No pet up whatsoever.  When who just so happens to port in but TANNER!!!  My Arch-Nemesis and king of the dr00ds (Evil KSing druids most commonly found in RM).  Well a few days before that Tanner trained me and KSed me until he stole my spawns in HHK so I have sort of a grudge against him.<br />
<br />
So I type /duel and I flip him the ol' /rude.  He meds to full and then accepts.  I immediately smack him with a malosi then stack on plague and Ebolt and start SoV-ing him til he dies.  He died quickly and I still had a bub of hp left and a fire dot on.  I just healed til the dot went away and I was very pleased with myself.<br />
<br />
Note:  I am only 52 with none of the uber shaman solo gear (JBB, epic, horse, regen bp) and I owned a 55 druid.  I also had no pet so I really did do well.  Imagine the power with a pet and project alpha.<br />
<br />
SO yes druids are pansies to kill.  Especially in an indoor place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yep, your wrong.<br />
<br />
Your pet will duel wield his weapons, give hime two procing weapins, you can probably even give him that Engulfing Darkness dagger, though I prefer two stun proc's.</div></div><hr />
