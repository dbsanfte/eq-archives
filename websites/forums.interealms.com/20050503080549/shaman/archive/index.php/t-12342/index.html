<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is it SO hard to find a cleric flagged for Storms and Valor? I<br />
suggest we all /feedback for rentable NPC clerics. <br />
<br />
Couldn't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow. That has definitely not been a problem that I've seen. /comfort Kbok. Clerics have had a much easier time getting thru trials, as far as I've seen, than shamans. After all, every group can use a cleric in the trials (executioner's trial anyways) but don't need a shaman. If you're unguilded, I guess that explains it. Most people get flagged as part of a guild effort, so most clerics flagged for PoV/PoS are probably in guild groups instead of &quot;pick-up&quot; groups. Sorry to ramble on here. Good luck to you and happy hunting. :)</div></div><hr />
