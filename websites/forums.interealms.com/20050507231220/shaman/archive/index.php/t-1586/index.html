<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone :-)<br />
<br />
Vallya is my 46th shaman, and she's having a terrible time with her pet :-(   The past two nights are good examples of whats been happening. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wedneday night, Kaesora. My group was sitting on the ramp, breaking into Xalgoz's temple. I summoned my pet and ordered it to guard here. We had fought four or five pulls and were medding for the next when the pup casually walks away, and aggros the temple.<br />
<br />
Thursday night, Fungus Grove. We entered from Echo and I summoned the pup in the outpost area. There was a second shaman in the group, and he summoned a pet as well.  We moved out away from the outpost to pick a fight or two. The other shaman's pet followed like an obedience school valedictorian. My pet got stuck in the tunnels every 20 paces or so. We fought the first fungus we came to, and decided to move clock-wise along the wall to the next battle. Again the other pup was right on his master's heels. I followed along for the first 50 paces or so before looking back to check on my dog. It was not a narrow passage, I thought the thing would follow me. It was no where in sight. I quickly prepare my summon pet spell, but by then I had no pet to summon. I DID however have about 8 fungus that wanted me dead :-(<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up: its nearly impossible to get my pet to follow me indoors, and it wanders off and picks fights for no apparent reason EVERY NIGHT.  I use the sit, follow me, attack, report health, guard here, and no taunt commands.  I've been in Norrath for two and a half years now, and I have never seen anyone have this much trouble with a pet. What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were you having connection problems?  I know that when packet loss goes up, your pet tends to get a bit of wanderlust.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I've had some probs with my pet as well in the past.  I absolutely LOVE our summon pet spell.....just /pet sit somewhere safe, run across zone to your pulling point, then summon your pet to your side :)  <br />
<br />
That's how I travel with mine now.....and I use petsit a lot more than /pet guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greetings Vallya!<br />
<br />
Our pets can be both bane and boon. <br />
<br />
As has been mentioned, lag and packet loss can severely affect pathing, this may have been what happened to you in fungus grove, and indeed in Kaesora the other night. <br />
<br />
Also... Fungus Grove is a high level zone, we were killing (aye I am the &quot;other&quot; shaman ;)) the yard trash  and it was red and yellow to our group.  This makes our pets much lower level ( by 20 or so levels) than the local plant life, which means they get agroed much easier.  Even the slightest blink in your connection can mean the pet wanders a few feet to the side and something casts on him... <br />
<br />
Though I may have made walking the pet look easy... I had my finger on my Broom of Trilon, ready to swat him in an instant if he misbehaved, the whole distance.  Perhaps this Sword of Damacles kept him in line ;).<br />
<br />
I retrospect, dragging pets any distance in that zone was probably not a good idea for either of us.  Better to park them with /pet sit down in  safe spot and summon them to do battle.<br />
<br />
I love our pets but since they are often green to what a  group would  fight, sometimes its best just to leave them in the kennel as well to avoid excessive agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dog dog is a natural born trouble maker!  <br />
<br />
I two box a Shaman and a Mage.  When moving through tight spaces (i.e. corridors, tunnels) the mage pet follows his master right on his heels straight on until mage stops.  In the same areas Dog dog lags behind, does many stop-turn around-run back-stop-turn around-run forward, and will eventually reach the group long after everyone else including mage pet.  I see with my own eyes almost daily differences in the pathing between Shaman and Mage pets.  Makes me think that all pets aren't created equally.<br />
<br />
Also at camp point I set both pets to guard.  Mage pet always goes back to guard point.  Dog dog likes to wander.  At least two or three times per night after a fight I won't see Dog dog.  On a good night he comes lazily meandering back after a few minutes from a random direction.  On a bad night I get the taunting messages followed by a dead dog and mad mobs looking for Barb-e-que.<br />
<br />
The only way I get around the pathing while travelling is by sitting (/pet sit down) pet in safe areas and using summon companion.  I have found no cure for Dog dog's wanderlust, but luckily I have the Mage pet to clean up his accidents ;)<br />

Fun fact: a 'dag' is the wool around a sheep's anus that's too encrusted with feces to use.<br />
<br />
Oh, those Australian sheep herders! What slang will they come up with next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our pets used to be fine. This business of randomly wandering away from the /pet hold point shouldn't be lag-related because the pet is controlled by the server (although who knows, with VI).<br />
<br />
This never used to be a major problem for me; pet always did used to get stuck in walls and have z-axis problems, but the SoL release and the new model was what started this train-causing business of heading away from the hold point and aggroing random stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kieran - I agree. Not only did they change the model, but they made the pet walk closer to the ground. And I ttink the landscape is causing the dog to get confused, in a way that floating pets (like mage pets) don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One of my group regulars is a chanter, and I have wondered if his pet's natural levitation had something to do with its good behavior relative to my pup. Can our pets be levitated? Has anyone tried this with improved pathing in mind?<br />
<br />
<br />
There seems to be more at work here than universally bad pathing. I followed blakkon (as near to walking in his footsteps as possible) and my pet got lost in seconds. The mobs it aggroed were not very close to us either. I use a 56k dial up, but noticed no lag problems at the time.  <br />
<br />
One idea came to mind.  What about the lag reducing changes made a little while ago (the ones that changed the frequency and content of the data passed between server and client). I seem to remember being given the option to filter out some data to reduce lag, and I think I used the new feature.  By choosing the lag reducing settings am I affecting the data the pet needs to function?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for the response :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seriously, I find our pets to be more of a hinderance than a help in most situations. He doesnt hit that hard, he doesn't have any hp to speak of, and controlling a pet with the really fooked up pathing there is all over the moon, especially when you can kill just as easy without him there, makes it just a personal decision for a pet. Now, if I am in one particular spot and I know the pathing is ok, and I won't be moving, then I might summon one up to give the little bit of help that he does, but many times it just isnt worth it imo. As for travelling across a zone with a pet in tow&gt;? Yeah, you are much better off either just waitin till you get to your destination or making him sit in a safe spot and summon companion afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Where can the spell summon companion be found? I looked all over EC but I am an ickie so I didnt mess with any of the ones that scowled at me, I figured the merchant that sells it would be indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its sold in the tunnels by an Erudite (i think) merchant, close to the Shady Swashbuckler.<br />

54pp I think also, can't remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aye, Rushka Deklamoor, just to the left of the tunnel from EC to the Shady area.  Also sells Chloroblast, now, I believe.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Do you like dags?&quot;<br />

&quot;Yeah, dags&quot;<br />
&quot;Ohhh.... dogs. Yeah, I love dogs&quot;<br />

<br />
I've seen other people with this opinion, but it DEFINATELY doesn't stand up to my experience.  I'm wondering - do you usually solo or group?  In a group or melee duo situation where you're pulling to a static spot - which is the majority of my experience - the pet works great, rarely causes trouble, and adds a little more than half a warrior's worth of melee to the battle.<br />
<br />
I have had problems using him in a solo situation, or when I was roaming around.<br />
<br />
One trick that helps, btw - use /pet back off right before the mob dies to clear any aggro that the pet may have generated on another mob.  This is especially important if the other mob has healed the one you're fighting.  I learned this the hard way in the old Cazic Thule, when a green lizard healed the blue I was fighting.  My dog took off after him when the blue was dead and aggroed half the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NukuUnu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">dog dog stopz to pee and sniffz da other dog dog scentz on da wayz! dog dog gud but fruity!<br />
<br />
Seriously I watch dog very closely when moving from camp to camp or kill and remake when we get there. I do a lot of walking backwards when moving to make sure the dam dog is not straying.</div></div><hr />
