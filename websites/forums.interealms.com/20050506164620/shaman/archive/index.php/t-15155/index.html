<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow shammies,<br />
<br />
I usually get to my hunting spot and realize that I don't have any weapons for my dog.  Question:  Can I have my 2 boxed cleric summon those cleric only weapons and give those to him?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your responses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Another question, is there an item that will summon weapons?<br />
<br />
I usually buy forging hammers from the vendor in shadowhaven they are 1hb, and only cost a couple silver, right near the nexus port in.  But I can't always get there for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This would be way beyond unbalancing for a pet to weild the proc.</div></div><hr />

Since I don't know of any, I just farm GD for Velium weapons.   Proc goes off at a fairly decent rate, and it all just helps with dps.  : )   Plus, I make a few pp off the giants I kill for 'em.   Not much...3-5 pp per giant, but I usually end up killing 20-30 filling up a 10 slot bag with weapons.  So I make enough to donate for C3 several times.   Works for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I have several places I look for pet weapons.  I've personally not heard of the foraging hammer before though it sounds good.  I like Shives from LoY most vendors have some in the lighthouse in guntak 6sp or so.  Skellies at the Nek Pok book always a couple weapon packing ones near there.  In PoK its self there is a guy that sales fishing supplies near a pond by where alchemy items are sold.  He sales Rusty daggers for few silvers.  I just try to keep on average 3 sets on me so I have backups if I ever lack room for loot I just dump a pet weapon as they are not worth much and can make it back from the sale of the loot.  Though I do really HATE it when I forget to bring my trusty weapons for the mutt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I like chill daggers or etchaka's (sp). They are both off hand only so you only need to give fido one for the desired effect. This lets you carry less of them around. I've noticed that you can usually buy ALOT of the etchaka's off one of the vendors in shadeweavers thicket even tho it isn't part of thier normal stock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your reasoning sounds good, but is it true?  I'm not totally confident that handing him an off-hand only weapon that he actually puts it in offhand.  I guess it can be tested a couple of ways.  I imagine his off hand goes off a lot less then his primary.  So, handing him an off hand only and parse it for a while, then hand him a 1h anything for primary and see if there's a change.  <br />
<br />
I have the feeling that the pet doesn't care if it is off-hand only, but you could very well be right :)<br />
<br />
Last time I handed weapons to my pet was for snares in seb (serrated bone dirk, thief only, and yes it works).  Other then that, pet is buff timer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It works. It takes about 30 seconds for anyone who wants to, to confirm it. Go buy a chill dagger (piercing, off hand only) and give it to your dog. Turn on his hits and have him attack something. You'll see both clawing? (maybe biting can't remember off hand) and piercing, IE it's dual wielding. If you try that with a regular dagger you would only get piercing since it's equiped in the primary slot. You can also easily see the effect with any pet that you can see wielding weapons (IE necro and mage). Give them an off hand weapon only and they will equipe in the off hand. I've been using weapons like this for a while and am 100% sure it works.<br />
<br />
Giving the pet even rusty weapons is nice because it noticably increases your pets dps if you get him dual wielding. Mage weapons are nice because of the procs on them. Otherwise I just look for the cheapest and easiest way to get them swinging both paws and off hand only weapons fit this bill nicely. The etchaka's (sp) are nice because I've been able to cheaply buy them in as much quantity as I wanted off a vendor close to a Stone from PoK cheaply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Giving him one off hand weapon does work, BUT, the main reason I give him weapons is not just the Duel Weild, but to change the skill he is using. Dogdog is a Warrior, Warrior HtoH caps at 100, 1HS, 1HB, Piercing all Cap much higher, so it increases his ATK to use these weapons, thus he will miss less, and avrage higher damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doggy does the same damage per hand whether it's bite, crush, slash, or pierce. No difference.</div></div><hr />

Can you provide any evidence to support this? I have never seen any difference between giving pet 2 slashing weapons and giving him 1 off hand only hand to hand weapon which a normal warrior wouldn't even be able to use. Also if it where true you would want to give him blunt or slashing weapons instead since warrior's piercing caps slightly lower.</div></div><hr />

I refuse to think that the dog is a warrior, he is simply 'a mob'.  If he was truly a warrior, he wouldn't be able to use class specific items such as serrated bone dirk (rogue) only.  I prefer to look at the dog as 'a mob' that is 'flagged' with certain basic 'abilities', nothing more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs definitely have a Class associated with them but they don't follow alot of the same rules as regular PC's. An easy example is STA buffs do not effect the hps of mobs. It's also easy to see that they ignore certain stats as far as weapons go. For example all the post 60 mage summoned weapons have race? listed as none so they can't be equiped by players. They sure can be equiped by pets tho since you can see them procing it and can see mage pets wielding em. Pets still do have a base class tho that sets thier basic abilities and that class can be seen with showeq and other simular programs from what i've read.</div></div><hr />

I usually cast it on fido but more to time it for the melee's in the group than anything else.</div></div><hr />

Yes (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14330), as do longer-lasting STR buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why do you guys refer to the pet as 'alpha' ??  I have the lvl 55 Spirit of Howler Pet.. any idea what lvl range it is in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think the 55 pet is 40-45? range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Go to the bazaar and do a search for &quot;all effects&quot; &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;any class&quot; for less than 50pp IF you are using the 55 or lower pet.  If you have the 61 pet, just use the mage summoned procing weapons.  At level 57, I normally buy the lifetap procing whips or YKs if I can get them.  My pet will proc the YKs about 3-8 times during a fight and lets him pull agro from me quickly if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pity really as they stack and are rentable/tradable, would have been the perfect solution, but sadly doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">just because our pet /shields doesnt mean hes a war as someone said before our pet is a &quot;mob&quot;<br />
and all mobs will /shield i have seen a screenshot of a horse using /shield in bot was pretty funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Horses are warrior mobs.<br />
<br />
In short, all mobs default to &quot;warrior&quot; unless clearly given some sort of other class.<br />
<br />
As a f'rinstance, sneak/chanter/caller type goblins in Nurga/Droga don't shield.  Taskmaster/cave lord types do.<br />
<br />
It simply defines a set of abilities which the mob can use, and does not limit weapons.  Find a mob you can give a weapon to, and give it a class-only droppable weapon.  It'll wield any of them.</div></div><hr />
