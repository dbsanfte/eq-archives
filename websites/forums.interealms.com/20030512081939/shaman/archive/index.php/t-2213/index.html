<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Needed: Iron Cudgle of the Clair, skull with I (stuffed baracuda) and skull with II (mandiglow clay, a mandible, jawless skull on the pottery wheel)<br />
<br />
Anyone ever failed the skull combine? What does it give you in return? Apparently it just gave me my jawless skull back...as I didnt identify it, just ran over to the quest giver and handed him all 3 pieces, he ate my cudgle and skull with I, giving me the jawless skull back. <br />
<br />
Forunatly we have a KICK ASS lead gm, so after a little waiting she checked into it and said I had screwed the quest up. <br />
<br />
My main question really, has anyone failed the skull combine? What did it give you? I didnt get a failure message....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a crappy enough time getting the shaman skull from WarsWood, so I made damn sure my skill was beyond the suggested range by 30 points or so.  Only person I have talked with that failed the combine was unaware that pottery skill was needed.  <br />
<br />
How high was your skill when you tried the combine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whats your pottery skill at? This combind is trivael at 80. You can get skill to about 120 in an hour for about 100pp makeing Med bowls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I combined with 2 skill points in pottery with success. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">skill was over 30.<br />
<br />
Tried it again and completed teh quest the other day. Beats me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pottery at 109 and I succeeded on first attempt.<br />
<br />
But, at same skill I attempted the key for the 5th(?) and failed on my first attempt, succeeded on the second one.<br />
<br />
It's really hit and miss. And unfortunatly the only things that dub your success is your skill and any +% mods for pottery skill.<br />
<br />
INT/WIS has nothing to do with your successes, only skill increases.</div></div><hr />
