<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BristolMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been lurking here for a couple of years, finally decided to register to post...<br />
<br />
After two slow years, Bristol is at the point where a horse is feasible.  With the recent changes to the focus items (which I thankfully had little of, Kobold boots didn't put me back far..) I was wondering about some of the facets of horse use.<br />
<br />
Being able to med while casting, and being able to have a horse up but not have your movement slowed down due to manipulating the model settings.  Have these perks been ok'ed by SOE?  Or do I risk having my horse &quot;fixed&quot; as well?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IIRC, SOE said that being able to meditate while sitting on a horse was something they planned on leaving in. That's certainly one of the benefits of having one.<br />
<br />
I'm sure they'll eventually fix the fact that you can avoid the run delay that horses by turning off horse models. That seems like an obvious exploit to me...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't think they will. Not being able to use a horse without Luclin models would be penalizing people for having bad vid cards. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Being forced to use new models would definitely suck muchly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/edit i see the error in my ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">nah, now all you gotta do is turn off horses and pets as well as the model your char is.  Still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">easy to test to.<br />
run along with horse on, click sow boots. zoom, speed increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even if they force those of us with no horse models on to pay the movement/ducking penalty, you can get rid of the horse with a single click.  Pull gone bad?  Need to run for it?  CLICK off horse CLICK on SOW take off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I suspect at some future point down the road (undefined at this time) SOE will send the 'old' models the way of the classic UI.  <br />
<br />
They will make the case that it is too time intensive to make double the number of models for each mob/player in the game.<br />
<br />
  Sorta like they did with the Vah Shir when SoL came out - it was several weeks before the low-res version was deployed.  And apparently froglocks only have the newer, high-res models in LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bristol has a good point, can't trust SOE, one of the reasons I haven't bought one.<br />
<br />
But at least you can get some of your money back on the horse bridle, about 2/3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">there is no reason to believe that horses won't be suddenly and unexplainably nerfed.   As far as I am concerned, anything is fair game, nothing is safe from the nerfbat.<br />
<br />
As Nytmare points out, at least with horses you can get some money back.   The benefits of a horse are very worth the cost, until the time when those benefits are changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hope thay fix the bugs or at least have the horse effect behave in the same maner with both the same positive and negative consequenses reguardless of how you set your controlls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Upcoming Nerfage:<br />
<br />
1. Getting benefits from horses with model off. Can't have people moving fast on the damn things, can we? So what if Luclin models are ugly as sin and cut performance by half.<br />
<br />
2. Quick Buff affecting Heals over Time. Can't have a usefull AA skill like that. Just ain't right.<br />
<br />
3. Shaman dogs dual wielding with weapons. You know it ain't supposed to be that way, dontcha???<br />
<br />
4. Express experience from PoP zones. It's just a matter of time!!!<br />
<br />
5. Whatever we damn well feel like...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">6. SCRM affecting heals-over-time.<br />
<br />
7. Buffing lowbies with level 51+ buffs by grouping with them or using MGB.<br />

8. Focus stacking over STR.<br />
<br />
9. Dropping items on the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Under the circumstances of the disapproval of my opinions of last week....theres no chance Im going to state my opinion on whether they should or shouldn't be changed haha ;) ...but just FYI, BristolMT, Id save your money as you seem to want the horses to be able to be used without horse models on. I can tell you that as of tonight ( I haven't logged on in a few days) horses require you to have horse models and your race models on. You get a message telling you this if you try to cast it other wise.</div></div><hr />

Where's my prize!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats wierd Evel, I can still click my horse fine, have you got *Any* of new models turned on?  You can't have your race off, but others on and use a horse, you have to have the entire lot turned off, every single one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my horse still works fine with all models of as well.<br />

gonna have to keep waiting for your prize Darjeeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd just rather be shrunk than look at those ugly old models.<br />
<br />
Evel, this case is much different from the affliction foci.  Turning off all the new models and summoning a horse when you can't use a horse is a deliberate attempt to get around the rules.  Putting on a Coldain Military Bracer and seeing that it works on slows is an observation people make from experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like the old models because they look better and run faster.<br />
All the new models do is descrease fps and increase the boobage factor for all models male and female to an extreme level</div></div><hr />

OH NOS!  Somebody who plays EQ on a p2 with 128 megs of RAM bought a horse!  They are obviously exploiters! We must ban them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Honestly, I really can't stand the 'new' (SoL release) models appearance.  I tried Anarchy Online, but couldn't get past their goofy looking models.  Am I superficial ? yeah, probably, but the old models are part of the EQ's allure for me.  Here's hoping they never remove the original models.</div></div><hr />

No one's saying you shouldn't be able to turn those models off to increase performance. You just have to deal with the run delay and slower speed that you have to take when the models are on.<br />

Theres 2 sides to the coin, remember many people opt for chain horses or land an ornate chain one.  Again, no movement speed boost for them.<br />
<br />
For a shaman its not a big deal, if we are in a zone that allows sow, we have sow via an easy to obtain insta click.  For a class that hasnt got self sow, horse movement is often a good thing.  So it kind of balances itself out.<br />
<br />
Personally my pc is more than capable of running EQ with all luclin models on, but ugh, *** were they thinking when they remodeled my lizard =(  If they redid the model and animations to actually be nice, then sure, I'd use them.  As they are, no thanks.</div></div><hr />

SHUT UP BEFORE I LOSE MY HORSELESS STANDING MED. Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">a bit OT, but I'd just like my horse (the cheapo one) to be like sow speed..as it is, he's slower then UNSOWED run speed.<br />
sure it might be the gimp horse, but it's still a HORSE. and the average shmo is faster? Bah.<br />
<br />
Just a little thing though, I'd rather see bigger issues addressed, I love my horse anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I tried horse (with models) and I watched both my HP and Mana go up a significant amout every 6 seconds for 3 ticks... <br />
<br />
Turned off models, stood up with horse buff on (and double checked) every 6 seconds only HP went up, I was surprised, and watched for 5 for ticks just to be sure...<br />
<br />
All models were turned off, ALL of em =p.<br />
<br />
/cry... I want my standing med...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Mana goes up, just the display doesn't update properly when using old character models. Your mana display will update itself once you cast a spell. This is one of the reasons we worry that horse med with no horse model is an unintended benefit (&quot;exploit&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ahh... okay, I r teh STOOPID<br />

And fungis are no drop on test :p Uh huh. Sure. Everyone knows for a fact that they don't test things like this on test they push them straight to live so people don't have time to bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">darkpaw,<br />
are you saying that I dont have a character on test w/horse that I tried to summon just alittle while ago to confirm this? Trust me it IS changed on trest....log in and ask someone with a horse...and no, Fungis are not no-drop on test( I got the attempt on humor btw ;) )<br />
<br />
and Darjeeling,<br />
No...not a Sony rep or related to them in any way...but I do appreciate the virtual world they created...I guess I am guilty for cutting them a little slack( see the quote Ive used on this...&quot;Did you ever write what you call wrong?&quot;)......can you imagine the evil empire known as SOE creating a world they hope everyone enjoys??? inconceivable....<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that the devs and their bosses sit around the sacrificial alter at night devising new ways in which to make the shaman suffer....I mean...dont they?<br />
<br />
My post was for BristolMT, trying to save him some time...while I cant say this change will go live..it IS on test at the moment....check it out yourself :)<br />
<br />
Edit for darkpaw: as proven on this board as of late -everyone- has time to bitch haha you cant please all of the people all of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Used to be an article floating around by an ex-MuD developer explaining how the people that create, own, or run a MuD turned into nerfers. Was very insightful.<br />
<br />
Personally, i don't get mad at nerfs, i get annoyed by very stupid decisions that waste hours and hours of my and a lot of other people's time. Something SoE has proved time and time again they excel at. But, sure, keep cutting them slack, game's only been out four years or so, right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BristolMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I appreciate the overall discussion and the heads up Evel.  Even the cheap horse would be an exceedingly large investment for me, and I'd prefer to being buying a known commodity.</div></div><hr />
