<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beolvaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please explain to me just how a ranger can out nuke a shaman.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Burn (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=4897) 770 hp damage, 3.5 second cast and 30 second recast. Gives roughly 770 hp per 35 seconds.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3390) 925 damage, 7.8 cast and 2 second recast. Gives around 925 hp per 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Seems to me, that from this data, a shaman will out nuke a ranger by a factor of 3-4 times the damage. Can someone please explain this before we complain too hard to Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, that particular spell isnt in game yet, its a GoD spell iirc; but here is some stats for ya:<br />
1). Brushfire (level 64 Ranger) does 612 for 220 mana with a 30 sec recast.<br />
2). Frozen Wind (level 63 Ranger) does 700 for 300 mana with a 30 sec recast.<br />
3). Calefaction (level 59 Ranger) does 450 for 250 mana with a 45 sec recast.<br />
<br />
I dont think so much that its a per spell outdamage race, but at most a shaman will have 1 or 2 nukes up (personally I rarely have them up and if I do its usually Tears), where a ranger will likely have all 3 up plus a proc buff. Its the fact of sheer unloading power; each of those spells has a 2.5 or so cast time, not factoring in the innate spell haste that a hybrid gets with offensive spells; so while we have done 925 points of damage with our one spell, they have likely nuked with 2-3 of the above, resulting in more DPS &quot;burst&quot; damage; granted per nuke we do more damage, but in the long run (assuming mana isnt a problem) a ranger will indeed outdamage us with nuke damage.</div></div><hr />

You are missing 2 spells that a ranger has:<br />
<br />
Brushfire (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3431) <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Frozen Wind<br />
 (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3418) <br />
<br />
Do the math and when you add in these nukes, rangers are extremely close, if not better, than us at nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone thought of manna pool for that ranger? It cant compare with that of a shammy. My main is a paladin, and I have a good manna pool for someone my level and class. I would be OOM very quickly after trying to outnuke a shaman, and my mana regen rate is nothing like that of a shammy. <br />
<br />
I would assume that the ranger would long run out of manna before it really became an issue of out nuking the shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Einnod, what Beolvaar is looking at is the recast time.  To out nuke us the ranger would need to load 4 of these types of DD.  Then they could chain in sequence.  He has done the math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tarthug:<br />
The point being that a ranger can outnuke a shaman if he really wanted to<br />
<br />
And in response to mana pools.. a good lvl 65 ranger can easily have a 5k mana pool, whereas a 65 shaman with the same gear would only have about 1k more mana than the ranger has. Try searching for a ranger and shaman profile on magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Einnod, there is no way.  They don't have 4 nukes with enough damage to out nuke us.  The best I figure is:<br />
Sylvan Burn, Brushfire, Frozen Wind, Calefaction could come close ... for the first 45 seconds or so.  Calefaction has a 45 second recast while the others are all 30 seconds.  You can't load the spell twice, and you can't cast it when the gem is down, so unless I'm missing something, no way a ranger is going to outnuke a shaman, even if they tried.  Besides, trying to out nuke a shaman is going to cut down the ranger's DPS.<br />
<br />
Another thing I don't get is why we're using VS here.  Over time, assuming the nuking test lasts over a minute or so, SoT is a better nuke due to the faster cast and if we were really swinging for the fence (no worrying about breaking any mezz with AE), we'd mix VS and ToS.  The ranger couldn't touch that kind of damage.<br />
<br />
EDIT: &quot;The ranger couldn't touch that kind of damage ... with a nuke.&quot;  clearly, their bow and melee would still own our nuke damage</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Although I use ToS more than any other I personally dont class it as a nuke because it cant be affected by ID4 so that to mean means that Sony dont class it as such either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Comparing a paladin to a ranger for nuking?  *guffaw*  No, a paladin can't outnuke a wet sponge, much less even a gimpy nuker like a shaman.<br />
<br />
At best, shaman nukes are on par with HYBRIDS.  SK's can actually outnuke us and have just about the same mana efficiency as a shaman - AND, they've got resist modifiers; -50 for scythe of innoruuk (880 dmg).  Spear of Decay is another 600, so that's 1480 dmg every 45 seconds and 555 mana.<br />
<br />
I suppose the theory is that a shaman could nuke 4 times in that 45 seconds... except that no mob lasts 45 seconds - unless it's a boss, in which case we might as well dot.  So in an ideal high-mana situation, the SK pumps out 1480 dmg in the time we've stood there doing about nothing for the better part of 10 seconds, to get off our sub 1k nuke.<br />
<br />
Yes, hybrids are MUCH more suited for this age in EQ of quick DPS and high mana regen for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a ranger as a duo to my shaman.  His gear is mostly ornate, i dont know what his mana pool is but his wis is around 260 or so unbuffed (go LDoN augs).  Anyway, with a couple FT and mana pres 4, I dont see him going out of mana in the span of 5 min it takes to drop a boss.  Archery is useless in alot of raid encounters, though my view is restricted to time.  So its nuke or melee, and as a ranger the nuking part is way safer :P  Not like they got anything else to spend thier mana on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't forget that the hybrid spells all innately cast faster. As for mana pools, given the same wisdom/mana items, the mana pools will be the same. The extra &quot;penalty&quot; hybrids once paid for spell casting was removed. Long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The 4 posts above just summarized what I would have said in response to your last post, Tar.<br />
<br />
Fights never last long enough for us to do more damage than a hybrid would do on nukes, and our time would be much better spent doing something else(at least in my opinion)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well this is obviously an over simplification but<br />
<br />
Frozen Wind 700hp/3.5seconds + Brushfire 610hp/3.5 seconds = 1310hp/7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike = 925hp/7.8 seconds.<br />
<br />
So at least in short bursts rangers do out nuke shaman.  While I do not think that this is a sign that hybrid’s dd needs to be nerfed, it is an indication of how poorly shaman dd is.  Yes a Ranger would have to chain dd spells because of long recast times, and as Tarthug pointed out, even if a ranger did this, it would most likely be a decrees in his dps, compared to output with his bow and melee.  The point is not that ranger’s spells are over powered, but that shaman’s dd is underpowered, and seriously cannot keep up with dps of a hybrid.<br />
<br />
As Gabus noted “I would be OOM very quickly after trying to outnuke a shaman, and my mana regen rate is nothing like that of a shammy.” <br />
<br />
This is true, but only to a point.  With canni shaman can make manna through canni/healing.  But of course canni is not passive.  The complaint that some shaman have is that our dps is pathetic because things die too quickly for dots to run their course, and our dd spells are very inefficient compared to other casters.  I cannot have a good dps if I’m canning (0 damange = 0 dps) but all my spells are very manna and time inefficient compared to other casters, on the basis that I could canni.  My knuckles ache from canni iv, but because of the inefficiencies in shaman spells, I’m always canniing.<br />
<br />
 Before the other hybrid classes start to worry that shaman are calling for a nerf to your nukes, don’t panic, we’re not.  What I think some of us shaman are complaining about is that the traditional way that shaman do dps (dots) has been eclipsed due to the fast pace of the game, and our dd and heal spells are, well, gimps.  <br />
<br />
Just speaking for myself, I think shaman absolutely need either a better canni, better heals, or better dd.  Two out of the three would not be over powering, but one of those three need to be done to keep shaman a viable class for groups.  As it is I’m amazed that any Ldon group would get a shaman over a BL, since our dps is so horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No ranger high enough to have Frozen Wind/Brushfire will be casting Calefaction unless a mob is super-melee resistant (Seru, maybe) or they don't want to get into melee range.  Besides the relatively low dps compared to high-level melee, its base cast time of 2.5 seconds makes it ineligible for hybrid innate spell haste.  It's just not worth it at that level.<br />
<br />
So, over 30 seconds you've got about 3 casts of Velium Strike (base 2775 dmg), and one cast each of the three ranger spells (including Sylvan Burn, for a base 2082); the shaman wins--except that the ranger nuke damage is all front-loaded, so it leaves ~24 seconds that the ranger is freed up for melee/archery while the shaman is stuck casting.  Depending on whose numbers you take for ranger melee output, that could be around 4k additional damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So, over 30 seconds you've got about 3 casts of Velium Strike (base 2775 dmg), and one cast each of the three ranger spells (including Sylvan Burn, for a base 2082) <br />
<br />
With spell recast you can not get 3 casts of Velium strike in 30secs. Unless you want to start assuming focus etc...we are just talking base spells without mods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem I have here is there is no specified period of time that the test is suppossed to occur over and if the test lasts 30 seconds the shaman wins hands down (say on a raid, a vast majority of raid targets will live long enough for shaman to outnuke rangers).  In an LDoN normal dungeon, sure that ranger CAN own the shaman, but it's situational.  The argument that we should be doing something else for greater effectiveness, well, so should the ranger.  With shorter cast times, the ranger will win a burst test of 15-20 seconds, which is realistic in exp PoP and normal LDoN advents, but it's not like they own us whenever they want, and they have to load 3 gems for that where as we're doing 1, maybe 2.  The ToS and VS combo will beat the ranger regardless over 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">K let's forget using ToS for one second because in LDoN it's too dangerous for me to even mem it and I am out of spell slots as it is.<br />

How's this for a run down:<br />
Sylvan Burn 770 hp damage, 3.5 second cast and 30 second recast<br />
Frozen Wind (level 63 Ranger) does 700 for 300 mana with a 3.5 cast &amp; 30 sec recast.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.5 seconds First spell lands= 770 damage to the mob<br />
5.5 refresh and start next spell had 2 seconds to melee and deal 200 damage (any ranger is around the 100dps mark now days)<br />
9 seconds Second spell lands=  1470spell damage +melee damage (They are a hybrid) =1670 Damage in 9 seconds= 185dps.<br />
<br />
Shaman... <br />
7 seconds we have done 925 damage (add in two seconds of melee to make it fair=15dps if i'm lucky)<br />
9 seconds total damage= 950 damage= 105 dps<br />
<br />
I never get a chance to land a second nuke on 90% of the mobs we fight :/</div></div><hr />

It's not 3.5 seconds; hybrid innate detrimental spell haste pushes it down to somewhere under 2 seconds at 65.  Figuring in lag and operator error, I'll just go with 2.<br />
<br />
So, at 2 seconds they hit 770 damage.<br />
<br />
Melee output depends on whose numbers you want to use; I used the 170ish high-end hasted ranger damage posted from over on the Glade.  There's some argument over who's got the right numbers.  2 seconds of melee, so at 4 seconds they've done ~1110 damage<br />
<br />
6 seconds and end of second spell, 1810 damage<br />
<br />
8 seconds and start of third spell, 2150<br />
<br />
10 seconds and end of third spell, approximate max of 2762 damage.  Shaman's finished one Velium strike, 925 damage.  <br />
<br />
Ranger can't nuke again for about another 20 seconds, so add 3400 damage melee.  Just under 6200 damage, or a bit over 200 dps.  Ranger parses suggest 190ish would be more accurate. *EDIT* Forgot that I'm including the GoD nuke which is not included in current parses; that's what's pushing the number over 200.<br />
<br />
Shaman nukes certainly won't be filling that 5275 damage gap in that time as they currently stand...<br />
<br />
Edit: If the ranger really wanted to do *nothing* but nuke for that 30-ish seconds, they could toss in a Calefaction, Icewind, and a Firestrike or two depending on time for another 1112-1414 DD damage in place of their melee.  Total of around 3194-3496 nuke damage in the time of 3 Velium Strikes.  That's about 25% higher than a shaman using VS alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly, I don't really see the point of this comparison other than another excuse to whine about our percieved lack of abilities.  My first EQ character is a ranger and I can tell you first hand, theres not much they can do besides deal damage.  They don't tank well, they don't buff much besides attack and ac, and they have the healing abilities of a level 54 shaman.  They've evoled into the damage hybrid, and nuke damage is an important piece of their dps capabilities.  If they could heal as well as a shaman I might have a problem, but as it stands, it makes sense that they can out nuke shamans.  If you want big direct damage spells, make a wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as for rangers running out of mana, what else do they spend it on besides self atk buffs, and nukes,  any of they're non self buffs are do long in duration to count, ie sot, pred,  so w/ ft, mc, voq/kei,  very few things i've seen in pop need snare, and that can either be an aa, or a lvl 9 spell</div></div><hr />
