<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xaelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyo,<br />
<br />
Right now I am playing a 28 Druid and about to get some nice spells including Regen, and then found out Shamans get it earlier, so it brought up some pondering. So far playing a Druid has been fun, though sometimes I have a hard time getting in a group, and Shamans look to be a bit more cooler. So I come here.<br />
<br />
Well I was just wondering how Shamans are, compared to Druids. A couple things I was thinking about.<br />
<br />
1. The coolness n fun factor,how are they to play? I love being a wolf but theirs no real usefulness as a druid to it other than looking cool n running fast. Bear form seems better since regen and can stack regen spell n use canni. Plus wolf pet seems sweet.<br />
<br />
2. Soloing n grouping, I've heard they get groups nicely, but how are they for soloing low to high levels. I imagine it might be easier to solo once you get pet, but thats only till 30 or so?<br />
<br />
3. Spells dmg, how does their dmg stack up to druids. I know Druids can nuke with their fire spells n then AoE dmg spells are nice for adds, and DoT's are good too. How does their dmg spells compare like for dmg/mana effictiveness/etc.<br />
<br />
4. Melee n tank ability, can they really dish it out and take it? Not comparing to Warriors, but to Druids. Druids can only wear leather but have nice scimi's, but Shamans can wear plate which is nice.<br />
<br />
5. Pets, I love the wolf pets, how are they? I can only charm pets, and while its okay I hate having the charm wear off and having to keep recasting. So how are the wolf pets compared to mages/necros/beastlords. What do they usually con, how well do they dish/take dmg, etc.<br />
<br />
Shamans seem similar to Druids except Druids get Ports (which I think are now not really needed, since you can just bind at a PoK book), Fire Nukes, Dmg Shields, etc. Shamans get some Druid spells earlier, plus an extra regen/wis buff and a mana spell which when the two are combined seem they can be sweet. Now I know this is a Shaman board so its going to be abit one sided, so anyone thats has perhaps some actual insight on druids from playing them so there can be a realistic comparison. Alright thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Shamans are way cooler, end of story. =p<br />
<br />
2. A shaman can do a decent job of soloing but a druid can solo much faster quad kiting than a shaman can root dotting and sicking the pet on mobs. Shamans have an easier time finding a group if a slower is needed but if a healer is needed a group will go for a druid over a shaman, of course they probably wont pick up either without a cleric. <br />
<br />
3. Druids get much stronger and mana effective nukes and AEs. Shamans get stronger dots and have slow.<br />
<br />
4. A shaman can only wear up to chain, they can't wear plate though some of it does look like plate. Shamans can take hits a lot better than a druid but in the end game neither of them can really take a hit. Shamans will also usually put out more melee damage but thats really only useful in the lower levels.<br />
<br />
5. The shaman pet is pretty weak until the high level ones which can con up to dark blue and rampage, they can't tank anything in PoP really though so they are really only good for another kind of DoT while in exp groups and emergency while your soloing.</div></div><hr />

Druids are Druid , Shaman are shaman , no is better or worse , we have different abilities and traits that we each bring to the table. Easier to get groups ? Hmm not these days with bards bst's and enchanters having a solid slow. Not that im  complaining , just making it clear that groups can and do function quite well without us. With a druid you dont get asked to buff every 10 seconds when there is much more fun things to do ;) Druids have a much better heal and on that merit alone might get a group over a shaman cause you always need a healer.<br />
<br />
if your liking your druid, play it. If you wanna see what a shaman can do , make one.<br />
<br />
Thats about the best advice i can give</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Who is the best ?<br />
Well it's easy to answer...<br />
Druid can be dog<br />
Shaman use dog as pet<br />
<br />
 :D  :D  :D <br />
<br />
(JOKE !!!!!!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shamans can be a bear<br />
Druids get a bear pet<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5. Shaman pets are not damage machines like mage and beastlord pets. I'm pretty sure a 39 beastlord pet could beat the hell out of a 55 shaman pet however the 61 pet with muzzle of mardu and 2 ixi swords is respectable. The basic pet strategy is to slow and root the mob and you sick puppy on it and stand back and dot, reapplying root if it breaks. Works fine on non PoP mobs like the gimps in seb, chardok and PoG but not so great when mobs are hitting for 350+ even when we can slow them by 75%.<br />
<br />
Make a shaman and find out if you like it. Most give up in the early years when buffing is very tedious due to the short duration and lack of group buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">one of my friends had a druid. we would group often until the 30s, and then after I would play his char just for fun.<br />
<br />
they both have their benefits.<br />
<br />
the biggest differences that I found are as shaman we get cannibalize, druids get snare.<br />
<br />
these two spells make the biggest difference in the way these two classes play.<br />
<br />
for soloing, shaman are an in-your-face take the hits and keep on hitting dot/melee kind of class. druids are more run around the zone and hope it doesn't start running fast.<br />
<br />
for groups, shaman are buff, debuff and marginal damage. druids are more damage dealing, healing, and evacing (don't know how much that helps these days).<br />
<br />
of course, I can't offer any help for high levels, as I have been lvl 44 for almost a year and a half, and I quit playing my friends druid when he was 40.<br />
<br />
those are the biggest differences, which is better? I think they are equally good, it depends on how you want to play as to which you will think is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My lvl 61 puppy (60% haste buff, FA, Focus) kicked the snot out of a lvl 58 necro's best pet in a pet duel.  My pet was at 70% when his died . . . didn't mess with his pet at all either.<br />
The puppy does GREAT when in a non planar zone, even something like CT he's way way useful.  Puppy can effectively tank a slowed mob with torpor/Q on and gain hps while doing so.  This makes him a great main or add tank for you.  And with a couple of weapons his dmg is respectable, somewhere around 40 DPS.<br />
<br />
Course that's nothing like what a druid can do with a charmed frog in PoStorms (end game).  Those frogs, druid pet buff hasted to 70%, deal upwards of 600 DPS.  But that's another discussion altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Having played both to 60 I'll say shamans are a much more powerful class.  Shamans can solo higher level monsters, and are much more desireable in groups.  If you find the right spots, a shaman can solo just as fast as a quad-kiting druid.  As far as which is more fun, that's a personal opinion and I can't tell you which you'll enjoy more.  As my first character, taking over 100 days /played to reach 60, I'm very nostalgic about my druid; he was alot of fun :)  Shaman can solo stuff the druid could only dream about though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My lvl 61 puppy (60% haste buff, FA, Focus) kicked the snot out of a lvl 58 necro's best pet in a pet duel.  .<br />
<br />
That's not really a fair comparison. :) Our 61 puppy is 58th lvl and the best a necro can do at 58 is the monk pet is which around 43rd lvl I think.<br />
<br />
Try that against a 61+ necro pet. I've never done it but I have feeling puppy would get owned big time. The LoZ pet hits for 70+ and has a hefty amount of HP. The 62 necro pet buff is 70% haste which is 20% more than the previous buff so that would make a difference too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">4. A shaman can only wear up to chain, they can't wear plate though some of it does look like plate.

<br />
That's not true. If for example Jaundiced bone was chain that just looked like plate, Iksar could wear it, but it's plate, so they can't.<br />
<br />
Shaman's get some plate armor, but most is chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The coolness factor goes to Druids by a *small* margin.  The Teleports and the non-root breaking DoT's give Druids a wider hunting range solo than any other class.  Necros are a bit stronger but they have to deal with pet pathing issues, which can be a major PITA in some zones. Shaman are still cool but I'd give this one to Druids.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shaman contribute different things to groups.  In a group without Enchanter I think a Shaman is a must for the slows.  If you have Enchanter and Cleric then I think a Druid is a slightly better choice because of the Evacs and fast damage capabilities.  In terms of grouping I consider Druids and Shaman to be equally valuable.<br />
<br />
Soloing is very even also.  Druids have an easier time getting around Norrath and setting up and Shaman are probably slightly stronger against the typical mob.  People tend to view Druids as weaker soloists against magic-resistant mobs but realistically Shaman have the same issues against these because of the inability to keep the pet alive without landing a slow.<br />
<br />
Druids do more damage with spells.  Shaman pets make up the difference, at a real cost in mana.  Typical scenario when hunting with pet is to have to slow-cripple-dot-dot along with the pet damage.  This takes just as much mana as the Druid's dot-root-dot-dot.  If a Shaman chooses not to dot and relies solely on pet damage then the sequence is slow-cripple-heal-heal-heal (pet that is) and then stepping in to do a bit of melee damage at the end to avoid the XP reduction code.<br />
<br />
I hunt regularly with two Druids who are a couple of levels north of me and it's not worth bringing out the pet in that scenario (I can avoid slowing with no pet to protect.)  Of course having the Shaman dots break root makes for interesting tactics.  I tend to double dot pull and then canni after they've rooted the target and dotted it.  When the target is dead I go pull another.<br />
<br />
Ogre Shaman can definitely tank some.  The frontal stun immunity allows for reliable spell casting and once a dark blue mob is slowed and crippled I can usually stand in front of it until it is dead.  As with anything else there are some exceptions to the rule that I definitely cannot tank.  We get chain, not plate, and at 53 I have about 950 AC self-buffed.  I don't know if other Shaman races are comfortable tanking, I would be a lot less comfortable without the frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
Pets are okay damage and can take damage fairly well from a properly debuffed mob.  That said, the Shaman pets are nowhere near as strong as the Necro, Mage and Beastlord pets.  There are a lot of cirumstances, even solo, in which I choose not to summon dogdog because he's not worth the effort.  My pet has conned light blue at every level I've had him at.<br />
<br />
Shaman and Druids are not as similar as you would think.  The main difference is not in the spells as much as the attributes and method of play.  Shaman are high hp low mana and tend to constantly hover at 50-60% of both as they play.  They very rarely actually med, using cannibalism and hp regen as their main source of recovery.  Druids, on the other hand, are more traditional casters with lower hp's and a bigger mana pool.  They tend to blow their mana on a kill or three and then regen more traditionally by medding.  In terms of actual play I find the Shaman to be more like an Enchanter than a Druid, both solo and grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shamans get some Druid spells earlier<br />
<br />
This is not to be mean, but if we get the spells first, shouldn't that say 'Druids get some Shaman spells later'?</div></div><hr />
