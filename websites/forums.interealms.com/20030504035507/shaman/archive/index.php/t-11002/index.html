<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This spell was selling for 100k on Lanys. It is now 50k. IMO not worth it at all.<br />
<br />
For the amount of times that I have actually cast Avatar, it is just not worth it. <br />
<br />
To make up the emerald cost vs the price of this new &quot;componentless&quot; spell is somewhere like 6500 casts of regular Avatar. I don't think so. At 65 almost all the melee I fight with have primal/prismatic weapons anyway...what's the point?<br />
<br />
Oh, I should also add, with reg raid buffs, and their Prixxx weapons, they max stats anyway...so that extra 40 that this Avatar gives...makes no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you have to ask that question then you dont know what this spell means. the 40 extra attack it gives is just that, 40 atk more than they previously had, this spell also has only a 1 min refresh casting time. which means with aa's and buff extension items you can keep it on 10 people if you really want to. primal/prismatic weapons proc counts towards the 250 innate atk cap, any avatar cast by a shaman does not. and 40 atk is nothing to throw away, the rangers over at the glade had done some testing and every 10 atk is ~1% more dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I'm noticing lately is that the tanks are grumbling a lot about PA not proccing when they need it.  I don't think they proc any less than they did before, but now these guys have better weapons and they're getting sick of trading them out to get that proc.<br />
<br />
My policy on FA is that if the MT asks for it, he gets it.  He's the one who decides if it's worth it or not.<br />
<br />
As an aside, it's a hella tradeskill spell ;)<br />
