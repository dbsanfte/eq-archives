CLICK MEEEEEEE (http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/13oct_lunareclipse.htm) <br />
<br />
Can anyone see it? The moon will turn all red and we won't see such an eclipse in North America until 2007 :(<br />
<br />
<br />
No love :(<br />

This link will update automatically with new pics of the moon as it's eclipsing.  Cloudy here to. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The clouds cleared up just in time for me to see it :)  Going back out to take another look!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's really cool is that scientists take measurements while the eclipse is only partial, so they can see the effects of particulate in Earth's atmosphere.  Volcanos going off etc, would make the edge of the shadow blurry and give it a faint yellow color.<br />
<br />
The color you're seeing when the moon is fully in the Earth's shadow is completely due to the effect of the atmosphere bending the light.  If we had no atmosphere, then the light that reached the moon due to gravity etc, wouldn't be enough so you could see the moon at all (if you could see, standing on a planet with no air  :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I taped the entire eclipse tonight and I'm going to make it into a time-lapse shot for a music video.  It should look pretty cool once done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome!  Link to it here when you are done with it, I would like to see something like that! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe I'll try.  I dont think that the quality is going to be that great because the light mist in the air made the light from the moon refract.  It made it look like the sun almost, until it got down to a sliver, or even better when the moon was completley covered.  I could see all the craters and shadows in the orange glow.  It was really neat, too bad you missed it  :(</div></div><hr />
