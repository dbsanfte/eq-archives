The effect is cool tho.  I spend a lotta mana doing speed in some groups.  Being able to idly click my bp for speed whenever I wasn't doing something else would be kinda cool . . . definitely not an item I NEED tho.  <br />
<br />
Pants summoning our 55 pet?   Kinda neat, kinda out of synch tho with the other effects.  You could argue that the pet spell should be obtained by getting the correct parchment, but that argument doesn't hold water when faced with Tranquility and cleric spell haste on other class bps.   I bet the pants got better stats than wolfcallers which is what many upper level shamans STILL wear in the abscence of anything outside of VT that is a true upgrade.  Yep I want some pants.  Sides, I could use my shovel of ponz on our pet and gain mana while I wasn't doing anything else heh.</div></div><hr />

That might not be too bad depending as casting time of the click. Have you ever tried getting a reclaim pet item? ;P. Maybe mages won't be the only class cannipetting. Might be nice to be able to canni without actually losing HP. Also, makes that AA skill suspend pet mildly usefull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">IMHO, Velious quest armor had better effects on them (Riotous Health on BP and Abolish Disease on legs).<br />
<br />
I would've liked to see Focus of Soul on the BP and Endurance of Boar on the legs, something to make buffing a little easier.<br />
<br />
56 pet on the legs? That's almost as bad as the 44th level pet on those Plane of Sky shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">that's great, those pieces needed effects to make them really worthwhile upgrades for many people.  I think SLTW is a good spell.  <br />
<br />
You can say that the effect on our velious quest BPs was boring, but I sure used it a lot.  SLTW is a buff I hate memming, hate casting, hate refreshing.  If I only have to click it, then I am lkely to whine much less and I know you would all be so terrible greatful for the respite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Too bad Vindi BP is still better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Pet summon wouldn't be a TERRIBLE effect... I mean occasionally I'll get an add while soloing and I'm occupied with something else and the pet gets clobbered. it's prety hard to sit and memorize, wait for cooldown, and cast a pet spell while keeping 3 mobs rooted. having it on an item could let you summon the pet up and let it buy you some crowd control time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">summon an unbuffed unhaste, unalphad green pet? ... no thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Too bad Vindi BP is still better.<br />
<br />
That is only dependant on the person.  To me, Vindi isn't better.  If you are maxed stamina and already have very high resists (200+ unbuffed) this offers 85 more mana and yet another spell that I can click instead of having to sit and mem.<br />
<br />
The legs would actually be pretty cool.  And hell this is only Ornate armor,  Elemental armor is much better, you can't very well expect all our best spells (FoSo, Boar, top pet, etc) to be on Ornate, or there wouldn't be much left for the Elemental armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I dont care how you cut it..its still a cop out on Sony's part.  There was as much thought put into this as there was with our 63-64 spells.  I hope those who claim these to be great can see that.<br />
<br />
I dont see it beating the PoM BP much if at all.  Few HP and Mana but the effect is worthless IMO.<br />
<br />
Shamanistic Shenannigan Chestplate: Wt 6.00. +52 AC, +5 Str, +15 Wis, +15 Int, +10 vsMg, +15 vsPos, +15 vsDis, +60 HP, +40 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP   Classes: Sm. Races: Iks Ogr Trl Bar Vhs . Found via this quest<br />
<br />
Quest should yeild an item with a much better effect or 100 mana/hp.  That would seem more in line since PoP loot has 125 mana/HP now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'd actually be willing to bet whoever was designing the effects on the pants didn't read the shaman spell list and probably didn't know we even had a 61 pet. Or maybe they were done by multiple people who didn't communicate. Either way, it makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's say u get to haste 3 melees,that would be 750 mana,taking 30sec to haste them is better than wasting 750mana IMO.<br />
<br />
30 sec isn't very long,compared to memming SLTW,cast it three times,and sit back down to mem the spell you dropped to mem SLTW.Then u got to get the 750 mana back.Sure with Canni V it doesnt take long,but I would prefer to keep that 750 mana for some dmg output or heals if needed.<br />
<br />
Plus I get tired to switch my spells to mem SLTW to haste doggy when soloing.<br />
<br />
The summon pet is crap tho,dunno why most classes get high end stuff and we get a useless  KUNARK pet.<br />

In the time it takes me to sit down, mem haste, cast the spell, unmem it, and wince back the mana, I could have just hasted my entire party with right clicky SLTW.  You guys that this free haste spell for 10 seconds is bad are on crack!</div></div><hr />

I am regenning mana on a horse while speeding my tanks.  Plus because it's free, I can speed anyone anytime I have an extra 10 seconds.  No, I'd take this bp and probably like it.  The 2 regen from vindy bp just wouldn't be worth keeping it around.  I remember when regen was big . . . that was before yard trash hit for 500's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That is of course presuming you havent got an ench/bard in the vicinity.  Clicky sta was far more useful imho, if nothing else  simply because it was always useful no matter what situation you was in (raid/single group/solo etc).  Although it did become a bit obsolete once Talis of the brute got upgraded.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd say clicky talisman of the boar would be FAR preferable, and not unfair to expect either given some of the other clicks, 10th ring peeps always whinge at me when I do a group regen =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">First of all i'd like to thank sony (seriously!) for adding effects to these armors.. w/o the effects they were kinda crappy for the hoops you run through to get to tier 3 type planes and to bother with getting the etheral rings etc.  A right click haste is wonderful, and SLTW at that.  I *hate* being in a group w/o an enchanter.. I *HATE* having to sit, drop a spell, mem haste, cast it on the melee, remem my other spell, someone else asks for haste (20 seconds after i say &quot;anyone else want haste?&quot;) drop the other spell, remem haste, and then remem my original spell.. every 12-16 minutes.  Usually I have 8 of the following useful spells (ok not useful, crucial) memmed:<br />
<br />
Torpor<br />
Kraggs<br />
Cannibalize 4<br />
Turgurs<br />
Malo<br />
Root xxx<br />
a dot or a nuke<br />
Regen xxx<br />
Tnargs mending<br />
Dispell xxx<br />
etc etc etc etc<br />
<br />
Point is I *need* all 8 spell slots, and I hate having to load haste.  I'd rather use the 10 second SLTW (at least its not our Peanut butter and Celery haste)<br />
<br />
The 55 pets pretty dumb.. although much more useful than most other 55 or under spells they could have put on there... but once you use True Spirit.. theres no going back and DarkBlueDogDog is worth the mana to bring out.<br />
<br />
My point is this: Other classes get useful 61+ pop spell upgrades to their class armor... we dont seem to have this.  This reminds me of JB where other classes got spells they'd use fairly often and of the ones we got, 5 of the pieces were super crappy 30's stat buffs you only used when bored or wanna piss off some guy that asks for a buff late in the game.. and a low level druid self only buff which had its uses for adding AC... the bracer was very very nice /shrug I still use it, but its outdated outside of soloing for the most part.  I agree we should have gotten similiar effects to the Tranquility pants or the group replenishment bp.. or our 61 pet.. or necro FD (i'd KILL to have a right click Feign death.. 8) )<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind theyre still tweeking these effects.. similiar to when the original focus effects came in.. I scrambled to get a Frozen Orb (i think it was a frozen orb) because it had Affliction Efficency III on it.. and then that was changed to Mana Peservation II or something a few days later.</div></div><hr />

Shock of the Tainted at 100% damage increase would be 460 dmg for 130 mana in just a hair over 2 seconds (with Affliction Haste IV and BoR).   If I'm not mistaken that would be almost 100 dps wouldn't it?  ~2.1 seconds for cast + 2.5 recast delay = ~4.6 sec per cast.<br />

Rampage tank? For WHAT? You can't impose your pet on the rampage list. Plus, even if you some how could put the pet on rampage (bearing in mind, unless you are soloing, doing so is impossible)  it wouldn't survive more than 2 rounds of rampage from anything that actually rampages.<br />

There is only ONE circumstance where the click on these pants would be useful. That is if you don't HAVE the 61 pet.

Luclin A :yes its very possible. First imagine a fight with a mob who hits for over 4,000+ points per round and if he has rampage that 4k will end up on a guildmate (sometimes its you becuase it was slowed too fast :( ) but if  done right it will end up on a closeby pet.

Instead of imagining just 1 pet, imagine 10 pets all being chain cast by 10 pet casters at once sucking in those extra rampages.<br />

I don't think tranquility on pants is overly powerful.  It's not like you can /tgb a buff from gear on another group, or MGB it.  Basically, it's mana free tranquility for the enchanter's own group, about the same level of helpfulness as group regrowth/blessing of replenishment on druid items.</div></div><hr />

Rampage is rampage.  the rampage tank gets creamed sometimes and not every guild has 70 players to throw at a mob. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Lots of times rampage is proximity based.  Since velious I haven't been able to detect a set pattern in who stays on the rampage list.  Its that way to keep us from trivializing it I suppose.  Pets very often get on the rampage list, especially in pop where it seems more proximity based than anything else that i can tell at this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
But in all actuality, the 55 pet has what about 1000 hitpoints?  That's one round of rampage we're talking about.  I would be better off in most cases casting other spells to up dps, spot heal, debuff whatever, then spend 16 full seconds to alleivate one round of rampage damage on one person, in *most* situations.<br />
<br />
Canni petting is an interesting idea.  There is an item  shamans can quest for that is clickable reclaim energy from inventory.  Other than canni 5 useable every 3 minutes, I can't canni fast enough to regain 325 mana every 16 seconds.  And this is at NO health cost to you.  You can only canni twice in 16 seconds for 164 mana.  You an canni 3 times in 16.5 seconds for 246 mana.  Still a better time/mana ratio and you're not losing 450ish hitpoints to do it.<br />
<br />
Even though I see its usefulness I'd still most likely use the 61 pet most often for grouping and soloing.  Clerics didn't get a pop spell on their pants either, they got a free 8dps hammer pet that dies at the end of the fight.  <br />
<br />
Also if your guild can get the pants, they most likely have gotten some runes and your guild has c5, so c4 isn't going to be used that often either.  Nice for recovering from wipes I guess, but that's about it, everyones going to want the c5 that's available instead.  Our gimp pet has more uses than that.</div></div><hr />

Thats  still one round of XXXXX melee diverted from  a player. and since this is a clicky can just recast another every 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes it would be to the advantage to do this, sometimes not.  I'm not discounting the arguement that's its useful to do, just not in every rampage situation.  You could argue the fact that by adding dps to the fight you could be helping stop mulitple rampages by simply shortening the length of the fight.  However on some mobs, the rampage damage is so high that your support melee would likely not last a single rampage round.  (ie bertoxxulus hi quad 2k with almost perma rampage)  And your pet would allow the melee to stay in the fight thereby adding to the dps of the encounter by keeping one of your damage dealers in the fight.  Then again on that particular fight my abolish diesease is also pretty crucial.  The dragon in HOH would be the perfect  example, he's an assbeater on rampage and chain petting for rampage eating would be a great addition.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it has its uses, but the 61 pet would be a hell of a lot more useful, and not really too much to ask considering the other class leg clicks that are floating about.  Personally I'd way prefer something a little more useful and less situational though.</div></div><hr />

Our business is casting spells.  Our primary consideration, therefore, is mana.  On this basis, the Scaled Avatar is the best of this particular bunch and the Vindi BP is an embarrassing fourth place.  Vindi was a really good BP two expansions ago.  It is not a good bp now, except as resist gear :P<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.. don't get hung up on the stupid effect.  It's not the prime consideration here.<br />

AURA OF BATTLE AND FT<br />
Aura of Battle is a 2hp/tick regen.  This is roughly equivalent to FT1, but you have to cann for it.  1 mana per tick, or 10 mana per minute.  Add this to the Vindi stats.  Add 5 mana per tick (or 50mana per minute) to the AB Tunic.<br />

Which is best is still a matter of opinion. I'd still keep my vindi bp over any of the other bps you listed there. My mana pool is big enough already and with SCM, cann v and an affliction efficiency 3 item I have found it nearly impossible to run out of mana even as a single shaman debuffing multiple mob pulls in VT or PoP zones. As such I'll take the hps, resists and effects on the vindi over the man from other options.<br />
<br />
The clicky on scaled avatar can definitely be useful and it is a nice bp. If i didn't have a good bp I would be looking for a SA as one of my options.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to compair high end bps you could have also thrown in the cursed bp http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=30564 and the warmasters bp http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=7386.<br />
<br />
Unless something clearly beats another item in every possible way then it's hard to say x is better than y. As far as bps goes those are all nice options. My personal preference is still the vindi bp and the only bp I would say is clearly superior is the mail of judgment.</div></div><hr />
