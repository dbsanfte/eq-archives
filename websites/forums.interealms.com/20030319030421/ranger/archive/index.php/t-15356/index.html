<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Demi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok<br />
<br />
I'm 51, done a handful of raids, and starting to group mostly now for exp. I have a Lammy in mainhand, and 20dmg/32 dly scimmy something if offhand..(bad of me not to know the name of it I know)...<br />
<br />
What I've noticed mostly for me, is alot of the time when I get agro, it's when I'm too close to the mob. (This sometimes happens when I'm moving around to stay on the mob's back). When I do happen to get hit from pulling agro, i just jolt.<br />
<br />
On raids, I've only died from Spells. In most cases it's the AE's..(resistances sux and 51 doesn't help). I've done Vindi, and didn't pull agro, just kept max distance.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering about Rampage and Enrage, those things. How does this actually work? Is it a 'hate list' so on such mobs like Vindi, the closer you are to him the higher the chance for you to get hit with Rampage? Is it based off DPS? Course, it's probally both, I'd just like some tips on how it's all calculated.<br />
<br />
I dunno if it's just been dumb luck, or just common sense for me. I haven't died much at all. Granted, I soloed quite a bit til I got mid 40's, but I also played a Shaman to 55. So i did have some kind of idea how the game works.<br />
<br />
My guild's already noticed, how i don't die like some of the others. I don't know if this is because my DPS isn't there for one, or i'm just being smart and trying to stay alive through out the fight. My thought is it's better for me to last til the end, rather than get as much DPS i can and die.<br />
<br />
Any comments on how rampage works, agro, etc.. i'd apprieate it greatly. I like to keep my good span of not getting killed on raids going. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enrage usually kicks in at about 5-15% of the mobs life.  Any hit you do from the front is automatically ripsosted and you get eaten alive.  Be wary of it, turn off attack or move behind or to the side.  It affects everyone and is a fast way to lose the melee in your raid.<br />
<br />
Rampage is a bit harder to explain.  It is affected by the 'hate' list, which you can manipulate to your raids advantage by having certain people attack first, use max melee range to reduce each persons agro.  A simple way to stay off the list is let the main tank and rampage tanks attack for 20s before anyone else engages.  You can often move non-melee out of rampage range.   If the mob is rooted (ssra uses this a lot) have rampage people plink arrows and stuff before the main fight to control agro.  Lastly, make sure people have hotkeys up to say they're on rampage, they'll be needing some healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enrage is exactly at 10% of a mob's life.  I watch for this when we're raiding so I can warn the guild at 12% to expect enrage soon.  Enrage lasts for 12 seconds and you'll see a message that it's done at the end of 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Ways to do damage while a mob is enraged:<br />
<br />
1) Pretend you're a rogue and get behind the mob if you can.<br />
<br />
2) Cast DDs. <br />
<br />
3) Shoot arrows.  (No, the mob will not riposte arrows.)<br />
<br />
4) Make sure whoever is getting beat on has a damage shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rage doesnt always go off at 10%.  I think Emperor is higher or less?  but most mobs are 10% though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A good MT will make a world of difference w/ enrage.  While melees know to back off when a mob enrages, pets do not.  I've seen more pets die to enrage then anything else.  A good MT can position a mob which enrages so the pets will be attacking the backs/sides.</div></div><hr />
