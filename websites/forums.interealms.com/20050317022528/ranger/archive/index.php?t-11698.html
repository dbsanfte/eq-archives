<br />
Why:<br />
<br />
   Killing Paineel Guards is extremely easy.  They hit for a max of 40 or so, and they have very few HP's.  They drop a kite shield and a bronze bastard sword which sell for about 8pp, and some  guards have a plat or two on their corpses already.  To sweeten the deal, there's no faction hit for killing the guards, so you can kill them all day long and remain amiable to all of Paineel.  Nothing will aggro you as you go through the cycle.<br />
<br />
Best Levels:<br />
<br />
   For this to be effective for Rangers I'd estimate you need to be at least 42 or 43, with decent equipment.  I was able to make a good profit at 43 without any haste items.  At 46 it was a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Getting into Paineel:<br />
<br />
   To get into Paineel, you need a key, or someone to open the elevator for you.   To get the key you need to be at least amiable to the guards in the newbie area.  The best way to gain faction is to kill Kobolds in the Warrens.  Starting at KOS, and having killed a bunch of heretics in Stonebrunt lowering my faction even more, I was able to get amiable after about 5 hours in the Warrens.<br />
   This 5 hours is not a complete waste, however, as the kobolds drop bronze weapons and a lot of alcohol.  I was able to considerably raise my alcohol tolerance by drinking the dropped ale.  Also, a drunken wood elf stumbling around killing kobolds can't be beat from a roleplaying aspect, if you're into that sort of thing.<br />
   When you finally get to amiable, say to the guard in the Newbie yard &quot;I need a key.&quot;  and he'll give you the key.  The newbie yard is also the best place in the game to collect batwings, if you need them for levitation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cycle:<br />
<br />
   There are 11 guards that are in the first two areas of the city that make up this cycle.  There are two immediately off of the elevator, to your right and left.  There is one by the Soulbinder.  Out of the doors, there are two standing next to the gate to the right.  Through the gate, there are two more straight ahead, and another, Guard Pendleir, behind the door to the building.<br />
<br />
Of those eight guards, the guard by the Soulbinder and Guard Pendleir are more difficult.  At 43 they'd take me down about a bubble of health before they died.  The rest are very easy and probably won't hit you much, if at all.<br />
<br />
Through the first portal and down the hallway there are three more.  Guard Yerlash to the left, Guard Polzdurn to the right, and Guard Buldoral that wanders around.  You'll also notice there are more guards in front of the Necro guild.  Don't try to pull these - you'll pull some other things too that hit hard and will chase you until you zone.<br />
<br />
These three guards are about as difficult as Guard Pendleir, so you might want to leave them out if you're just starting out at a low level.  Initially, I'd kill them all except Guard Pendleir so that I'd have time to med and heal by the time they all spawned again.  At 46, I could kill them all with time to spare.<br />
<br />
You can kill a few guards in the castle, but you run the risk of the Guard Captain aggroing you, and the guards there are a bit tougher and will slow you down.  Might as well just kill the easy guards that have already re-spawned.<br />
<br />
The guards up near the Soulbinder and elevator spawn about half as fast as the rest, so just use tracking and go up there whenever you recognize their names are up.<br />
<br />
One of my little time saving tricks when I'm selling the loot back to the merchant is to sit down and sell so that I don't lose that time to meditate.  It's only 30 seconds or so, but every little bit helps.  Also, the merchants inside the stores pay more than the merchant guy standing outside the bank, so don't sell to him.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line:<br />
<br />
I haven't kept track of how much I've made per hour, etc.  because usually I'm doing other things around the house when I do this, but I'd estimate about 300pp-400pp an hour.   I haven't found a more reliable, safe, and easy method of plat farming yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paineel guards don't drop anything on Seventh Hammer during the hours of 8-11AM EST, when I normally play, so don't even try to go there and farm them.</div></div><hr />
