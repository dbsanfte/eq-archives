I am absolutley positively ****ing furious about the raid functionality not going live for everyone, not just those people who bought PoP. <br />
<br />
I didn't plan on buying the next expansion for another month, but my guild is going to have it, and they are going to want to use the function. DAMMIT!!!!! Now I have to buy it if I want to raid with my friends, or I have to stick to grouping for the next month. <br />
