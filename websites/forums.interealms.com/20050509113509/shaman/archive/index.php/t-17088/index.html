<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medatron_Stromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First I would like to say that I just spent 45 minutes reading posts and searching.  I found nothing about this topic and grew tired of the one-liner &quot;Search=your friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I know this is not a very optimum setup, but I have my heart set on a Shaman and my girlfriend loves her Druid.  I am just wanting some strategy advice from anyone willing to share it.  I realize many of you do not play Druids, but I doubt you are as ignorant of the Druid's abilities as I.<br />
<br />
I was hoping with Druid snare/root and Shaman root, we would be able to keep the mobs off of us.  I figure we could both slap as many dots on the mob as we can and let dogdog tank with a damage shield on him.<br />
<br />
Aside from the enormous amount of overlapping spells, do you think this is a viable option.  We find pickup groups alot so we haven't really been able to duo much. (maybe a good thing)<br />
<br />
Again, thanks in advance for any positive feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hint:<br />
<br />
druid charm + decorus boars in tactics + shaman resist debuffs + shaman slow + both healers = win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, you are in luck! Druids are so much fun to duo with!  Particularly when they get snare!<br />
<br />
Basically, you can have them charm an animal and then make it tank and do dps, while you dot the crap out of it.  Or you could dot while she kites.  Of course, if it peels off of her, then you'll be doing the kiting, but who cares as long as it's snared?<br />
<br />
In low levels, it's basically a melee fest anyway (til teens, early twenties).<br />
<br />
To this day I still duo with druids, either with thier charm pet or just dots while they agro kite.  We're a great compliment to each other, because you can slow stuff in a godly fashion, thus keeping you both from death more often than not.  You can also heal each other!  <br />
<br />
this is a win win situation!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">unless your dead set on a shaman, i might suggest a beastlord, they're pet can tank much more efficently than ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A druid and a shaman box very well together.  The effectiveness of the combination, however, is only as good as the AA's, gear and skill levels of the individual characters.  The advantage of the combination is that the Shaman can almost always retain aggro and keep mobs off the druid using his debuffs and poison dots.  This is key because druids have less ac and hps because they are a leather class while shaman are a chain class.  In addition, shaman tend to gear up with better ac and hps, while druids focus on mana pool size.  If you use shaman debuff/dots properly, druid can always land snare and a few DD spells without gaining aggro.  In addition, druids get AE Snare and AE Root, which can be very helpful in CC but becareful because these draw major aggro.  AE slowing first can aleviate some of this.  Ideally, you as the shaman can tank the pull, let dogdog tank your first add and let the druid root the rest.  Be sure to slow all adds, tho, cuz if they come lose and hit the druid, your healer just died.  Druids get natures recovery at lvl 62 i think, which is an awesome regen spell that stacks with Replenishment.  Those two alone will really help you tank and canni while fighting.  And both stack with Quiescence.  Again, strategy depends on your level, spells, AA's, and skill levels.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure about shaman/druid before Dire Charm, but my 65 druid friend and I can duo any place he can find a viable DC target.  He DCs a pet, he pulls with harmony, I malo(sinia), and slow mobs, and he snares the mob.  At this point we have a couple of options.<br />
<br />
- He DoTs the crap out of it (and I do the same) to get it's attention, then we take turns kiting it around while the other nukes/DoTs it... the whole while my pet and his DC pet are chewing on the mob from behind.  Kinda mana-intensive since we're always moving and spending mana.  But it works.<br />
<br />
- His DC pet tanks after I slow and cripple the mob.  If the mob is rootable, we root the mob to keep it from chasing after us, and our two pets go to town on it.  We heal the pets as needed, and we can sit in one spot not having to do much.  This method is less mana-intensive but kills slower since we're not goin' nuts with nukes and DoTs.  DC pet can tank quite well against PoP mobs.  If the mob summons we can get by with this method by just cleric'ing the pets.  Takes awhile, but the mobs ends up dead.<br />
<br />
We've duo'd in HoH and PoD and I think we did it in PoV too... it's kinda cool to take down mobs with 2 people that normally require whole groups, but it can be dangerous.<br />
<br />
So it's situational, but very doable for a druid/shaman duo to succeed in the high-end game.  Like I said, I never duo'd with him until he got DC, so I'm really not sure how it'd be before that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">let the druid die then solo.<br />
<br />
thats my way anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My main second box char is a 65 druid.  <br />
<br />
depending on what level you and your druid are will influence what you do, quite a bit.  A little more information about your specific situation would be helpful.<br />
<br />
At 65, theres 3 basic modes I use.  I do not solo much so mostly I do this for farming, but also when I feel like the druid needs some AA.  I do not play him in exp/ldon groups unless there is no one else to take his place.  Anyways, the 3 main roles I use are as charmer, support, root dot partner.  I can't say I am an expert 2 boxer or an expert on the druid class, so your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Charming - Druids can charm animal NPCs that are up to level 60.  This is the most intense and engaging of all the things I use my druid to do.  It is somewhat high risk but fun watching the pet tear through mob after mob and running for dear life when you have 2 mobs in camp and a broken charm pet with all the mage toys, 80% haste and FA.  After the exp nerf it's not as grossly overpowered as it was, but still pretty fun.  When I am seriously charming, I often relegate Henora to the second machine (!).  <br />
<br />
The 2 spells you will be using will be -<br />
Command of Tunare (druid level 63) charms mobs up to level 60.<br />
Call of Karana (druid level 52) charms mobs up to level 53(i think).<br />
<br />
My location of choice is tactics, but you can also do this in the plane of storms and other zones like western wastes, sirens grotto and chardok.  I know western wastes and chardok you can use your lower level charm spell there, I dont know if this is the case in SG anymore after revamp.<br />
<br />
Pull pet and debuff it with snare, malosinia, glamour of tunare.  Snared pets give you a chance to run away when charm breaks.  Always always make sure your pet is snared.  Charm mob and buff it with focus, p9, FA, Savage Spirit and a damage shield.<br />
<br />
I pull with my shaman, unless outdoors and need harmony, in which case I pull with my druid.  I slow the mob and the pet will immediately take agro.  Snare and root the mob with your druid.  If the mob you are fighting is rooted then you only have one mob chasing you while you are trying to re-charm your pet if it breaks.  Unless that mob summons...there is a lot of stuff out there that doesn't summon so choose your targets wisely for best efficiency.  Make sure to do some damage on both chars to get more exp.  Mana-free items like epics are nice for this!  <br />
<br />
When the pet is damaged, I generally just make the druid heal the pet with Karana's renewal.  Since charm pets have massive hitpoints (frogs in the plane of storms have like 18,000 I think) the druid heal is actually efficient here (it's 4680hp heal without Healing Adept AA). <br />
<br />
There are a few items you can get for your druid that will make your life as a charmer a lot easier.   First, the Sand Eroded Shell (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19284).  It has the druid pet haste (70%) and buff, Savage Spirit (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=140&amp;source=Live).  It works from inventory, basically saving 100 mana each cast and a spell slot.   Second, Wanderer's Sylvan Leggings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17241).  Expensive but so worth it, heh.  Leather ornate pants are cheaper than chain (since monks will usually opt for AOW legs) and seem to be more available.  They have the top druid root spell, Savage Roots (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3447&amp;source=Live).  Savage roots is superior to our best root spell Petrifying Earth, in both mana cost (40% of mana cost of Petrifying Earth, 75 vs 180) and in duration (3 minutes vs 4.5 minutes).  Both spells have -30 resist adjust.  So even if he doesn't have ornate pants, your druid should be rooting, not you.   <br />
<br />
Other things helpful for charming are the clicky damage shield gloves for tunare druids from the vindi head quest, epic and velious bracer for mana-free damage and the AA ability exodus.<br />
<br />
Support - Druid heals me if needed, nukes/dots my mob and snares while I tank, evacs in emergencies.  Druidbot in this role can be really helpful for splitting mobs as a shaman.  Pull mob you want with slow, run like hell for your druid.  Druid starts casting evac and you root the mob.  Quickly run back down to your pull area and if you root lasted, it's single.<br />
<br />
Root Dot Partner - Pretty self explanatory, when I have to do this, I just sit the druid on his horse and he will snare and root the mob with his superior root and dot the mob with his low agro dots.  He is pretty low maintenace in this role because his main line of dots(swarm line) have a huge (-100) negative resist adjust, which makes them basically unresistable.  Especially considering I *have* to malos for my poison dots to land heh, so spells land pretty easy, even on red mobs.  Again, use his root, it lasts much longer... if you arent using pox and bane, that is.  Druid dots don't break root like ours do (until ultor and blood) but if they also have Vicid Roots AA that can help with that.. it decreases the likelyhood that a root will break to direct dmg spells.<br />
<br />
Druids are great, very powerful, very versatile.  Good utility, good healing, good damage through dots, nukes, pets and damage shields.  Useful in many roles, they make a great partner for a shaman... and that is just as a bot.   Get a real live druid who can play his class well to group with you and you have one hell of a team.  I learned most of what I know about druids from my friend Q and asked him lots of questions, so blame him for any terrible flaws here.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Three ways to duo with a druid.<br />
<br />
1st is charm.  You didn't mention your level so I'm going to assume you're not both 65.  Thus, charm is really out of the question as an effective means of duoing until she has command of tunare.  If i'm wrong, here's what you do:  You malosinia they mob, she snares it, then charms it.  Malosinia ensures that the charm sticks first try and lasts a long time.  Once you have a mob charmed, you slow another mob and root it then let them duke it out.<br />
<br />
2nd is root/dot.  She snares and roots it, you both dot.  Very simple.<br />
<br />
3rd is snare kiting.  She snares it and you both dot the living jesus out of it.  Your dots will easily hold aggro over anything a druid can do, so just run in circles and canni when you can while she sits and meds while refreshing dots.  If you have pofire access and can get to tables this is easily some of the best exp you can find.  The more nukers and dotters you can find, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Charm pet for tank and keep it alive together while stacking dots.<br />
<br />
On easier mobs you can let dogdog tank and take turns healing/dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Medatron_Stromm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All this information is great!  I failed to mention our levels, so I guess I should do so now.  The druid is currently 26 and I am PLing my Shaman to her level.  I was playing a monk with her, but I disliked him.  We always play together and enjoy grouping when possible.<br />
<br />
If this information helps trigger more tactics for us, great, but I have a much better feeling for our strategies now.  I also don't feel we are a horrid match anymore.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Basically what Henora said, though I don't know I'd recommend charming as a two box right away until you get some experience with it.  It took me a bit to acclimate myself to using CoT as a twobox, but boy does it make things die fast heh :D.<br />
<br />
Another piece of advice, never dot with a fire dot early in the fight, because that one spell will outagro everything you may have done up to that point.<br />
<br />
I generally just tank things and let the drood sit there and dot, and occasionally boom, but I have to second her opinion of ornate leather pants.  That free root absolutely rocks, plus it lasts way longer than my immobilize clicky ring :)<br />
<br />
I know that the dissertions on two-boxing druids may not totally answer your question, but I would probably do similar things duoing with one.</div></div><hr />
