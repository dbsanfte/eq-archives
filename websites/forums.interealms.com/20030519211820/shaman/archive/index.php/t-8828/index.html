Thank you in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Super Healing will not heal the damage of 1 quad hit from any of the yard trash mobs in pon.  I very much doubt you can be an effective healer (i am not either at this point) till you get the complete heal.<br />
<br />
Not sure if rat in poj will work but I really doubt it will be very effective</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No you can't. I try it at 52 troll Shaman, and 59 Monk with epic and fungi spider barely could do it. and Trees Stomp me to the floor. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">try Plane of Justice, the mobs on the upper floors are lower level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even if you could duo in the plane, it woulnd't be effective for you to do so.  If you have to use up more mana to get EXP X than you would in another place and your risk of dying is higher, what have you gained?  PoP is GODLY exp, but the whole place is designed for level 60+.  Yard trash isn't all that great exp at all for 60+ and I'm not sure you'd think that the risk to reward ratio would be all that much better for your level.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's not well itemized, so you get EXP, but that's it.  Don't expect that a duo like you described is going to see a parchment within 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been duoing a 62 epic mage + 53 shaman when i'm bored in pon - slows still get resisted occasionally after pulling with mala &amp; I have to zone on about 50% pulls where I get 2 mobs.  Unless I have c3 for at least the shaman, the downtime is terrible.<br />
<br />
That combo has no chance of xping in pop imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't say no chance . . . you COULD kite the mob using slow aggro and ranger follows behind hitting the snared mob for dmg while the shaman runs ahead and maintains aggro with dots and slows.  Assuming you pick a non-summoning mob type that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I(54 shaman) was able to partner with a 54 monk in PoI.  Neither of us were equipped with uber items or had our epics.  I did have c3 though, and alpha was in full effect.  He'd pull, I'd malo on the way in, turgurs asap which meant I'd take a few hits but that's fine, I'm a shaman not a druid.  In between shots on me I'd cripple to lower dps of the mob(helps a lot) He'd regain aggro and he and fido would dent the thing while I regained some mana...healing the monk occasionally.  At about half health I'd throw EB to speed things up, generally didn't regain aggro if I waited long enough.<br />
<br />
Now...while we DID do this, and it was fun as HECK...I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for serious xp.  By the time we finished a mob I was at about 30%mana and had to med up for a few minutes until we could go again, so the downtime was painful, even with c3.  I'd say 3 or 4 people of the mid 50s would do fine in the first tier planes.<br />

Just the experiences of a crazy keety.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You could try it, I solo the yard trash there (about 2% a kill @ 53) What I would do is have the ranger pull a *non-summoning* mob to the shammy. Ranger would kite it around a bit until the shaman gets mal*** on it. Root and snare it and have shaman slow (just incase). Plague ebolt and epic if you got it. Just re-apply when needed. ranger could use his DoT (stinging swarm I think, might have better at the level not sure, I know it sucks, but hey it helps right?) and heal shaman from cannies. Its doable no clue how the Xp would be though.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 Cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was wondering when i might be able to 2box here as well.  I 2 box a 62 cleric and a 51 sham.  Right now buffed i have 3200 hp and 990 ac. I can get c3 easy.</div></div><hr />
