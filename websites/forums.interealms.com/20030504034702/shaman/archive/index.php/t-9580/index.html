Level:  58 <br />
Mana:  400 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Type:  Single Target Instant Health Replenishment <br />
Actual Effects: Target: Heal Up to 75% or 1950 <br />
<br />
okay, I am bit confused about this 75% deal.<br />
Is this mean that.. I can only heal for 750hp the melee who has 3K max hp and down to 50% health.. since the cap is 75%?<br />
<br />
Or can I give him 1500hp to fully heal him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The max is 75% of the target's maximum hit points, not hit current ones.....  You till hit that guy for 1950.   This is a CH, so you can't speed the casting through items.  Also, it's very low aggro and not a bad mana ratio</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">by the time you get this the spell becomes a 10 sec 2k heal.  The only time it will heal for less then that is if you are duoing with a caster and even then they will usually have ageo on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just got this spell tonight. Basically from what i've seen If I cast this on a tank at half life it heals him to full. If it hits him at around a bub of life it heals him to about 70%. So does this mean it is 2000 hp heal or 75% doing whichever is greater?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its 2k hps or 75%, whichever is less =P<br />
<br />
IE, if you cast it on a person who has a max of 2000hps, it'll be a 1500 heal on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">so in other word... I no longer need to seek Torpor spell if I have above 2600 max hp(75% will be 2k)<br />
<br />
From the Canni4 148hp/82mana conversion..<br />
we get roughly 1100 mana out of it.<br />
Since it cost 400 mana to cast it.. I get 700mana out of it :)<br />
That ratio is as good as Torpor and I can buy Kragg's Mending spell for 5pp in SH :)<br />
COOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually i would seek out torpor if your guild is capapbe of getting it i never have it unloaded as well as tnargs mending (great spell)  cani 5 and torpor = 1200 mana gain  not bad ratio if your not in a sticky situation hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kragg's sucks hard core compared to torpor for self healing and caster healing.  You still have to use it on those bitchy melees though.  &quot;Waah, I can't move, waaah, I'm only hitting once every 5 seconds!&quot;  Babies.<br />
<br />
<br />
:D :p</div></div><hr />

No it's not as good as torpor. Torpor is 200 mana for 1200hps healed. KM is 400 mana for 1950? hps healed. Would need to be 2400 for the ratio. Not to mention that you can get scrm to push torpor up to 1800 and Mana preservation items will work on torpor but won't work on KM. Also torpor is faster casting and the heals over time factor is nice for canning since you don't need to be down 2k hps when you actually cast it. Can precast it before a cann v or cast it and keep canning so you don't have to be as low to cast it. Km is still nice but torpor is better for using on ourselfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for 35k-45k price tag... I think I would stick with KM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">kraggs wouldn't be a reason not to get torpor. Too damn slow.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's on the other hand, if you can't afford torpor this is pretty damn nice. Can't wait to ding so I don't need kraggs up on raids anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I see your point.<br />
In most case probably Torpor is better spell to go with.<br />
But the spell is simply too rare and expensive..<br />
and KM opens new door for those shamans without the torpor.<br />
<br />
If I come a cross Torpor spell then I will use it, but I feel that KM will do the trick for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While KM is certainly not a replacement for torpor, it IS an improvemnt over what was available before.  If you do not have Torpor, use KM until you get Torpor -- but remember that Torpor is where the action is.  <br />
<br />
Torpor can be affected by AA (duration) and some focus items (like mana preservation 3 items) -- which change the ratio signficiantly.  <br />
<br />
For example (bear with me if my numbers are slightly off),<br />
<br />
Torpor with no modfifiers is 1200 hp for 200 mana.<br />
<br />
With mana preservation 3, its 1200hp for 170 mana.<br />
<br />
With spell casting reinforcement 3, its 1500hp for 170 mana.<br />
<br />
With spell casting reinforcement mastery, its 1800hp for 170mana.<br />
<br />
With spell casting mastery 3, it *might* be 1800hp for 140 mana.  I'm not actually sure if spell casting mastery and mana preservation 3 stack -- maybe someone can fill me in.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that torpor grows with you; KM does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually Healing Adept (think that is the one) that gives +% more to heals works with KM.  At level 1 I do 1989 heals instead of 1950.  Also head some of the focus 4 items in pop will work with it too.  So in theory you can get this puppy over the 2K mark with AAs.  Just wish we could crit with it.  hehe</div></div><hr />
