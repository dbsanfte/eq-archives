<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a random waffle really ... I was playing about in the Hole with a few friends, and with this group we got to the base of Kirn's tower:<br />
<br />
61 shaman<br />
60 shaman (me)<br />
52 shaman<br />
61 mage<br />
52 paladin (tank)<br />
56 wizard<br />
<br />
I was pretty impressed, especially with the performance of the paladin. I was pulling, and we had 4-5 mobs on a lot of pulls. Having the extra shamans there really helped because I could usually channel a torpor and tank the mobs while the other shammies slowed them.We ran out of time otherwise we'd have used ITU to get up to Kirn. The group started out merely as a way for me to show the 61 shammy the zone in preparation for his epic kill on Kirn.<br />
<br />
The really impressive part, is that the next day the mage and the shaman went back and did Kirn as a duo. No tricks, no COTH, they fought down there and killed the scaly.</div></div><hr />
