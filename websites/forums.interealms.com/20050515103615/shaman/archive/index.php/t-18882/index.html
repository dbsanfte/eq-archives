<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've tried... I've really tried to keep an open mind and give SoE the benefit of the doubt but if these first 3 spells per class they've added are any indication of the direction we can expect Shaman to go in GoD, that's just...well F'd.<br />
<br />
We get a 5% lesser slow with a -30 resist adjust at 57 and 65 and a new.... Disease DoT!  And it's worse than Pox!!! WHEEEEE.<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 62 per tick <br />
3:  Decrease HP when cast by 72 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 360 Skill: Conjuration <br />
Casting Time: 6.1 Recast Time: 2.25 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Resist: Disease <br />
Range: 200 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any Deletable: Yes <br />
Dot Stacking: Yes Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental Source: Test 01/08 <br />
<br />
1574 damage over 2.1 minutes for 360 mana for a ratio of 4.372 damage/mana<br />
Compared to our level 59 Disease DoT:<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Disease Counter by 9 <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 111 per tick <br />
3:  Decrease HP when cast by 90 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 430 Skill: Conjuration <br />
Casting Time: 5 Recast Time: 2.25 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Resist: Disease <br />
Range: 200 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any Deletable: No <br />
Dot Stacking: Yes Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental Source: Test 01/08 <br />
 <br />
2088 damage over 1.8 mins for 430 mana at a ratio of 4.856 damage/mana<br />
<br />
So Pox is faster, better DPS and more mana efficient.   What the hell?  I'm having a hard time convincing myself that these AAs and Spells will get fixed when every one of them is being tossed in utter crap form.<br />
<br />
Druids get a new FR nuke just barely less potent than Winter's Frost except the new nuke has a resist mod, hence it's an improvement, albeit somewhat marginal.  Clerics get a new nuke for more damage at the same ratio as condemnation with a resist mod.  Shaman get a downgrade to Pox????<br />
<br />
It's so hard to keep that PMA... Why must SoE make it harder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And yes, I am fully aware that this is a pretty much 180 on my previous stance of let's give them a week or so and see how they flesh these abilities out.  It's just finally reached the breaking point for me where I can't sit back and watch them put in more and more unbalanced crap for us and not say anything, regardless of whether it's brand new in the spdat or not.  <br />
<br />
The straw that broke the camel's back I suppose. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Remember when LDoN was in beta and the new spells were listed in lucy?  They made no sense at all because all the levels were entered wrong.  I am guessing this is the same thing.  There is no possible way this spell could go live as a level 65 spell, unless it serves some purpose that we cannot yet understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The disease dot is obviously not finished, they just stuck something in there to hold the spot.<br />
<br />
The thing that scares me is... if all classes are getting new spells with -30 MR adjustments... are the new monsters going to all be +30 to MR?  Because THAT would truly suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even if they up the damage to be an upgrade to Pox/Ultor it's still F'd.  Why in the hell would we want yet another freaking Disease DoT?  They're absolutely the worst line of DoTs we have.  The ratios are only marginally better than the much faster acting Poison and now Magic based DoTs and they take so long to reach that efficiency that they're completely useless outside of soloing.<br />
<br />
I don't think you'll find any significant portion of shaman that would want another Disease DoT at any level.  Meanwhile they seem to have no problem putting in spells for the other priests that make sense even if they may need a bit of tweaking, they're generally on the right track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look at the bright side.<br />
<br />
At least it is deletable if you buy and scribe it by accident, so you don't waste a slot in your spellbook  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree, it's messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I bet they will make mobs more magic, cold, and poison resistant.  That leaves us with disease if we want to do any damage at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it doesn't have to be better than out other dots as long as it stacks. Kinda odd that it's not better though, don't they want to motivate people to run buy the expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">all the more reason to get on test and feedback this stuff. One might consider that the dev's are possibly trying to bait us to get us on test so that they can get our feedback by putting outrageous stuff on test.</div></div><hr />

Beta application has been closed for more than 2 days now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think it's pretty obvious that this disease DoT isnt finished.  Give it time, see what comes of it, even Sony isn't dumb enough to release a spell like this in its current state.</div></div><hr />
