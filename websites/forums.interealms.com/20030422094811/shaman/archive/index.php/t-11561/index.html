<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love my horse, even after they fixed it so that I couldn't use it with models off.  I would never swing a weapon while I'm outside.  I would much rather med thru fights and use my JBB for extra, mana-free, damage.<br />
<br />
But when I'm in a dungeon, is there a weapon that will give me more DPS than my JBB?  Or should I give up AC and swing a Dathor Great Hammer so it hits between JBB blasts?<br />
<br />
I'm about to Ding 60, so exp mobs are going to be very hard to hit, even with max weapons/offense skills.  Please include whatever other equipment I would need to make a weapon surpass the JBB.  I have no +Attk or Haste equipment, or Avatar in any form.  I don't have Rabid Bear and I don't like the idea of waiting for it to recycle.  I don't want  chase down other players for buffs, C3 and Virtue is bad enough.<br />
<br />
There is probably a &quot;best&quot; answer, but it's also good to know what else would work - since I'm not in an uber guild that can get me any toy I want.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldnt recommend losing AC for melee as a shammy.  Personally, I used to use a Runed Etched Icewurm Fang till I got my epic.  The ratio on it is fast enough that self hasted you may squeeze 2 or 3 hits between JBB depending on reflexes.  Also, with dex buffs it procs pretty often and nice to see<br />
<br />
Mob is hit by 263points of non-melee damage.<br />
You piece a mob for 48.<br />
Mob is hit by 81points of non-melee damage.<br />
<br />
RIEF keeps your stats up with wis/mana boosts and shield availability and will add to you JBB damage fairly effectively.  <br />
<br />
Now that I have my epic I never melee anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It has always been my experience that once I click my JBB, for that 8 seconds I do not swing my Barbarian Spiritist Hammer or poke with my Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, so I'm not sure how you're attacking 2-3 times between casts unless you're not chain-casting with the JBB. In my experience, I'll pull with slow, drag a mob back to where dogdog is parked and wait, maybe canni once or twice depending on how slow Mr. Soontobedeceased mob is, then when it hits me, I hit auto attack, which generated a swing and then click JBB. Once the blast from the bracer lands, you immediately swing with no delay like when you've actually cast a spell. That's why there is no percentage in using a fast delay low damage weapon like a REIF in conjunction with a JBB. Get a big heavy two hander to wail away with between those blasts. With the Barb Spiritist Hammer I get the satisfaction of seeing twin &quot;____ has  been hit for a non-melee damage of 263 points&quot; twice in a row usually 1-3 times a solo fight, but would love to see the damage number on a Dathor Hammer just for kicks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok here is the thing though. If you are on a horse you'll loose the effect of med if ya have auto attack on. So basicly its only worth it (maybe) in places ya cant use a horse. With a horse, the mana regenerated channeled into spell damage far outweighs the damage ya can do mleee (except maybe if ya get super lucky with melee procs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently got this: Winterstorm http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8827<br />
(they show the effect as being a proc, however it was changed to be a right click effect.. like a jbb but less damage, but also less cast time so it equals out in the end)<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes: Ok so this isn't something that is easy to get but it sure replaced all my other melee weapons and I replaced my JBB for a bracer with better stats.<br />
<br />
Before this I used either a club of the ice ocean (has a nice dd proc) or a hammer of spiritcalling.. which also has a nice Snare/DD proc.</div></div><hr />
