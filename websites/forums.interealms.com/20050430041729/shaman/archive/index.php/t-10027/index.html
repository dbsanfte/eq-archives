<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was helping a friend killing wurms for shawl quest thingy the other day when I ran into that guy in GD.<br />
I knew that wurn is casting Gflux/dispell so I buffed myself  with instant sow booties, gloves of warding buff, soul, boar, PE, regen, ac buff and levitation and tried to solo it..<br />
<br />
I fired up a pet, waited for spirit call to pop and maloed+ tugur the wurm.<br />
I landed blood of saryrn/ultor and epic before he could really damage me (melee damage were low from what I remember).<br />
Fight was going well, a few glfux without real damage with lev and instant sow booties and.. big surprise a few spell for 800 to 1200 that tnarg and quiescence healed easy until I got 3 of them for full in 2 sec.. I was at 75% life 70% mana and he was at 75%. <br />
<br />
Anyone has some info about that guy beside it's a wurm 60ish quest npc without loot ?<br />
Or anyone ever dropped him ?<br />
I forgot to log the fight..<br />
What I want to know is if that 1240dd is part of his Gflux or not (for me it seems to be an other spell.. but without log I can't tell)<br />
and if it's not part of his Gflux, if it's a DD spell, a proc or an AoE or and AoE proc etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he casts a DD chanter nuke if i remember correctly<br />
<br />
drops some of his tail doesnt he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, his tail is used to make a bow in Kael.  Turn it into Gleed behind the bank area I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, Vluudeen or something along those lines drops the tail for the bow, he's a fairly easy red wurm in GD, easy to spot.  Kardakor is for the earring of the sanctum quest, he's on CoV faction, you just have to talk to him at one point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he is a NPC for the Ralgyn's Promise quest <br />
