Use your pet like a dot. Pull mob with slow, dot it and tank while pet bites it in the ass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Will the 34 pet duel wield if you give him weaps?  If so you'll almost double the dps of your pet by giving him two weaps so he's hitting with both paws.  And definately don't expect much from him.  He's just a low mana/time dot that dies really fast.  The best thing about him though is that he'll keep mobs off of you and die while you make a beeline for the zone or cast gate or something.</div></div><hr />

All our pets will dual wield, however with the lower level ones you really have to watch the messages to see it (read: not that big a deal if he doesn't get weapons), not like the 49 pet where its 30%~ (guessing) of his DPS.</div></div><hr />
