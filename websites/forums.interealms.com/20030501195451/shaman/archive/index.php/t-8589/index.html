Can online gaming help defeat Osama bin Laden? That's not as silly a proposition as it may sound.<br />
<br />
A Pentagon-sponsored group called the Highlands Forum met this week to discuss what are known as &quot;Massively Multiplayer Online Games.&quot; These games, which can allow several million people to play, are among the hottest new trends in the Internet world, and they may have some fascinating uses in fighting terrorist networks.<br />
<br />
The cutting edge for these multiplayer games is South Korea, which probably has the world's deepest penetration of high-speed (or &quot;broadband&quot;) Internet connections. According to online gaming expert J.C. Herz, more than 2 million people a month play South Korea's most popular online game, Lineage, with as many as 180,000 of them signed on some nights.<br />
<br />
Lineage is a Korean variant of the sort of Dungeons and Dragons combat that's so popular in computer gaming. It's a role-playing game, set in medieval Europe, in which the followers of an evil king's stepson help him try to regain his rightful place on the throne. The followers are known as the &quot;Blood Pledges,&quot; and they try to capture castles -- which then allows them to levy taxes, buy more weapons and continue their assault against the usurper.<br />
<br />
Explains Herz: &quot;Competing Blood Pledges, large gangs of players that can number in the hundreds, lay siege to each other's castles for hours at a time, on fat broadband connections that allow the battles to play out in smooth resolution, in their full glory.&quot; Much of this gaming is done in Korea's 26,000 game parlors, known as &quot;baangs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lineage isn't popular with Americans, notes Herz, &quot;partly because it's a game where not everyone can be the boss.&quot; Koreans like a &quot;tightly defined clan hierarchy,&quot; she observes, whereas in American role-playing games, it often seems that &quot;everyone is the Lone Ranger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Among the popular American equivalents to Lineage are Everquest and Ultima Online. Everquest, a massively multiplayer online world created by Sony, can host 350,000 players, with more than 100,000 playing simultaneously. Sony charges each player $10 a month to join this online world, where the games can last for months.<br />
<br />
Next year a massive online game called Star Wars Galaxies is scheduled to be released by Verant and LucasArts. It could attract more than a million subscribers and have 300,000 simultaneous users, according to Herz. It might take months for players to traverse hyperspace, she says, and they will have to create &quot;a full-fledged economic and political system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Herz explains that &quot;as a design and engineering challenge, in sheer scale and complexity Star Wars Galaxies rivals the construction of a space station.&quot;<br />
<br />
What makes these massive online games fascinating -- in addition to their &quot;human anthill&quot; quality -- is that they may provide new insights into what's known as &quot;network-centric warfare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Defense intellectuals such as Linton Wells II, a deputy assistant secretary of defense who is responsible for command, control, communications and intelligence, believe that the Pentagon must realign itself for &quot;network-centric&quot; operations. In their view, adversaries such as bin Laden's al Qaeda group are really networks -- highly dispersed units that have the same loose but robust structure as the nodes of a computer network.<br />
<br />
The intellectual groundwork for this &quot;netwar&quot; analysis was laid out in a paper published on the Internet in October 2001 by two Rand Corp. analysts, David Ronfeldt and John Arquilla. &quot;It takes networks to fight networks,&quot; they argued. But it has been difficult to imagine what these anti-network networks might look like.<br />
<br />
That's why the massive online games are so intriguing. The ability to connect many hundreds of thousands of people simultaneously opens the possibility for sharing information, tasking both combatants and civilian rescue workers, and &quot;pulsing&quot; adversaries with diffuse but well-coordinated counterattacks.<br />
<br />
Herz, who is the author of a recent book titled &quot;Joystick Nation,&quot; notes that computer games have the same roots as military simulations. The difference is that computer gaming took off -- with many thousands of programmers helping refine the software -- especially after the Internet made communication and file sharing easy. PC gaming also developed its own intricate social structure -- through chat rooms, Web sites, rankings and other means of instant communication among the user network.<br />
<br />
The civilian PC war games are now much more complex and sophisticated than their Pentagon predecessors -- and, at the very least, online gaming could help make military games more realistic.<br />
<br />
But the challenging idea is that the online gaming world could provide models for much more advanced ways of responding to threats. It could create real-time networks for a kind of command and control that has never been attempted. The peer-to-peer connections of the online world could also break down some of the time-wasting and bureaucratic hierarchies that continue to obstruct military planning and operations.<br />
<br />
Bin Laden and his allies certainly aren't playing a game. But it's just possible that online gaming could provide some fresh insights into combating and ultimately containing this terrorist threat.<br />

<br />

...Seriously though, that's pretty interesting. Terrorist cells are going to be the next type of warfare, it will be interesting to see in the next 20 years how these get found and killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yah i know a lot of military guys that play EQ.  This one just happens to work at the Pentagon :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Land what department you work for?  (that is..can you tell me without having to kill me? :cool: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks like he works in the secret government department that comes up with Anagrams and Code names to me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've taken a number of management classes in school and it's funny how often I relate the content to raiding in EverQuest.  Many of the same topics and ideas in the world of business management seem to relate to the way people organize raids (or I guess guilds, to a point) in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
A lot of military command is based on management, so it's logical to go that one further step in terms of comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've noticed that from my time in EQ as well; there seems to be a disproportionate number of players who are either in the military or once were. I can think of several from my guild alone, one of whom just got back from Afghanistan. He posts pics on the guild website every so often of pictures over there and the various vermin that crawl into his sleeping bag at night time :D<br />
<br />
edit: Here's some of his pics, warning: he's not the most politically correct fella :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A lot of these experts are eggheads with too much time on their damn hands. Sadly many of them have served ZERO days in the military. (To see such disatrous results intersect Les Aspin and Somalia).<br />
<br />
You know I could load up my BMW'er with fuel, gas cans, and various other combustible materials and go crash the gate at Ft. Bragg - said act doesn't make me a terrorist or organized - I was just some schmuck who blew himself up in his car.<br />
<br />
I read something the other day dealing with these terrorists and their level of organization. The author (name escapes me atm) said what distinguishes al'queda from others is that the former can conduct to simultaneous acts of terror at once. (ie the bombing of the hotel in Kenya and the attack on the Israeli civilian plane.<br />
<br />
Well shoot - MANY military guys (and civilian) can orchestrate multiple movements involving disparate units and locales. It's called planning.<br />
<br />
In the end, destroying these 'cells' will involve identification, location (That's the toughie), penetration and trigger pulling.<br />
<br />
To all those nay-sayers who whine that &quot;You can't kill them all because that makes more,&quot; hey - when I see a roach on my floor at 0300 I don't think ' 'You know, if I kill him more may come.'<br />
<br />
I squash him and when and if I see others they get the same treatment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ignatius is a smart guy, but he is way off base in this article.<br />
<br />
- The Highlands forum is not Pentagon Sponsored as he claims, but is a loose collection of &quot;smart guys&quot; that brainstorm some interesting things (anyone ever heard of Andy Marshall?) - many of them are associated with the 5-sided puzzle palace.<br />
<br />
- Lineage only proves that a very homogeneous society will share similar interests. But if you've seen it, you know it's technologically inferior to the EQ and UO variants. . His comments are like saying China is the world's most popular country because so many people live there. <br />
<br />
- Net-centric Warfare is a term coined by the Navy at a Global Wargame a few years back that has taken on a new life (back in 1998, not the 2001 of the RAND document).  Wells' comments show a marked ignorance of the concept, which is a theory that claims our decision and communications networks, through improved capability and robustness, will overwhelmingly outperform an enemy's networks resulting in his complete collapse, and defeat. This theory is pretty much  meaningless when applied to a non-conventional warfare scenario since we want to get inside of a terrorist cells' decision processes, not outperform them! <br />
<br />
Oh well, I guess Ignatius was trying to cash in on some pop culture and Al Queda linkages to try and produce this week's op ed piece. <br />

P.S. See Faern? Not a euro-type at all. Now I'm a slimy consultant at the Pentagon and &quot;another Agency.&quot;</div></div><hr />
