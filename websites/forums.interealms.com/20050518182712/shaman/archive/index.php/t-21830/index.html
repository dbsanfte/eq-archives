<br />
Spiritist, Visionary, Augur, Spiritseer, Soothsayer, Spiritmaster, etc. are likely candidates, though I think Avatar would also be good since it's the next logical step up from a prophet (conduit of a god -&gt; incarnation of a god).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I think Heyokah is the best shamanic name.<br />
<br />
I'd therefore like it to be the AA title that you actually walk around with, so that when people look at you, they see  Heyokah Macnair.<br />
<br />
The advantage (and disadvantage) is that the word is not standard English (it's Lakotah Sioux in origin, I believe).  So not everyone will know what it means.  The disadvantage to that, of course, is some people will be jerks when they come across something they don't understand.  But the advantage, for those who are a little more open, is that it provides a little more flavor of mystery.<br />
<br />
As for the level 70 lfg tag:  I could live with witchdoctor (but not with Witch Doctor).  <br />
<br />
But my preference would be:<br />
<br />
Macnair (70 spiritwalker) <br />
<br />
Would need a reliabel walk-in-spirit-world invis spell to qualify for this, though.</div></div><hr />

You have to remember, Shamanism works with Spirits, Dreams, Fire, spirit and cold for Elements. <br />
<br />
So, why don't they research a little and find the best word that BEST describes our class. (And no, not Buffbot or useless. c'mon guys...)<br />

<br />
I stick by my &quot;Messianic&quot;, though, as the only realisitc upgrade from &quot;Prophet&quot;... Nothing quite says tribal leader by being imbued by your god to lead your people to glory / freedom / whatever...</div></div><hr />

<br />
au·gur    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (ôgr)<br />
n. <br />
One of a group of ancient Roman religious officials who foretold events by observing and interpreting signs and omens. <br />
A seer or prophet; a soothsayer. <br />
<br />
To predict, especially from signs or omens; foretell. See Synonyms at foretell. <br />
To serve as an omen of; betoken: trends that augur change in society. <br />
<br />
To make predictions from signs or omens. <br />
To be a sign or omen: A smooth dress rehearsal augured well for the play. <br />
<br />
If we are intune with the whole spirit world, that should mean we have some forsight into the future or near present.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The problem is, for each expansion that raises levels, SOE gives the highest level the &quot;Ultimate name&quot;... and then, next time they raise the cap, they have to try and top the name they had already thrown out as ultimate back in their last expansion.<br />
<br />
Case in point, a level 60 Rogue has the awesome title of &quot;Assassin&quot;, while a 65 rogue is a &quot;Deceiver.&quot;<br />
<br />
Would you rather be deceived or assassinated?  <br />
<br />
Same with Lich coming before Demi Lich (I know it's a necromancer spell, but the fact that that order is how it is is a good example).<br />
<br />
They SHOULD just give up and call 70 the &quot;Bestest Ever In All The World Until The Next Expansion Shaman&quot;... though it would cause a lot of spam on /who, hehe.<br />
<br />
Personally, I vote for Heyokah, even though you aren't really a Heyokah until you've done epic through to the SoW booties part (which you could easily do solo once you're at this level, heck, your omens doggie could probably bite the wimpy black dire in two).</div></div><hr />

So how about Sucker?<br />
<br />
I wonder if that doesn't provide a clue as to why stat buffs are so great?  <br />
They nailed the second one to a T.<br />
<br />
I can't help but wonder if some of our new skills/AAs won't include a xylobot script to buff in response to tells. <br />

For class title I would say Heyokah.<br />
For available AA titles - Dreamwalker, Spiritwalker, Witch Doctor, Seer are all good.<br />

One mentioned previously that does not work is thaumaturgist, according to Webster's it means the following.<br />

I know.  That is where the name was derived from.<br />
<br />
It would still make a fantastic title.  Who said it had to make sense?  Most of the other titles don't.  A level 65 monk named CheeseMonkey who lives at home poppin' his zits in between raids while he snort-laughs has NOT transcended anything, and a level 65 warrior who is not a guildmaster is not really an overlord.  Heck, First-Tier AA titled people are by no means barons of anything.<br />
<br />
I hate witch doctor.  I'm not a witch doctor, I don't sing tribal chants and go ooga booga and shake a rattle while i make herbs.  I consider myself more of a noble priest more in tune with the earth, who calls upon the power of spirits.<br />
<br />
I really, REALLY like Visionary... it's in line with the meaning of our previous titles, and sounds very cool :)</div></div><hr />

I don't like Heyokah as a class title.  <br />

Elder, Oracle, Prophet - these were great designations.  Baron, Venerable, Luminary all sound kinda lame to me.  Yes, I know I'm mixing matching a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Avatar &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I'm actually rather fond of Avatar as well.  It seems a logical next step in the progression with our various gods.  Shaman, mystic, luminary, oracle, prophet, avatar. . . <br />
<br />
With each step we get closer to our god.  A shaman (unless talking to Rytan) is a priest.  A mystic is someone who relates to religious mysteries or occult rites and practices.  A luminary is a person who gives inspiration to others (a bit of a stretch to imply it's from our gods, but c'est la vie).  A oracle is a person through whom a deity is held to respond when consulted.  A prophet is a person who speaks by divine inspiration or as the interpreter through whom the will of a god is expressed.  Each step is a step closer to our diety.<br />
<br />
Seems to make sense that our next step is to allow our diety to manifest through us.  Hence . . . avatar--1) temporary manifestation or aspect of a continuing entity, or 2) The incarnation of a [Hindu] deity, especially Vishnu, in human or animal form. <br />
<br />
Most of the above are from the dictionary, btw!  :)<br />

I dunno, guys, using a souixan term for a jester (to paraphrase) doesn't really say &quot;Shaman&quot; to me&quot;<br />

Also used to describe and refer to  - for lack of a better term - spirit mischief, both the deeds and the being responsible.<br />
Never try to literally translate Native American terms, the difference between the associative thought patterns of a traditional Native American language and a modern language like English just cause for confusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from that, if they're going to have titles, they should at least mean something.  When you look at a shaman, you can't tell if they have 50 aa or 500 aa.<br />
<br />
And no matter what they make it, if it's not different from a druid's or a beastlord's aa title then I'm firebombing Sony headquarters.  That's the most important distinction they need to make.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I say they keep us Prophet, because after looking at that new spell line, there's not a huge difference once you figure in GoD spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having 20 &quot;Messiah&quot;'s walking around would be weird... the theme is being a Prophet for a tribal community, not a world-wide religious harbinger.  Avatar is too powerful (as well as a more melee-oriented title) and not necessarily linked to Shaman.  &quot;Dream Walker&quot;...?  I'm a Shaman, not an interior decorator.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">20 Messiahs would be wierd.<br />

Which is why I suggested &quot;Messianic&quot; - Pertaining to a messiah, a servant of the one who delivers the believers in the faith.<br />

Jinheim, did you come back?  I thought you had washed your hands of our dirty litle vice called EQ and headed to CoH.  If so, good to have you back.<br />
