<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Clattering Bone Neck, Ribbon Choker or whatever it is<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians, Crystal Spider Eyes, Enshrouded Veil<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
Shissar Scaled Gauntlets, Stormrider Gauntlets, or Coldain Skin<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't get something for each slot, but may be able to get one or two of these with 4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best advice I can give you is to window shop for a week without buying anything at all. Why? because you get the best picture of what is out there, as well as an idea of prices. <br />
<br />
This has helped me hugely in the past. Two of my first great bargain buys were Chokidai Hide Spaulders (250pp) and a Rust Encrusted Bracer (150pp). Should have been 3k for the pair on our server. <br />
<br />
So that would be my advice - don't buy a specific item, buy a bargain. You can even sell it again, rinse repeat and end up with a hell of a lot more than 4k to upgrade with :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chitinous belts are cheap on my server.  Something you might want to look at.  So are Goranga Idols.  You could also camp a Gantru Charm for range slot with a duo partner or small group in UP.<br />
<br />
Consider replacing the cloak with an Arctic Wyvern.  HP&gt;wisdom.  You should be able to sell or trade at about an even cost.<br />
<br />
Consider replacing the platinum fire wedding ring with a shadel bandit ring.  Another easily camped item, so I wouldn't recommend buying it.<br />
<br />
Your gear doesn't look that bad for your level.  I also recommend browsing for a week (or longer) to get a feel for market prices and snag any true bargains you can.  Be careful though, as LoY items come out, some item prices will crash with very little notice.  If you aren't comfortable playing professional trader though, just browse and don't buy.<br />
<br />
Good luck shopping!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">have been keeping my eyes on the bazaar sales. keep seeing shadel bandit rings but they have not dropped lower than 2k. might as well at least try that camp. and see that chitinous belt for a little over 300p on occasion. i really appreciate your help and advice for me equipment.<br />
