<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SimonNejmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
<br />
I just started a new shaman cat and is wondering wich weapon skills I should try to keep up.<br />
<br />
Or doesn't it matter at all? Will shamans become pure casters further into their lives so that 1HB and such skills stop to matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all of them, but pierce and 2hblunt more than 1blunt.  IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Piercing for epic, obviously.  I keep my 1hb up because I may want to use my iksar cudgel for a weapon, never know.  I also like my tash stick.  I am not sure why I would want 2hb, but everyone keeps saying to keep that up.  Can someone post why?  Thanks  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i had same problem..... why should i keep up 2hb. now i wish i had with the intriduction of the driveshaft..... fairly cheap and very nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All 3. Only hand to hand isn't important. The highest ratio weapons are 2HB, like Tae Ew. And the 1H weapons allow room to equip a shield full of stats. All 3.</div></div><hr />
