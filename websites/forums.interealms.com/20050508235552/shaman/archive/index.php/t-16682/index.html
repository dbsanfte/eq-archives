Get a peice of sh*t gear with a little sta on it and no hp's, watch your hp's go up and down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It varies depending on class, and where that point is.  1 sta under 200 gives more than 1 between 200 and 255, which gives more than 1 over 255.<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it also matters if you have the durability AA as well. I just go by the rule that any stamina over 255 is virtually worthless, certainly not worth sacrificing anything major for.  For Shamans that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know Warriors sta equations are:<br />
<br />
sta * (lvl/10) = hp.<br />
<br />
Up until 255. After that it's 1 hp for every sta over 255.<br />
<br />
I think shamans is sta * (lvl/20) = hp.<br />
<br />
Not to sure. Should be on this site somewhere.<br />
<br />
Natural Durability doesn't effect the hp per sta thing.<br />
<br />
Just total overall HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make tests on magelo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think (not sure at all) it must be something like:<br />
under 200sta: +1sta = +6-8hp<br />
over 200sta: +1sta = +4-5hp<br />
Am I too wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It all depends on your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, its pretty simple. It depends on your class, level and AA's.<br />
<br />
At level 60+ with no AAs, per STA at 255 and lower:<br />
<br />
Warriors get 6 HP<br />
Monks/Rogues/Paladins/SKs get 4 HP<br />
Casters/Priests/Hybrids get 3 HP<br />
<br />
Natural Durability 3 will add 10% of whatever number you had per STA (Warriors would see 6.6 HP per STA). PE adds a very minimal amount beyond that if your class can buy that ability.<br />
<br />
There is a major drop after 255 STA. Its half or less the HP after 255 vs 255 and earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">According to Magelo<br />
<br />
HP = TRUNC[ 5 x ND ] + TRUNC [ Lvl x LM x ND ] + TRUNC [ TRUNC [ ( STA - TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] ) x Lvl x LM / 300 ] x ND ] <br />
<br />
Our LM is 15<br />
ND is Natural Durability which is 1+.02, .05 or .10 depending of whether you have ND1, 2, or 3<br />
I assume Truncated is a math geek way of saying rounded off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">truncated is different from rounding.  Truncating means completely cutting off numbers after a certain point.  Say if I truncated to the one's digit, 5.6 would become 5.  But if I rounded it would become 6.  <br />
Basically truncating is just rounding down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">According to Magelo<br />
<br />

I assume Truncated is a math geek way of saying rounded off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trunc is the same as floor, which is the same as just cutting off the decimal stuff without rounding.<br />
<br />
This formula seems to say that at 256 stamina and higher, stamina has half the effect it normally does.<br />
<br />
i.e. :<br />
265 sta = 260 effective (3 hp) sta.<br />
270 sta = 263<br />
275 sta = 265<br />
280 sta = 268<br />
285 sta = 270<br />
290 sta = 273<br />
295 sta = 275<br />
300 sta = 278<br />
305 sta = 280<br />
310 sta = 283<br />
<br />
(so for 55 sta above 255, you only get 28 effective extra sta)<br />
<br />
For a level 65 with 310 sta, 3.25 hp per effective sta leads to:<br />
283*3.25 = 919 hp based solely on sta<br />
1010 hp with ND<br />
<br />
For a level 65 with 255 sta:<br />
828 hp based solely on sta<br />
910 hp with ND<br />
<br />
For 55 extra sta above 255, you get 91 extra hp.<br />
With ND, you get 100 extra hp instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is very cool-- can find out the exact benefits of Natural Durability based on this formula :)<br />
<br />
HP = TRUNC[ 5 x ND ] + TRUNC [ Lvl x LM x ND ] + TRUNC [ TRUNC [ ( STA - TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] ) x Lvl x LM / 300 ] x ND ]<br />
<br />
ND = 1, 1.02, 1.05, 1.1<br />
<br />
283 sta, level 65<br />
<br />
5 + [975 * 1.00] + [[269 * 3.25] * 1.00] = no ND<br />
5 + [975 * 1.02] + [[269 * 3.25] * 1.02] = ND 1<br />
5 + [975 * 1.05] + [[269 * 3.25] * 1.05] = ND 2<br />
5 + [975 * 1.10] + [[269 * 3.25] * 1.10] = ND 3<br />
<br />
5 + 975 + 874 = 1854, no ND [zero AAs]<br />
5 + 994 + 891 = 1890, ND 1 (36 extra hp) [2 AAs total]<br />
5 + 1023 + 917 = 1945, ND 2 (91 extra hp, 55 over ND 1) [6 AAs total]<br />
5 + 1072 + 961 = 2038, ND 3 (184 extra hp, 93 over ND 2) [12 AAs total]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is very cool-- can find out the exact benefits of Natural Durability based on this formula :)<br />
<br />
HP = TRUNC[ 5 x ND ] + TRUNC [ Lvl x LM x ND ] + TRUNC [ TRUNC [ ( STA - TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] ) x Lvl x LM / 300 ] x ND ]<br />
<br />
ND = 1, 1.02, 1.05, 1.1<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am currently level 65 with 280 Sta and ND1, and I was disappointed when I bought ND1 to find that I only got 36 Hp for my 2AA, so I was wondering whether Planar Power (PP) to increase my STA would be a better use of my AA, so I used SEARCH and found this thread, and This one (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21920&amp;highlight=STA+HPs+305) Neither of which gave me all the information I needed, but they did give me the Formulas to work it out.<br />
<br />
So I did, and here are the results.<br />
<br />
<br />
STA | No ND |  ND1 |  ND2 | ND3<br />
280 | 1851  | 1887 | 1942 | 2035<br />
285 | 1857  | 1893 | 1948 | 2041<br />
290 | 1867  | 1903 | 1959 | 2052<br />
295 | 1873  | 1910 | 1965 | 2057<br />
300 | 1883  | 1920 | 1976 | 2068<br />
305 | 1890  | 1927 | 1983 | 2078<br />
 <br />
<br />
So it appears the 2AA fro ND1, gets me 36Hp which I knew, but the 2AAs for PP1 would have got me 6Hp.<br />
<br />
As, for my next step, ND2 costs 4 more AA, and will give me 57Hp, wereas if I spent 4AAs on PP it would give me 16Hp.<br />
And the 6AAs for ND3 give me 93Hp compared with PPs 22Hp.<br />
<br />
So, we can basicly comclude that ND is the way to go completely, and the extra Sta from PP isn't worth the AAs at this stage.<br />
<br />
I hope someone finds this useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With ND3, 1 STA can give anything from zero HPs to 5 HPs, depending on how lucky you are with rounding and the amount of STA you have already (post 255 is when you start seeing strange things happen).<br />
(Edit: oops, that link's already been posted. I'll update that post as soon as I can after Omens goes live with info on STA over 305).</div></div><hr />
