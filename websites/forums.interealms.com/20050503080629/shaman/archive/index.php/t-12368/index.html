<br />
what is your experience here? Since I got SCM3 (few months ago) I constantly got the feeling that fizzles are not reduced at all. Bit difficult to parse this though.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My impression is that my fizzle rate on alteration (which is my specialisation) hasn't improved at all, but that for evocation has marginally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I got SCM3 a while back and was looking forwards to seeing a reduction in fizzles on alteration spells, but I have seen no visible improvement at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah no improvement at all. not sure we gain mana reduction also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah no improvement at all. not sure we gain mana reduction also.<br />
<br />
The mana reduction works.  I had SCM2 when it was broken a while back (before PoP so quite a long time ago) and notice the same night that it was broken that I was running out of mana a lot faster.  I really can't say that it reduces fizzles but I do know that it makes a huge difference in mana usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anything which purports to 'reduce fizzles'  (except the AA that totally elimiates them on spells under a certain level) isn't going to have any effect under normal circumstances.<br />
<br />
Why? Just having maxed casting skills will bring you fizzle rate down to the lowest it can get.<br />
<br />
You have to have crappy skills before such effects can do anything for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you wanna see the difference, then try MGB Fo7 before and after SCM3..... it sure as made a difference to me!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what finaljustice said ;)<br />
<br />
Massive manasavings with scm3, i need basically all my manapool to MGB Fo7 unbuffed (or about 93% ish with VoQ), yet regularly end up with up to 33-35% mana left after casting ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: still fizzle all over the shop though  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thats always going to be the case, I remember MGB'ing Khuras Focusing and needing the bar to be at 50m to MGB cast it, yet I ended with 20m or so with no AA's... so I don't think you ending with 33-35m from 93m-fm is due to SCM3.  Just my findings though over lots of time using MGB, not so much these days though.</div></div><hr />
