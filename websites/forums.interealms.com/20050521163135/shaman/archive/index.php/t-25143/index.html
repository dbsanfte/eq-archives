<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not a &quot;come to WoW&quot; post this is a &quot;Here's a difference between the two&quot; post.<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
Remember the rat race that was Clerical Epics? Remember camping {whatever} by yourself for a particularly nice item?<br />
<br />
Remember that Epics were originally designed so that not everybody could have them immediately.  MOBs didn't always drop a particular item (Vampire Essence in PoH for Enchanters), or were rare spawns (VS in Karnors).<br />
<br />
So what happened say for the Rangers - if one Ranger was able to turn in something to VSR, then another Ranger could not.<br />
<br />
If one Monk killed Gwan in PoSky, then another could not.<br />
<br />
A zero sum, I win you lose philosophy and implementation.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't like that. * IF * you are of the required level to receive a key quest (mostly at 12, 20 and 40 from what I've determined so far), then you get the quest.<br />
<br />
Furthermore if 5 of the same class needing a particular guy group together and kill him? All get the item.<br />
<br />
And if one or two die in the process before the named dies (meaning they can't loot the body)?<br />
<br />
It's not a start over penalty.  You simply wait for him to respawn (maybe 2 minutes max) and kill him again.<br />
<br />
Trying to turn in an item that is wrong or to the wrong NPC? Doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
There aren't multiple pitfalls designed to create frustration or confusion on the part of the playerbase.  You CAN'T turn in an item to the wrong NPC, you CAN'T have an item eaten, you WON'T be sitting at one spot staring at a wall for hours on end.<br />
<br />
But hey, I just wanted to provide that perspective.  Again, play what you think is fun and what makes you happy.<br />

Unless of course, you have to run back asap or everyone will die haha.<br />
<br />
If you stay dead without releasing until the mob is dead, you will then be able to release and come back to a lootable corpse, or be flagged with his death!  Saves that 2 minute wait! yeah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I choose eq1.  Tried FFXI, Daoc, WoW, EQ2, Horizons, and a few more.  EQ1 is by far the &quot;hardest&quot; of everything I've tried, and I like that.  For me, the reward is knowing that it was very difficult and I succeeded.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, FFXI is probably on par with EQ in terms of difficulty, but its whole world just felt &quot;off&quot; to me.  I can't explain it.  Just didn't feel like a 'real' fantasy world.  Too much eastern influence I suppose.  My westerness didn't sync well with the themes and so forth.  <br />
<br />
Daoc.  Don't like PVP.  Initial release was bare of content.  I didn't feel much strategy was involved in fighting.  Of course, I was a nuker, and only got to lvl 30 or so.. but in the end, it seemed toned down.  Simplistic.<br />
<br />
WoW- Casual game.  Very well done casual game.  But doing my &quot;epic&quot; by waiting for 2min for a mob to appear is.... not fulfilling.  At least for me.  I want 3 day spawns.  I want 1-100 chance of something dropping.  I want competition for those spawns.  To each their own.  <br />
<br />
EQ2-  EQ1 reworked into a more casual game.  More 'hardcore' than WoW.  Faster paced combat, quests galore with short to long completion times.  Not sure why I didn't like it, but there was an &quot;air of cheesiness&quot; or something.  Again, the world didn't feel real to me.  It all felt scripted, like some developer was holding my hand.  <br />
<br />
Horizons- Could have been one of the best mmorpgs of all time imo.  In Theory:).  Very poorly implemented.  I had high hopes for it, and played it from day one of beta thru release before I could see it wasn't improving.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I suppose if you regard getting upgrades as your right, rather than having to earn them, then you might view that as a good thing. Epic quests (the original epic weapons back in the day, and subsequent epic quests in following expansions, such as the velious shawl/ring, aid grimmel, BiC etc) are supposed to be epic, they are supposed to take a butt load of hard work. If you can do it in 2 minutes, its hardly epic. And I don't see how you can take pride in a hard won accomplishment, because it wasnt. A real quest has people doing it purely for the doing the quest, not because the xp its going to net, or the shiny bauble it generates, but because its a quest. There were quests like that in EQ, granted, many didnt do them, but they were there. WoW quests are just an insult to the genre, little better than EQ1's pathetic task system. They dont deserve to even be called quests, they should be called tasks instead, because thats what they are. The only reason people do them is to get some free xp while hunting normally, and to get some piece of junk armor because they are short on cash to buy the good stuff in the auction houses. It's all about instant gratification, not about earning your place in the games universe. I've done a lot of the &quot;quests&quot; in both EQ2 and WoW, and they leave you feeling strangely un-fulfilled. They might as well just have a mob you go to hail and pick up your loot (and in some cases they actually do, for all practical purposes). There ain't nothing like the feeling you get as you achieve each milestone in something like the PoP arch quest or the Velious shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ill tell ya...my favorite thing about EQ is that you had to earn every last thing you had with very very little direction.  Having no clue where to go...who do get quests from...where to buy armor from...nothing.  I loved being so lost.  Gaining the knowledge of these things served as a greater reward then the loot itself.  This is the only reason I wont be playing EQ2 or WoW...sounds like its catering to people.  Making a game easier to progress IMHO is a terrible thing to do.  Make it more difficult.  Flagging in my eyes was a terrible idea...keyed zones are great.  Starting out with nothing more then a note....a club...food/beverage....and a candle were perfect.  Not having a mob drop 6 of his heads when you can only see one head...is perfect.  I cant wait to see how D&amp;D online turns out or Vangaurds of heroes...maybe they can bring the challenge back to the roleplayers in the community.  <br />
<br />
IMHO....WoW sounds like alot of fun w/o the time sink... the time sink makes ya stay...earning everything the hard way creates memories and...makes you stay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want something hard that's a time sink with a terrible reward at the end, make foie gras from scratch.  The only difference is that being able to make foie gras can get you dates, but playing EQ usually doesn't.  ;)<br />
<br />
EQ is full of time sinks, so if that's your thing then go ahead with EQ.  If you like getting stuff done, pick WoW or EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Doma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont understand why people think a timesink is fun :P grinding wos to get runes isnt fun I would rather do a quest to get my skills/spells so at least I know that when I log in I have a sense of direction not sit in pok for 2-3hrs first to try make/get a group going then spend a further 5 hours killing mobs that give hardly any xp in the hope that someone doesnt gank that name that my group spawned in the hope it will drop a rune in the hope I will win the roll :P<br />
<br />
Playing for 8 hours and then not walking away with at least 1 rune kinda makes me feel a little cranky.<br />
<br />
Saying that I love other aspects of EQ grouping with friends, the odd raid, taking down that mob for the first etc wish there was more soloable content for those hours when no one is around for groups.<br />
<br />
I think I am one of those waiting for WoW (europe) to be released. <br />
<br />
I love the idea of actually being able to log in play a few hours feel I have achieved something, got somewhere and log off and do something else or do a huge session cos I dont have anything else to do that day/night.</div></div><hr />

During few weeks of WoW beta i was in i could barely bring myself to log on EQ to attend raids no chance on earth will i do those timesink farming sessions if i can have 4-5 hours of fun in WoW instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really want 3 day spawns with odds of 100/1?<br />
<br />
What pisses me off about eq the most is the timesink required to do pretty much anything. I'm not on about getting from A to B but farming rare drops off rare mobs just so I can get into a bloody dungeon, and enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
I recently started a new Necro char on EQ, and have been enjoying playing him. The old world levels are great lots of fun. Then I hit TOFS a duneon I really enjoyed the first time round. <br />
<br />
I killed the first floor mobs but couldn't get a key to the next floor. So the next I decided to &quot;cheat&quot; and Log on Hal to clear the floor over and over until the key mob popped. 4 hours of constant killing and not a single key mob. I was about to log off in sheer frustration and lo and behold he popped.<br />
<br />
I would rather have spent those four hours on my necro playing the game rather than on my shaman killing mobs to get the key for the next floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm gonna take a guess and say that most of the people posting in favor of Everquest were not here since the begining and probably started playing the game 2-3 years ago. Most everyone I knew from 5 years ago are long gone with no chance of returning. For some reason I kept playing till WoW came out but it was a chore just to log on, sometimes I had to wait till that first drink kicked in. Most people that have played eq hardcore since day 1 have since gotten lives outside the gaming world and now only want to play games part-time.<br />
<br />
If you've only been playing for 2-3 years then I can understand why you are still enjoying eq but I find it difficult to believe that anyone that's been around since day 1 is still enjoying the game although there might be some rare exceptions. Still, I find it even harder to believe that anyone voted for John Kerry or Al Gore.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like it or not, one of the things that has kept EQ pumping all these years is . . . yup, timesinks. They havent all been fun, and they havent all been necessary, but I don't think you can effectively eliminate timesinks without affecting the overall game in many many detrimental ways. <br />
<br />
But honestly guys, this debate is getting old. Apples and Oranges. Different games. WoW seems to have that &quot;log in for an hour&quot; thing that so many people whined non-stop about in EQ. Thats all well and good. I just hope when you have burned through all the content because its so trivially easy, you at least start to realize that MAYBE there is something to be said about making quests and leveling a BIT more time-consuming in order to sustain the game and enhance the feeling of satisfaction in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you've only been playing for 2-3 years then I can understand why you are still enjoying eq but I find it difficult to believe that anyone that's been around since day 1 is still enjoying the game although there might be some rare exceptions. <br />
I have been playing since day 1. I have a character with over 120 days played pre-Kunark. Honestly, I think a lot of the people from the &quot;early early days&quot; are probably more disgusted with how simple and dumbed-down EQ has gotten, which indicates to me that WoW is just gonna be a temporary satisfyer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may have a point there, time will tell. I think eq was more of an addiction then then it was fun and the time sinks added to that addiction. The game may have been going for 5+ years but I doubt many of the original people are still around so although eq did have some holding power, for most it's not a 5 year game or even a 3 year game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I became disgusted with the amount of time it required to do anything.<br />
<br />
I agree that some sort of personal investment is what makes accomplishments feel rewarding once a task is completed. EQ just went too far to one extreme. I don't think WoW is on the complete opposite end of that spectrum though. I have faith that Blizzard will add those TWA's (time wasting activities) in a manner that will slow leveling down a bit, but not make it feel like the grind you find in EQ.<br />
<br />
WoW's questing system is top notch in helping alleviate that feeling of grinding. It's always sending you to new places to see new things and usually has good rewards at the end. Perhaps the grind is there, but well hidden, or at least nicely packaged so it doesn't feel like such a grind?<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm a firm believer in, and support of what many others have said...play whichever brings you the most enjoyment, satisfaction, and bang for your buck. No one can tell anyone else which game is &quot;best&quot;. That's up to each individual to decide. For me personally that's WoW at the moment (and has the potential to be for many years). As with all other games, I'll play until it's no longer fun, then look for greener pastures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blazz,<br />
<br />
You are 100% wrong on WoW. It is not simple or dumbed down at all. The people who complain it is so simple are the ones (I am pretty sure) who outlevel thier stuff then beat the snot out of it.  I die a considerable amount but I am also pushing things. (Soloing Elite ogres in Loch modan at level 19) Winning fights by luck and skill and a little bit of foresight. <br />
<br />
There is a differance between a stupid confrontational design and the more polished and simply fun design. One is not really easier than the other It simply takes less time. EQ has alot of roadblocks and hassles built in. Wow has made the travel easier but thrown more distractions in to slow you down by making everything robust and vibrant. The challange is in playing the game and having fun. Not in the RNG or the hoops of frustration you have to dive through.<br />
<br />
A powergamer with a 100% focused mindset on min/maxing will devour WoW and spit it out. That is what the min/maxers do. But to design a game to that crowd just makes everyone looking for a world and not a collection of encounters long for something more. <br />
<br />
Wow is something more. <br />
<br />
Blazz, try it. You will enjoy it. If you don't post me a message that you hate it and I will personally reimburse you the 50 bucks. It is that much fun. (Offer only valid to Blazz. He has earned it fighting with me for the last year (Grins))<br />
<br />
I will give WOW the highest compliment I can. It is like the first days of EQ all over again. Minus the suck. What they do from today forward I can't see, but by the sheer scope of fun I am having I am along for the ride gladly. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khulgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Timesinks are a cheap easy replacement for content.  That's all there is to it.  I'm not gonna say WoW will solve that problem, but please don't act like timesinks are a good thing by any means.  They are simply a temporary aspect of MMORPGS because currently, the technology does not exist to allow content to be created faster than it is consumed.  This will change one day, and is changing even now.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It cracks me up to no end that some people consider themselves skilled, or &quot;better&quot; players, because they have obtained items and/or flags in EQ1 that are a test of endurance, not a test of skill.<br />
<br />
Tugela, you seemed to miss the original poster's point.  The original point was that, in EQ1, the players are placed in indirect competetion with each other.  It's hard to be friends with someone when you can only advance yourself at their expense.  So much of EQ1 is designed around placing the players in indirect competetion with each other.  That is exactly why so much griefing occurs in EQ1, competetion between players over a limited resource, but with no official rule set to allow them to compete fairly (that is, there is no in game, fair pvp system in place to decide who gets spawns or who gets a camp).  The players had to do it themselves, and usually, people weren't always playing by the same rules (some were willing to train, some were not.  some guilds were willing to leapfrog, some where not.  some guilds were willing to blow spawns/kill under their level to hold back others, some were not).<br />
<br />
In contrast, in WoW, you are not penalizing others nearly as much when you advance yourself.  In fact, often the best way to advance your own character, is to help others advance.  This is in direct contrast to EQ1.  To imply that quest rewards are not earned in WoW is not only insulting, but egomaniacal in that you imply people who complete quests in WoW are incapable of completing the quests you have completed in EQ1.  Which is nonsense.  Completing a quest in EQ1 requires the same two components: friends, and time.<br />
<br />
What you are saying Tugela, I think, is that you want to be able to stand out from the crowd.  I can understand this and in fact I desire the same thing; I think everyone does.  The draw of many single player games is that the player is special, a cut above.  This is much harder to obtain in a multi player game.  But therein lies a large part of the attraction ... the struggle to stand out from the crowd.<br />
<br />
This basically means you and I want a game where players are differentiated in some manner.  I think a lot of people would like this, actually.<br />
<br />
The main complaint about EQ1 (and many MMORGPS) is that what differentiates people is:<br />
<br />
1) Whether you raid or not<br />
2) The amount of time you play<br />
<br />
You will note that NEITHER of those things has very much at all to do with true skill.  When I watch two people play a match of Starcraft, or Chess, or Mortal Kombat, or even bloody Checkers, it is generally clear in the end, who had more skill.  That is (sadly), simply not the case in EQ1.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now, let's say in EQ1, there are 100 clerics all trying to get a cleric epic.  If they held a &quot;best of the best&quot; type event with PvP once weekly, with the winner getting the cleric epic, *then* I would go around saying that those with cleric epics, truly have skill.  Because only 52 epics would be entering a server per year, and the people who hold those epics defeated others in a fair competetion.  However, the fact is, most any goal obtained in EQ, is obtained by knowing the right people, and putting in enough time.<br />
<br />
Now consider that WoW *has* a PvP system, and that the best items are rewarded through participation in, and excelling at, PvP.  Sounds about right to me.  Those who don't want to participate, don't have to ... but if you want to truly distinguish yourself, you will do so through true skill ... not from being a college student/unemployed person/stay at home SO/whatever with far more time to play than the most of the rest of the player base.<br />
<br />
Basically I challenge all those who say the rewards in WoW are too easy to obtain, to put their money where their mouth is, and come play.  If you play a normal server you won't see the PvP system for quite some time, thus you won't see people with the better rewards for a while.  If you play a PvP server, even doing these &quot;oh so easy&quot; WoW quests becomes quite the challenge when completing the quest means moving into contested or hortile territory.

I agree with you on the worthlessness of timesinks and people who think they &quot;earn&quot; things by taking a long time to get them.  Those people just want an excuse for falling behind the norm and a complaint when &quot;young bucks&quot; surpass them.  It's all a cop out.  I bet if you ask those people if they like standing around for 5 hours at the DMV to get their driver license, they'll say no.  But you spent so much time to get your license, waiting an additional 5 hours only makes it more valuable, right?  And that person who got it in the express line because they made previous arrangements is a silly newb who doesn't enjoy the old-fashioned nostalgia of &quot;earning&quot; things.<br />
<br />
<br />
But as for WoW and their PvP system, it's a myth.  They haven't done anything with it.  It's just unfair killing with no rewards at this point.  It's a waste of time.  I hope they improve it so it's different than every other crappy PvP system on the market now.</div></div><hr />

There hasn't been decent lore in EQ since Velious.  PoP had some okay lore, but you never got to experience it unless you raided.  WoW is actually filled with a lot of lore that even I like to follow, and I hate lore as it makes no sense most of the time and has no bearing on the game experience.</div></div><hr />

It would be better for them to put in the ranking system rather than the reward system.  People *LOVE* to see their names on ranked lists, and to try and achieve a higher spot.  Humans (and men moreso than women, at least openly) are competitive beings.  A nightly-updated ranking system is also easier to implement than a balanced reward system.  I don't get why they're making such bad decisions now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Tis funny,<br />
<br />
Unlike most of you, time for me is irrelevant...I didnt mind spending time in EQ doing things...<br />
<br />
Was is grinding, yup, but i dont mind grinding really...wouldnt have played that much if I did, and I do like the sense of accompishment, you get after the long grind of having gotten something done....<br />
<br />
I think what has finished EQ for me, is not the grind...its the RAID...<br />
<br />
Like all the rest of you that have played EQ from day 1, I have raided...I have guilded, done it a lot...got damn tired of it...<br />
<br />
Maybe its my personality, but frankly unlike most of you I never really found raiding all that challenging....once you figured out the event, it was easy as long as everyone did there part properly...<br />
<br />
In fact raiding was easier than single grouping some stuff and way easier than soloing some of the more challenging stuff...thats where I always really enjoyed myself...figuring out strategies to solo something that most people said couldnt be solo'd<br />
<br />
Face it though EQ aint what it was...in the beginning, there were really very few raid targets/zones...and raiding wasnt everything...<br />
<br />
Expansion after expansion, SoE has more and more stressed the raid game...<br />
<br />
Early on in EQ, the difference between a raid geared player and a non-raid geared player was really fairly trivial...now the gap is freakin stupendous...to the point where you now have no choice...you either raid or you dont progress...<br />
<br />
If your tired of raiding, tired of the uber-guilds, tired of the endless freakin boring wait organizing for your latest target...then there is nothing left in EQ for you...<br />
<br />
That is why for me EQ is probably done...it really boils down to the one-path solution  that is truly EQ now...<br />
<br />
The last character I played was a warrior...leveled him to 70, got him over 100aa and even got him to warmly OoW faction...I never quilded him...I actually did a few raids with him, acting as a main tank for some of the smaller guilds...he has about the best gear you can get without really raiding, stuff you can get single-group, quest or buy....<br />
<br />
Definitely, it was a challenge, but in the end, I was again faced with the fact that in order for him to progress any further, even for him to get his OoW Tier 1 BP or Legs, I was gonna have to guild him....decided that enuff was enuff...<br />

Most everyone I knew from 5 years ago are long gone with no chance of returning. For some reason I kept playing till WoW came out but it was a chore just to log on, sometimes I had to wait till that first drink kicked in. Most people that have played eq hardcore since day 1 have since gotten lives outside the gaming world and now only want to play games part-time.<br />
<br />
If you've only been playing for 2-3 years then I can understand why you are still enjoying eq but I find it difficult to believe that anyone that's been around since day 1 is still enjoying the game although there might be some rare exceptions. Still, I find it even harder to believe that anyone voted for John Kerry or Al Gore.  :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">WoW is 'nice' with camps based on fast named spawns, easy to do quests. EQ has always had timesinks. For some, and probably most people, the amount of time spent gaining a reward is directly proportional to the amount of pleasure derived from receiving said reward. I liked WoW during the stress test, which is where I played it. I enjoyed it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. <br />
<br />
I started playing EQ more than 5 years ago now, and we've had our quarrels. I've stopped playing for other games before, like DAoC and CoH. Neither was able to keep my intrest. I've quit just because I got bored of the whole computer gaming thing for a few months.<br />
<br />
Some of the most memorable events of my early eq life came from either timesinks, aka getting rewards. Or, the fact that death was a cruel fact of life. Everything was new, and I was a newbie. The GM's weren't much more active then they are now, but this was before the craptastical PNP came out. Worst, idea, ever. How can you take a game full of waiting for spawns, that revolved around camping, and then say there was no such thing as a camp. Anyway...<br />
<br />
Of course after playing eq for so long, and the creation of internet sites revolving around the game that actually gave good info ( remember everlore and castersrealm ? ) has created monsters. If anyone here is a dice chucker, its the same thing as the guy that can't seperate the geek knowledge in his head with the knowledge his character has. Of course there is no real solution to this, at least nothing I can think of.<br />
<br />
The reason I don't want to play WoW, is simple, its the same reason eq has gone down the toilet. Its become to easy. The entire game has been dumbed down and retracted, step by step. There were no maps, no pok books. Death meant something. Death in today's eq world is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. We probably have all been on a fear wipe, or rescued a fear wipe. The entire eq world was like that, but it was forgiving, mobs weren't that hard. Groups didn't yet have to be completely perfect ( although it helped ).<br />
<br />
All of this combined has forced a game, that originally was meant to mirror a D20 world, to alter itself. The game has to be one entire timesink, and new mobs new zones and new encounters have to be balanced against a perfect party. Because every other timesink has been taken out, the only one left had to get longer, or this game would fall apart. There has to be timesinks of gaining runes, power gained slowly over time with AA abilities to unlock your full potential. Without hell levels, without long walks, dangerous runs to get from one city to the next, and without large timesinks involved in getting decent equipment there is no longer any other thing to eat up your time.<br />
<br />
Lack of timesinks that allowed conversation, and social interaction is bad. Easy gameplay that has resulted in less of a need to talk with others and work together, is also bad. So in the end, a social game evolved into something that no longer or requires as much social interaction, with a lower feeling of reward for gaining power.<br />
<br />
The ease of WoW, and the fact that I was able to progress in levels and tradeskills quickly without &gt;any&lt; social interaction is not what I want in an MMORPG. However, some people love it, and can be social with it, amen to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Man, is your logic twisted.  In either game you can be as sociable as you like.  Just because you have to group does not make you a social butterfly.  Equally true, just because you don't have to group, does not mean that you can't be sociable.  I'm in a 25 person guild, and every night, I'm either in a guild group or pick up group for part of the evening.  Do I have to be, no.  Are there advantages to grouping, hell yeah.  And, when I'm solo, I'm still very active in guild chat and ooc.  So your assumptions and conclusions really don't seem to hold water to me.  You can play any way you like, the game only sets the framework.<br />
<br />
And, btw, a timesink sux, pure and simple.  Waiting 5-6 hours in the chance that a mob will drop a rare drop is not fun.  Not challenging.  Not something I want to pay to do.  It sux.  Sense of satisfaction without insane pain is possible, really.</div></div><hr />

For those of you like me who played the BETA, leveling was made quicker and faster in BETA to artificially inflate the higher end players (smart IMHO because the power gamers are going to level first, therefore they will be the ones testing raid content instead of casuals who use a command line to inflate their levels).  Making that assumption on production servers is pretty short sighted and ignorant.  I'm not currently bashing EQ, I'm simply saying some of you have your facts wrong about WoW.<br />
<br />
Leveling seemed pretty fast in BETA also because it was fun.  I got exp for exploring new zones, but in EQ I had to fight the crowds in either the cash cow dungeons or the exp grind zones.  Some people like this, I didn't.  Working through the lower levels I like the philosphy of rewarding the player for moving around rather than going to PC, grinding 5-7 levels, going to LoIO and following the &quot;fast track&quot; exp path.  It's more interesting.  Yes, I played EQ since June 99, so when I leveled my origional 2 chars (ranger/shaman) I explored and traveled even though I was discouraged from doing so by game mechanics (try going to old split paw when crack tusk is hunting your butt, yeah, it was fun the first time or two, but wiping repeatedly all night to Cracktusk was not).  Later on, I leveled my twinks in the usual spots because starting a new character was so tedious.</div></div><hr />

Its these kind of attacks on anothers character that bother the people who still play EQ.  We dont want to hear about WoW because of these kind of statements...not because WoW isnt a good game.

Its to the point now that I may never even try the game just because if these are the type of people (my way or the highway) that play WoW, I dont want to be affiliated with them in any sort of fashion.

Um, as far as I can see, from direct reports of WoW players, leveling is about as easy in WoW as it is in EQ when twinked. Have you ever played a character from total scratch, no Bazaar, ONLY the quests and drops available to you in EQ? It would take you a GOOD month to break 30, and thats playing a solid amount of time. There are quite a few people in their 40s now, on WoW, arent there?<br />
<br />
Look, I am not trying to make WoW look bad. I am not saying its a bad game. I am not saying its not as hard as you want to make it (Snoww, that line is for you man). But lets face it, what was a LARGE bitch about EQ? That there was a specific portion of the player population that had FAR better stuff, mostly because they min-maxed the game. You think that WoW isnt going to have &quot;a set path&quot; to the best gear? You think EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the game is gonna be able to achielve it? Hell if thats true, then you just talked me TOTALLY outta that game, no matter how much fun I can have in it for a month or 2.<br />
<br />
EQ and WoW are different. WoW has had the benefit of learning from ALL of EQs mistakes, adjusting them, and putting out a game that definetely appeals to a certain percentage of the EQ population. But it DOESNT appeal to ALL of the EQ population, so stop trying to FIT my playstyle into that game. I am ALREADY seeing people coming back to EQ because WoW has a VERY low level of &quot;long term gratification&quot;. <br />
<br />
The MTV world isnt for everyone, and Diablo 2 was the best game I ever played . . . for about 15 minutes. Stop trying to diefy WoW when they havent even made it around the &quot;first turn&quot; yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I know this is going to sound pretty trite, but the truth is every game is as good as you make it.  For some people, they are quite happy with EQ, be it because the play styles match their method. (or they've become so used to it that it has become their preferred method)  I have to keep wondering why everybody is so worried about what everyone else is doing in game, instead of simply enjoying the game for themselves.<br />
<br />
I personally am playing WoW.  My highest character is lvl 19, and I'm taking my time and really enjoying the various aspects of the game. Sure, I've seen lvl 50+ characters running around, but I'm really not worried.  If they want rush to high level, so what?  How is their ease of levelling really going to affect how you enjoy the game? Do you get that jealous that somebody else is above you?  If so, then go power your way to level 60, and I hope you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Why worry if 5000 other people have the same items you have? Do you like the item?  Yes? Then cool, enjoy the item for what it is.  Do you really need to feel that you are 'special' simply because you have items which not many others do?  If so, then perhaps this is not so much about having fun as it is about being better than other people.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that being proud of accomplishing something that gives a great reward is wrong, but really, isn't it about personal achievment? So what if everyone else on the server has it, if it was a challenge for you to get, then you've still put in a fair bit of effort.  <br />
<br />
If you have to feel that you have more skill than other people, why not try getting those items that everyone has earlier than everyone else? Then you can brag how you got 'x' item 5 levels before most other people.  WoW may seem easier, but that doesn't mean there is no challenge.  Sure, you can do an instance with a full group, but why not try it as a duo, or with lower levels than the so-called recommended.  I guarantee you, that you can still find many challenging things to do in WoW.<br />
<br />
During closed beta for instance, I (21 Paladin) duoed shadowfang keep with a lvl 20 warlock for part of my 'epic' quest for that level. This is an instance which people lvl 25 were saying full groups wipe on. Truth to tell, we even managed to surprise the developer of the zone and quest that we could do it. (got some feedback on a log we kept posted) Same thing for Blackfathom Deeps (another part of the quest)  I had my epic hammer at lvl 22, and I felt damn good about it, knowing I'd got it a few levels before many other paladins, and using less people. (The entire quest duod with the warlock, we both dinged a level during it)  Heck, I'm STILL proud about doing that!<br />
<br />
Challenge is where you find it.  EQ1 has challenges, sure, but don't rule out WoW as 'too easy' just because of other people's feedback about the systems.  You can push yourself to the limit just as easily if you apply yourself.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to push WoW as the next game, etc, but for all you EQ1 people claiming it's too easy keep that in mind. On the other hand, I also enjoyed some of the timesinks in EQ as well, call me crazy, but the shawl quest was a lot of fun!  It may seem like you have to work harder to make a challenge, but I think that's a good thing.  There were times when EQ timesinks were nothing but a huge frustration, and at least on WoW I can pick and choose my challenges.<br />
<br />
I've got lots more I *could* add, but I'm just lazy to type much more  :D</div></div><hr />

Why does time spent always have to equal worth?  Applicants to Joe Schmo's Random Guild can get unwanted loot that's better than anything quested in EQ on their first day.  And getting unique loot in WoW isn't as simple as you make it sound, at least at lower levels.  You still have to fight probability to get something decent, and the better loot comes from elite quests and elite dungeons, which aren't exactly cakewalks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some mental complex, which makes them feel they need to convince, or justify thier choice?<br />
<br />
And then to top it off, they get defensive when EQ players don't agree with them, or defend EQ on an EQ board.<br />
<br />
Realize this, we will NEVER come to some universal answer of truth on what games best.    It will ALWAYS be opinion, and open to the eye of the player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">There hasn't been decent lore in EQ since Velious.  PoP had some okay lore, but you never got to experience it unless you raided.  WoW is actually filled with a lot of lore that even I like to follow, and I hate lore as it makes no sense most of the time and has no bearing on the game experience.<br />
<br />
I agree completely. The lore/story in WoW is far more interesting and relevant than in EQ. And it more or less starts at level 1. In EQ I bet you can level to 60 or maybe even 70 and never have wondered why things are as they are in the world you run around in. In WoW you will pass sick animals and wonder why they are sick and later find out what might be causing it. You will meet dark twisted versions of your kind and wonder why and later find out more. And many quests have interesting tales to tell if you follow them through. Lots of the time if you are asked to bring a report or letter or book to someone you can read them and learn alot more about what is going on. There are even books lying around in various suitable places that you can read too that are purely there to flesh out the story.<br />
<br />
I think the keypoint is that if you give WoW a chance and play it to be enjoyed it will pull you in. If you play it for the phat lewts and to make it to max level as fast as possible it wont have that chance.</div></div><hr />

I've been around the Crucible forums since their inception, and actually long before that when they were originally located on the Soerbaird network. I've been here through 3 or 4 iterations of the Crucible, from Soerbaird, to Maxx, to Mung, now Sunmoon and Interealms.<br />
<br />
Why is it that so many EQ players are still such hard asses when it comes to people that play games OTHER than EQ?<br />
<br />
This will all get sorted out as soon as the forums are split up into multi-game related channels.<br />
<br />
Trust me. I'll be more than happy to post in WoW specific forums vs. your precious &quot;general&quot; forum. There's only one WoW related forum at the moment (which I frequent more than General), but sometimes the stray WoW post will find it's way into General. Ease up a bit.

differ from EQ in any way?<br />
Sick animals? Check.<br />
Mysterious reasonbehind it? Check.<br />
A quest to cure them? Check.<br />
Twisted versions of races? Check.<br />
Interesting quest texts? Check.<br />
Quests to bring in letters and reports? Check.<br />
Books just filled with in-game lore? Check.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only difference is that you are consciously seeing all of this in WoW, simply because it is new to you, while in EQ you see a lore book and go thinking &quot;yay, more story crap, get on with the quest already&quot;.<br />
<br />
EQ's lore could be better, more plentiful and so on, but if you are willing to actually follow the quest dialogues, to talk to NPCs and to read the lore books that drop all over instead of deleting them you might find some intersting stories. I for one liked the shaman epic storyline, I liked the epic 1.5 storyline and I expect to enjoy the 2.0 storyline too. I often find myself with not enough time to really dig into the lore of OoW but the little I have seen so far looked good to me.<br />
<br />
If you want to complain about something complain about how EQ has more timesinks then WoW, how EQ lore does not tie into game mechanics or how shaman are getting screwed. But complaining about a lack of storyline when every single example you listed is implemented exactly in the way you applaud WoW for is silly.</div></div><hr />

Though it may be argued that it doesn't have the &quot;10+ years of lore&quot; (dating back to WC1) that WoW has. I'm also pretty certain that EQ has considerably more quests now (as it should after what, 9 expansions?), but finding them can be a real PITA.<br />
<br />
What can't be argued is how easily WoW lore is discovered in game via quests vs. the difficulty in discovering it in EQ.<br />
<br />
Some like the easier more open system in WoW. Others like working hard to figure things out. To each his own.<br />
<br />
I'm the former, in case there was any question or doubt. I don't mind putting some effort into my quests, but I sure as hell don't like spending months to complete them. :) &quot;Life Quests&quot; (WoW equivalent of &quot;epic&quot; quests) will take some time to complete, and that's fine. But the majority of them are doable in a few hours (some in considerably less) of playtime.</div></div><hr />

Yes levels are easy to come by in WOW, but in eq isn't leveling easy too? Even with crappy gear going to paludal can get you from 10-25 in a weekend. Like camping stuff in eq for hours on end and never end up getting it? Guess what there are things like that in WOW. In a horde instanced zone Wailing Caverns ( lvls 18- ) there are several named mobs that drop unique items (blue) and uncommon items (green). I've been through the instance over 15 20 times, each taking at least an hour to clear the zone. I've only gotten 2 unique items (1 from a quest and 1 from a named). Out of the 15 20 unique items in the zone. I've gained levels 18-24 there so far and still trying to get the items, this frustrates me, but when i finally got one of the items i wanted, it was like a relief and it brought back the magic of acomplishment that i've been missing from EQ lately.</div></div><hr />

Hey, I will gladly step forward and say that just because I played EQ for as long as I did that doesnt mean that I thought EQ was great entertainment all the years. Yes, that does mean I have only myself to blame for not stopping earlier. But dont go trying to make it sound like people only stick around because EQ is sooo good. I bet a lot of people also hesitate to leave because they invested silly amounts of time in a virtual game character and that makes them hang on to even the slightest of hope that SOE will suddenly turn around and realize what they are doing (or not doing!).<br />
<br />
I bet that a huge percentage of the people that finally cancelled their subscriptions havent really enjoyed EQ for a long time. You gotta give SOE some credit for their shrewd business skills in this regard but that doesnt mean EQ is a great game. Its a cashcow now.<br />

Best quote in this whole thread.<br />
<br />
Some interesting points raised, though.  I checked in on the Crucible after probably a month because I actually have no work to do today, and WoW is a-patching.  But other than that, I DID love this game, and the magic really did fade into nothing, reducing the game to a job for me.  Doesn't change the fact that I have good memories, including the great people and posts on this board.<br />
<br />
Another motivator is that I popped onto my old EQ guild website, and there's apparently a lot of hostility and bitterness there toward those of us who left (abandoning them, all their hard work and effort on our behalf, etc) - though they're in Time, I'm not sure what we &quot;robbed&quot; them of by not staying for a game we no longer enjoyed...  (it also surprises me that I don't feel the slightest bit of regret for not &quot;sticking around&quot; for another month or two to see Time.  I guess I'm really cured)<br />
<br />
And I'm starting to wonder if it's not just universal.  Those staying are disgusted by those that left.  Those who left can't understand why anyone would stay, having less fun for the same money and time.  The same comments from different people on different boards, about how WoW is &quot;dumbed down&quot; and &quot;cartoonish&quot; and won't provide any long-term gratification.  About how EQ is &quot;dead and buried&quot;.<br />

Those two statements, his and yours, aren't contradictory. He's simply saying that a lot of the cancelled accounts haven't been used in a long time, but they probably loved the game when they were playing regularly a year or more ago.</div></div><hr />

I am enjoying WoW so far, but I don't think that EQ1 is &quot;dead and buried&quot;. If I could play EQ1 efficiently on my laptop and if most of my friends and guildies hadn't left, I might very well be playing it at least some of the time. There are still things to do there that I would like to accomplish at some time, places to see, natives to kill. As it is, my accounts are paid for through April and I will re-evaluate them when the time comes depending on whether I am back home and can play it again.<br />
<br />
WoW is enjoyable for now, a different pace, a different risk-vs-reward structure, a different way to stimulate the &quot;goal-setting&quot; part of the brain. Relatively few bugs, quite polished, nicely done quests, a whole new world to explore, new skills to acquire. So far, so good.<br />
<br />
Will WoW last 5.5 years the way EQ1 did for me? Perhaps it won't: much of the community is not exactly stellar based on what I have seen so far; the game nudges you in the PvP direction (but doesn't require it); I am worried that balancing the game for PvP will upset the PvE balance; level 60 content may or may not prove to be as enjoyable as high level EQ content.<br />
<br />
It's very early in the game, so to speak. Comparing WoW and EQ1 in December 2004 is like comparing EQ1 and UO in April 1999, who knows which direction the game will take?</div></div><hr />

You played EQ for years. I am going to make a wild assumption here and say that you enjoyed playing it at some point. Why is it so hard to believe that there are still people enjoying it? Fine, the magic is gone for you. You found a game you like more or maybe it is just newer. You tell us how much you like the new game. Great for you. Now you feel the need to tell us how the game we still like to play sucks. Just skip that step. That just leads to heated arguments which will either end in mudslinging or in people realizing that this isa matter of taste. Let's just fast forward to realizing that people are different and thus might like different games.<br />

You have no clue why I still play and enjoy EQ, nor why any of the people on these boards still play and enjoy EQ and I find your assumption that a large percentage of EQ's subscribers hate the game they for extremely dubious.<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm kinda in the same boat of feeling a little bit of hatred/annoyment at those people that left for EQ2/WoW. Don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no problem with anyone that leaves my guild for any reason. What the main problem is that some of these people are the same people that you have been playing beside with for years, and they just get up take off and not leave a message indicating where or when you might be back or if you are even gone at all.<br />
<br />
Take for instance, we have a druid who had a legitimate problem that some of us in the guild knew about. He was one of the 90% raiders and just one day he just didn't log on and hasn't been seen since. Most of us that know him really would like to know if he's okay or if he just decided to not play anymore. He was in the guild longer than I was (i have been guilded for 1 1/2 years) and he's been a longtime guild favorite. <br />
<br />
My point is, I don't care if you leave, but at least have the courtesy to say that you are either a) not planning on continuing playing because you are having fun playing another game, b) not planning on continuing playing because you just don't have the time nor want to play anymore, c) planning on playing whenever you can, just can't do it as much as you have in the past.<br />
<br />
Don't people realize that when you are in a guild, you have a certain responsibility to fullfill. We don't expect everyone to be at every raid, and that's why at least my guild has an offday as well as a light raiding day. We just expect you to let us know if/when you don't plan on playing, so that we don't end up having 35 people on and wasting everyone's time because not enough people to raid things that we wanted to kill. It's not too hard to take 2 minutes out of your life and post an away message. <br />
<br />
Roster spaces are filled in each guild for the most part by what the guild perceives as ideal to raid with. When you quit playing without letting anyone know, you create a situation where the guild is either forced to wait and hope that you come back to play and keep that space free, or fill it with a new recruit. Recently when EQ2 came out, we were still able to get almost full raids, but within the next week we were getting 35 people on (WoW open beta time). Then WoW officially came out and we ended up picking up about 15 recruits in order to fill the ranks of those people haven't been raiding. Take into account of say... 15 people that I've noticed hasn't raided much if at all since mid-november, 5 of them have posted that they are retiring from raiding in EQ1. That means 10 people at least have not told the guild what their future plans on. And what does that mean in the long run? Mostly your roster space is filled already.  If you come back that's fine, but let the guild know your intentions upfront.  People take breaks.  People need time off to get control of their RL problems.  People have work problems sometimes.  Other people have school (exams/finals coming up soon and it will take some others out for a few days).  Just be honest with yourself.<br />
<br />
These are the same people who have been fighting beside you for however long.  They took the time out of their busy lives everynight so that they could have fun and raid alongside you.  Don't you feel you owe it to them to let them know that you do not want to play anymore?  Have you ever been online at raid time with that sinking feeling that the 35 people that are standing there with you isn't going to be enough to do anything constructive, or anything that you were able to do last week with 54 people?  I have, and it's not fun, nor it is fun to get that feeling that you are being let down by the very people that were by your side just a month ago.<br />
<br />
Please, please please, if you are going to quit playing EQ1... tell your current guild your plans (assuming you are in a guild). If you have spent any time in the guild, the least you can do is notify them of you leaving. Nobody likes it when people retire, but it's part of the game. Nobody likes it even more when a bunch decide to stop playing or take breaks and not tell anyone.  Just let others know your intentions, that's all I ask.</div></div><hr />

Could be worse. My guild/alliance's forums are hosted by an individual and they have been down for many weeks. As far as I could determine, pretty much everybody has left for EQ2 and WoW, but I can't even find out who is where or which server/characters they are playing since I have no way of contacting them :(</div></div><hr />

You have no clue why I still play and enjoy EQ, nor why any of the people on these boards still play and enjoy EQ and I find your assumption that a large percentage of EQ's subscribers hate the game they for extremely dubious.<br />
<br />
If you include my quote then why do you try to make it sound like I said something I didnt? In that quote I didnt say that people hate EQ. There is a difference between not enjoying something and hating it.<br />

Oh no! What an evil thing to do. Do you expect a company to not want to make money?<br />
<br />
Again what you quote me for doesnt correspond to what you try to make me look like having said. I actually do acknowledge that they want to make money. But SOE's way of making money is not the only way. If you enjoy the result of their business strategy then thats fine but that doesnt invalidate my statement. One of the results of their strategy that you might not have considered is that in the future YOU get to pay for the expansions and zones that YOU enjoy, I wont be around to help finance your entertainment anymore :)</div></div><hr />

ever tried anarchy online or eve? those games are hard(for i eve i have to trust others since i never played it), the learning curve in ao is not called a learning cliff for nothing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I would hardly call Java superior to those two. In fact he is saying that EQ1 is inherently superior to any other game on the market, though more difficult to develop by several orders of magnitude. That seems off too. Clearly we are in need of clarification. :D<br />
<br />
I don't call Java superior to the other two, either.  But it does do more housekeeping for you, and is thoughtfully designed as opposed to &quot;design by growth&quot; or &quot;design by committee&quot;, both of which C++ suffers from.   Java has some (to me) fatal shortcomings that show up in the long run - which may or may not be the case with WoW, only time will tell.<br />
<br />
In EQ you have to figure it all out yourself; that's the equivalent of a computer assembly language (or perhaps straight C language, if you prefer, allowing MUDs to take over the assembly language title).  Yes, it's more difficult to play than the others on the market (I have tried COH, WoW, and EQ2 recently).  Examples of this are the underdeveloped quest system/UI; kill-stealing, ninja-looting, and training are possible and easy; etc etc.  As long as you KNOW the system, KNOW the zones, and do the right things (including just going somewhere else when that idiot necro FD trainer shows up), EQ works just fine, but it does not hold your hand much.<br />
<br />
EQ2 attempts to build on EQ but fix its problems, which is what C++ does with C.  Unfortunately, IMO EQ2 is a bit overdesigned... like C++.  The feature list is more like a kitchen sink of unrelated items than a working total.  The game plays unevenly as a result.  This reminds me bigtime of C++.<br />
<br />
WoW (which I do play, thanks) is a more modern MMP - not necessarily better, but more modern - that avoids many of the traps that EQ2 fell into, and makes life really easy.  It seems to have an overaching design and each part fits into that design, like Java.  Unfortunately I have my doubts about how interesting it is going to be long-term unless PVP turns into something that interests me (which it never has).<br />
<br />
My personal preference in programming languages is actually C++ minus some features I consider problematic, like operator overloading, templates (in most cases), automatic copy constructors, and a few others.  However, this doesn't match my preference in MMP's at all - I am prepared to sacrifice power for convenience when I'm playing a game versus when I'm writing code.<br />
<br />
I do still have an active EQ account, but I haven't played in over three weeks, and if I still feel the same way when the account runs out in about six more weeks, I'll let it expire.<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks to the anonymous poster for the negative rep bump with no explanation.  Since you gave no explanation, it's hard for me to figure out what you didn't like.  And since I was not attacking anyone, detracting from the argument, EQ-bashing or anything else, I'm puzzled as to what it could be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certain aspects of WoW definitely make life &quot;easier&quot; than what it was and, to some extent, still is in EQ1 (never played EQ2). However, it's important to define what we mean by &quot;easy&quot;/&quot;hard&quot; vs. &quot;challenging&quot; in this case.<br />
<br />
For example, in 1999, CR deep inside a dungeon/PoF (/shudder), back when we didn't have Summon Corpse, was both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;challenging&quot;. It challenged your group/raid's skills to retrieve your bodies from the bear pits in Perma when you were naked, but it was also plain hard, time consuming and often frustrating. Staying up until 5am to retrieve your body from Fear was &quot;hard&quot;, but not the kind of &quot;hard&quot; that I personally enjoy.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, many Luclin encounters (keep in mind that I never did high level Luclin encounters, I hear parts of VT were different) were neither particulalrly hard nor challenging, just endurance tests. Mobs with tons of HP and high AC, lots of mod rods on the ground, and so on and so forth. And the time sinks to get to the endgame zones were just time consuming, but otherwise not challenging at the level when you could do them.<br />
<br />
Then there were PoP encounters which were often challenging and involved strategery, but not particularly hard since the cost of failure was very low. The biggest problem in PoP was competition with other guilds for spawns, which, I suppose, is a challenge of sorts.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like to explore and test my solo abilities in different areas (Chardok, The Hole, etc), and my biggest problem with EQ was that LD could be so expensive when you were in a remote zone and couldn't get a rez/summon corpse. I was on an unstable Internet connection for a big chunk of my EQ experience, and I really really didn't like the fact that it limited my choice of zones when I wanted a challenge.<br />
<br />
Now, on the WoW side, there are still challenges, but they are, so far as I have seen so far, not &quot;hard&quot; as defined above. When my Shaman was level 17, he and his level 15 partner, another Shaman, took on a level 19 Elite mob in the Warrens. Since the game is new and our gear is mediocre at best, it was a very close battle and we barely won with one death. In some ways, it was like a mini PoP encounter, with an adrenaline rush from fighting a superior opponent, but without a substantial penalty for dying.<br />
<br />
Of course, there is more to WoW than the minimal death penalty, fast combat and challenging encounters, but I thought I should mention it :)<br />
<br />
It seems to have an overaching design and each part fits into that design, like Java.  Unfortunately I have my doubts about how interesting it is going to be long-term unless PVP turns into something that interests me (which it never has).<br />
<br />
Oh absolutely, the jury is still very much out. For starters, I suspect that the average high level pickup group in WoW will be much worse than it was in EQ, so playing with friends and like-minded people will be not just important for the game to be fun, but mandatory. Another consideration is that I like the EQ AA system, which lets you improve your character in many interesting and subtle ways, whereas I am not sure how I will be improving my character(s) at level 60 aside from gear upgrade.<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks to the anonymous poster for the negative rep bump with no explanation.<br />
<br />
The &quot;explanation&quot; of the negative reputation bump that I received for a post that was ambiguous about the staying power of WoW was:<br />
<br />
Don't be a fanboy for WoW. If you don't know something save some trouble and don't post. It will make you look that much SMRT.<br />
<br />
It happens :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Point taken on easy vs hard.  There are multiple meanings of 'easy'.  In this case I really meant easy to figure out what you are doing; the quest system makes it obvious what you have to do next, for example, instead of having to go to a third party website for a more-or-less accurate walkthrough.  (Note: those who like to be first to solve the quest, EQ is definately your game, go for it.  I have never been first to solve a quest and probably will never be.)<br />
<br />
Any game that wants to be played long term had better not be too easy.  There's going to be grinding involved, it's going to take time, etc.  However, EQ is not structured to encourage much of anything except grinding, and its spawn tables encourage camping certain spots.  This is, IMO, a key difference between EQ and WoW, and also an example of design being reflected in the day to day play.<br />
<br />
Regarding WoW's long-term viability versus EQ - I NEVER approached EQ with the mindset of &quot;what will I be doing in this game five years from now&quot;, five years ago.  Hell, I never thought more than a month or two out until my guild tackled Emperor Ssra/Vex Thal and realized that it was going to be a long haul by the time we all got keyed and farmed VT long enough to gear everyone up.  So I am perfectly willing to cut Blizzard some slack... but with the knowledge that EQ *still* has more stuff in it than I can possibly find time to do, even now, five years after I started my main. <br />
<br />
Oh, and with people comparing EQ and WoW - remember that the vast majority of them are comparing early-game or mid-game WoW with end-game EQ.  Hardly anyone has the patience for playing the lower levels of EQ as they were intended any more, but for those who do, and who go to areas that they did NOT go to when levelling their mains, the experience is much more similar to WoW than you might think, except for some of the UI issues I have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Finally, a note to the negative rep-bumpers - this is a discussion/comparison of EQ and WoW, which is ON topic for this forum.  I haven't bashed EQ here and I won't, nor have I blindly promoted WoW, and I won't, and I don't care enough about your negative rep bumps that I'm going to stop saying what I think, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Had an interesting read through this thread.  Just thought I'd throw in my two cents.<br />
<br />
Biggest difference I see between WoW and EQ is that EQ runs on my PC and WoW doesn't.  Currently there is actually a large minority of people that have bought WoW and cannot play at all or get booted very frequently.  I played EQ a month after release and didn't have this problem.  So looks like, in some ways, Verant had a better then WoW did.  : )<br />
<br />
I just hit 65 in EQ on my shaman and currently grinding out some AA's to get canni5.  Still a lot to do in EQ, and I expect to bounce back and forth between WoW and EQ.  A few months here, a few months there... depending on what is fun.  I don't think they have to be mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
Assuming Blizzard figures out how to not screw people that meet the minimum requirments, have reloaded their OS, the game 3 times, and still can't play.<br />
<br />
Bastards.  : P  I want my new MMORPG fix, the first couple months are always the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Anyone else out there having the same problem as me? Some friends going to WoW, some going to EQ 2, and even among those two groups, they are scattered all over several different servers. I am game to experiment with the new games but I end up being pulled in 6 different directions between the two new games and like 3 servers on each one, that I end up just saying forget it, and go to Wall of Slaughter instead.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Biggest difference I see between WoW and EQ is that EQ runs on my PC and WoW doesn't.<br />
<br />
For me, the biggest difference between WoW and EQ1 is that WoW runs on my laptop PC and EQ1 doesn't, at least not in 80% of the zones that I could do meaningful stuff in. I am sure it has an effect on the way I view things :)<br />
<br />
A few months here, a few months there... depending on what is fun.  I don't think they have to be mutually exclusive.<br />
<br />
That describes my case as well. As soon as I get home for the holidays, I will march to Hate (which I love) and spend 5-6 hours needed to get my newly SoE-enabled Monk to 65 and my Shaman to the 9th spell gem. Never had a  high agro weapon on my Monk before, two-boxing should be much more fun once I can DOT at will :)<br />
<br />
I want my new MMORPG fix, the first couple months are always the best.<br />
<br />
Yes, a big world full of wonders and all that. Not quite as exciting as EQ1 was 5.5 years ago when it was my first online game (2 hours in Meridian 59 don't count), but still.<br />
<br />
By the way, I find it interesting that low level encounters in WoW are paced closer to high level (PoP+) EQ encounters than to the low level EQ game. Fast, furious, have to push the right buttons at the right time, minor death penalty.<br />
<br />
Another interesting thing is that it is surprisingly easy to get used to the pace and the interface. I have a level 18 Shaman on Eonar and I leveled a second Shaman to 12 on Shadowsong in order to be able to play with a friend over the last two nights. The process was very smooth, very fast and felt natural. I didn't die a single time in spite of the fact that I did all but one Tauren quests at the right (&quot;yellow&quot;) level, including dungeons, camps and caster-heavy areas. All of them were new to me since my other Shaman is a Troll. I was really surprised since I am fairly bad at fast paced video games.</div></div><hr />
