<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GuybrushThreepwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys. new poster on the boards, been reading for a long time, keep up the good work.<br />
anyway:<br />
i was wondering if a 56 druid/shaman duo is a good way to go? i hear its a great combo. if so, where should i go? i have heard pod and pon are good. we have tried pon stalkers before. <br />
or maybe with a 52 (or is he 53?) monk. i hear this is also a good combo. <br />
<br />
ramble ramble. any suggestions? druid and monk are my friends, and shaman is myself. we both have maxed out wis with c3, his monk is sir twinklord :P thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
