<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for as many old school pics as possible, ranging from lvl 30 to 50. Hehe Ive been playing since beta 4, but recently lost all of my old pics after installing a new hardrive. Looking for old pics if possible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All my old screenies are long gone since my comp crashed and was reinstalled several times :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cant remember the level I was in that pic but I remember it was right after totemic came out... literally.  I was laughing because I looked like a christmas ornament.  Notice the 2hblunt :) (yeah that is a staff of the observers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe my guild's old website (hasnt been updated since I put up our ezboard) has some really old screenshots. Some good ones of me proudly wearing my full totemic + runed circlet and wielding my staff of observers. :D<br />
<br />
Here's me fighting Meldrath (http://eq.greytower.com/graphics/Meldrath.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whaddya mean old?  Like old-school gear and mobs, or just screenies with Lucling textures turned off?<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">old school everything, fighting king in guk with 2 groups =p. Old school naggy raids where the best tanks used ykesha's(old look) and crafted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, I still think of crafted as new :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had screenshots from the first few months. Me on my old skool Warrior with my proud new LANGSEAX! Thats right i had dual langies.. woot. Large bronze, i had all cept panties. Those were banded :D<br />
<br />
Alas... these screenshots got lost long ago :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Think this is one of the oldest pic's I still have on my puter..pre-RoK..Also the uber Staff of Observers. I never did get the rubicite arms to finish my set =P<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HAHA! That's a great pic Rathelon. Brings back memories for me and my friends grouping up and killing mino's for their axe's. Mino axes were soooo uber then. Use to hit steamfont and go for hours on end grabbing as many as we could to sell them in ec for nice cash. That of course was nearly 2 and half years ago.<br />
<br />
My friend still has pics of old school Hiero Halfheart - my druid and his paladin Solinar and our other partner in crime Donovan. I'll see if I can get the pics and post some of the good stuff=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's a blast from the past circa 1999 - my first Vox raid.  <br />
<br />
http://members.bellatlantic.net/~kuped/VoxFight3.jpg<br />
<br />
Notice the Bronze legs and mixed crafted on the leve 45+ (dead) warrior in the forground.  I think this was before Totemic existed (although that dead ranger might be wearing his quest armor - shrug).  Notice the 6-button pad and the unmoveable onscreen windows.<br />
<br />
But most of all, notice the deadly SMACK I put on that lady (yellow circle in text box) with my uber Gatorsmash Maul  I paid 1000pp for!!! :D<br />
<br />
Ahhhh - memories<br />
<br />
Krup<br />
<br />
P.S.  As I remember it, we lost this one. :(</div></div><hr />
