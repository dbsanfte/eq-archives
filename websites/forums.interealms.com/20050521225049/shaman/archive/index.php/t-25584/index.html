<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After having a chance to purchase some OoW AAs, here are two AAs I consider &quot;must haves&quot;:<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid -  Group Heal. If you don't have your epic, you need have a Group Heal.Being able to save a raid with a well timed MGB HOT is a joyous thing.<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild -    <br />
Cleric dies and you save the day. Incredible addition to our abilities, decent reuse time.<br />
<br />
What other AAs would you recommend to someone purchasing OoW AAs? Improved Heals? Reflexive Mastery? Additional spell gem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For a class with as many different, useful spells as Shaman, I would put the Spell Slot on the &quot;must have&quot; list. But other than that, I suppose if someone wanted to put AA into more damage before more healing, I couldnt argue. Channeling is also a very strong contender for &quot;must have&quot; because it truly turns us into non-stop casting machines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vindictive Spirit. <br />
Um, thats a spell G, not an AA :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I swear I read AAs and spells! :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree Ancestral Aid and CotW are the best aa's we got with oow. I would put Spiritual Channeling as a close 3rd must have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally from a non raider the only &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; to me is the extra spell slot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spiritual Channeling definitely belongs somewhere at the top of the list.  Anything that lets me chain cast every mana-hogging spell I want for three minutes has amazing potential.<br />
<br />
The extra spell gem and CoTW are no-brainers for their utility, but I still dig Resplendent Cure for cleaning my group up during raids. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spritual Channeling for sure. Its great for those AE mana draining mobs for raiding shamans. I loved this especially on Quarm, I can constantly heal my group (5 rangers) np with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1. Spell Slot - even with the new one I still don't have enough!<br />
<br />
2. Origin - ever been bound in a place that isn't easy to get out of and died in a zone on the other side of norrath? (EX: being bound in WW, and dying in NC because of a train, with no rez in sight. Spiritstone and Gate don't help you much there :X)<br />
<br />
3. Call of The Wild - for all those moments when you were just a split second too late on yoppa's or tnarg's after 'tard cleric pulled aggro, and you manage to save the rest of the group by busting your ass.<br />
<br />
4. Spiritual Channeling - near-infinite mana loophole helps in said above situations.<br />
<br />
5. Ancestral Aid - c'mon...do I really need to explain this one?<br />
<br />
everything else seems to be pretty average get-when-you-have-AA-surplus-AAs, stuff that will help you when you have nothing else to spend AAs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would put Spiritual Channeling in first spot, closely followed by Call of the Wild (and I usually value things I can not yet do much much higher then being able to do things I already have better). After that I would probably go for the spell gem, then Ancestral Aid.<br />
<br />
Nothing else really sticks out as a &quot;must have&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Assuming they actually work, crit ticks on HoT spells seems like something of a must have for the &quot;grouping&quot; shaman.  I cast a TON of heal over time spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">spell slot is a convinience, not a &quot;must have &quot; ability<br />
spiritual channeling rocks for raid buffing after wipes<br />
call of the wild is a godsent the three times I needed to use it<br />
ancestral aid - nice, but not effective enough in todays raid environment (GoD, OoW)<br />
AHM3, AHG3 - I get so used to those 6k heals</div></div><hr />

I think Call of the Wild and Ancesrtal Aid help far more in Group situations than raids. That cleric dies in group, what would you do, wait for him to run back? Gate and invis him? Call is a pure Group spell that has mild benefits in raids, maybe, if a Necro didnt manage to FD. <br />
<br />
As for Ancestral Aid, its great for both groups and raids, which puts it into the top 5 for sure. I pop it almost every time it lights up in groups. Practically free healing. Especially with a cleric who knows his shizz and uses his Div Arb regularly instead of &quot;saveing it for an emergency&quot;. In raids, the MGBability of An Aid makes it pretty sweet. Rogues STILL ask me to cast it for the over-cap buffs alone, LOL. <br />
<br />
I would definitely put those 3 in the &quot;must have&quot;, for all shaman, raiders and non-raiders alike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree with this list in this order except origin.  <br />
origin imo is the most worthless aa shaman get.  i place origin next to innate charisma.  the only thing it does is clear up a bag spot because you can dump the spirit stone.  it isn't ment to be a quick single evac aa as it takes 15 seconds to cast (check lucy if you don't beleave me http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5824&amp;source=Live )...the only classes that can really use it for an evac aa are classes that can disc invunerable for a duration longer than the aa takes to cast.  <br />
while this AA is nearly useless for a shaman, i have done WS while playing rangers and used origin to gate out of trouble....damn me agroing the guardian of doomfire =)<br />
<br />
if you want a 5th added to the list i would add in, either healing AAs or buff slot exstension AAs at the bottom of the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are the next 2 i will be getting (well CotW when i hit 70) but to me i still say the most useful is the spell gem.<br />
It always helps me be it solo or group just wish we could have had 2 extra.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What does &quot;must have&quot; mean?<br />
<br />
I think it means that this AA is judged to be the difference between success and failure, in an &quot;out on the edge&quot; situation.  It is an AA that gives you the ability to do something you can't do any other way.  So if you have it you can win; if you don't have it you will probably fail.<br />
<br />
That contrasts with &quot;incredibly useful&quot; AA, which make a strong difference, but not usually a win or lose difference.<br />
<br />
On that basis, I would propose:<br />
<br />
Must Have: <br />
Call of the Wild.  If you can get one cleric back into the fight, who can then divine rezz one more back into the fight, then you will be able to change a marginal event from failure to victory.  There is no other way a shaman can do this:  this is a must have.  It's also a convenient time saver, but that's not what makes it a must have.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling.  If you can pump spells nonstop for four minutes, regardless of mana, then you will be able to change a marginal event from failure to victory.  There is no other way a shaman can do this:  this is a must have.  It's also useful for buffing, but that's not what makes it a must have.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid.  Honorable mention.  If you can restore the health of your whole group with an instant click and then go on to other things, then you will be able to change a marginal event from failure to victory.  This is &quot;honorable mention&quot; in this category because you can also do this with the clicky on epic 1.5.  But it is still in the must-have category because we have no group healing spell.<br />
<br />
Incredibly Useful: <br />
All healing AA<br />
All defensive AA<br />
Extra spell slot<br />
<br />
These all add very significantly to what shaman can already do.  <br />
<br />
With all the healing and defensive AA, a shaman is pretty tough and can get a lot of healing done.  I like them all.  But they are a percentage increase on what we can already do; they are not adding an ability which we could not do any other way.<br />
<br />
I love the 9th spell gem and I'd like to have 12, but what it has taught me is that I just can't keep memmed all the spells I want.  I have to figure out -- and often reconfigure -- two spell sets, and switch between them with the /mem command, on the fly.  Nine slots, swapping 3 gems back and forth, yields 12 spells available.  I could have managed 12 spells with 8 slots, swapping 4 gems, but it would have been slower and more dangerous.  <br />
<br />
Origin I see as a convenience for melees.  No more need to buy gate potions to get out of the dungeon.  I think &quot;needing&quot; it for a shaman is pretty excessive.  I have forgotten to rebind myself when I had set a bind point in Western Wastes, and sure enough I got myself killed with my gear in Ssrae and a naked barb standing in the tunnel at the entrance to Sirens Grotto.  Origin would have been handy then; I wouldn't have been in the embarrassing situation of needing a guild mate to come rescue me.  But the lesson there is for me to recognize that if I forget to reset my bind point after leaving a zone like that, I am liable to need to ask a guild mate to come rescue me again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Call of the Wild is the only &quot;must have&quot;, because it's the only new unique ability.  SC, AA, Origin, Spell slot, everything else is really, really good, but Call of the Wild is the only thing that qualifies as &quot;must have&quot; along the lines of our other &quot;must have&quot;, Cannibalization</div></div><hr />
