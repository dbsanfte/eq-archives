<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If I'm not the main healer in a group, its doubtful I will keep anything besides Q up. Does that make me a bad Shaman? I do not usually ask the healer in group to get my pet, but I have a couple times when he was the only thing standing between us and another mob. <br />
Its unfortunate he did not realize we are included in the &quot;priest&quot; classification, but that does not make someone an imbecile. The only thing I can see that he may be faulted for is not slowing and the poster cannot say for certain that he didn't slow, just that he thinks he didn't.<br />
All in all he doesn't seem like the best Shaman you could ever group with, but man, I've seen worse. My alt is a mid fifties warrior, and he has been grouped with some bad ones. If your going to go to the length of linking a discussion about someone who plays the class really badly, I think you could have found a much better case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only thing I can see that he may be faulted for is not slowing and the poster cannot say for certain that he didn't slow, just that he thinks he didn't.<br />
<br />
Its pretty damn easy to tell if mobs are slowed or not.  At 61 Turgurs is slowing for the full amount of 75%.  Anyone can tell if mobs have been slowed.  If you have a doubt if they have been slowed, they havent.<br />
<br />
And I think this is the worst type of shaman to be stuck with.  Its not as if he doesnt know what he can do as a shaman, its that he doesnt seem to care.  <br />
<br />
I dont very often play main healer in groups, but I always have 2 heals up. Tnargs and Torpor (I dont have Quiscience yet).  Keeping that heal up means that sometimes I have to swap out spells a little more often than someone who doesnt keep up the heal, but I can assure you that no group member has ever died for lack of healing from me even if I am not MH. Does that make me a better shaman than someone that isnt ready to step in and heal?  I would say that I am more ready to deal with the situation should it turn south and that I could be more effective than one that has 2 dots and 2 nukes up if the cleric goes down. Id leave it for others to decide who is better.</div></div><hr />

If I only had a druid as primary healer I'd load at least one (I always have Q and Tnargg's up, but thinking back to 59 before I got Torpor) heal.  Druids are better healers but on a hairy pull their mana dries up fast and if the druid is an alt they might have some aggro control issues with heal.  Keeping another heal up is just common sense, no matter how bad it is.  Then again, I've met shaman who will not heal anyone but themselves because they don't consider themselves healers and don't want to play that role /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I'm not main healer, I keep Tnarg's and Topor up.  Tnarg's is not very efficient, but when the fecal matter hits the rotory impeller, a 1300 pt heal can make a big difference.  If the cleric loses C3 or I'm main healer, Kragg's gets added to the list.  Topor (and I have spell casting reinforcement mastery, so it does 1800) only gets cast on others during down time.  Casters get Tnarg's, and melee's get to wait until Kragg's is worth while if there is time.<br />

If I lose a dog in LDON, we lose another 50hps of damage per mob, if that.  Not a big deal.  And if it's between keeping the dog alive or a group member, then the sacrifice of the dog is worth it.

No matter what I do - soloing, duoing, grouping, raiding, or even tradeskilling (yes yes, I know) I *always* have Quiescence and Tnarg's up. Always.

Was there ANY time in your shaman career that you did not keep a heal up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Was there ANY time in your shaman career that you did not keep a heal up? <br />
twice.<br />
<br />
1) lvl 58 (pre-Kragg era) I was with a rocksolid cleric and a druid who loved healing.  After pleading with them to stop healing me (we are all friends) and them healing me just to spite me, I said screw it and dropped all my heals.<br />
<br />
2) low or mid 50's and raiding ... can't remember what, but it was pretty tame by modern standards.  I was the only shaman on a short epic raid.  I was too low for slow to reliably land and everyone wanted HoS and the works ... dear god, even AGIL.  I spent most of the raid on post res buff duty and buff refresh.  If I took hits and died, I would have welcomed it.<br />
<br />
Other than those, no, I always keep at least one, and about 90% of the time I keep two heals up (HoT and blast).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I keep tnargs and Q up at all times. I wouldn't load Kraggs for love or money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Tnargs, Q, and slow.  Never unmemmed unless I'm naked.  Not haveing Tnargs (or a fast heal of some sort) memmed is putting all quick healing *for yourself* onto another player.

<br />
Hell, if a healing hybrid is in the group (ranger, beastlord) and doesn't have their heal up, I get kinda upset with em.  Once I was sole healer for a LDoN adv cept for a beastlord.  Big fuggin pull happens and I'm dancing all around getting stuff slowed, and keeping folks alive.  There are still like 2 mobs left beating on me and my hps drop below 20%.  I'm running around the room gaining a few more seconds while the group is yelling at the  beastlord to heal me before the last few hps I got go away.  15 seconds go by and the mobs catch me and kill me, the group then wipes.  <br />
<br />
I asked the beastlord why in the hell he didn't heal me.  His answer: I don't keep Chloroblast memmed, it sucks and I'm not a healer.  He woulda got the boot right then if he wasn't needed to finish the adventure.  As it was, he got a pretty good scolding from me and the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Heh, quit taking up for this shaman. That shaman was a total moron or ebayed, it doesn't matter what class had the pleasure of experiencing this persons company. C'mon, whens the last time you didn't mem at least one heal, expected a cleric to heal your canni damage, expected a cleric to heal your pet? <br />
<br />
I've been playing a long time, and I've had clerics/druids take the initiative and heal me or my pet, but I do not expect it and cannot imagine any scenario in the far future where I would expect another healer to use his healing mana in this way(much less insist on it), unless we were extremely overpowered and bored to hell at our camp, even then his mana should be used for nuking, dot'ing or whatever.<br />
<br />
*edited*<br />
As for spells mem'd, maybe I&quot;m a bad player, but I have Q, tnarg, slow, root mem'd at all times. I don't care if I'm in a group of 6 shamans, or 3 shamans and 3 clerics. I will not drop hot, insta heal, slow and some sort of root. Those are my 4 spells I keep up 100 percent of the time and it would have to be very odd circumstance I would ever trade them out for even 15 seconds as a swap slot. I do not like trusting other players for root or instant heals, I might in a solid group but I can't think of many spells more important even in that case. Raids are the only time I might drop one of these spells for cures or somesuch when sitting isn't possible due to aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This highlights the problems shaman face with spell slots.  I just listed four always-up spells, and a fifth almost-always-up.  And none of those spells actually do any DAMAGE, lol.<br />
<br />
I would SO love to see two additional spell gem slots, restricted to buffs only.  Come one, SOE, we get ALT-1 through ALT-8, give us ALT-9 and ALT-0 :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite often in my case.<br />
<br />
Spells more or less perma memmed are<br />
<br />
Quiesence<br />
Canni IV<br />
Gtr Immobilise<br />
Malos<br />
Turgurs<br />
<br />
That gives me 3 'option' slots for which I will usually choose between a  DD (tears or velium strike), Bane,  Ferine Avatar, and Tnargs.  If Im in a group with someone else as main healer I'm likely to drop Tnargs.<br />
<br />
I don't feel naked without a heal: I would feel naked without a root spell memmed so I can oerform shaman cc at a pinch (and I do have VP, but cc at 2minute intervals only doesn't do the job).<br />
<br />
I wouldnt expect the main healer to heal my pet: if needs be I'll just stand by the mob and get slapped a bit while quiessence heals my pet back up.  But then again the cleric I normally group with does keep my pet alive if he has the opportunity to do so.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see Nomadd almost certainly slowed 3 mobs: if he hadn't I'd expect the main healer to have serious aggro problems.  He just expected the druid to do a bit more than he did.  But then I'll start by taking my fellow shaman's side (especially against a druid) unless there's good reason not to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use Tnarg's as a quick heal and I constantly chain cast the Big Q on main tanks and assists as damage absorbers.  This also helps the main healer maintain mana for effectively.<br />
<br />
The Shaman in the referenced post was out of line. Shaman's ARE healers, just not Clerical healers.  I visualize the Shaman as one of those witch doctor healers not a Healer with a Doctorate, Hehe.<br />
<br />
Shaman's should always keep some form of heal up.<br />
There are times when things go bad and the main healer is down for the count and the Shaman suddenly is stuck with the duty of keeping the tanks alive.  Happens occassionally.  <br />
<br />
Heck if nothing else, Its our job to keep the healer alive if he gains agro and needs to be kept alive.  Its our job to protect the main healer when possible in most cases.<br />
<br />
I hate when I hear a Shaman such as described in the Druid's post.  That definately is a bad player and gives us Shamans a bad name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Having read the log carefully: he's a 61 shaman with no torpor.  He should therefore have had Kraggs memmed.<br />
<br />
But if they've just dealt with 3 mobs on a bad pull and hes got to to recast his pet, I'd guess that he's very lom: so as the druid has 45mana maybe a heal isn't such a big deal, and maybe the druid saving the guy's pet would have been a reasonable thing to do.  <br />
<br />
I've not done Miragul's: does the mob list sound like it was there?  If so we have a 5 man group paladin, shaman, druid, 2x mages in a DPS race.  Guessing non of them uber so thats short on dps.  Perhaps the shaman thought the druid wasn't doing enough (backed by the shaman being lom whilst our druid hero is still at 45m after a bad pull).  In which case the shaman may have had Kraggs memmed but wasn't going to admit it.  Perhaps log makes out the shaman is worse than he really is because he doesn't know how to fight his corner in chat.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm grasping at straws here, but I think we ought to explore this from the shaman's point of view before we write him off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I read it carefully also; however, I got a different impression.  The guy clearly stated that Shaman's aren't healers, thus he didn't have any heals memed.  Granted, everyone plays shamans differently, but the guy was taking the position that the Shaman wasn't a healing class.  Yes, we aren't the best healers and are basically 3rd in line behind the Druid as healers.  <br />
<br />
At level 61 he would have Kraggs, Chloroblast and Superior Healing.  I didn't have Torpor either at 61, but used chain casting of Chloroblast.  Wouldn't cast Torpor on tanks due to the negative effects if I had it anyhow.<br />
<br />
At 61, I always kept 2 types of heals memed.  Kraggs and Chloroblast.  Sometimes swapping Chloroblast for Superior Heal depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Not blasting your post CrustyOldShaman, just outlining my position and my impression to the Druid's post.   If the Druid didn't post the chat text of the encounter, then I would have been reluctant to take a position on the matter, but the Shaman basically showed his colors in his reply to the Druid and the Shaman lost respect in my eyes based on his replies.<br />
<br />
I can't really find a defense for the Shaman in this case.<br />

<br />
Thats the point I'm trying to make in my usual inadequate way: we have to look for the defence becuase the prosecution posted their's and we get their selection of the evidence.  Perhaps two lines further in the chat log the shaman expanded on the semantics of who's a priest, who's a healer.<br />
<br />
If these people are in an LDoN adventure he's struggling to regain mana whilst our druid hero is smuggly sat on his butt.<br />
<br />
Our druid hero has - according to his story - got real healing aggro problems.  Hell he's not even sure whether the shaman is slowing them its that bad.  So how is it the shaman's pet gets enough aggro to get killed.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that the druid here is a victim of classy envy - we being the capable class, druids being the dork class (very often at least)?<br />
<br />
How bad could the druid make the shaman look if he wanted to?  One thing that most of us can probably agree on is the druid is not a nice guy - having happily rubbished this shaman so publicly.<br />
<br />
Imagine you are level 61: you have no torpor, no malo, so your slows bounce a fair bit in LDoN.  You have canni V, and no other aas.  You have no FT gear and are struggling for mana.  And the groups MH wants to make you look bad and is deliberately not pulling his weight:  maybe you'd start insisting he healed you.<br />
<br />
All I'm sure about at the moment is that if I was on that server I'd never group with that druid.<br />

<br />
Point taken and well made.<br />
<br />
Yes, there could be more to the story and yes, the Druid's post is slanted to make him look more positive since he made the post.  <br />
<br />
Could quite possibly be more to the story than what was implied in the post.  Sort of a situational problem.  Can't say I haven't been in those types of positions, where my mana was too low to cast heals and I couldn't Canni quick enough.  Could quite possibly be the case here.  Shaman's are a busy class, especially in LDONs.<br />
<br />
The statement of Shaman's not being healers, still sticks in my gut though, hehe.<br />

When I join a group, I automatically assume that I am a backup healer.  What that means to me is that I heal the MH along with throwing spot heals to cover while the MH does CH on the main tanks/melee.  I sure as hell don't expect anyone but myself to heal me if I have cannied, and I escpecially don't expect the MH to heal my pet, lmao.

Agreed.  But if I was lom, had still to summon a new pet whilst the main healer was at 45m wouldn't it make sense to ask him to, especially as he has more efficient healing spells than you?<br />
<br />

If they are reasonably complete it appears that the group - all competent except for our shaman of course - was still pulling while the shaman was oom and at 22pc hitpoints.  If I was there as a main healer, I'd toss that shaman a heal if I was on 45m.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like whatever else we can agree the druid isnt competent.<br />
<br />
Edit: added the following.<br />
<br />
There were 3 mobs, paladin on one, mage pets on 2nd, the 3rd beating on the druid (heroically channellling through being hit).  So who killed the shaman pet?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">but his own text damns him.<br />
<br />
The selected clips from a log edited by a very obnoxious person.  And the 'heal not memmed' quote isnt in it.<br />
<br />
After saying he isn't a priest class and shouldn't have a heal memmed, he states &quot;its a healing/buffing/debuffing class noob&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't see anywhere in the text where he says he hasn't got a heal memmed: just the druid using 'mem a heal ' as an inadequate and taunting response to what may be a reasonable request for a heal.<br />
<br />
So which is it?  Cant have it both ways, either you're a healing class or not.  It doesn't really matter whether you care to call it priest or not, a healing class heals.<br />
<br />
And a main healer ought to heal a oom shaman who's at 22pc, particularly one without torpor, who still has a pet to recast.  But I suspect this main healer refused to heal the shaman under any circumstances.<br />
<br />
He agrees he's a healing class and never claims not to be.  He doesnn't realise shamans are grouped with druids and clerics under the general title 'priest class' and thats all.<br />
<br />
Maybe I could see giving the benefit of the doubt if he wasn't being self-contradictory and insulting, but after reading even a few lines, I simply cannot.<br />
<br />
Thats one of my points: you get a very few lines - selected snippets chosen by what seems beyond any doubt a pretty nasty person.<br />
<br />
In the text you see the shaman has lost his temper.  You can't see why?<br />
<br />
But now lets look at what the druid writes:<br />
<br />
Ok about 20 minutes before this clipped conversation takes place we get a 3 pull. I want a couple seconds before blast healing the paly and immediately getting aggro on the other two. the mages throw there pets on one of the mobs and so i only have one hitting me now. I channel a heal through to myself.... twice. No one has healed the tank yet, as i was getting beat on by the mobs. tank kills the first, and i blast then CH the tank. I then top up the mages life.<br />
<br />
So the main healer has had to channel a heal through to herself twice.  Yet no one has healed the tank yet - so how did the main healer get aggro in the first place?<br />
<br />
Then he asks for new swords since &quot;the MH didn't heal my pet&quot;<br />
I told him &quot;if you wanted him healed that badly you should have healed him yourself&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd still like to know who killed the shaman's pet because according to the druid's account we have 3 mobs:<br />
<br />
Mob (a) is fighting the paladin.  Can a shaman pet out taunt a paladin?<br />
<br />
Mob (b) has two mage pets on it.  Mage pets &gt;&gt; shaman pet surely.<br />
<br />
Mob(c) is beating on the druid.<br />
<br />
Its only now we get:<br />
<br />
He then says &quot;i don't keep heals memmed unless im MH&quot;<br />
<br />
But this line isnt in the logs.  Its typed in by the druid.  she couldn't find it in those logs she's cut and pasted together.<br />
<br />
But now we get the real sickener:<br />
<br />
Ok to continue. Im at 40ish mana from the adds and the beating i took. The shammy Canni's his life down to 22%. then says &quot;grianne heal plz&quot; At this point im telling Anjamar the story over the phone and hoping to hell that this shammy gets low life aggro so i can let his non-healing ass die. ok and heres some of the conversation (you really have to see it to believe it... it just got stupider and stupider -- and he is still at 22% life, because im not healing him any)<br />
<br />
In a adventure, on the phone, taking the piss when your main healer and you are trying to get your own party member killed.  Am I truly the only one here who finds that sickening?</div></div><hr />

(You know, the old &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot; saying, regardless of how much fun it might be.)<br />
<br />
The postings seem way too one-sided to be the entire truth.  I'm just glad neither one are on D-Ro.  We have our fair share as it is.<br />
<br />
For all we know the shaman might have been trying to screw with the druid for not doing his job, but it backfired on him through these boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I applaude your position as devil's advocate and agree that a cut-n-paste view of a conversation isn't going to show everything, I disagree with you on one point 100%. Any shaman that is going to canni down to that much and NOT heal themselves ought to be shot. I don't blame that healer. I NEVER expect a heal unless I've got heavy agro...period. Only time I ever canni'd myself that low before canni5, was in utterly safe areas and I always healed myself. Sometimes I'd get a heal, but I'd always explain what I was doing and that it's ok, I'd heal myself. But I wouldn't argue if they insisted and they were at full mana. My canni damage is my problem...not that healers. Good shaman take responsibility for themselves, not expecting others to use their mana on us because we're too lazy to do it ourselves. Just from this alone, I deem the shaman a moron. I don't care if he doesn't have torpor or isn't high enough to have quiess...his healing is his own responsiblity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Crusty,<br />
<br />
Good job playing devil's advocate. To take it a bit further, lets say the shaman was doing his job:<br />
<br />
3 Mobs in camp so 3 malo's, 3 slows, 3 cripples (possibly) to prepare the mobs since mage ... or is it mages ... are jumping on one for CC and Tank on another and 3rd is beating on druid.<br />
<br />
Question here for both druid and shaman - why hasn't anyone (druid or shaman) rooted the one beating on druid? Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Given the scenario, the timelines are not right. If the shaman has canni'd down to 22% health with 3 mobs in camp someone pulled way to freaking early. This shaman is chewing every part of his body to get mana to do his job ... at least that is the presumption.<br />
<br />
Why? Did shaman just renew buffs before the pull, or get a few malo/slow resists or (as the druid would have us believe) just being stupid and can't play their class.<br />
<br />
I think we have all been in groups where a person can't play their class worth squat. Perhaps this shaman was that person. Then again, we have all been in groups where a person has no idea what other classes can do even though they have a decent handle on their own class. Perhaps this druid is that person. Maybe the druid just thinks the shaman was sitting around because the druid has no idea what it is a shaman actually does and truely no idea how expensive mana wise it is for a shaman to do their job.<br />
<br />
Last point, how the paly wasn't contributing to the healing, even as main tank, says a lot about the versatility of the group as well. Paly's I group with, even in the primary role of MT, know how to keep an eye on the group and add that quick heal or group heal when the fit hits the shan.<br />
<br />
Yeah, this ain't too coherent, but just some quick thoughts after reading this whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Crusty wasn't referring to you. Was referring to the Shaman in the original post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Bazlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Agreed.  But if I was lom, had still to summon a new pet whilst the main healer was at 45m wouldn't it make sense to ask him to, especially as he has more efficient healing spells than you?<br />
<br />
Efficiency is not the issue here.  If I am cannied myself down to 20% due to slows and buffs, then by all means, the MH should heal me.  But in the situation in question, unless I misunderstood, the shammy was dotting, which, in my experience, is a luxury.  If you are casting dots and nukes to high heaven and thereby are lom, then it's your own fault.<br />
<br />
In this case why is it unreasonable to ask the main healer to do the same?<br />
<br />
Because the MH is healing the tanks/melee.  I would rather have a backup healer take pet healing duty then have my MH worry about some stupid pet that shouldn't be tanking in the first place.  That is, unless it is one of those lovely pet tanking necro groups with no melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If one of those mage pets is an earth pet, or if someone rooted the mob, a rooted mob will almost always beat on a shaman pet before a mage pet... the wolf generally gets in closer.<br />
<br />
That said, I never count on others to heal my own canni damage and pet.</div></div><hr />

Besides focus items affect Tnags but not Kraggs as its a CH.  Once I hit 62 I never even gave Kraggs a second look.  I'ld be more apt to drop a tropor on a person then a Kraggs.  Least I could cast it and canni back the mana before I could get a kraggs off.  <br />
<br />
Back on topic I cring every time I see a shaman sitting while they med back up becuase they are OOM at 40+.  CRY...  And I could just not make my self look at that poor clueless shaman as that is what he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Personally, I stick with first impressions.  And my first impression that mister &quot;not a priest class&quot; is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Since so many others are ripping on the druid, let's examine some of the more colorful quips from the defendant.<br />
<br />
&quot;BTW noob I am a shaman not a priest&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a healing / buffing / debuffing class noob&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah.  But let's be fair.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, we can assume this individual doesn't have Stoicism, Torpor or Quiscience.  The latter two are expensive.  The former can be quested, but only if he has the LoY expansion (and he may not have it).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, with two other toons that are at least sixty, it can't be that hard to save up for one of the higher healing spells.  And what happens if by some bizarre freak accident the MH dies?  That's why I always keep a mem healed.  I've only been playing regularly since May and I can't count the times I've seen a cleric or druid get aggro and start running around in circles panicking.  But when that happens, I usually root the mob then heal the MH after I toss a quick heal onto the MT and/or MA to keep them going.  This is common sense.<br />
<br />
So I'm going to go out on a limb and say this person is a moron.  A crappy heal is better than no heal.  Yes, the druid could have been more diplomatic.  But having grouped with many idiot shamans (I'm not slowing or buffing or healing or any of that, I'm meleeing) (I don't like casting canni to regen mana that spell sucks) (brb I need to get a fresh clarity) I can definitely empathize.<br />
<br />
And I think The Poster Formerly Known as Faern is cool.</div></div><hr />

also I never ask for nor do I expect a heal from others unless I am tanking. why the **** would you ask another class for a heal when you just canni'd down? thats just retarded to expect the healer who just blew a ton of mana to heal your now fm ass up. grats dumbass dragging out downtime even longer than it needs to be.</div></div><hr />
