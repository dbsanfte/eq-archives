<br />
I've been following some of the dueling / PvP threads, and I see people talk about &quot;jousting&quot;, which I believe is where you run towards someone hit them and then run past them.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why this is a better tactic that just standing and hitting people. Especially for chars with duel wield and multiple attack.<br />
<br />
The only advantage that I can see is that you can hit someone and then get out of spell range, but I'm sure there must be more to it than just this...<br />
<br />
I'm sure some my more educated brothers (and sisters) will educate me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Guznuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With the EQ enginge you'll find that as a melee using fast one handers it's harder to accumulate damage on a target. This is mainly because of stuff like lag in a connection or levitation or whatever. Simply put, it's pretty easy to evade melees as a caster in pvp. <br />
<br />
Jousting with a large two hander however should pack a nice punch when you make a pass - which is pretty easy to do. <br />
<br />
Enginen involvement aside, it's also pretty important in pvp for things to happen fast. With faster one handers you're slowly wearing the target down and giving him time to plan/think. If you're smashing him up 20% health a time he's going to have to think much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, bascially, it's where they run off so you have a harder time doing dmg to them.. <br />
<br />
Then they run in and hit attack as they pass. This allows slow weapons, such as Weighted Axe to reset, as well as keep them out of your range. <br />
<br />
It's most effective when the target is Engfuled/Snared/Rooted. <br />
<br />
It doesn't always work though. Let's say you have my warrior rooted and are jousting me with a 30 dmg Axe..  All the warrior has to do is wait for you to run in and hit attack when you get close. If they are swining a higher dmg weapon, you aren't gaining any advantage by jousting. <br />
<br />
A SK with a 24-28 Dmg 2HS snared my Pally and proceeded to attempt to joust.. <br />
<br />
Unluckily for him, my Axe did more dmg. So all I did was stand in place, watch him, and swing when he got near. The time it took for him to stop, turn around and come back in on me, gave me plenty of time for me to heal up. <br />
<br />
As for a shammy.. You will want to avoid getting jousted if possible, if they get you snared/rooted just dot them as they run in.. Some people don't run out of spell range when jousting. <br />
<br />
It's a matter of timing, mainly..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are better than your opponent at jousting, you will be able to land hits on him while he gets the 'Your target is too far away' message.<br />
<br />
There are different styles of jousting in pvp. When playing my melee alts, I usually play it defensive. I run toward my opponent, and just before i get within range of him i reverse and backpedal. This usually has the effect of him hitting his attack button and hitting nothing but air. I then run up to him and smack him over the head while he is waiting for his weapon to recycle. <br />
<br />
Whether you should play it offensive or defensive depends what class you are and what your opposition is. If youre playing a warrior you should go as offensive as possible when meeting other melees. You have more hps and ac than them, while they might have spells. You want to give them as little time as possible to use those spells against you.<br />
<br />
Like mentioned in above posts, the point of jousting is primarily to compensate for the fact that it is hard to stick to PC characters in pvp due to the subpar engine that EQ is based on. Add in damage shields, and using 1handers just isnt a viable option.<br />

If you are only going to connect a few times, make sure they hurt.</div></div><hr />
