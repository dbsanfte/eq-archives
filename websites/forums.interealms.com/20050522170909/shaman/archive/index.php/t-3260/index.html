<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been curious about this for quite a while, so figured I would ask. <br />
<br />
When I play everquest, I play the game. I don't listen to music on CD. I don't listen to the radio. I don't watch TV or have it playing in the background. When i play i have the sound turned on so I can hear what is going on in game, from the footsteps to howls of the dogs. Am I the only one or do any of you play with sound on too?<br />
<br />
I can still remember in the old days in Sol B when I could tell when a Kobold was close to us and which direction it was from us based on the sound. I will always treasure those sorts of memories of the old days hehe. Anyhow, just curious :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a barbarian warrior friend though that has an amazing ability to &quot;track&quot; whatever we're looking for based on the sounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to, but not much anymore.<br />
<br />
My good speakers went kerplowie... now my speakers sound like<br />
<br />
Scrrittchhhhh scriiitchhhhhh scritttchhhhhhhh all the time, cause they suck.. so maybe when I get decent speakers. For now its usually the radio/cd's going in the background.<br />
<br />
I like the EQ music and sounds, just need decent speakers (and can't use headphones, cause... I dunno why, just can't :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Surround sound or headphones, depending on which PC I'm sitting at.  The headphones are the nice &quot;block out the rest of the world&quot; kind that makes it even more immersive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sound on EQ up so I can hear everything, cept for when the girlie is sleeping, then it's up just enough I can barely hear what's going on.  2 desktop speakers in front of my monitor help in that respect.<br />
<br />
Cartoon Network is always on also, and when Courage the Cowardly Dog comes on, TV goes up so I can hear it over the canni sounds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I keep the sound up (music down) for that very reason to hear mobs near/attacking.   I do keep a small tv near and reading material, so I don't stare at the comp screen a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to until the sound got broke and all I got was screeches and reverb so now I play it without any sound.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always have the EQ sound loud enough that I can her what's going on, although I do ofeten have music playing at the same time. Some zones seem to have broken sound though - I never get sound in Maiden's Eye for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Depends what I am doing.  I normally have the hi-fi going in the background.  Grinding xp I have the sound up as I tend to spend a lot of the time looking at a different computer screen reading forums so like to have the sound to be help me judge when to cast spells.  Grouping I also tend to have the sound just so that I can hear what is going on.  Raids I tend to have the sound either right down or off.  Too much noise with all those other people casting spells, especially when there are a few shaman on the raid and we are all spamming canni :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hiho,<br />
<br />
on most XP grind groups I hear music and often watch a movie.<br />
On raids where it is mostly staying in 1 camp and doing a routine job I do the same, while on others (like for example Chardok Royals) I focus on the game.<br />

<br />
I added the neat file nosound.txt to my eq directory a long time ago and haven't ever looked back. I was over at a friends house a little while ago and was amazed to hear eq sounds coming from his speakers. I just thought everyone turned off the sounds I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">eq sounds suck, mp3s are much better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I usually use headphones - I like to immerse myself into the game and it has the added benefit of blocking out my wife's voice. If she's not home, I'll crank up the desktop speakers just to get more freedom of movement.<br />
<br />
TV or stereo? No way, I'd lose track of myself if I did that. Sometimes, during a really boring camp or xp grind, I'll break out some comic books or a novel to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I need the EQ sounds around me.  I really need to know if I am getting whacked.  Other than that, I agree with the sound of Canni...nerve wracking!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I watch TV or listen to my stereo. But my sound in EQ has been fubar'd for over a year now and I have little patience to try and fix it now *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I usually play EQ with headphones on and I have all the features on my card turned on (I can actually hear when mobs spawn when they are beyond a hill, behind a wall, or in a couple spots even accross the zone).  I've grown really dependant on the sound to guide me (I use it like tracking) and having a CD playing or whatever cuts into my ability to tune into EQ.  Its like losing one of your senses.  I only put the tv on if I med and even then I only have the phones half off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cann is the reason I had to turn sounds off...I like the sounds, but cann always sounds like a bonb went off beside me if I have them turned up enough to hear other sounds.<br />
<br />
TV or MP3s normally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I usually dual box and have a 3rd machine for looking up allak or maps.  So I think I'm too deeply immersed to watch a movie or listen to music while playing EQ :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've got the sounds to EQ on low, Winamp on high. (13+ hour playlist), TV with DVD player playing some movie I've seen way too many times, while painting my Warhammer mini's during the downtime in camping the Emp in Seb :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I haven't turned on sound in EQ for over a year and a half...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've been playing w/o sound for a long time ... the dog howling, the canni sound, etc ... just drove me nuts ... <br />
<br />
Sometimes I listen to MP3's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I usually have the TV on with a movie or some other random background noise when I am playing.  Sometimes music.<br />
<br />
The only time I turn on EQ music is when I am in Rivervale.  That is really the only good music in the whole game. The sounds and music are off 99% of the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am the same way as Aktunka - no radio, no TV, none of my own music playing, I'm not reading a book, nothing.  The only outside distraction might be if I'm on the laptop looking up something on Allakhazam or EQAtlas while I'm playing, and that's really part of playing.<br />
<br />
I play a lot with a wizard friend and god knows what he's doing most of the time.  If we want to move to a new location we have to jump up and down to get his attention first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I play with the sound on...strangly I kinda like it.  I like hearing when a mob is near.  I dont even have a TV in the room that I play in.  Sometime I will listen to music, but generally only in exp groups.  I am afraid that if I dont pay attention that I will pull too many mobs or an extra flurry in tov or something and get people killed.  So, I pretty much always just focus on the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have the sound on at all times, but turned way down low most of the time.  Canni drives me nuts too.<br />
<br />
There are situations where I turn the sound up quite a bit.  One notable situation is in Aaryonar fights, where you can HEAR the AE going off.  Much better than relying upon someone calling it out, I can be running out as soon as I hear that sound.  There are a few other situations like that, where the sound provides critical clues, but other than that I leave it just barely audible.<br />
<br />
And the TV goes on for baseball games, and the music plays via Winamp about half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Make it a poll - please!<br />
<br />
hehe - i can't weed out the posts agreeing with the initial post - &quot;play with all sounds on&quot;  from all the variations of &quot;EQ doesn't hold my interest&quot; and &quot;my sound sucks anyway, so I turn it off&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the sound on my speakers GREATLY irritates my wife, and I got used to playing in silence a long time ago.  With Velious I had to go to th nosound.txt abd I haven't turned it off sicne upgrading in anticipation of Luclin.  I think I will break out the headphones and try the sound for a while, now that my computer should be able to handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I do a little bit of everything. Some Times I'll watch a Baseball game, listen to music, talk on the phone or read a book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">EQ sounds off, radio or TV on depending on whats on TV.  I never really played with sounds have only heard like 2-3 dings in my EQ career *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I play with EQ sounds on low.  Like everyone else, the Canni sound over and over and over drives me mad.<br />
<br />
I usually listen to shoutcast or mp3s on my other computer.<br />
<br />
The only time I turn the volume up is when I go afk, then I can hear if there is fighting cause I turn the volume all the way up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I spend about 80% of my eq time with at least 2 eq's running on the main pc, and 1 eq running on backup pc.  Backup pc has no speakers.  Main pc can't run 2 eqw's with sound.   When that's the case I listen to mp3's.  The 20% of the time i'm not 3-box'n I have normal sounds.  I really do like the sounds, and miss it while i'm 3-box'n.  Definitely adds to the fun level of the game for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'd love to play with the sound up, but I just can't tolerate the noise of Cannibalize anymore.  <br />
<br />
If they would please mute it, or change the sound or something, I'd be delighted to turn my sound back up.  It definitely helps.<br />
<br />
The dog howling sucks too.  /pet shut up would nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I play MP3's while I play, since I absolutely hate the canni sound. If I'm soloing, I'll be reading a good book or magazine &lt;/cheer Maxim!&gt; in the downtime, but if I'm playing in a group I'm completely focused on the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To all the people that listen to MP3s, are you running EQ in a window and just swapping in and out or do you use a plugin like EQAmp?</div></div><hr />

I have to play with the EQ sound turned way down, the sound of cannabalize gets on my last nerve. <br />

<br />
Rofl,  I know what u mean.  I can't stand it anymore so I try to tune it out, and I grab a mod rod from mages whenever I can.<br />
<br />
New /petition, please remove sound from cannibalize spells!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">With the release of Luclin, I was forced to economize my EQ experience, just to be able to log on.<br />
<br />
No sound...lags me<br />
No particles...lags me<br />
No luclin models...lags me<br />
No velious graphics...lags me<br />
No looking up from the ground...lags me<br />
<br />
Lack of sound does hurt my ability to play...lots of audio information that helps tremendously. I remember being level 20, and tracking the glacier bear through the caves by listening to the sound of his growl.<br />
<br />
But, it is nice to not have to listen to myself cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">No sound for me, I would use it but with Luclin textures installed I blue screen if I have my sound turned on in EQ and I dont want to take the time to redownload luclin patches. /Shrug, I dont miss cann hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I always have sound on, but sometimes the sounds are mixed with MP3s. Sometimes I like listening to just the virtual wind across the tundra, but it's also fun to get synchronicities with EQ and the random playlist. <br />
<br />
One in particular I'll remember for a long time was when my guild was in Sky on whatever island is above the bee island. We didn't have enough people yet, or everything was dead, or something, and so we were watching the guild below fight the bees with our telescopes and bound sight. Just as they wiped out and began CR, Frank Sinatra's &quot;My Way&quot; started to play (&quot;And now, the end is near; and so I face the final curtain...o/~).<br />
<br />
Brought a tear to me eye, it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Hehe thanks guys. At least I don't feel like such a freak anymore lol =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">my TV is on 100% of the time I play.<br />
<br />
Other than that, if I get to pull PoH, PoF, or (never happened yet) PoG, I'm on some serious 80's heavy metal music trip, usually loud enough to make neighbours join in the headbanging and incidentally hitting their head against the wall directly next to my room... or so i think.<br />
<br />
That sentence is fugly but I guess you'll understand.<br />
<br />
Or i watch pr0n on the 2nd pc, in case i'm not the puller and thus terribly bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I have all sound pretty much off in game.  I used to have it on so I could hear HG sneaking up on me but since I am no longer concerned with them I just listen to MP3s.<br />
