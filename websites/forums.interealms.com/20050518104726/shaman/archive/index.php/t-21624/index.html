<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing a bit of grouping today in BoT and was trying to group buff with the usual stuff, Billy, Focus, Sta etc and was only getting the message that they were landing on me, so a bit curious, I asked the group if they were getting the buffs....of course they werent and I got a tad bit curious, so I camped, came back and tried again, still not getting them....this happening to anyone else or is it just me?<br />
Oh yeah even tried /tgb outside of group and turned it off when I was in the group too...sigh I hate patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happens a lot now and it's not due to the most recent patch, been happening on and off since the dx9 patch. It can happen based on location or if you are on a horse or other junk. I usually dismount and that solves it but it can be location dependent as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zoning fixes this as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only place I have seen it happen to me is in BoT.  I normally stand in the middle of my group and cast on myself to make sure everyone gets hit, but now I target someone and cast on them for it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont target yourself when casting the group buffs.  Ive started targeted a different group member and I havent had any problems with it yet.  Although I experienced it several times while casting group buffs on myself.<br />

Thanks, I'll try that.  Happened to me on Sol Ro raid the other day when I was the only shaman.  Periodically throughout the raid I was getting way too many buff requests for stuff that was less than an hour old  (70% extended buffs w/ 8th shawl &amp; SCRM).  One or two were idiots who clicked off Focus (or didn't click off Shield of Maelin).  But after looking at the rest of them, 2 out of 4 groups completely missed some of the group buffs I KNEW I cast at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Yet today I had no problems or complaints, though there was another shaman present, so maybe they just pestered Elder Kariynu. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Yup /random is bugged too, due to mounts. Dismount before you roll.<br />
<br />
Also I occasionally had some spells appear to not land on the mob today; no message. When I'd dismount and try again it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

90% of the time doesn't show the yawn messages and stuff, but at least it always shows the resist message.</div></div><hr />
