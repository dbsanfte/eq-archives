<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dakirra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit level 63 recently and can'y believe the cost of spells. Getting the SP's for turn-in isn't that heard, but once I hit 65 I'll need runes, and those are very rare drops.  50k for Fo7. How can I afford this? Where do people get this kind of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dunno I was poor till they upped Ornate drops and I sold a few items.  Im no longer poor but im not rich.   Maybe offer your services to or join a raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got mine from LDON, both from cash splits from adventures and from selling dropped items and research items in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I paid somewhere around 130k for all my 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Made my money primarly from trade skills. Smithing mostly, selling stuff I was making from skill ups. Acrylia armour, Tae Ew stuff, Sickles etc... Only thing is ya need to be patient and willing to spend money to make money. I was able to make enough money to buy all my 65 spells within 2 weeks. I did pretty good though, maybe 120k for all the spells.<br />
<br />
Another way to make money is vendor farming. I used to do it a lot at one time and made some good coin from it. I have one guildmate who does it a lot and has really become knowldegable on what items people commonly sell on vendors that sell for a lot more in bazaar. He's a warrior and has bought all his ornate pieces except the BP (which he has the coin for, just can'f find one for sale) and one other piece, can't remember which. He has the legs though and that costed him over 100k. All his money is from vendor farming.<br />
<br />
Ways of making good money is out there, just gotta be patient and willing to do it. ;)</div></div><hr />
