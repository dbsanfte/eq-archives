<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've searched and couldn't find the answer. Can an Innoruuk Troll get Katta Faction to do the &quot;Amulet of the Grey Wastes&quot; quest? I have 3 shissar organs, from killing the Taskmaster in Echo.I am level 50, almost 51. I have killed a few Seru guards in Marus Seru, not many. Also had a couple groupings in Tenebrous Mountains killing some Vampires, again not alot. Any help would be appreciated, Thank you..</div></div><hr />

You can get this faction killing in seru and i think coterie but it may take a while to get non-kos. However, once you do get non-kos you can just ask Drenic about snake people and you get a free faction boost with the magus. You may even be able to do this by harmonying Drenic and then repeating the phrase, but watch out if he aggros because he will nuke you dead.</div></div><hr />
