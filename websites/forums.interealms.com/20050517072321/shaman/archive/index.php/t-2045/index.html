<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen people mention a few things about horses, was just wondering if someone could post all the details here :)<br />
<br />
what all do horses allow you do to, some people have implied you can meditate on your horse while moving around, is that the case?   if anyone from a pvp server has info on what horses do in pvp please post about that too.. i've heard a couple people on sullon mention people usuing horse exploits, and I'd liek to know what they are so I can avoid getting killed by someone with a horse (dont have one myself)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">one of the benefits on a horse is if you are not in combat you are considering &quot;sitting&quot;.  In this case you get the benefit of mana regeneration without the agro aspect. You do not regen health any faster however.  <br />
<br />
There are several flaws about horses.  One, they drown in water and poof.  secondly, invis is still bugged on a horse, and thirdly, Levitate is whacked where you lose the floating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Benefits -<br />
<br />
When on Horseback, you are sitting, Hence, you are medding.<br />
But only when NOT casting and NOT Meleeing.. when you are Idle, you are medding (Quadding Wizards LOVE this)<br />
<br />
Endless Weight Allowance (Need to carry 80K PP somewhere... no problem)<br />
<br />
Can be fast as all get out if you buy an expensive one.<br />
<br />
Limited Safefall capacity (like 50 or so)<br />
<br />
Downsides -<br />
<br />
The can drown and they do bug lev and invis.<br />
<br />
Warguren<br />
Torv Server</div></div><hr />

I'd have to disagree. My shaman doesn't yet have a horse but my enchanter does. My experience is that you med when on a horse even when casting. For example when doing vials of mana for my shaman to make wu's with I was able to cast the spell 25 times at 200 mana a pop for a total of 5k mana spent. Now my enchanter does has pretty good gear but he's no where near that much mana and even with c2 he can't regen an extra 1500mana in that time unless he was meding while on the horse.</div></div><hr />
