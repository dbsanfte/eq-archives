<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, but I wish I would have saved one more point and got that instead of rabid bear for the class title.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have some friends who have it and they say it's really nice.  However, i don't plan on getting it till alot later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">great for bsts and necros and mages, until our pets become much stronger I don't think any pet AAs are worth the points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I plan on getting it after SCRM.... that will get me my class title.<br />
<br />
I'm 4 points from SCRM, just got SCR3 this weekend.<br />
<br />
I adore dogdog. I take him everywhere I can. I just can't take him to anywhere there are AEing mobs due to his automatic aggro.... like ToV or the plate cycle in Kael, etc. When I'm slowing buffing and healing, I don't have the time to mash /pet back off<br />
<br />
So for me, I look forward to bringing dogdog to ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And I hate it.<br />
<br />
It isnt a toggle. Like pet guard here. It is a one time order.<br />
<br />
So Before every pull you would need to hit it. But the problem is when you hit it. He stops attacking the one that is still in camp. <br />
<br />
Since I chain pull It ends up being a bigger pain in the ass than to just guard pet and if smacked on pull tell him to back off.<br />

Snoww Silverhammer Bashy bear.. E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the nice features of /pet hold is the fact that it acts as a backoff AND hold -- no more pounding /pet back off while a mob goes aoe on your pet.<br />
<br />
One note on usage, once you issue a /pet attack your pet will be in kill-whatever-aggroed-you mode until you explicitly /pet hold again.  I had hoped that you would not need to explicitly issue a /pet hold command after each battle to get him back to a tranquil state, but that's how the functionality was implemented.  Because of this, I have a hotkey that is:<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet follow or /pet sit<br />
<br />
that I press after every battle so my pet doesn't go running off in search of other mobs to beat on that may be aggro on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have it, It failrly useful when soloing, can pull can not have to worry about dog running after a mob that smacks while u pull or casts on u.  But its not an agro wipe, so for example if ure pet was hitting something b4, u use pet hold and try to sic it on a different mob, it wont listen it will go after the first mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hukt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To make an gimp aggro wipe with pet hold make a hot key that says pet hold  ..... pet back off .... pet hold this will back pet off and has him ready for next target though it does still have the first in aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">... and have yet to get pet discipline.<br />
<br />
I plan to save up 29 aa... then get some stat bonuses...<br />
<br />
then finally pet hold.<br />
<br />
So mebbe when I have 459aa I will finally get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">403aa.....<br />
<br />
we could start a discussion on who has the most... that is quite a few AA's, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Crikey!<br />
403 AA!<br />
Ok mudcrush,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mudcrush,<br />
<br />
Can I borrow 100 aa points or so? I promise i'll pay them back eventuall =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are times I pull multiple low level mobs (for faction or farming), like skeletons in Kurns or orcs in Crystal Caverns. Pet hold would be useful in that situation, far better than pounding &quot;/pet back off&quot; while rounding up mobs. But not more useful than other AA abilities.</div></div><hr />
