The VP revamp will still require a key.  If you have the old key, you only need complete one additional step to upgrade to the new key.  I believe there is also a new path in place to get the new key from scratch as well.  The intended level of VP post-revamp is elemental level.<br />
<br />
The zone is an elemental level raid zone, primarily. The quest for the new key involves single group encounters.  If you have the old key already, there is a single raid you can do to upgrade that to the new key.<br />

Your choice is start from scratch on the new key, with single group content, or get a raid to get 1 item to upgrade the current key.<br />
<br />
What they should have done is just left it, and created a NEW zone, and called it  VP2, and said &quot;single group keyable&quot;. At any rate, just further proof that you cannot make anyone happy in this game. Within 3 posts of each other, a raider is whining and a non-raider is whining, LOL. <br />

I dunno blazz, just cause its another zone for people to get good gear from, doesnt speak anything at all about the mobs and how hard they will be.<br />
<br />
Frankly im inclinded to agree. I see this becoming another zone for their target base of players. Raiders. They are worried about people leaving and need to find more places for them to explore.<br />
<br />
Obviously we wont know till its revamped and live, but im not hopeful about it being 1 group doable.</div></div><hr />

Elemental level raiding does not include casual players of any level.  Sure, some may get the chance to tag along, but it is hardly designed for them.  But IMO, VP was hardly for casual players either.  Farming Trak for your Guild usually means your not that casual the way I see it.  It looks like SOE took an underutilized raiding zone and is trying to make use of it.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can bet your arse that mobs in here will mitigate the crap outta slow and make another zone for us the third-wheel-syndrome :(<br />

Ummm, either dis is gonna be by far da worse risk vs reward ever, or dey betta be movin da &quot;old&quot; drops ta trash mobs anda addin new loot tables fer da dragons.<br />
Cuz elemental lvl rewards dis stuff is not, heck, outside of a few unquie items cuz of der effect, everything dat drops in da zone been trash since Vel, da main reason it is always empty, not cuz da key quest was too hard.<br />
As to da havin ta do a raid if ya are already keyed, it think it is cuz der is a reward dey mentioned fer folks wit da key already, so I guess dat is how ya would earn ya reward fer havin dun da key the old way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is as close to a casual guild as you get but since people in it have been playing for ages they have managed to collect enough stuff and AAs as to just recently be able to actually kill dragons in VP.<br />
<br />
Now this zone will be completely off-limits to us.<br />
<br />
It seems like there is a TON of uber raid encounters to do in GoD yet SOE feels its neccessary to convert an old zone to yet another uber zone. It just makes no sense to me at all.<br />
<br />
One thing is adding new uber-only-zones but taking old casual-65 &quot;raid&quot; zones and converting them to uber-only is beyond stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Used to be a nightmare to get people to go VP as certain classes different have the keys. At least with this revamp and hopefully some added loot as well as the old loot, it could be ok.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I heard somewhere (might be on this thread, didn't bother to look) that it will be raid content for elemental geared. Could they be trying to prevent a bottleneck in content as more people/guilds are pushing up through the elementals? And since not everyone is satisfied with the current state of GoD?<br />
<br />
This might be an attempt to help placate some of the remaining higher end raiders until OOW goes live. Or it might be trying to help alleviate what they might perceive is some bottlenecking of experience in a certain degree of content.<br />
<br />
In any case, in my current capacity, I doubt I'll ever get to see the new VP....but I don't worry, as I like the places I'm seeing now, and am in no rush for that to change. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think you are all reading too much into it. Hey guess what, Fire and Earth are &quot;elemental level raid zones&quot; you know. <br />
<br />
Wow, talk about jumping to conclusions and whining about things like you KNOW.<br />
<br />
Dont give me any &quot;SOE has a history of . . .&quot; crap either, ok? I dont wanna hear it. <br />
<br />
I read this as a single-group zone with elemental level mobs and loot, with raids and single group content, accessible by anyone who wants to do the quest, no raid required. Why would they make a &quot;raid only&quot; zone and have keys be a single group quest? Come on folks, lets try putting 2 and 2 together and not coming up with 5 for once. <br />
<br />
Guess we will wait to see who is right. Frankly, I just cannot see SOE adding another 100% raid-only zone at this point in their &quot;Cozey to the Customers&quot; type attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just FYI. This new deal where we have to get a raid to get the key upgraded is bull ****. I camped that skelly for 16 hours straight, with no breaks in KC i camped all those other mobs and did every part of that pain in the ass quest to get my key and now i gotta do more to get in a zone i fought tooth and nail to get into to begin with? Im a lil pissed about it. All i know is i sure hope they keep the key quest in place, cause if people do 1 raid and just waltz in there, after is took me so long to get my key, i would be very pissed off. Thats the point of the zone, its supposed to be a pain in the ass to get to. Hence why things like Shaman snare spears drop there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VT key? :p  It has happened before!<br />
<br />
The way I see it is SOE giving players above casual but below hardcore a way to get nifty elemental level gear. I'm thinking it will be easier to get this key (from scratch, or the &quot;last step&quot; raid) than getting elementally flagged.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry too much about it being overrun with hardcore raiders, not after the first few waves of explorers.  Most hardcore raiders are not interested in the elemental zones any more, or their gear, so I'm pretty sure this zone will follow suit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Keyed(Flag) zones are terrible for casual players and casual guilds.  They make it nearly impossible to plan a raid to.  My guild currently has around 70% of its members keyed to VP and ST.  With about 30% keyed to VT.  We raid once a week and twice a week there are optional alliance raids.  You can hardly plan a raid that excludes 30% of your members.<br />
<br />
Motivating people to get keyed can be a double edged sword.  Many times the initial people to get keys become frustrated with the guild not advancing fast enough and move on to more raid oriented guilds.  Some will resent the push to get keyed and others simply won't have the time to be bothered.<br />
<br />
Either way it will initially be a playground for more raid oriented guilds.  After it's farmed sufficiently it will end up as deserted as it is currently.  I'd rather they just open it up as an alternative raid zone.  Since I'm ranting a bit I also wish they'd boost Vox/Naggy and the giants surrounding them and remove the level limits.  Very few people hang around level 52 with PoP experience available.  The level limits served their purpose but are now obsolete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">VT key? :p  It has happened before!<br />
Sorry, VT key requires a raid. Last I checked you cant 1-group Emp Ssra. Used to require 2, since the Orbs didnt really drop off one-groupable mobs DURING Luclin. Now there are a couple Orb droppers that are one-grouped, even duoed.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I fear about. I no longer have the physical key and I won't redo the key just because they forgot this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps its not for the casual player but there is more than just 2 sets of people in EQ, there are hardcore raiders. casual raiders etc... I think this will open up some new elemental gear choices withought all the damn flags wich makes it so a casual raiding guild can get it done. Lets face it a casual raiding guild could take out emp with the games current state and gear available. With the right tactics and maybe a bit of Ssra or VT farming i think guilds should be able to handle some Vp action. <br />
<br />
1 realease comes out and people get all bitchy, what did you expect them to fix the whole game on 1 patch ? there is more than just issues from 1 side we all have things we would like to see fixed so **** and relax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I like it. VP has been completely unutilized since Luclin came out. Which is not surprising as even for a casual raid guild there are many better targets for 3 - 5 groups. Loot like the snare spear or the PE hammer have nothing more but nostalgic value and  even that is supposed to stay on the loot table.<br />
<br />
Zones with elemental quality loot that can be done by small raids on the other hand are very rare outside the elementals though. For myself I am happy that there finally may be a use for my VP key I finished 2 years ago and never used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sounds like a great idea to me.<br />
<br />
Mostly VP is a slum run for a bored crew of heavily geared folks on my server.  I love VP and still go once in while, even though I have everything from there that I would want (including the spear of constriction :) ).  <br />
<br />
To have a chance to do VP when loots actually matter would be very cool.  But I'll miss the one grouping of big dragons that used to obliterate raids. The old VP raids were fun, but sitting around for 3 hours while the pullers were at work wasn't great.  <br />
<br />
They appear to be trying to kill 2 birds with one stone.  Return folks back to the old Norrathian lore (and dragon fighting) that people have said they wanted, and limiting the upgrade to a zone already keyed and isolated.  It would be best, imho, if they upgraded it and simply got rid of the key, but that's not going to happen.  <br />
<br />
I personally don't mind key quests.  I did VP quest way back during Kunark when my guild at the time was never going to do VP.  I just wanted the key, it was a goal of mine.  I like that.  I did most of VT key for the same reason.  The design problem comes when spawns are simply too slow.  There is a balance between making people &quot;work&quot; to feel a sense of accomplishment (good) and making people waste too much freaking time trying to do something in a game (bad).  <br />
<br />
I also hope they can check for /keyring people, because my key is long gone.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many upgrade keys are obtained in this proposed raid?  One a time, or en masse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The zone is way underutilized, I solo in there off and on and I have never seen anyone in there, ever. Doing something that will increase it's usage is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

So your conclusion is that the zone will not have any 1-group content whatsoever, similar to the other &quot;EP Raid zones&quot; like Fire, Earth and Water . . . OH WAIT!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Anyone know what the exact the details of the raid/quests for new key/key upgrade are? To make this a utilized zone for the long term, the steps to get there have to be reasonable.<br />
<br />
My first concern is SOE may handle this like they did the Hate Plane revamp. Tons of work to make an old zone a very good solo, group and raid zone followed by the contintued restriction of only wizards being able to port anyone there. Now you can single port up if you get a port stone (~50-60pp) from Neriak and take it to an NPC in PoT. Better, but still (at a very basic level) stupid only because it is per use restrictive. Not a lot of folks going to keep getting port stones to head to Hate once they have their specific drops from there - regardless of how interesting the content is.<br />
<br />
I mention this as an example of SOE's continued over or under-reaction to setting up conditions that players must meet to get to content. PoHate revamp failed to actually open up the zone effectively for players to willingly make the effort to go there. End result - lot of effort to redesign the zone (and well done, to give them credit) that went unused ... so, in effect, wasted effort for what SOE expected the benefits to be.<br />
<br />
Will VP be the same? Beyond the first surge of folks who make the effort to check it out, how long will this zone be used? If the quest/raids are simply more stupid long term time sinks to get a key for what is 'remedial content' to those who have the ability to easily access it, then the effort at revamp will be one more exercise in SOE futility to introduce 'new' content in the same lame ass fashion whose very nature prevents its use. Other avenues and zones are already accessible to 'elemental level' players who are getting 'elemental level' gear. Why would they, enmasse, work to get to VP if the benefits are not marginally or significantly worth the effort?<br />
<br />
Unless SOE steps beyond their inbred trend to fail at balanced effort, risk and reward for this zone it will, despite the time spent to revamp the zone, simply over the long term fail to actually redeploy the player base.<br />

Proof is in the pudding, as the saying goes. We shall see what that is soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Based on the spells on test which appear to be VP related, I'm pretty sure that its not going to be the sort of place where your average casual is going to want to go to.

Software companies rarely employ the same people to do both the Content in a game and the Game Engine.<br />
<br />
One is a creative task that is best suited to 'artistic types' who have had training and experience in creative endevors.<br />
<br />
The other is a analytical task that requires following rules and maintaining an attention to detail that would drive some free spirits bonkers.<br />
<br />
I suspect that Sony maintains 'Software Engineers' and 'Content Designers' just like the majority of the industry and by redoing the zone they are not taking any resources away from the game engine repairs.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way,  they may use the same tools of the trade (ink and paper) but would you want a Romance Writer to be writing Criminal and Business Law instead of an Attorney?  or Vis-Versa?  <br />

Wondering if anyone knows if it will still be possible to finish up the old key after the revamp if you have the 3 medallions and just need the tooth.  Or if i have to just trash all my hard work and redoo the key from scratch.  I dont see myself being able to get a tooth in time before they implement this.</div></div><hr />

Well, the elemental planes and Sol Ro tower have many single group encounters yet require extensive raiding to get in.  So why would anyone expect anything different here?<br />

Cause its a old world zone with a paini n the arse quest to get in and some thigns should be preseved cause they have character and add depth tot he game instead of churning out another &quot;raid it till it bleeds dry zone&quot; ?<br />
<br />
My 2 cents atleast.</div></div><hr />

Single groups encounters to get in. From what I read, the WHOLE key is single groupable. The ONLY raid required is to update old keys to new keys (I guess they assume if you have an old key, you are a raider, which isnt right). I am hopeful, even optimistic, that it will have single group content inside too, with EP level one groupable mobs like the mini-minis in Fire, Earth and Water. Sharkspine, Flamebuckle belt (100/100 with FT3), Charm of Defense, Earthtone Band, these are all 1-group drops in the EPs. If there is single group drops like this in the new VP, and the quest to get in is all one-groupable, well, thats what the non-raiders want, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

What you really mean is that you did the quest, including your 16 hour stint for one piece and feel that everyone else should be excluded from the zone unless they go through the same pain you did?<br />
<br />
Kinda like the argument you have been disagreeing with concerning the elementals I think...........<br />
<br />
I want the elementals preserved because they add character and depth and no one should get there unless they go through every step.<br />
<br />
Excellent! We all agree. Thank god we put that age old argument to bed.</div></div><hr />

The ONLY raid required is to update old keys to new keys (I guess they assume if you have an old key, you are a raider, which isnt right).So keep the old key and do the single groupable encounters and get the new one.  I haven't read anywhere that says that people with the current key are required to raid to get the upgrade.  If it's really that much trouble, just do the new key instead.  It's a bit more work(after the amount of crap you go through to get the VP key, you should be thick skinned hehe) but if it's faster, just do it that way.</div></div><hr />

I took that information from the original post. <br />
From the SOE guild summit boards:<br />
<br />
*********<br />
::snip::<br />
If you have the old key already, there is a single raid you can do to upgrade that to the new key.<br />

Well, I think its unfair of them to EXPECT that everyone who has an old key can just &quot;Do a raid and get the new, updated key&quot;. There should be additional single-group steps to upgrade from an old key to new key. Maybe a couple, but certainly make it an option. After all, VP is Kunark. I mean come on. I bet more than 50% of the people who even raided during Kunark dont play any more, and arent even in the same guild if they do. I think this whole &quot;Raid to get a new key&quot; thing is based on the fact that Trak has basically become a 1-grouper by people with EP+ gear (i.e. Raiders), or a target for smaller guilds to &quot;raid&quot; without having 72 people (probably doable with 18-24 mid-range folks 60-65 with fair, if not outstanding, gear. Smaller guilds, basically).</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
I think the elementals shouldnt be opened to everyone, so im not sure if your talking about me or someone else.<br />
<br />
Its not a &quot; they hurt me so they must hurt you. Its a rite of passage, you worked hard to get what you got and then they just come in and give it away for free ? It robs the player and the game. Pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Litgruv, I want to respectfully disagree with you.  Did you work hard to get to the elementals or simply manage to have enough people to do it?  I dont want them opened to any Joe Schmoe.  However, it should have a method to access that doesnt require 40+ person raids.  If you want it to be a 'rite of passage' great.  But allow for people with different playstyles to have alternate methods to achieve that 'rite of passage'.  They did it for Tactics, and that zone hasnt become a 'noob' zone for it.  Besides if done well (like the Diakyu Emblems), it could significantly help the backflagging issues advanced guilds are facing by providing an alternative method in which they can get single groups flagged forward.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Didn't they just revamp VP about a year ago? They removed the no-gate restriction, beefed up some of the trash mobs. In fact, I think it was bugged after the revamp, where occasionally you would run into a  Guardian Wurm that would hit for a lot more than others and would regen at a super high rate. Now it's getting revamped again ... kinda odd to me, but I'm game I guess. <br />
<br />
I'm disappointed that the key quest is changing. I kinda liked the idea of key quests. It offered a player something that they can do on their own time and accomplish part of, then finish the rest with the appropriate calibre raid force. I missed that in PoP, where everything requires a flag that a raid mist get for you. Key quests offer a small sense of self-accomplishment. Now, the time sink part sucked, but I'm talking more about the idea and not the actual implementation.  <br />
<br />
I am disappointed to hear that it might be Elemental in level. I don't mind seeing the bosses beefed up, but it seems to me that to have it Elemental level is just a bit over done. <br />
<br />
That's my 2cp</div></div><hr />

OK, I do not understand you at all. There is still a key quest, it just doesnt require a trak tooth anymore. It is supposedly completely 1-groupable. <br />
<br />
Elemental in level, IF there is single group content inside, is exactly what the non-raiding folks have been asking for (indirectly, they are asking for the EPs to be opened). <br />
<br />
I guess I am not following your line here.</div></div><hr />
