<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>peteyFU</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&lt;b&gt;I am locking this thread.  I am asking that the other moderaters let this die a normal death within this forum.  -Mojo&lt;/b&gt;<br />

I am going to be honest with you.  No one here cares what your reasons are, what you did was idiotic, childish, and plain immature.  You even admitted you did it not for any reason of angst that you may have had.  Your reasons may be valid to yourself, but they are not to us.  The only person this was a scandal to is yourself and your unknown friend (soupy?).  Please stop doing what you are doing.  What do you think you stand to gain?  Recognition as a crusader fighting the evil of the world?  Never happen.  Doing a favor for a friend?  Favor has been accomplished.  <br />
<br />
Here is what you wote in your original message, for all to see:<br />
<br />
&quot;For those of you that care.<br />
<br />
I am petey222.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I switched my IP address so I can post again.<br />
<br />
Please don't post these IP's, as they AREN'T me, and I'm definetly not Australian. Heh, it's kind of flattering though that that is where my IP pointed to. But following up and posting information that you find off of whois will proabably just get you and some random company or organization, a little bit confused.<br />
<br />
For the record, I am NOT soupy.<br />
<br />
Reasons for trouble making:<br />
1) Owed a friend a fovor for bailing me out of jail on a 5k bond for a bar incident that involved some chairs, few broken bottles and a mighty fine piece of ass.<br />
2) He wanted me to make trouble on the boards and gave me some rather wierd allegations to bring up.<br />
3) I played EQ about 4 years ago when the game was first releasted, hence my little knowledge about the game and hostile references to the ways of life by most EQ'ers - no harm intended.<br />
<br />
All and all, besides the high volume of profanity, some creative ANSII art, and some personal attacks (which really weren't personal, b/c it was all based on stuff that I had just read yesterday on the forum), there was no true harm intended. It seemed some people were even enjoying the flame. <br />
<br />
So with that said, Sunmoon, I have nothing against you, matter of fact it seems you do a pretty nice job on the site. Being a person who used to make and host sites for free for EQ and UO, if I could have gotten a couple bucks out of it to cover costs, I probably would still be doing it today.<br />
<br />
That's all folks, keep your ear to the grindstone and peace in the middle east.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing anyone sees is that you have been causing grief around here.  Is it really that hard to be a man and stop being a jerk, and just walk away?  Posting your previous message is the only concession you will get out of me.  <br />
<br />
Petey, please fade back to wherever you came from.  We TRULY don't care about your reasons or your case.</div></div><hr />
