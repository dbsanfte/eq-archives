<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ragbal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My apologies if this belongs in the equipment forum, but more wanted to get some opinions on this item I picked up in the bazaar. First let me say it cost quite a bit but I had nothing else better to do with the money and I had never seen it before:<br />
<br />
Wicked Bone Atlatl<br />
Magic Item Lore Item<br />
Slot: Range<br />
AC: 5<br />
Sta +6 Wis +10 HP +30 Mana +30<br />
Sv Disease +10 Sv Poison +10<br />
Recommended Level of 53<br />
Focus Effect: Haste of Mithaniel<br />
Wt 0.7 Size:Small<br />
Class:SHM<br />
Race: All<br />
<br />
No idea what zone its from either.<br />
The effect is:<br />
<br />
Haste of Mithaniel  Detail | History | Stacking | Raw Data  <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Spell Haste by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Casting Time(3.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only) <br />
6:  Limit: Effect(Percentage Heal excluded) <br />
 <br />
<br />
Personally I like it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like buff haste and tnarg's mending haste to me.  I like Tnargs, and that buff haste would stack too.  A worthy item.  <br />
<br />
Where does it drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ragbal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wish I knew. I just picked it up in the bazaar. First time I had ever seen it, and couldn't find it on any websites. Also it speeds up Torpor so thats nice also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's very cool. I purchased one for 100k and loved it, but felt I had spent too much. So then I purchased another for 15k (I think it was mispriced or the person selling it thought 'oh well, shaman don't melee much, why do they need haste?') and resold almost immediately for 65k. ;) I'd say it's well worth 50k to 100k. <br />
<br />
With QB2 I've got torpor down to 3.3 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The &quot;beneficial only&quot; is misleading.<br />
<br />
I have a haste of mithaniel focus item (not this one, shoulders from PoI).<br />
<br />
Works on: All buffs (except acumen - too short a cast time), Tnarg's, Chloroblast, Torpor (4.8 second torpor, W/O any quickbuff AA), Gate, Invis, Pet summon spells, Regen...basically EVERY spell in your book except:<br />
<br />
Spells that cast under 3 seconds<br />
Kragg's Mending<br />
Any harmful (damage, debuff) spell. I haven't checked the dispel magic line, it may work on these as well despite them having a hostile component.<br />
<br />
Don't know that I'd spend 100k, with the prototypes in PoI being so easy (and the shoulders being an exponentially better item than the Atlal), but the focus effect gets a big thumbs up from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It drops in the Ruins of Lxanvom(sp?), in the undead area I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did buy one for 7500 on AB<br />
<br />
