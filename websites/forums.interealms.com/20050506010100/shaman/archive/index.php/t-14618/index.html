Just a note, due to a recent patch, flag restrictions were removed from CoD, HoH and BoT.  Although certain level restrictions remain, basically any characters with PoP have access to these zones, quests or flag events are not needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild will probably never drop arien dar or what have you. But A few hours of work and or a lucky drop or three and a little aa boost for that flag is still an okay reward. <br />
<br />
At least the content isnt wasted. Sone actually didnt screw up that one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild just had a PoS raid day in which we collected the items for several people to become flagged for BoT.  We got all of the messages indicating that we would be able to enter BoT, but our keyrings don't show that we have access, and when we ran to the portal in PoS, we couldn't get in.  It's been speculated that the reason we can't get in is because we were not flagged through the PoJ trials.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this?  We're planning on doing the trials soon for the medalion upgrades anyway, but I'm hoping that the trails will fix the BoT problem, too.  Any advice would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In order to get a flag later on the &quot;normal&quot; progression (as opposed to the alternate quests), you have to have whatever previous flags were needed. So yes, you need to buckle down and do trials. Not sure if it is necesary with the BoT key (since it is kind of a key, and not exactly a flag), but normally when you get flags out of order (such as when my whole guild got the Saryrn flag before killing Bertoxxulous, when we finally DID kill bert, everyone had to have the seer fix their flags so they would work right for progression to SolRo tower), you need to go and visit the Seer in PoK and have her dig through your memories to fix your flags.</div></div><hr />
