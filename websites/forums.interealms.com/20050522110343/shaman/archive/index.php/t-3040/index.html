<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
    I recently made the 52/53/52/53/52 area of my life. I was wondering if you could give me some tips on what to cast and what sequence when soloing now since I seem to not be doing very well :)<br />
<br />
   I have all my spells thru 52 and I use a JBB but have not completed my epic. (also no Fungi I'm kinda old school but saving for an Iksar BP)<br />
<br />
   When I try to solo sometimes it goes good and other times a blue just absolutely hands my ass to me...Is this normal? I don't mind dying so much if I know it's just luck of the draw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I think one of a shaman's great strengths is to be able to stand toe to toe with a lot of mobs, it's also important to know when the fight isn't going so hot and you need to root the mob, get away, let the mob rot while you regen some health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try soloing seafuries in OOT, they are *uber* easy, Slow sic pet and jbb or DoT or (insert kill meothd here)<br />
Do Gornit too :cool: <br />
<br />
OR You could try CoM solo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When soloing, I tend to use one of two strategies for pulling:  pull with slow (when mobs are not highly resistant) or pull with maloX (when they are).  When I pull with maloX, I haul ass as soon as it casts, run until I can cast again, stop, pause, cast slow.  After years of doing this, I've got the timing down pretty good, usually can get the slow off before the mob gets to me.  If you have troubles getting it off in time, just pull further.  :)<br />
<br />
ok, now I've got a slowed mob that's kinda pissed at me.  But because it's slow, I can nearly always get my spells cast.  Root is your friend, use it often.  Root, back off, dot/debuff/heal/etc.<br />
<br />
If you play toe-to-toe, drop a cripple in to reduce the damage output (and increase your damage output).  If you just root/rot, don't bother with anything other than slow (for when root breaks), maloX (if resistant), root, and dots.<br />
<br />
I solo'd a bit in the low 50's, and had fun stacking 6 dots on a mob at a time.  I used the top 3 poison dots, top two disease dots, and my epic dot.  I felt sorry for the mobs, but that didn't stop me.<br />
<br />
If you can save up 8.5k plat, invest in a horse.  See other threads about this, but it is the best investment you will ever make for hunting in outdoor zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tag-team the mob with ya pet dog.<br />
<br />
When ya get a bit low, just root and back up, and let the dog take a pasting for 30-40secs while you med/regen or canni if Lom etc. Think of the pet as an extension to your hp, let him take a beating off every mob to an extent, as dogs regen fast it seems..<br />
<br />
JBB and cheap root (level 14, 30mana) makes for good mob control when needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">53 spells are pretty useless, so whatever you did at 52 won't change at 53.  Or 54 really.  Hrm, or 55.  After that mobs get a bit tougher, and you get bane of nife, so that helps out a bit.  Otherwise 52 - 55 are pretty damn boring levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So many players and classes talk about soloing. I guess people never really wanted the forced grouping by Verant. It used to be a must but after player power increase not so for so many. Or they just get to dual boxing...<br />
<br />
Anyways, many good tips have been given if you like solo and so forth. Best exp in game can be done in duo/trios, but for best enjoyment out of game try to find stead friends to group with them and stick with them through the rains and sunshines. Perhaps find a suitable guild and all if not in one yet... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vurm:  Yeah, that's normal.  There is an especially large power difference between blue casters- some of them I can take down (at 52) without any danger, some have me Gating when they're still at half-health (/rude Sarnak Zealot)<br />
<br />
I try to stick to melee-type mobs when soloing, and the sequence is usually VoS/Root/Ebolt/Root if needed/...JBB/Root(repeat as needed)... sometimes I'll throw on a second VoS or Ebolt on there if I have to.  With a couple level 2 (cheap) focus items, VoS becomes very cheap to cast, and between the horse and cann'ing between JBB blasts, I get most of my mana back by the time the fight is over.  One thing you'll notice... I don't usually slow or malxxx melee mobs.  I have a decent AC, and I can take a few hits while I get them re-rooted (nice mana savings, too).  Againt mobs that hit hard and fast (Some wurms in BW, for example), I will slow... but against most I don't bother.  I'm sure this will change as I level up.<br />
<br />
With casters I buff all of my resists first, get to full mana, and tend to just unload on them (pull with cancel magic to wipe their buffs/SoW, malxxx, plague, ebolt, VoS, blizzard blast), maybe slow, then run up and try to interrupt 'em with slam while they try to do anything.  If I have a pet up, it makes it easier... but I don't usually find it worth it to summon and buff a pet just to take out a caster mob.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In the 52-53 range I was trying out 4 different areas for decent exp.  OOT (seafurbies), BW (everything but the wurms ... they were doable, but they were tough at that level, avoid guller), KC (yes, I did this, yes its a lame zone, but I got tremendous exp, loot sucked, easy as sin to get a group and I learned a lot about coping in bad groups), and the hole (6 spawns in the ent, although lately its been permacamped by folks looking for iron oxide).</div></div><hr />
