<br />
I have a few questions i need to ask<br />
<br />
1) is there a website or messageboard like this one for the Rodcet Nife server<br />
<br />
2) Has any shaman Maxed its AA'a <br />
<br />
3)What is the command line for the /join crucible server wide channel (so i can speak to all us shaman's online )<br />
<br />
4)is it possible to still Farm POG for gems? or does the whole zone agro ?<br />
<br />
5) has anyone got any drops in the last trial in POJ (the fire one) and is it possible to farm 4 boxing <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Or, at least someone there can direct you to the right place <br />
<br />
3)What is the command line for the /join crucible server wide channel (so i can speak to all us shaman's online )<br />
<br />
;join serverwide.crucible:crucible <br />
<br />
4)is it possible to still Farm POG for gems? or does the whole zone agro ?<br />
<br />
Difficult, I'd say.  2 creatures will spawn every 30 minutes or so with zone wide aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  I'm sure there is.<br />
2)  Yes, Mudcrush for sure.<br />
3)  /join serverwide.crucible:crucible<br />
4)  Yes, but you have to deal with protectors every 20 minutes, so it is a little more tedious<br />
5)  Yes.  I duo it with a rogue frequently.</div></div><hr />
