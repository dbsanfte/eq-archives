<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing people talk about how our stat buffs do nothing and most people have their stats at the max without buffs. I have been thinking of a possible change to FA that may or may not have been posted, and might help make it all the more desirable than it currently is. It is probably out of the question, but here goes.<br />
<br />
What if FA added 120str/dex/agi/atk OVER what you currently have, something like overhaste. For example if you already have 305 str, it will pump your strength up to 425, making melee go crazy for the huge bonus. <br />
<br />
I realize that the amount of work that would need to be done by Sony to allow such a massive amount of stat increase over the current cap. If FA acted like an overhaste type buff increasing stats over the cap it would appeal to everyone from my 56 rogue alt w/ 230 str to the 65 Potime rogue with 305 str and might make us more of a help on raids, or in groups though the recast time and super short duration would kill anyone. <br />
<br />
/shrug just my 2 cents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Forget that for now I think. Our main issue (and what I was looking for in this expansion) was a noticeable improvement to our heals. FA is definitley something that I don't really care about right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree a new heal is much higher on my priority as well, but this is something that I wanted to post before I forgot it :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything that I have to recast every 8 mins or so, regardless of how good it is, is something I'm not much interested in, thank you.  I've hated the Avatar line ever since I memmed the first one and all the sudden had to start buying emeralds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best thing SOE could do with Avatar if they decided to change it, would be making it a group spell and last an hour.  If a ranger or beastlord can keep atk on a group without having having to cast it every few minutes, then there is no reason for us not to.  It's the ATK that people want from it, not so much the other stats that end up not doing much for those with max'd stats from gear and/or Focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The other stats on FA are meaningless to me.  I use it to buff ATK and ATK only.  It's great just the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually don't mind the short duration of FA, it's the 1 minute recast that drives me bonkers. If I could mem it, cast it quickly on a full group and then demem it for 10 minutes, I would want to use it a lot more.<br />
<br />
Currently, what happens is I get in an FA rotation in a LDON adventure, then we get a nasty pull of 6-7 mobs and by the time we're done, FA is ready to go and I have no idea whose turn it is. <br />
<br />
While I would definitely applaud extending the duration, just removing the ridiculous recast would work wonders for this spell's appeal for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason people dont care about the other stats avatar adds is because thier stats are maxxed.  If you allowed it to increase the stat cap on those items then those other stats could be actually useful.  High strength = higher atk.  Surely people aren't arguing that this wouldn't make FA more useful than it currently is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes letting it kick the stat caps up would be cool but very unlikely given the amount of effort to raise the caps using AA. The most important change they could make to FA in my opinion would make it group castable, multiply the mana cost appropriately and increase the recast time to make it only maintainable on a single group. Put simply, eliminate the need for me to memorize who needs it and when so I can just cast it whenever it pops up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FA is ready to go and I have no idea whose turn it is<br />
<br />
I set up a chat channel to manage this, Glori.  Whenever I cast FA it puts the targets name in a small window in the upper left of my screen.  Whenever I notice that FA is available, I just glance up at that list to see who is next.  Saved me tons of wasted casts and stress :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There was an Idea about this over on monk boards awhile back  that Avatar is like KEI for melee and should have a simalar duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Group FA for 4 hours IMO. The melee equivalent of KEI.<br />
<br />
MGB FA inc !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Group and increased duration. These 2 changes would make FA so loveable, I'd almost hug a Dev...before roasting him over a fire pit with some BBQ sauce.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Remove the recast, change the stats to something meaningful, and up the mana cost to say, 450 to make this spell actually worthwhile and retain the &quot;ooomph&quot; factor it had back in Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd be happier if they just erased that spell line from the game.  If they want to keep it, they should make it a group only passive ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[1] up the duration significantly, up the mana cost, make it a group spell;<br />
[2] remove dex/str/agi stats;<br />
[3] add stats like shielding/strikethrough/avoidance/overhaste with an emphasis on the stats that add to damage.<br />
<br />
when I cast this on my group, I want everybody to scream my name in /ooc proclaiming me the god of melee buffs, as it should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, and add an illusion component that turns them into tiny bunnies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There should be a gear stat cap and a seperate stat buff cap imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd vote for that :)<br />
<br />
Only problem is, they'd make the spell no drop off boss mobs in some post-time zone that I'm never going to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I would have gone for a 3-stage AA to double/triple/quadruple the length of FA in a heartbeat.  That way you could at least get close to an hour on duration with foci.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of ditching the stats in favor of avoidance, strikethrough, shielding, etc, but I really doubt SOE would give us such a powerful and useful upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">oh, and add an illusion component that turns them into tiny bunnies... <br />
<br />
sheer brilliance  :D  I'm sure it'd be too unbalancing though. A herd of bunnies could do some serious DMG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the part where I wonder why I didn't think of that first, I'll have to try that, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hail,<br />
<br />
If they'd extend the duration to 30 minutes and cut the recast time to 30 (or even better, 3!) seconds, I'd be a happy bear.  Could care less about changing any other aspect of this spell.  I honestly smile when I get a beastlord with Ferocity in one of my adventure groups.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">rather see fos as the &quot;kei for melees&quot; (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19083&amp;highlight=fos)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aqualung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd like to see a group FA(non-tgb), with a 6 minute refresh, on an AA hotkey.  I'd gladly pay 20aas or whatever to free up a spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&lt;~~~~ would kill for his DoT's to land in pvp again :) ya no one can kill me with 1700ac 7600hp and a giant mana pool with very good mana regen and BoT. but now it's super hard for me to land much of anything on anyone with elemental gear or higher and it's kinda making pvp not very fun. OH PLEASE OH PLEASE look out for us pvp servers :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't know if I'd ever want the duration of FA to be close to KEI.  That would remove FA from the list of very few reasons why people want to group with shaman these days (not like it's a huge reason, but at this point anything helps).  Making it a buff that someone could just pick up in PoK and then forget about for a long time would kinda suck.<br />
<br />
I think a group version (with appropriate mana costs) that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes would be perfect.  It's short enough to keep people from just picking it up in PoK, but long enough to keep our hair from falling out of our heads.</div></div><hr />
