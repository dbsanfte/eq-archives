<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This post is more of a condensation (though it's still long as !#$@) of the thread Dangerous new addition to PoFear: Ireblind Imp  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19893) <br />
The information in there is great, but it was alot of stuff to swallow in it's current format (mainly because I was spitting out silly ideas in random places on the thread and had no concept of sticking to topic  :p).  Plus I re-organized it so I could post it all on the zerker forums since they'll have to be targeting this guy at some point.  This is the strategy lay out as best as I can concieve of it.  please post any corrections/ideas that you may have.<br />
<br />
Much of this information is taken off of the shaman Crucible, and most of the tactics are taken straight out of my furry shaman butt... Take them with a grain of salt, but trust that I did use at least half a brain when constructing them.  As such, I thought it might be helpful to give you a guide of sorts on taking down this epic fight.  He so far has taken down two EP guilds that I am aware of (though they brough rather a rather small contingency, and were unaware of this new mob), yet our family guild of only 2 groups, average level 56 could probably take him down(would have, had he not poped amidst a 6 pull).  The difference is planning and strategy.  After you get those two down, I am convinced this mob is a pushover... Anyway, enough of the intro and on to the fight.<br />
<br />
The mob: Ireblind Imp<br />
<br />
General information: Random instant spawn off of a scareling (i.e. you kill a scareling and have a chance for him to spawn).  Some raids have cleared fear of all it's scarelings and only had him pop once.  Some had him pop 3 times in one clearing...  It may even be possible that you could clear fear and not have ireblind pop, though I have yet to have this confirmed.  It is my opinion that his spawning is totally random.  Luckily for everyone, his agro range is not as insane as most of fear seems to be.  if fact it's quite manageable.<br />
<br />
DPS/hps: his highest swings are just a tad over 200.  I did not see him quad (though he might... I can't say with 100% certainty yet), and only got hit by one double.  In short, he hits like an infant gnat.  However, he is built like a tank.  Best estimations that I have read puts his hitpoints at somewhere around 125k.  This still makes him succeptable to a SK zerg strategy and just HT the sucker down, but since most of us don't have that size of an SK army, I'll continue...<br />
<br />
Spells: This is the dousy...  He casts and area of effect mezmorise spell.  -1000 magic resistance check, so don't even bother trying to resist it.  And don't try to get out of range either... the range is INSANE.  it's on alla at 500 wich basically is WAY out of a typical casters range.  Unfortunately for all involved, this spell lasts somewhere close to 20 seconds, and he only lets it drop for 5-10 seconds max.  in short, he chain-casts the damn thing.<br />
<br />
Resists/immunities: As far as I can tell, he is unstunable, unmezzable, unrootable, and unsnarable.  Though I never did land a slow on him (I am only lvl 54 and we had no chanters tashing, and no 60+ shaman to malo(s)) I did not recieve an immune message, so I do believe he is slowable.  I, however, am unaware of whether or not he mitigates.  The resists (according to our higher level players) weren't all too outlandish.  Spells had a fairly low resist rate, and no immunities on any particular spell line (i.e. poison, magic, fire, etc.) were reported.<br />
<br />
Other dangers:  He will spawn waves of greenies, called Essence of Rage. <br />
1st wave at 80% life, 5 Essence of Rage <br />
2nd wave at 50% life, 2 Essence of Rage <br />
3rd wave at 20% life, 2 Essence of Rage <br />
These were unmezzable and hit for around 100-120 or so.  I believe they share all the same resist/immune properties that ireblind did, so rooting for CC is also out of the question.<br />
These mobs casted shadowstep, basically porting odd members of your crew out in the middle of nowhere... very bad thing if the zone is not very clear yet.  I have heard that they can be taken down with a single powerful dot, so I believe their HPS are very small.  As long as you control them, they should be quick kills.<br />
<br />
And last danger, is his spawnpoint/bindpoint is wherever he pops.  I.E. if you kill a scareling in camp, and it pops Ireblind, and Ireblind proceeds to whipe your guild, then his happy butt will also be camping your corpses when you try to do a CR.<br />
<br />
Strategies:<br />
Disclaimer...  Some of these strats have been tried and some are being speculated (I will deliniate which are which when delivering them).  I am pretty good at combat tactics, but I am not intimately familiar with EVERY aspect of eq (for example, I still have a few grey areas on guildwars that we will explore in a moment.)  If one of these strategies does not work so well, or if I am completely off my rocker, please post a correction, as this is still a work in progress.<br />
<br />
Getting Past the Mezz:  This is the MOST important part of the entire fight... figuring out a strategy to get around the mez, as otherwise he will take out your whole raid slowly, one pc at a time.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the key is dot damage.  If you take damage, you break mez...  So you have to work a few strategies to have everyone taking damage.  The most important note before begining is that you MUST take more damage then you regenerate in order for your dot to break mez.  So here are some Ideas as to how to do this:<br />
<br />
Crimon Potions: (tested)  This is essentially a healing potion (50hps) that then takes back 2 hps per tick for about 3 minutes.  The &quot;taking back&quot; hps acts as a 2 hp dot.  These potions are purchasable from vendors for only around 10pp so they are certainly the easiest way to break mez... if it works.  The problem is not many people are regening less than 2hps per tick.  If you are a troll, an iksar, someone who has trained in innate regen, someone wearing regen gear who forgot to take it off, someone who forgot to click off ALL of your regen buffs (don't forget the BL versions now), or someone who forgot to stand your happy butt up, or click off your horse/drogmar, you are regening more than 2 hps per tick.  So these potions might as well rub your tummy for all you care.  For some that are CERTAIN that their regen will not exceed 2 hps per tick during the fight, then these are a painless way to keep them dotted and awake.<br />
<br />
Edit: Some have mentioned that crim-pots don't HAVE to exceed the natural regen to work...  I know a few in my guild tried everything they could and still weren't able to break mez with these things, but many people on pvp swear by them, and say they can break mez even though their regen exceeds 2.  The only thing I can think of is that there might be some difference between mez breaks on blue servers, and those on red servers...  I am not at all certain.  Regardless, try the crim pots, and if they don't work, have one of the below strategies prepared as backup.<br />
<br />
Self-Dotting-Groups (tested): Since crimson potions won't work for everyone, one strategy is to simply try to take down Irebling with dotting classes only.  This means your MT and Off-Tank (remeber those nasty spawns?  yeah you'll need an off-tank group to kill them) will be SK's.  If you don't have enough SK's, an OK equiped Shaman can tank just as well as this guys hits soft (just have the shaman chain cast disempower to keep agro).  Druids will be your healers, as the clerics will be out of commission, and Necros will probably be your main source of DPS.  Before you pull your first scareling (probably before you enter fear) make sure those set in these groups (you really only need two... one more Ireblind, one for offtanking the adds) have up a low level do that will not kill them, but will still out-weight thier regen.  If they are intent on leaving on their fungi, or whatever, and/or staying on their horse, make sure they take that into account when considering which dot to pick.  Also, have them all pre-test the dot about 5 times before going.  You want to make sure they can land it on themselves, otherwise they are worthless.  If their resists are too high, they better get good at swapping out their gear for a sec to drop the dot.  They will have to do this about 2-3 time in the fight as it's about a 10 minute fight.  Lastly, for those that are not self-dotters, have them mem their fastest casting heal/DD as they will only have 5-8 second periods of being awake.<br />
<br />
Nullify Magic:<br />
This technique was suggested by Saldaora (I have yet to try it, but it sounds pretty good).  The self dotters would obviously start by self-dotting...  Then, assign one or two self dotters to nullify magic duty.  They begin casting nullify magic on all memebers of the raid.  You could either have these two (or more... up to you) people wake up the whole raid, or simply wake up a couple other people who's job it will be to wake up the raid...  Since nullify magic strips 4 spells, your going to want some junkbuffs up front, however, since you will need to be using this SEVERAL times during the fight, and since re-buffing everyone in time for the next nullify is pretty impractical, you might as well just deal with a raid-rebuff after the fight.  <br />
I do not know if the lower level versions of this spell (cancel magic) will strip Mez or not, but if it will, then it is a MUCH better way to go.  When buffing before the raid, start with a junkbuff, then buff up.  When this fight starts, click off the junkbuff so the mezz will land in the first slot...  This way, when cancel magic is cast, it will take out the mez.<br />
<br />
Duels: (speculating)  I am not 100% familiar with all the rules of duels, however I do know that when in a duel you cannot heal or buff anyone outside of the duel (actually tested this recently).  Therefor, this meathod has the inherrent dis-advantage of making some folks un-healable, and some folks unable to use their heals on others.  Please, if you are more familiar with all the restrictions of duels, post below, as more info is needed to determine if this is a viable option...<br />
Basically, those classes that cannot self-dot will duel a class that can.  As soon as Ireblind pops, all dotters dot themselves, then dot their dueling opponent.  If planned properly, this will alow the entire guild to participate in the fight, however, the dueling restrictions might be debilitating for some.  AoE's of all kinds will be unusable for the entire raid (including AoE mez), and as mentioned above, healing issues might make this strategy not worth it.<br />
<br />
Guild-War:  <br />
EDIT:Guild war was broken when they made the guild management system, and they have given no inclination that they plan on fixing it.  Untill it is fixed (if ever) the following stratagey is not a viable option:<br />
<br />
(speculating) Probably the most clever option, as well as the best all around one, should the strategy work, is to creat a raidwar for the specific purposes of winning this fight.  Of course, this restricts this tactic to those guilds that are at least friendly enough with another guild to ask this kind of favor... but It's still worth exploring...<br />
Basically you ask a friend guild if you can borrow 2 or 3 members (all dotters) to help on the raid, and also, if they will let you declare a war.  Once the War is declared, and the 2-3 people join up, assign each one of the &quot;adopted dotters&quot; a list of targets.  Their whole job for the raid is dotting their targets when Ireblind pops.  Basically, ire pops, these folks dot themselves, and then start working their way down the list dotting each one as they go (they should use a lower level dot, that does just enough damage to cancel the innate regen of the highest regener in the raid).  Their targets should be in some priority order, like MT first, then clerics, then high DPS, etc.  They dont' need to add the self dotters on there, as they will take care of themselves.  You might want to assign one or two people on your raid to dotting them, just in case they didn't get to themselves before the first mez hits.<br />
The great thing about this idea is that the dotters have a non-agro/non-healing role, so the raid-war restrictions do not hinder anyone's ability to fight.  Also, if you want these folks to add the self dotters on the rotation, it allows them to keep up thier normal raid spells, and be more prepared for taking down Ire and his friends.<br />
Edit:  I have heard that raid-war is currently broken atm.  I am not sure the nature of it's broken-ness  (:p) or if it will preclude this stratagey as an option, but I thought I should mention it nonetheless. <br />
<br />
Preping for the Adds:  Just about every guild has their own off-tank strategies, so I'm not going to impose mine on you.  I will however make a note that there should be more than just a &quot;tank&quot; off tanking these buggers...  Everytime mez lands, there is a 6 second (max) period that the adds turn away from the off-tank.  They will go to whoever Ireblind imp is attacking, as he will have broken mez early.  Even if it's the MT, on the first set of spawned adds, that ups the DPs from a possible 400 dps per round (anticipating double attack) to a possible 1600 dps per round.  It's still not UBER dps, but it's enough to catch your healers off guard, especially since they won't be able to heal immediately.  As such, getting these adds killed FAST is a priority.  Since Ireblind is a pushover as soon as you have gotten past the mez, I think it's worth sacraficing a full groups worth of dps (at least) on the adds.  <br />
Also, Tell everyone to go slowly, and not push the agro limit.  The MT is not landing all his rounds because some are interrupted by mez (which in turn reduces their agro), and if some caster pulls agro as a mez tick lands, the adds will kill you before the healers are even able to start healing.<br />
<br />
Getting past the corpse camping:  <br />
There are two ways that I can think of to get around the corpse camping.  The first is to have your preset off-tank group also be a scareling group for the whole raid (until you've cleared all the scarlings).  If a scareling comes with a pull, the off-tank gets agro, and pulls it to the location of the off-tank group (stationed a little ways away from the rest of the raid).  There they kill the scarelings, and if Ireblind pops, they drag him back to the rest of the raid.  That way, if the raid wipes, he goes back to his pop point a little ways off of the corpses.  And added advantage is this group will already have thier dots up, and be prepared to heal their own tank for a while... so they can shout to the raid that he's comming, and give them time to dot up before he gets there (however, this still might not work as the agro range on the mez really is rediculous).<br />
<br />
Second way is to prepare an alternate camp site (probably just a little ways up or down the west wall).  When Ireblind pops, the raid simply moves up or down to the new site, and continues the fight there.  This makes dotting on the fly a little more difficult, and might require a &quot;sacrifice&quot; tank to pull agro in the beggining, and simply stay and take the death while the rest of the raid slowly moves down in between mezzes.<br />
<br />
Pulling:<br />
Two ideas on getting Ireblind by his lonesome instead of amidst a multi pull like we were unfortunate enough to do:<br />
First, of course, is to simply mez the scarelings, and save them for last.  If there are multiple scarelings, have the chanter take the rest (all but the one being killed) up to a safe spot, and keep them mezzed.  If Ireblind pops, the chanter really can't do anything but nuke him anyway, so they might as well keep the other scarelings company (this means the chanter will probably need a healer with them, because if ire pops, the mezz time between dots will be enough to kill the chanter if their own mez breaks.<br />
<br />
The second way is after the breaking (cross your fingers and pray he doesn't pop on a scareling on the breaking, or you're just screwed) send a monk out (with a ranger, just to help him find them) to single pull the scarelings, and get them all cleared before moving on to anything else.<br />
<br />
Well folks, that's all I have as far as conventional strategies go.  I have one really cooky off the wall strategy that is almost guaranteed to get you killed, but if it works, it would be clasic... So I'll post it.<br />
<br />
Off the wall, totally out of my butt strategy: <br />
<br />
Edit:  Though many have told me this works, some say it is totally random, and therefore might not be a viable tactic... I will put it down anyway just for fun.<br />
Remember along time ago when dots were set to do less damage to casters when they were moving?  As such, if the first spell you casted on a casting mob was a dot, they would come running at you, and wouldn't stop to cast.  Well, they changed the code, and dots do the same whether the mob is moving or not, but they never told the mobs...  If you pull a caster  by dotting it (initial agro must be by a dot, not by proximity, or by any other means) they will come charging, and won't stop to cast till they reach you...  you see where I'm going with this?<br />
If you root-rotted all the scarelings a fare distance from camp (for example, if scarelings come in on a pull, the shaman slows them to pull agro, runs them a good distance a way, roots them, and then dots them... some necros could also pile on the dots... and then runs back to camp) you could concievably have ireblind pop with no initial agro.  His agro radious is small enough to get just inside casting range without ticking him off (easier with extended range augments), so you could concievably pull him with a dot... then kite his little imp but around.  Make sure the kiter had sow, and have them chain casting an agro spell, and everyone else can slowly add in dps here and there as he gets dragged by the camp.<br />
I do not know if he can spawn adds without casting, but I suspect he can, so you still need your off-tank groups ready.  But if the imp-kiter keeps him moving to where he never stops and mezzes, then the adds are a cake walk.<br />
If this strategy worked, it would certainly be the easiest way around the mezzes, but one bad lag, and the whole raid could be in an unexpected world of trouble.  This might, however, be a good opening strategy to give everyone the time to dot up, and then just take him by the MT and agro-kite the imp till the MT pulls his attention.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope these tips have been useful.  Again, most of the general information about the imp came from the posters at the shaman crucible as well as did a few of the stratagies., and the rest of the stategy ideas came from yours truely, along with a good amount of help from my fellow guildmates at Conclave of Eternity (www.goconclave.org)<br />
<br />
Edit: as a side note, much of these ideas are taking too many precautions for the uber-raid type crowds.  There are several spells/abilities that will allow some higher level guilds to cut some corners on things I have said, but I wrote this guild with the mindset of helping everyone who could once raid fear.  Our guild is big enough to clear fear, but not by much, so the tactics are geared to help guilds in our similar predicament get out alive.  If there are other shortcuts/ideas that will help the many 65 level member raids, please post them, in the interest of thuroughness (like the cleric share health AA being a means of breaking mez for a majority of the raid).</div></div><hr />

I would like to qualify this by saying I've spent countless hours pulling casters in Nurga and they don't care whether i lead with slow or lead with a DoT; sometimes they come running and sometimes they decide to sit there and cast.  I assume that it is therefore not going to (always) work anywhere else in the game (maybe this is a recent stealth nerf, but as of 2 days ago it just isn't true).<br />

Yes it is, At Illia's someone posted that it dropped an item that was berserker only. (Not one of the equipable ones)  Its also pretty easy to tell (like the scouts with Luclin, I might be wrong though, wasnt playing when Luclin was coming out)  Or there is always the ultra rare chance its just for some quest, but thats probably not the case.</div></div><hr />

And are both low level dots in the 1-6 range of damage.  Would not be tht hard to have your fear raid run to PC and/or North Ro and get one or both those dots added to your buff line up.  That would cover pretty much any none dotter with damage per tick.  If they still needed damage per tick they could add in the crimson pots.

I forget how much damage it does when standing in it. but im almost sure it does burning damage.<br />
<br />
If so, could your MT / cleric rotation stand inside that ring, with some sort of heal over time to counteract the burn damage and still stay unmezzed?<br />

So now there is this Imp with an insane AE camping the IZ and he will remain there until such time as one of the server uber-guilds manages to find a way to kill him, or until the zone/server is reset.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem wasn't so much from the Imp as it was from all the ADDS. Dozens of them. As people try to break in, along come the normal Fear mobs with their long agro range. AE lands and they conveniently forget about whoever they had agro on and continue to go about what they were doing.... adding even more mobs to the agro. And with the AE, it's virtually impossible to CC. So, people died to the adds, a couple at a time while everyone else was virtually helpless. CR became literally impossible (Fright was DTing corpses at that point - not joking) and as such GM's had to intervene.<br />
<br />
DETAILS:<br />
<br />
From *experience* the Imp is IMMUNE to snare, root, slow, stun, and mez. Charm is unknown. He was not immune to any types of DoT's or nukes (except the stun component). The AE was not resisted by anybody even those with 400+ MR (as is expected with a -1000 modifier). While his agro range is not necessarily that of other Fear mobs, he chain agros' right along with the rest of them. If you have agro on a Fear mob, if the Imp gets within the mobs agro range, off goes the AE. Heaven help those that get shadowstepped as I did. The AE has a range of nearly (if not more than) half the zone. While it's been listed as having a range of 500, I personally found it to be more. Also, others in the raid that got shadowstepped away a few times and were trying to train adds away from the raid were getting hit with it at approx half the zone, confirming the insulting range. I don't know if anyone actually died to the Imp. Unless I am mistaken, the deaths came from just the adds.<br />
<br />
I personally believe that the AE is more than just a mez but has a stun component along with it. At one point I was DoT'd and then hit with the AE and the DoT did not remove the effect. Others in the raid tried Crimson Potions and self-DoT's to no avail. It stayed for the duration. While it being a mez + stun is not a documented fact and is just personal opinion from observation, it is certainly plausable. <br />
<br />
MORAL OF THE STORY:<br />
<br />
**NO MATTER WHAT** do not kill ANY Scarelings anywhere NEAR the IZ. Mez them, root them, train them..... do whatever you have to to make sure you are very far from the IZ before killing any. Otherwise you risk the same thing we went through: an angry Imp letting the rest of Fear have you for lunch.<br />
<br />
[edit]: It should be noted that the raid originally was a small one going after &quot;normal&quot; Fear epic mobs and was joined by more and more including my guild as time progressed. It was not 70+ from the get-go, but that was the total at the end. However, the final CR attempt was approx 30 people fully geared (most of whom are very talented and creative veteran players with higher end gear) and still got wiped. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">More ideas being kicked around in my guild...  (we have alot of epic pieces left in PoFear so we're motivated enough heh).<br />
<br />
1. Disintegrate the scarelings.<br />
<br />
It's a wizard spell that makes the mobs &quot;poof&quot;.  Would it work in this situation?  It's level restricted and I think some of the scarelings will be too high in levels to work.  But on the others, would Ireblind not spawn on a disintegrated scareling?<br />
<br />
2. Pumice stones.<br />
<br />
Have everyone's first 4 buff slots empty (junk buffs, and remove them before going in).  Have one DOT class per groups.  When Mez lands, the DOT class person dispells (or uses pumice stone) on tank, tank and dot class then pumice two other members in the group and these two then pumice the last two.  Everyone un-mezzed in the time it takes to click the pumice 3 times...  Then keep beating on Ireblind.<br />
<br />
I wish the #1 works, but #2 doesn't sound bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">correct me if I am wrong, but don't pummice stones only remove beneficial spells?  I don't think it's going to strip mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm pretty sure pumice stones aren't instant cast (i think this is what you are thinking anyway), and you cannot use detrimental spells on people you aren't dueling.  This also doesnt take into account that the mez may not be removeable this way (it's probably a curse counter type thing).  Radiant cure might cure it, but the refresh on RC is pretty long (you could hope to have at least one group not mezzed and then rotate groups as the priests in these groups use up RC--assuming RC1/2/3 remove the mez).<br />
<br />
The best bet for dealing with the scarelings is to have enough enchanters to keep them all mezzed and then never kill one (unless you are going there for the berserker epic...)--my opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, if you look at this:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4581<br />
<br />
The spell it casts is nullify magic, and I believe that removes any spell, good or bad.<br />
<br />
(some person posted on that page that they swear by it to remove root)<br />
<br />
I've HEARD that you can cast it on group members, duel or not.  I haven't tested it though...<br />
<br />
And I figured there was a casting time, anyone know what it is?<br />
<br />
Casters have a casting time too, so it's like making everyone capable of dispelling mez, not just casting classes...<br />
<br />
I've heard 3rd hand that someone killed Ireblind with four toons.  One was a dotted shaman who would dispell one of the others, then the two un-mezzed would un-mez the other two and keep going.<br />
<br />
But that was indeed 3RD hand...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, if you look at the spell text for Nullify Magic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=49), it only works on beneficial spells.  It can be casts on group members, and the cast time off the pummice stones is 3 seconds (I believe...  please correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
Basically this won't work to break mez as it's a detrimental spell.  As for a group of 4 taking Ireblind, I honestly wouldn't be shocked if they did.  The more I read about him, the More I realize he's just a big panzy once you get past the mez.  Infact, 2 SK's and a Really good druid could probably take him down (one SK for Ire and one SK for the adds).  2 SK's and 2 druids could take him down easily if they knew what to expect and were prepared for the fight.  Honestly, the more I research it, the more I am certain this fight is made more difficult by trying to get the whole raid involved.  Just streamline the fight, have only a few good peeps take him down, and have everyone chomp a little pop-corn and enjoy the mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just to let everyone know;<br />
<br />
Guildwars have been broken for a long time now. So that strategy will not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">aye...  Guild war was broken when they made the guild management system, and they have given no inclination that they plan on fixing it.  Realized this just after posting the thread, and I forgot to add that into the post... Fixing it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ROFL!!!  I think I actually just got a negative rep bump for posting this guide :p<br />
<br />
That's too funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">That is funny.<br />
<br />
You know, because, organizing things for people is wasting your time.<br />
<br />
I gave ya a + rep bump because it's a great guide, and you took your own time to summorize only a good number of posts.<br />
<br />
You didn't rush through it, used proper English, and posted the information in a short, but precise, way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, if you look at the spell text for Nullify Magic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=49), it only works on beneficial spells.

<br />
Wrong dispell works on any spell that doesn't have counters with a few exceptions. Mezes most definitely should be dispellable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wow, then I guess alla is wrong.  Thanks for the correction.  I'll try to find a place to add that tactic in the guide, as many classes can cast nullify magic...<br />
<br />
One dotter can nullify two non-dotters, and they can proceed to wake the whole guild...  My appoligies Saldaora, that could be an awsome strategy.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the correction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wow, then I guess alla is wrong.  Thanks for the correction.  I'll try to find a place to add that tactic in the guide, as many classes can cast nullify magic...<br />
<br />
I don't think alla's info is wrong more just an issue interpeting the way they say things =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I went to Fear with my guild's allys 2 days ago. The strategy they used was to kite the scarelings away ..don't kill them...then mem blur them. It worked great. We did not kill any of them and did not have to deal with the new mob at all. <br />
We did kill Fear , but sadly, their guild's shaman got the tear :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Pff, -reputation?<br />
<br />
I just +reputation'ed you.  Great post I've been reading it every day since it went up.<br />
<br />
Rookz, maybe you should verify that nullify magic works on mez'es before you change your post.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope it works from my end :)<br />
<br />
I'll be proposing the dot class only approach and the kyting the scarelings approach to my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Smyrtu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Great guide! One minor point - you always have standing HP regen when on your mount, so there's no need to click off your horse/lizard. Might as well stay mounted to get the other benefits.</div></div><hr />
