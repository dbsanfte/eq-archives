<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok yeah I am complaining again ;)<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid firstly doesnt stack with Spirit of Wood (looks like at comparitive levels we may even overwrite it but I cant test yet).<br />
All other aa of this type stack but ours and the the Druid's.<br />
I see no reason for ours not to fully stack considering all the others do.<br />
<br />
Next it doesnt stack with Diaku because of the dex/str.<br />
So for 28-35 additional dex and 35-45str we are not allowed to heal folks?<br />
Not very good logic and they need to remove this.<br />
<br />
And lastly it doesnt stack with rabid bear?<br />
Why make an under used aa less desired again because of a tiny amout of dex/str.<br />
<br />
Come on guys every other str/dex buffs we have stack but these cant?<br />
Again I fail to see the logic.<br />
<br />
To any devs that might read please allow us to stack with Druids and our own buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, first before you complain, spend the other 10 AAs on Ancestral Aid, because at lvl 3 its estimated 333 hp/tick 90 str/dex over cap.  I am the only shaman in my guild that has this AA due to the fact that I am the only shaman left in my guild atm that is playing regularly, but I join the druid channel since it doesnt stack with Wood and when its time for the melee to disc I pop in MGB AA.  It helps our main raid leader is a Druid but still this works just fine if you can come up with a rotation with the druids on when to set yours off.  At lvl 1 and 2 its just novelty but at lvl 3 and on a raid with MGB it becomes a utility that you offer the guild.  I think it also helps stackablity in some cases cause you can have each shaman cycle in their MGB AA on each target you hit when the melee are discing.  Every little bit helps IMO.</div></div><hr />

Would have been nice if ours stacked with everyone elses but I'll take not stacking with wood. At least it stacks with clerics and our own HoT like bot or serenity.<br />
<br />
Next it doesnt stack with Diaku because of the dex/str.<br />
So for 28-35 additional dex and 35-45str we are not allowed to heal folks?<br />

<br />
Easy enough to solve, get the second level and it will overwrite diaku. Could really care less if they stack or not I rarely use diaku.<br />
<br />
And lastly it doesnt stack with rabid bear?<br />
Why make an under used aa less desired again because of a tiny amout of dex/str.<br />

Could care less if it stacked with rabid bear or not. Personally I'm over 500 aa's already and with OoW out rabid bear isn't even on the radar. I've got at least another 300 aa's to go before i'd even think about it.<br />
<br />
As far as using it in MGB's on raids I'd say that the second level is more than enough to work for raids. First level of ancestral aid is the exact same hps healed as the first level of druids OoW upgrade so there shouldn't be any problem there. Already better than the maxed MGB wood chains of old. I'd say second level to ensure no stacking issues with diaku if anyone happens to have gotten it on there raid altho first level would work as long as someone with the second level or higher leads off and overwrites diaku's before hand.<br />
<br />
Personally I really like it. Combined with the epic it gives you viable group heals. With 2 of them you don't have to worry about not using it as much since you have another up. I don't have any plans to get the third level in the imidiate future but will get it eventually. Just too many other aa's to work on right now after hitting 70 than to spend 5 aa's for 33hps a tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First level will overwrite SotW 3 if its casted by a lower level druid. I just got level 1 of ours today and immediately tried casting it with wood. It overwrite it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have lvl2 of this aa, so far i found it stacking with Cleric line and overwriting SotW as stated above. <br />
Did anyone test stacking with paragon? didn't have a BL in group yet to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I certainly am not going to get excited about Ancestral Aid overwriting Diaku but if it overwrites Wunshi's Focusing I have a big problem.  It would take level 3 to overwrite but levels 1 and 2 would be blocked by Wunshi.  I always have Focus on me and group.  Ancestral Aid is worthless if it is blocked by or overwrites Wunshi.<br />
<br />
The description in Lucy (might be wrong) is that Aid raises the _caps_ for str and dex, it isn't directly a str/dex buff and should not be affected by any str/dex buff the same way the Bard songs raise caps but aren't blocked by or overwrite those spells.<br />
<br />
I haven't checked my Aid yet to see if it actually increases str/dex or merely raises the caps.  I'll check next time I'm in game.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's a /bug report situation.  If it's working as intended then I want my AAs refunded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just tried it and Ancestral Aid does both.  It raises the caps AND buffs str/dex for 30, 60, 90 (depending on level).  The buff component should be removed or allowed to stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Upset? no, annoyed? yes<br />
<br />
I just find it absurd they would even have a stacking issue with them.<br />
<br />
Diaku also doesnt stack with Wunshi which I just got today which is also absurd. The whole point of Diaku was a str/dex buff independant of Focus line. If they had combined it in with Focus then fine but they didnt so they should still stack.<br />
<br />
We shouldnt have a stacking problem with Druids period.<br />
Why should we step on their toes when all other HoT aa stack?<br />
The answer is we shouldn't whether we work it out with the Druids on a raid is a moot point it still should not exist.<br />
<br />
Can we work around it? Yes<br />
Should we have to? No<br />
<br />
Why should these spells stack with every other str/dex buffs but our own?<br />
I can't come up with a logical reason why they shouldn't stack.<br />
<br />
Sony should fix it. It is not game changing just pure annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sony should fix it. It is not game changing just pure annoyance.<br />
<br />
It is a game change. Every group HoT that stacks is another Hot that can be mgb on a raid adding that much more healing to the entire raid. In situations where your dealing with large ae's/ae dots have yet another HoT that stacked would make things easier and would change the game. I fully expected our group Hot aa to not stack with someone. Bsts probably would have been better and made some sense but as long as it wasn't clerics I was happy.<br />
<br />
Bigsnack For'Mobs,<br />
Why wouldn't it stack with focus? it shares no slot with common effects. There's no reason why it shouldn't stack with old focus or new. As far as only focus goes I can say from experience that they stack fine. New focus I don't know yet but wouldn't expect it to have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I said the new Wunshi Focus because Lucy shows that it does not stack.  As has been pointed out though Lucy has been wrong several times on the new stuff.</div></div><hr />

People still want Diaku cast on them? I was unaware.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes people still want Diaku in Uqua where all stats take a huge nose dive.<br />
<br />
Lots of folks lose enough str in Uqua that they walk at a crawl without Diaku and I either overwrite it and have to rebuff or bounce.<br />
Diaku exists to stack. It was their whole point of giving us this spell at all.<br />
<br />
Diaku doesnt stack with Ancetral Aid or Wunshi now.<br />
<br />
And my guild Druids are less than thrilled with it not stacking with Wood.<br />
If its heal issue they could have simply made the heal portions not stack like they do with other spells. There is absolutely ZERO need for my spell to overwrite theirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ancestral Aid is the same type of spell as Spirit of the Wood, so of course it doesn't stack. Two druids can't stack this spell, two Shamans can't stack this spell, so why should a Shaman + a Druid stack?<br />
<br />
It sure needs to stack with everything else though.<br />
<br />
BTW, cast time is instant, refresh is 15 min, cost is 5+5+5, and the level requirements are 67, 68, 69. For those of us who are level 67, getting the second level of it is not a usable work-around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Diaku and Wunshi stack now at least. There was never anything on Lucy to indicate they would not but always got a did not take hold message casting it...<br />
<br />
As for AA and SotW being the same spell?<br />
<br />
Wood at level 3 does:<br />
Increase hp by 250/tick<br />
Increase Damage Shield by 55<br />
Increase AC by 48<br />
<br />
3rd level of AA does:<br />
Increase str cap by 90<br />
Increase agi cap by 90<br />
Increase dex cap by 90<br />
Increase hp by 333/tick<br />
Increase str by 90<br />
Increase agi by 90<br />
Increase dex by 90<br />
<br />
At the VERY minimum the icons should stack and the healing should not like the way several haste type spells will stack.<br />
We should still gain the 55 DS and 48ac from Druids bare min not overwrite them.<br />
<br />
But since every other healing aa stacks with every other class EXCEPT our new aa stacking with the Druids I will maintain that they should stack and we should not overwrite them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually I don't believe Paragon stacks with either the Clerics or ours/Druids. I forget which. So there is a precedent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spirit of the Grove at level 3 does:<br />
slot 4:  	Increase Hitpoints v2 by 333 per tick<br />
slot 8: 	Increase Damage Shield by 70<br />

<br />
Ancestral Aid at level 3 does:<br />

slot 5: 	Increase STR by 90, over cap<br />
slot 6: 	Increase DEX by 90, over cap<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it wasn't too long ago that threads consisted of people complaining that shammies had no group heal. with Oow we get 2 group heals. and there are still complaints...  :( <br />
<br />
i will agree with 1 thing though...it shouldn't totally overwrite Diaku. just temporarily overwrite it. both icons are still present but Diaku takes a back seat until Ancenstral Aid is complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ancestral Aid is by far one of the best new AA's for shaman's In OOW I have it at lvl 3 ATM. Heals close to 400 a tick and mine lasts for 36 sec.  It has saved me and my group many many times and with onaly 15 min recast time makes it even better.  + It also can be used with MGB!!! Making it a must have AA for all shamans..... Just what I think...</div></div><hr />
