<br />
Grats warriors!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hakslat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am from Kalran's server also.  There was talk of this in the bazaar but some one said he used a tactic that could be practically used on all the dragons there.  The Tactic was rumored to be so good that if he did post it or gave a log, it could possible be considered an exploit.  And with all the nerfs flying about I am sure it probably could be preceived as one.  I just wish I did not have rumors to go by and he would just Post the damn log or even the only barely visable screenshot of yeldema he claims to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hakslat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL, woot<br />
<br />
Just quickly logged back on to M-Thule and verified the rumor.<br />
<br />
Apparently, it is true that Kalran's method of killing Yeldema can infact be used on all, to most, Western Waste dragons.  Not only that it can be DONE BY ANY CLASS.<br />
<br />
Any class can take Yeldema; a lvl 52-53 dragon, with this Techinque no wonder Kalran won't post the log.<br />
<br />
Funny too because as a Shaman I kinda weakly fear kite this way with my symbol of inny, blind and my dots (no dog).  LOL<br />
<br />
It is true that the mob did hit Kalran a bit and summon him some.  After all need to get procs off ;).   But, Basically, Kalran snared and blinded Yeldema.  Preventing Yeldema from summoning him and damaging him, then, LOL, hurled bolders at Yeldema.  No wonder Kalran said the techique could be used on caster dragons.  Dragons can't cast if they are running away snared.<br />
<br />
If verant found that most 60 mobs cannot be feared kited (infact many of them are immune to fear) but can be blind kited.  If verant knew that mass people started blind kiting higher summoning mobs.  Blind would be nerfed.<br />
<br />
Kudos Kalran and his guild nice tactic.<br />

Nope.  lol<br />

I went to school during the 80's.  We had valley-girls and preppies -- neither worth altering speech patterns over.  'Language' is the attempt to convey your thoughts to someone else.  The clearer you do this, the better at language you are.  If you let silly, faddish slang change your speech into something less coherent then your brain is just MTV playdoh.<br />

The &quot;teh&quot; in question is a Jeff K reference from somethingawful.com. So &quot;meschit&quot; sorry if slang or inside jokes offend you, take your meds grandpa. Then again, since you apparently run around declaring yourself fecal matter, you dont have a lot of room to talk. <br />
<br />
Well Flab, you young whippersnapper, I didn't think I made the impression that I was offended by Hak's jargon, but to clear things up, I was more amused than anything else. The words may change throughout the years, but the intent has always been clear...this is how I talk to look cool.<br />
<br />
As for any scatological meaning to my name, it's actually Yiddish for &quot;so cute I'm ugly&quot;, only I found out I had misspelled it and it should be &quot;Miesceit.&quot; At least that's what I'm going to tell any GM that gives me schit about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hakslat, you are looking like TEH n00b, since last I checked, castersrealm message board was not ezboard run. If you were a regular on the crucible you would recognize the phrase that is so widespread among us, and wouldn't have made the blunder of attempting to flame the entire shaman board. Given that you don't give your class,  I begin to question whether or not you are actually a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I went back though and reread hakslat's posts.<br />
<br />
I will make sure I ask him from now on if I can think something is funny or not. <br />
<br />
And wouldnt most people have the smarts to not make your very first post on a board a flame?<br />
<br />
Since you have managed to offend yourself by adding words to a phase that was coined by a moron to begin with, I would suggest you take up a new hobby that doesnt involve reading. It will save you quite the frustration in the future.<br />
<br />
Oh, and check the guide posted in teh alchemy section if you think there isn't any good info on this site reguarding alchemy. <br />
<br />
But who knows, maybe you read the title of that section of the board, and instead of reading it &quot;Alchemy&quot; you understood it as &quot;Alchemy: shaman take it in the face&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sensing a common thread here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep the phrase is by a moron.<br />
It is not funny<br />
And the phrase actually in game; known to the select few on the board and myself to where it orginates, but doesn't stop the majority of kidding players that don't understand the meaning from actually making fun of YOU.<br />
<br />
Look I gave you an example as to what a group of players thought of the phrase upon first hearing it.  Whether, you agree with their thoughts or not doesn't much make a difference now does it.<br />
<br />
The phrases both of them are stupid neither should be used.<br />
<br />
By the way I did check out the alchemy on this site ... eqtraders offers a lot more info.  sorry<br />

Oh dear lord, people that have no idea who I am other than a bunch of pixles in a game think I am a dumbass. The people here like to joke around on the boards and in the channel.

to you and Tgout and you fozy, from the first page if any of you actually read.<br />
I used the J and F*ing and Sh*t as possible substitutes rather than actually using bad language. A possible restriction on the board. <br />
<br />
To why I used those spellings is totally unrealated to your ebonic crazed explanations that you all made up LOL.  Its funny its like your all children that don't read and when you don't like the way something is going you result to the weak defense fo name calling too.  Pathetic.<br />
<br />
as for the asshat label.  Keep talking like babies it fits you.  It seems like a lot of you like coming up with kid like phrases.  <br />
<br />
Posters from Crucible as the masses created on &quot;M-Thule&quot; like to: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Hakslat, three things to chew on for ya.<br />
1.) Guess ezboard is using some l33t scheme to get &gt;&gt;FORUMS.INTEREALMS.COM/SHAMAN&lt;&lt; ( hint not ezboard.com) to alter your posting and viewing of the crucible and castersrealm to be more fun by viewing them in ezboard mode. I know it's lame to pick on something like that, but c'mon, call us morons and you dont even know the freaking board you using.<br />
2.) To my knowledge, IN TEH FACE wasnt meant to be an insult. Particularly not in the first post it was used in. On the crucible I've always seen it as a fun phrase that everyone uses, much like AYBABTU was for a while. If I am in error about it being an insult, someone please correct me, but I haven't seen it as such yet.<br />
3.) Alchemy hasn't been changed much in a while, why the heck would we need to have more posts to be useful? I've compared the alchemy information on both sites, and see little reason to insult this board's forum. <br />
<br />
If anyone should be known as sheepish and childish, it would be you. You still have not realized you were wrong about calling the forums.interealms.com/xxx sites. Your flames are weak, and resort to the equivalence of a monkey flinging fecal matter at passerby.  If you are going to act intellectually superior, at least check your grammar, spelling and basic sentence structure. <br />
<br />
Finally, in the words of Hawkeye Pierce, &quot;THBBBPBT&quot;. I'm sure you'd notice your face is slightly moist after that raspberry , but you are probably used to it from the drool you produce in your dribble you call posts.</div></div><hr />
