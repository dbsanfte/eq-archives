<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Go to the middle of the beach next to the water, park your pet, and pull mobs from all sides.  With a little trial and error, you will find that you can pull mobs from a good distance without aggroing others. Mobs start conning light blue at 42, but even at that level there are more than enough to pull.  I expect to solo here until 44.  Right next to you on the beach is where Mokon Brokenskull spawns, and if you are lucky enough for him to spawn AND you can take him, he drops some good loot. (a decent charm and a bow worth 2k)<br />
<br />
Every once in a while they resist the DOTs or Slow, but not enough to warrant debuffing them before casting other spells.  <br />
<br />
Overall this is an easy place to solo if you are tired of soloing in Dawnshroud Peaks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I took my necro here this place is pretty nice, I remember taking my monk here in his early 40's I believe this is certainly one of the better places to go. Also if any of you take a necro or chanter for that matter, hit a undead mob with the highest MR you got charm and you tear through those mobs like a hot knife through butter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's the minimum level you would recommend for a shaman to try Gunthak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending how well equiped you are, I am guessing lower to mid 40's? You can get adds, and training to zone is somewhat tough with the water.</div></div><hr />
