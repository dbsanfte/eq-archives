<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well today I broke 1700hp unbuffed at 53. Then I looked at my equip and I could raise it another 100 150hp quite easily. My wis would suffer only slightly ( 169 to about 160 ). Should I? I have fungi/jbb/ and epic is only a small distance away ( hole /boggle ).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HP is a useful stat.  Wisdom is not.  So, you're on the right track anyway.  What I'd look at instead is your level of AC to HP.  Cap your AC first (1100-ish), then worry about your HP.  HP becomes more useful when you start deailing with Cann5, but it's good to start early.  Just don't ignore AC at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AC is about 910 atm unbuffed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't say wisdom is NOT useful, merely that it's less useful than AC and HP. But you need balance in all things, having a wisdom so low that all your spells fizzle and you can't cast a round of buffs before you go OOM would be annoying to say the least.<br />
<br />
However a combat wisdom of 160 is quite high by some shamans' standards :) (mine included)</div></div><hr />
