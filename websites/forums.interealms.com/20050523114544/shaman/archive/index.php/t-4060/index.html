When a necro starts out saying 'I've been thinking...' you know there's trouble a-brewin'. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe  i've been posting on that thread.  It is quite an interesting thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like how the necros think they know everything, and i especially like how someone wanted like a 100ppgem component for every torpor cast or something....<br />
<br />
My fav part is where some dofus is going on about how slow is irrelevant at level 60, cause of torpor...Somehow not grasping the fact that torpor works as well as it does BECAUSE we have slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My favorite line was that cannibalize is a cool spell but it'd neve be done in combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;But the fact that shamans can almost out-dot us&quot;<br />
<br />
no...freaking...way...sorry...uhh...NO...<br />
<br />
I played a necro to 55 and let me tell you..no way in hell can a shaman out dot a necro...no way.<br />
<br />
E-bolt, bane of nife, etc, have good damage, but something they dont tell you..REALLY HIGH RESIST RATE.....remember, necromancers get e-bolt, plague, VoS, and scourge as well.<br />
<br />
Necromancers also get Lifetap dots.  Cessation of Cor, Ignite blood, pyro, pyre, devouring darkness, and splurt.  Let me tell you, you can fight on a necro all night long and when you see &quot;your splurt spell was resisted&quot; your like ***?? It resists maybe once per day..maybe.. (this is in XP solo and group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Omg, I'll be a necro whining. First I see. Umm, well actually I'll take that back quite some cause all the necros I've grown to know better in the end game have still enjoyed their class and excelled in it amazingly. But some folks would just like to be the only class who can do it all and better than anyone else what not.<br />
<br />
Nice suggestions there, give necros clarity stacking (i presume they want KEI on top of their own health to mana line), also they'd like to have better crowd controll (time to delete all enchanters) and slows and what nots. Why do they want to make necros most valued class in groups when it's solo class. Necros can still contribute good amount in groups, just not as good as classes which were ment for grouping. Well I guess many get the initial power rush of the necros (and powerfull they are all the way to the end) but get disapointed when they can't do it all as per groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm the VERY PROUD owner of a lvl 44 necro<br />
<br />
Lol wait until he meets shamans high enough to click JBB.  He'll really whine then.<br />
<br />
I was tempted to post a reply to this thread but decided it wasnt worth registering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">10$ says he'll be rerolling after lvl 51 latest when he realizes that VI didn't create God class to do it all and name it 'necro'. Well maybe he'll make a shaman then and realize that they didn't name it 'shaman' either... One day he might notice they named it group ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just saw that post, and how uniformed necros are.  It is not like when you hit 60 you get your free copy of torpor. ROFL<br />
<br />
/em still waiting for her copy of torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I took the bait and posted on the thread.  My post is way too long :(  I feel dirty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*sigh*  You guys took something posted on a Caster's Realm forum seriously?<br />
<br />
Trust me, if you want to know how the real Necromancers feel, go to EQNecro...and avoid the whiners on CRealm.</div></div><hr />

I just saw that post, and how uniformed necros are.<br />
<br />
About as uninformed as most people (shaman included) that post at the caster's realm boards.  hell, they're one step removed from everlore there!!  :D<br />
<br />
why is it every time some clueless assclown makes a stupid post on some class' message boards, some people on this board get so worked up?  &quot;Druids are at it again,&quot; &quot;look at the clerics crying now,&quot; &quot;omg can you believe what the necros are saying now!&quot;  C'mon people these idiots don't represent their entire classes anymore than wildaar's charisma theories represent ours ;)  besides that, who gives a rat's ass about the sagely opinions of a ** 44th level ** necro!?!? <br />
<br />
Like most classes, necros have some issues that should be addressed by Verant, and the discussions about &quot;fixing&quot; the class get kinda wacky at times.  Take a look at our own &quot;wish list&quot; posts - you get some pretty stupid sh^t flowing from the keyboards of some shaman too!  Most of the people posting on threads like that are as clueless about shaman as the average shaman is about any other class.<br />
<br />
As another poster said, if you want to see the opinions of real necros, look to necro.eqclasses.com.  at least there you have necros with a modicum of intelligence and experience.<br />
<br />
(yes, I have a 57 necro :D )</div></div><hr />
