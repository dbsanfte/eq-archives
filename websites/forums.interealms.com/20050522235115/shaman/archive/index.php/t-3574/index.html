<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am so glad they are keeping a list of players who have had their names changed.<br />
Not so easy to sneak past a bad rep now, and I hope they keep their lists updated and public to help protect their legit customers.<br />
<br />
More info can be found  here (http://eq.castersrealm.com/).<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just to clarify, I am not saying that everyone who has participated in the name change service is trying to escape a rep, because, obviously, that is not true.<br />
It is those who take advantage of this name change service to escape their rep that I am speaking of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Konnen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have mixed feelings about this Rodahn.  <br />
<br />
On one hand, I feel that the list would be good for people who changed their name and want to show others who they used to be, to keep the trust.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are people who want name changes to get a 2nd chance at rebuilding a rep OR to avoid offensive people.  This list really hurts those people.<br />
<br />
My personal view on this whole thing is that VI should NOT publish a list of name changes UNLESS the person changing agreed to have their name listed.  I could careless if some people feel they have a right to know who changed their name to what, it's actually none of their business and they need to get on with their life instead of worrying about another changing their name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These lists are pretty good for a laugh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Konnen,<br />
<br />
There may be some good reasons why some people need to change their names. However, after seeing the list for the Nameless, alot of people on the list changed their names to avoid their bad reputaion (ie. scammers and cheats). That is the best reason in my opinion of the list to be published, so those &quot;scammers &amp; cheaters&quot; are known, by their new names. Believe me, on the &quot;Nameless Tavern&quot;, that list was put out right away, and I can see by comments, who to keep away from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lo and F'ing behold, one of our server's ALL TIME biggest *******s and scammers changed his name.<br />
<br />
For all you BB people out there, take a look at that list.<br />
<br />
Dilusion = Despond<br />
<br />
Thank GOD that list is out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally think they never should be able to change their name.<br />
<br />
Only reason they should, if it's objectable.  And for some reason, there's been names that GM's haven't changed, even by request of the player (with the objectable name).   Talk about mind boggling.<br />
<br />
As for those trying to rebuild their rep, they shouldn't have put themselves in that position in the first place.  They can always restart at level one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very simple reason they are doing it...<br />
<br />
You simply fill out SOE's form (which you use to request, for each character, a rename of your character's name to an unused name on your server that complies with all of the terms and conditions of SOE’s character naming policy) and SOE will charge you the applicable fee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Ramhorn. People should NEVER be allowed to change their name. You made a stupid name, that's your problem. You got a bad reputation, thats your problem. Live with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm glad the list gets published, because my server was the last /movelog server and it seems every scammer and jackass who had bad reps on their own server moved to AB. <br />
<br />
When our community board went live we had a ton of messages from nice people on the scammers original servers saying beware of soandso he's just moved to your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gotta agree with Haleice here.  We seem to have an abundace of jack-ass scammers and idiots on our server.  As said, a lot of the scamming, training, loot whore idiots descended upon AB and thankfully most of them were pointed out.  If they were able to change there names without any form of public record then I think an awful lot of people would stop standard pick up groups and it would be a hell of a lot more difficult to get into a guild as they would have to tighten up to try to make sure these people dont get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also have mixed feelings about this.  I don't know if anyone has changed their names on the Tribunal server or not, but i have met some people who have pretty awful reps and if they disappear we can go to the list to see if they had a name change.  But for the people who just didnt like their name, or changed it for privacy (my first name was changed by a GM because it was a very funny tribal Barb type name)  They have that reason only to so, and if privacy was an issue, than everything could go awry.  If you had the choice to have your name listed, nobody in their right mind would unless they like to be exposed.<br />

Just my 2 gp.<br />
