<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, <br />
<br />
Just wanted to introduce myself, and ask a question if I could.  <br />
<br />
I started a Iksar Shaman to play along with my brother's monk.  <br />
<br />
My main question is, how do you find it best to organize your spellbook.  I have never played a caster before, and even at level 14 I tend to do a lot of searching for spells.  I tried a few different attempts to organize, but nothing really seemed to work.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There was some guides already submitted that explained how lots of people organized their spell books. You can probably find it with a bit of searching.<br />
<br />
I still have a pretty unorganized book. I just put spells in the book as I get them. Eventually I'll create some Hotkeys to /book 1 for buffs /book 10 for heals/regen and that sort of thing. I haven't looked over all of the shaman line of spells, but from memory I'll probably set it up like this:<br />
<br />
Stat/Hp/Haste etc... Buffs /book whatever<br />
Heals/Regen<br />
Dots/DD<br />
Slows/Debuffs<br />
Utility spells Gate/Invis etc..<br />
Pet<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is some other stuff I've missed that doesn't fit into those categorys but that's a rough estimate. Also, when I organize the spells in my book, I usually put the spells in the opposite order, so if my buffs are from book pages 1-10 for isntance, I'll put my highest level spells towards the page 1 end. So /book 1 will take me to my newest usually currently used spells - I guess you could do it the other way too:) <br />
<br />
I'll probably wait a bit before I organize my book, to see what new spells I don't have printed out - ancient spells and new spells that were introduced with luclin, curse spells. Then I'll make sure I have room and a slot for ever spell when I organize my book. I'd hate to organize my book then a new spell I didn't have written down, get that spell and have no room in that area of my book, so it would overlap. Then spend the time right clicking and moving spells around to make room.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />
