<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was considering purchasing a fungi staff, verant mentioned they fixed some regen stacking issues in the patch, but never went into detail... so my question is, will the effect from the staff still overwrite sow and stack with regrowth after the patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it has been fixed so that the staff does NOT stack with regrowth.  I have no first hand experience but you need to check in the patch thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hrmm...Verant has taken quite a bit of our regen away (Fungal staff, lowering of AAXP regen rates, etc) and I'm sure more changes will be discovered in the coming days.<br />
<br />
Question:  Until now, Shamans have been distinctly different from other Wis casters with regard to equipment choices...we want HPs, and a LOT of them...insane regen plus insane canni was our choice (where Clerics and Druids choose high Wisdom for mana).<br />
<br />
What, if any, changes will this patch have on that strategy?  Will our total regen rate be lowered so much that shamans start to explore other strategies (maybe pure AC?).  <br />
Just my ramblings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm - First thing I'm going to check when I get on is if Regen/fungic Tunic's stack with Regen/Chloroplast/Regrowth.   If the Staff doesn't stack then it's possible that Tunic's don't as well. <br />
<br />
Anyone confirm one way or the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/rude Verant<br />
Anyone know what level it can be clicked?  I would like to know whether to sell mine for 50pp to a level 45 beastlord or 200pp to a newbie one.  <br />
<br />
This is the first time my bank account has been hit by the nerf stick.  I bought one 2 weeks ago.  Nerfing 2 year old items is BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can confirm it still stacks with at least the Fungi Patch tunic, I'd assume regular fungi is the same, but any cast regen is ovewritten, or blocked by Staff.<br />
<br />
Guess I get to decide what to do, try to sell it to get some money back, or toss it at my beastlord twink =(.<br />

<br />
And here's Alan/absor in response to some very angry monks on the subject of the AA nerf: <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm committing a personal sin. I’m posting to a thread that I haven’t finished reading all the way through. I’m sorry about that. I’ll try to finish it later, right now I’m hunting for patch repercussions. <br />
<br />
The change to the regeneration thing was not really a bug fix, it was a change of opinion. As should be obvious from this long-as-hell thread, neither leaving it as it was nor fixing it would end up being the ‘right’ thing to do when it comes down to public opinion. Folks on one side or the other of the discussion are going to end up displeased.<br />
<br />
We made the change because we thought it was the right change. If anything, I’d rather you all be angry with us than ripping each other apart over this. We basically came to the conclusion that there really isn’t any reason for two races to get more from the same ability than all the other races.<br />
<br />
I’m sorry for those that are unhappy about the change. And I’m not real happy about anyone that’s here gloating about it either.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&gt; is there a msg whne you cast a spell or something that will tell you if theres a stacking issue or will it just not take effect?<br />
<br />
There's a message, but it's next to useless because it doesn't tell you *what* conflicts. Could be a bard song, could be a single-target version of a group buff, could be some random right-click effect, could be a self-only spell the target has.... it's a major PITA figuring it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As if stacking regrowth with fungi staff regen was not an exploit.<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Yes i have one. Yes i will still use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, this sorta sucks, but its not a major nerf in my opinion. <br />
<br />
I mostly used the staff indoors in groups or soloing... afterall this is where you spend most of your time. Indoors, where you cant cast sow. Which meant having mad discipline on refreshing regrowth and fungal so as not to loose one of them and thus have to get out of dungeon to refresh sow. Ive tried keeping both refreshed, but sooner or later you get a bad pull and have to concentrate on other things than refreshing buffs, or you get the no-blinking buffs bug.<br />
<br />
I use the staff at raids to get mana back, i havent casted regrowth on myself in a dungeon in ages. With a hotkey setup i can equip, fungal and deequip in less than a second. If i need some movement speed i just click it away.<br />
<br />
And like mentioned, its not like any of us ever thought this wasnt a bug and wasnt going to be fixed. The only reason it worked in the first place is that we have the sowboots which casts a sow that is somehow 'different' than normal sow when it comes to stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My favorite item is almost becoming a common one...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The thing that annoys me even more now, is that Absor's response doesnt make any sense to me at all.  <br />
<br />
Essentially he says they did it because they thought it wrong that 2 races got a greater advantage.  They were aware - and didnt like the fact - that this would upset a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Well if thats the case why couldn't they give everyone 2pts regen per AA pt? <br />
<br />
Its NOT like 2pts was overly powerful: the general opinion on this board is that AA is something you don't do until level 60 - its not worth the exp cost until you have nothing else do use the exp for.</div></div><hr />

VI on the shaman class:<br />
<br />
&quot;Our policy is 'Take take take' kkthx&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am very upset with this change.  I bought my staff a couple of weeks ago for 8kpp and was very happy using it.  8kpp is about 3 weeks of my eq time.  The staff is now useless to me - I'd rather keep regen memmed and use it than equip this staff every 5 minutes.  Two months ago or so I spent 3 days getting a fd item for my SK, about 2 days after I got it VI made it a charged item again making it worthless.  Seems very unfair to take away without giving something back - VI coulda made staff where u didn't have to equip it or something.  I am starting to find myself a little bored with EQ at times lately and this policy of taking things away from us is not going to help keep me playing.  There are all sorts of items with really great effects in game, which give an advantage to the people who possess them - these folks played the game and earned these itmes in one way or another - it is simply not fair to make changes to existing items without some form of compensation.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an address I can write to to complain about this to VI?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas about what to do with this staff now that I don't use it?  Is it if value to someone else?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">pretty sure the staff would be damn useful to a class that cant cast regrowth...Can Necro's use it?  They can convert health to mana just like we can.<br />

<br />
Edit:  just looked it up...Druid/Shaman/Beastlord only.  Bleh.  Guess it isn't as useful as I was thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Grickk:  I'd think only the staff is now of highest value to beastlords, followed by us, followed by druids (who hare to be snared more than anything).  In any case, the value has definitely tanked.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well at least we weren't as beat down with the nef stick as monks were a few patches ago.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What Verant did about the Fungi Staff is just F'd up.<br />
<br />
For those of you that are unfamiliar with the item, here is a little info and History.<br />
<br />
First, here are the stats:<br />
<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM <br />
Damage: 18<br />
Delay: 35 <br />
Ratio: 1.944 Amazing <br />
Wis: +8 Int: +8 Cha: -10 Fire Resist: +5 <br />
Weight: 1.1 <br />
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Blunt <br />
Classes: Beastlord Shaman Druid <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Inventory Slot: Primary Melee <br />
<br />
<br />
The 'Pre-Pre-nerf' version of this staff could be clicked from your inventory (meaning any class could have instant regrowth), until today, they were 'priceless'.<br />
<br />
The 'Ok, this item sounds GREAT, and it was... but here was the catch... <br />
You wear the Staff, you click it, and you have 'Fungal Regrowth', a highend HP regen effect that 'snared' you.<br />
<br />
Snare is a dangerous thing to have on you, but shaman LOVED it because you could just click off the effect, and just quick click your epic shoes (Effect: Spirit of Wolf)<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
Since 'Fungal Regrowth' overwrites 'SoW', it was possible to 'Stack' Regens (Much like people stack Bard songs with shaman buffs).<br />
<br />
It was possible (until today) to have 'Fungal Regrowth' and 'Regrowth' going at once... which was nice if you happen to have a 'Fungi Tunic' (Which has an effect of 'Fungal Regrowth' without the snare effect)<br />
<br />
So what happened?<br />
<br />
The staff became valuable to ONLY Shaman (can be done with Beastlords/Druids, but it's 'Shaman' value made it too expensive a toy for them to play with).<br />
<br />
When I bought my Fungi Staff, they were going for about 30-35k, I did some wheeling and dealing and got it for 20k.<br />
<br />
I paid 20k because of what it did for me, and how it effected my character.<br />
<br />
Is it an Exploit?<br />
<br />
I say no, and here is why.<br />
<br />
Fungi Covered Greatstaff had been nerfed before, and there is NO way they didn't know of it's stacking abilities... they just didn't know how to fix it, so they left it... <br />
<br />
Did they think it was a big enough problem at the time? Apparently not, because the thing still drops.<br />
<br />
Shamans, of all servers, and all levels were saving there hard earned plat for 'Fungi Tunics' and 'Fungi Staffs' to get the most out of 'Cannibalize' (convert HP's to Mana).<br />
<br />
So how does this effect us?<br />
<br />
Well, I can tell you for one thing, Crystalflake is pissed off because she bought one for 17k two days ago, and she my as well have left it on her corpse to rot.<br />
<br />
Shaman went out and paid that HIGH DEMAND price for an item that gave them HIGH COST results...<br />
<br />
...what do they have now? <br />
<br />
AN F-ING PAPERWEIGHT<br />
<br />
This is wrong because people work hard for their plat, and camp long for their items... and one patch later, have their **** worth 10% of what they formerlly were worth.<br />
<br />
What can we do about this?<br />
<br />
Unite<br />
<br />
The safehouse bitch's and **** happens... so we gotta too.<br />
<br />
If they don't wanna return the functionality of the staff... then they can make it stop dropping and make it sellable to vendors for 20,000 plat.<br />
<br />
Right now, I am VERY pissed off, and I feel VERY cheated.<br />
<br />
I want something to happen about it, and my voice isn't enough.<br />
<br />
Please write to your GM's/Verant CS to have something to justify their loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">15k....thats what I paid for mine about 2 months ago.  Now, the most enjoyable item I own is all messed up.<br />
<br />
Are they just TRYING to make the game less enjoyable?  ANYTHING that is fun, or decreases tedium is sought after and destroyed.<br />
<br />
HOW IN THE HELL can you people nerf that stick and not nerf the fungi tunic?<br />
<br />
GAH.<br />
<br />
Hey Absor....  I quit, ya peckerhead.  And dont patronize me with your dumbass &quot;lets make peace, it was all for the best&quot; bs responses.<br />
<br />
What really really sucks is the fact that Im (or was) such a big supporter of Verant.  I've been here since beta 4, and now they have finally went too far.  3+ years, and Im leaving...wonder who else less devoted players will after this...../ponder monk boards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The more I think about this, the more irritated I get.<br />
<br />
I thought VI's policy on item nerfing was to only retroactively nerf when an item was vastly overpowering to the game (e.g. Manastone).  The fungi staff certainly isn't overpowering - have you ever seen the quote &quot;I just couldn't have beat uber_mob_01 without the fungi staff !!!&quot;?  or &quot;Sorry, you're not welcome in our group because you're missing the fungi staff!&quot;  I don't think so.  <br />
<br />
In their mind, this doesn't apply because it's a stacking issue, not an item issue.  To anyone who has one, though, this is a retroactive item nerf.  As this item was of the most use to the shaman class, this is a retroactive shaman item nerf - from my perspective no different than if they nerfed the epic DoT or the Bracer.<br />
<br />
Free regen and free damage are a couple of the most powerful effects in the game.  This staff has been a top-tier shaman item for a long time (what, two years?  When did Kunark come out?) precisely because of the game mechanic that allows this stacking.   It provides a nice power bump in the mid levels, and is a nice downtime-reducer at higher levels (or when res effects are on.)   Now, suddenly and without warning, they nerf the power boost into uselessness- making this basically a toy.<br />
<br />
How are people supposed to know it was an &quot;exploit&quot; to stack affects this way?  It's been two years!!  Is it an &quot;exploit&quot; to med without sitting while on a horse?  No, because in some developer conference someone 99% of the EQ community has never heard of made a comment about it.  So now we're all basically forced to follow out-of-game discussions to know whether a long-existing top-tier item will suddenly stop working?  IMHO, this is ridiculous!<br />
<br />
I guess I shouldn't complain...  Feral Ancient Avatar now stacks properly, and there is a new pottery-made potion that takes a million components, a million skills, tons of interdependance, and a nice investment to create a 25 pound item which replicates (with a 30 second cast time) an effect I can buy from any druid for 10 pp.  /boggle  What the HELL are these guys thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hail!<br />
<br />
All I have to say is OMG!<br />
Did NOT know about this nerf until reading this thread.<br />
<br />
I JUST almost bought one tonight.  I only had 5kpp in the bank.<br />
Someone shouted PC on fungi staff.  Usually I ask buying or selling about an item I have interest in, but I was in a hurry and about to zone.  I replied /ooc about the same as the tunic, maybe somewhat less.  (or something alond those lines)<br />
<br />
Right before I zone, he does another PC on JB arms.<br />
I reply 20-30kpp.  (DOH! Thought he said legs.)<br />
<br />
After I zone, I /tell him about how WAY off I was, and give him a PC of 300-500pp on the arms.  We chat a bit.  Turns out he's thinking of starting a twink shaman for a long time.  So long that he's been hoarding items for over a year.  He wanted to sell the fungi staff to BUY JB armour. :P  GO figure.  He was a warrior btw.<br />
<br />
Because of my pre-nerf PC call, he wouldn't sell it to me for my entire savings of 5kpp.<br />
<br />
Man am I glad now. :)  I just dinged 52 today, and I love the spell regrowth. :D  Sad to see I won't ever use a Fungi Staff to stack 'em. :(<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So who can we write to to express our strong feelings about this?  They make it impossible to post anywhere official. <br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">First off, considering the effect on the fungi tunic, which is the same effect as the fungi staff, stacks with regrowth, I always thought that the fungi staff effect and regrowth should have always stacked without the sow trick.<br />
<br />
The drawback was the Snare effect.  Thus the reason to seek a fungi tunic.  I bought a staff a couple weeks ago for 8k and it was nice to be able to med up and regen over 40 a tick outside and the free regen in a dungeon was nice.  With this nerf Verant has cut the value in half!<br />
<br />
I will still use mine in dungeons but thats it.  Im not worried about the snare effect because I can always click it off with run 3 inside and the ability to insta sow outside.  I am very disappointed in Verant!<br />
<br />
Another blow to the poor Shaman.  We need to protest this bull**** nerf.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully  i'm sure they will never nerf this 'exploit'.<br />
<br />
They nerf an item like the fungi staff and they are dealing spells like this one (CIII) in the game. <br />
<br />
My only hope now with my shaman is to get cannibalisation,if they nerf this aa skill one day : /cancel my account.</div></div><hr />
