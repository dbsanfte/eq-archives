<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Winterstorm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8827) was changed in last patch, the effect wintercall is now right clickable 180dd nuke with 6.5sec casting time.<br />
<br />
Not as good ratio as bracer, but iksars can use...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok can we say case closed now? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sure we can ;)<br />
<br />
Of course the JBB would have to be made &quot;no drop&quot; and available only off of a level 65 mob :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">fine... i have mine :P<br />

ikkys picky as always...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG No!<br />
That just sucks.<br />
<br />
With a 20/22 1hb that procs 100dd stun, I was almost doing as much dmg as chain casting jbb.<br />
<br />
I projected that once I obtained Winterstorm, I could surpass the dmg output of the jbb with pure melee (fully buffed). <br />
<br />
If indeed it's now a clicky nuke, then I deem it completely useless. :p<br />
<br />
Plus, procs are harder to resist than a casted spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have killed THO, I dunno how many times (20+ enough to supply at least 8 wizards with their spell, and have yet to see this weapon drop.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Indeed.  Now *technically* lizzies have a nice right clickable nuke, but...damn...talk about not worth the effort.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh good!  73 less damage, and you have to put your epic away!  Clearly an excellent substitute for the JBB.  NOT!<br />
<br />
Of course, all the races can use this, not just iksar . . . no Hroth, case is not closed yet.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now now Chu... don't go gettin all riled up. :p<br />
<br />
73 damage less, but also casts in 2.5 seconds less I believe.  9 seconds on JBB isn't it?<br />
<br />
I'd say this is a nice 'toy' if you can get one.  If cold lands on the mob, you slap epic dot on, switch weapons and you have mana free damage to play with.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Biggest difference is that this is going to be solely a 'toy' for the relatively uber at least.  nodrop, so you won't be twinking and PLing with it.  Not quite a JBB equivalent, but still a nice toy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hope Wildaar posts his opinion here, cos I have no doubt it will be hilarious and accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So epic then switch...<br />
<br />
Not like a jbb equiped &quot;other shaman&quot; will use this over the jbb it has about 6less pure dps.  All i have ever seen asked for is a jbb like item that iksar could use... i didnt know it had to be some iksar only thing... heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not Iksar only but accessable :)<br />
<br />
It is a nice item and I would use it. One small problem with that, though. Unlike the JBB that can be acquired by farming giants in Rathe and Everfrost (never once setting foot in Sebilis), this item is no-drop and will only be acquired by those Shaman in guilds capable of this sort of content (or those with friends who are). <br />
<br />
Honestly, I thought you were kidding when you said &quot;case closed&quot; :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I am not going to go into it... I will just state that I am one of those that believe because what the iksar have as a race and how it compliments the shaman class an ikky jbb type item should have some kind hefty negative attached to it... just IMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd bet many of the shaman that are killing THO have already bagged their epic, I have.  If I had 2 very nice bracers I might consider bagging  my Sprinkler for a Winterstorm and taking the slight decrease in damage.  But since I don't have 2 very nice bracers I'm not too concerned with bagging a JBB atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Talking of clickables. Bone of Bertoxxulus' casts Rotten Bile per right click now too.<br />

Rotten Bile is a 60 DD, 735 in 21 ticks or something, disease based. Range useable...look up the rest of the stats with search.</div></div><hr />

This is like when I was a 3 year old kid, as soon as someone had a toy, I wanted it. Even if it sucked and I didn't plan playing with it. I wanted it.<br />
<br />
Oh and before someone reminds me how &quot;difficult&quot; the THO encounter is, you can completely debuff it before engaging it (retarded rooted encounter). Even a ranger can tank it, almost all of our casters melee it. It's just a long boring fight. I was AFK most of the time, so were half of the melee. There was also a necro competition to see who does more damage to THO. Oh and it's uber AE ... ooooh spoooky! The most fun part of the THO encounter is to walk over the invisible bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">THO is an endgame fight.  By the time you get this item it has lost most of it's usefullness.<br />
<br />
The difficulty involved in getting it mean it is NOT in any way equivalent to a JBB in terms of usefullness to a levelling shaman.<br />

Oh and before someone reminds me how &quot;difficult&quot; the THO encounter is<br />
<br />
/remind<br />
The THO takes how many more people than a Seb group? He's now hunted by how many guilds for VT key components or caster loot? Click sticks all but required? Come on, Zorlac. If you think this item is in any way comparable to a JBB in terms of risk/reward you're crazy enough to work for Verant. Any Shaman that works for it can get a JBB. Not everyone will ever have an opportunity to even fight the THO, much less actually kill him. This is not a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh my THO is an endgame fight now.<br />
<br />
Need what for him, 2 groups ?<br />
<br />
Anyways, it doesn't really matter. You guys have now access to the single reason people chose to play a troll or any other race over the iksar. Complaining about it is hilarious...<br />
<br />
Btw, i wouldn't mind if i got iksar's regen ability(permanent of course) off the Emperor of Ssraeshza. Would like to hear you guys bitching then...really i'd enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Zorlac, show me the level 45 Iksar shaman that's going to get invited to fight THO and who will actually be allowed to roll on an item of recommended level of 51.<br />
<br />
A few facts about the THO: <br />
<br />
- level 65<br />
- He casts an AE that makes casters fizzle 95% of the time<br />
- Huge regeneration<br />
- He hits for 790<br />
- Parsers suggest 850k to 900k hit points<br />
- Can be slowed<br />
- By most accounts, you need 3-5 groups<br />
<br />
You can compare the Winterstorm drop off of the THO to the JBB, but the dissimilarities are legion: <br />
<br />
- this is far harder to obtain via pve<br />
- this is not tradeable -- you can't buy it<br />
- this puts out 8 dps less<br />
- this is useable by ANY shaman (the JBB is not useable by Iksars)<br />
<br />
C'mon -- why do you have such a chip on your shoulder about Iksars? You know that this item doesn't equal a JBB. Verant flubbed by sticking the JBB in the game in the first place --- they should at least not turn it into a racial disadvantage for Iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">THO may not be a hard encounter for you, Zorlac (or any of you end game Shaman) but I'll never see it. <br />
<br />
I will see hill giants, lots of them. I will see items that I can sell for 1k here, 3k there. I will be able to save up 15k in a few weeks or maybe a month. Just like every other non-Iksar Shaman can.<br />
<br />
The thing is, with my 15k, I cannot buy this new toy. I cannot sit in EC or GFay and /auc WTB Winterstorm. <br />
<br />
Do you see the difference yet?<br />
<br />
There is access, yes. If you are in a guild capable of that content. You may find it trivial but for many it isn't. How many times have you seen your fellow Shaman here state that they can't even do Fear with their guild? Those same Shaman that list in their Magelo a JBB?<br />
<br />
The two items may have similar abilities but the acquisition of the items is vastly different. You all know that but, for some reason, seem to enjoy playing this little Iksar vs. everyone game. I do not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My wife gets stressed out over petty **** at times.  I ask her why she worries about stuff that she can't change and doesn't really matter in the first place.  She shrugs and says, &quot;I know, It's dumb&quot;  /sigh   I guess she's not alone...<br />
<br />
JBB, Winterstorm, right click nukes in general (for a shaman) are toys or bonuses.  Lacking them does not cripple you in any way.  Send in your /feedback asking for changes and whatnot, but the whole iksar/non-iksar and JBB issues are pretty much pointless other than that.</div></div><hr />

please...thats just silly.<br />
<br />
Look at the other right-click effects that Kunark Armor gives to other classes and reconsider. <br />
<br />
Druids get a right-click DoT *and* a right-click snare.<br />
Rangers get free arrows, and a snare.<br />
Warriors (the ultimate non-caster) get buffs and invis.<br />
etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Every class has pieces of 'Kunark' Armor that is more desireable than other pieces...that doesn't mean that VI screwed up by introducing them.</div></div><hr />

Zorlac, show me the level 45 Iksar shaman that's going to get invited to fight THO and who will actually be allowed to roll on an item of recommended level of 51.<br />
- Show me a level 45 softskin shaman going to Sebilis, getting a crypt group and rolling on JBB.<br />
<br />
/auc WTB JBB<br />
/auc WTB Loot rights to Winterstorm<br />
<br />
Difference? None. Just talk to your local uberguild. And I am pretty sure you get WS much cheaper than JBB.<br />
<br />
- He casts an AE that makes casters fizzle 95% of the time<br />
- If your WIS/INT is below 200. So non issue for non hybrids also you can &quot;hide&quot; from AE. Point was? At one fight I was constantly dotting it (no JBB needed) and I was standing just 2 inches from it. Never had one fizzle.<br />
<br />
- Huge regeneration<br />
- Like every &quot;endgame&quot; or &quot;boss&quot; type mob. Nothing new there.<br />
<br />
- He hits for 790<br />
- Forgot to mention, rooted, can be slowed VERY easily, can be fully debuffed before engaging, also WAR + /disc def = trivial encounter.<br />
<br />
- Parsers suggest 850k to 900k hit points<br />
- Green con to 60 named gnolls in Iceclad have 75k HP. Point was? Just because something has 1 zillion HP, doesn't mean it's not killable.<br />
<br />
- Can be slowed<br />
- As said before, slowed before he even touches a raid party member.<br />
<br />
- this is not tradeable -- you can't buy it<br />
- Wrong. You can buy it.<br />
<br />
- this is useable by ANY shaman (the JBB is not useable by Iksars)<br />
- And? Wasn't the level 60 iksar shamans bitching and complaining because at 60 were XP is again important they have no right click DD? Well now they do. And it's fairly easy to obtain if you got 20 friends.<br />
<br />
C'mon -- why do you have such a chip on your shoulder about Iksars? <br />
- As many pointed out, Iksar no JBB is perfectly balanced. It was debatted in 30 billion threads. Many Iksar agree too.<br />
<br />
You know that this item doesn't equal a JBB. <br />
- It is an alternative to JBB.<br />
<br />
Verant flubbed by sticking the JBB in the game in the first place --- they should at least not turn it into a racial disadvantage for Iksars. <br />
- Same old Iksar persecution. Of course you fail to mention the many Iksar advantages. And the fact that BoN + Canni + natural regen + regen = same &quot;mana free&quot; DPS as JBB. But let's not get into the same old cliche.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Zorlac Im sorry but that is maybe the most idiotic thing I have ever heard.  Did you not see that someone killed the THO twenty times and it never dropped?  Do you not think that someone in that &quot;local uber guild&quot; would want this item.  <br />
<br />
But of course it would be easier to get and cheaper than a jbb, you would only need to find a uber guild with no shaman and tag along for 10-15 raids.  Man sounds like a plan.</div></div><hr />

hahahah, oh man thats rich.  Dunno what your server conditions are like of course, but I dont know of a single guild on my server that would entertain being paid to organize a raid to get someone toy loot. Even funnier, for under 15k? You have got to be kidding me. I've been to THO before, and i'd assume at the quickest it would take 2 hours to get in an get the kill. Organize 20-30 people for less than 15kpp? /boggldybogboggle. It...just....doesnt make sense...lol. And then assuming it drops, and if it doesnt, like they'd be willing to come back next spawn for free, rotfl...oh man, thanks for the laugh.

I can't say I've ever noticed a problem channeling JBB, except in the obvious cases of quite a few mobs beating on you.  I do have terrible problems with epic being interrupted though :)<br />

180 dmg in 6.8 sec is a joke for highend item like this.<br />
u do more dmg in melee with this spear instead of nuking.<br />
and with the former proc i did more dmg in pure melee instead of nuking Jbb. sometimes 360dmg with critical cast 3.<br />
that should be ok cause its from THO.<br />
<br />

Verant removed crits on JBB.(cause of caster balance*rofl*)<br />

Bit of a leap there, don't ya think?<br />
<br />
But I do at least agree that this is more a nerf than an upgrade. Unless you are a lizard I suppose.<br />

More like a million pp thing if you should find a guild willing to regularly kill this guy and let you tag along every time, most likely you never ever will.<br />
<br />
If THO is trivial to you ,you should be able to farm up about two hundred thousand to million platinum in the same time it takes a foutyfiveish guy to farm up enough for a JBB too.<br />
<br />
Note however that this in itself has better stats than the spear of fate. JBB has crap for stats.<br />
<br />
Making it right click is a nerf of the weapon.<br />
<br />
It has no imaginable use that compares to JBB. Any shaman able to obtain this should make higher DPS with it in melee than casting the nuke. I suppose you could use the click to pull greenies for dogdog to kill but it was much better as a proc.<br />
<br />
I haven't killed him enough to determine if it is or isn't rare but it's an extremely entertaining battle so I imagine I'll be bagging the epic soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">What are some people smoking here ?<br />
<br />
You have a melee DPS of 28 ? Didn't think so...<br />
<br />
JBB is 5 more DPS than the Winterstorm. <br />
However it's faster casting which results in less interrupts and more melee swings inbetween. Argueing about the RvR when comparing JBB and Winterstorm is showing how clueless you are.<br />
<br />
Iksars should have never had access to a &quot;JBB&quot;, but they got it in form of this drop off a 2 group raid mob, yet you aren't happy. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Giac, I think the point is, most people seem to magically think every level 46 non iksar shaman magically gets a JBB the second they turn 46.  So, iksars look at this Winterstorm and think, bleh, I can't buy one at 45 to help me level from 45-55+, so it's useless.<br />
<br />
Of course, some of us non iksar shaman didn't get a JBB until 57...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I shouldn't do this but I have to.<br />
<br />
No one is saying that, Gloriana. No one on this thread anyway.<br />
<br />
What people are saying is that there is a difference between farming hill giants for cash to buy a JBB and doing the encounter that may drop this spear. <br />
<br />
So you got your JBB at 57, someone else got their's at 45 and another person had it at level 1. That spear, the no drop item that it is, will not be used for twinking because of the way it is attained. <br />
<br />
Why you are ignoring that little difference is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/em then snaps back into reality. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sick of the whole JBB argument, Iksars can't use it...get over it ! And other Shaman races will never have our dead sexy scales...chicks dig the tail (I'll let you guess why).<br />
<br />
I never knew about the JBB when I made my Iksar and even after hearing about it, I still don't want it. sounds like alot of hassle and headache just for a piece of armor. Not to mention the money and time sink trying to acquire one, I'm actually glad I don't have to worry about it. One less thing on my scaly plate !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The complaint was, iksars did not get a right click nuke.  Well, here it is!  So, what's the problem?  When it can be achieved.  Sure, it's a high end encounter, so was getting my snare spear so I could proc a snare that Inny worshiping shaman get to right click at level 10 (or whatever).<br />
<br />
*shrug* Iksars really really wanted a right click nuke...now, they have the possibility of getting one (previously they had no possibility).  There isn't a possibility of a barb shaman getting a 40 point innate AC...no matter what the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">There isn't a problem with there being a right click nuke.<br />
<br />
There is a problem with people saying &quot;now shut you because you have one&quot;. Just as you don't like people assuming you got a JBB at 45, I don't like people assuming that content is attainable for everyone. <br />
<br />
Like I said, nice spear. Many Shaman who post here will never see an item of that calliber, regardless of what race they choose. While they will see a JBB. That's all I've been saying throughout this thread, the ability to attain the items is vastly different therefore they are not equal. If that spear was only Barb Shaman usable I would say the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I agree with people that say this item is complete garbage now.  It was not only hit by the nerf stick but beaten, kicked, punched and curbed.<br />
<br />
Forgive me I'm wrong, but my thinking is that any guild that is going to tackle THO will have shamans with higher manaless DPS than 27.69, iksar or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Yeah I have higher DPS than that. Meleeing and with this weapon that would increase further. It is in NO WAY crap as it is one of very very few weapons that both in stat boosts and damage ratio suprass the Spear of Fate. It still in no way compares to JBB. Yadda yadda, THO can be two grouped. Well in the time anyone can two group THO any of those people could have soloed the JBB.<br />
<br />
If you are uber enough to two group THO then you should have no interest in this weapon as all shamans should have a melee weapon with a ratio below one as well as stat booster with better stats than this.<br />
<br />
I would and I presume will use it however. Not for nuking though, you can easily surpass the JBB with this, and you should because it's harder to get. You just simply DON'T click it, your melee DPS will be higher than a JBB with puny epic swings in between.<br />
<br />
It's a retarded comparison.<br />
The weapon was better when it was a proc.<br />
<br />
JBB can be gotten by any EC daytrader at lvl 1 or a farmer at lvl 30. Winterstorm is highly unlikely you'll get before you're a Venerable Oracle. <br />
<br />
Guilds that can two group THO have no interest in doing so because while he has decent loot for tier two guilds on newer servers ot tier three on older the people who can two group him are busy fighting stuff like Seru/XtC/emperor/VT/Glyphed etc. And trust me they will NOT kill this mob for you for 15kpp nor 150kpp 1500kpp maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Are you kidding, people ?<br />
<br />
I keep reading you do more than 28 DPS meleeing...<br />
<br />
You do NOT!<br />
<br />
Clicking this thing will do more damage than the melee with any weapon in the game. Even with a Bone of Bertoxxulus i can't outdamage it, and its 48/40, +6 disease. You would't be able to outdamage it if the effect was still a proc. <br />
<br />
A shaman's hit/damage table will never make you average for more than double the damage of the weapon on exp mobs. Factor in the low ATK most of you people have and you will stay significantly under it. So this weapon is 22/23. <br />
At max haste you will swing at a pace of about 1.3 seconds for a max possible average of 44. That's like a max average DPS of 33.8. And we haven't factored in the misses yet, which make upabout 50% of your swings. So vs. exp mobs you'd be lucky to do about 17 DPS max hasted(which is impossible for a shaman to get by himself) with this. Now if added the proc(hypothetically, since it isn't a combat proc anymore), you would have to do 11 DPS via procs. That's 3 1/2 procs per minute(with SCF III).<br />
<br />
You get the picture...<br />
<br />
I am not saying i didn't prefer it to remain a proc. This is just an attempt to dismiss the belief peopel could melee for higher damage than via clicking this weapon. It's not a toy, it's what Iksars have whined about for 2 years. <br />
As Glorianna pointed out again(after i tried to make it clear to some Iksar shamans), there's no mob in the game currently that grants me an innate AC bonus or regen, no matter what i do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">The JBB is for non Iksar Shaman only. No amount of discussion is going to change that.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game the way it is. Soon there will be viable alternatives to EQ that offer a far richer gaming experience than is currently on offer. The EQ treadmill is one of the dullest experiences in any game I have ever played. The only reason I still play is the unique social experience the game offers. Equipment and lvls are only worth striving for in so much as they enable the social elements of the game to change and develop. I enjoy the challenge of being part of organising 30+ people towards a common goal. Just as I enjoyed the challenge of organising 6 people towards a common goal.<br />
I see playing an Iksar Shaman as a tough career choice. I personally think we have a hard time of it with xp penalties and faction issues. But I love my Iksar, and dont think I miss out on any of the aspects of the game I value most highly.<br />

No, i don't do 180 damage in 6.5 seconds pure meleeing. I am a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Starting to think what's wrong is that he's a newbie. Actually because of cold resist issues the restrictions on the JBB are almost as bad as not being able to fight high ac mobs.<br />
<br />
Sure in Acrylia melee DPS drops to single figure values. But in Akheva where AC is low surpassing 30 isn't even hard. Same thing all melees deal with. Shamans can easily get to max haste as rabid bear in itself is post cap haste. Celerity and a decent haste item is too.<br />
<br />
Shaman attack should be between 950 and 1250 depending on buffs so that'll let you regularly hit most exp giving mobs for quadruple damage. Even lousy 20/30 epic does not fall far short on some mobs.<br />
<br />
No item may give you innate 40 ac but at lower levels that evens out by such items as assorted JBlegs, JBbp, IGS and other decent high AC gear that is restricted to Iksars. At higher level you can even it out against your higher base STA since you don't need to dump quite as much ac for hp as we do.<br />
<br />
Regen = exp penalty, it's usefull for getting exp faster, on a raid it will grant me very little benefit.<br />
<br />
So tell me Giac, have you ever seen THO? Did you &quot;two group&quot; him? In that case I hope the guy who played the shaman to your level got at least $700 from you...</div></div><hr />

- You guys all forgot some very important things. THO is killed all the time on most servers. The FT3 hybrid helm alone worth killing this guy. You DO NOT pay for an item so a guild kills it for you. If this item is about to ROT then they might sell it, if you talked to them before. It's not about paying a guild to kill mob X, it's about paying for a loot if it rots. And since many shamans in top tier guilds won't give a rat's ass about this piece of crap then it will either ROT or maybe getting sold.<br />
<br />
Oh and people who think WS is the be all end all shaman DPS melee weapon, well newsflash, you are only going to miss mobs &quot;faster&quot;.<br />

Winterstorm is 6.5 seconds(not that it would matter).<br />
You hit for 94 how many times ?<br />
Max hasted you will have 5 swings in 6.5 seconds. You'd do 52 damage per swing(270:5). Depending on the mob you will hit 2 or 3 times out of 5 swings. So assuming you hit 3 out of 5 times you do an average of 90 damage per hit when your max swing is 94 ?<br />
<br />
Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well that would work if THO was standing in the middle of EC. As it is he's standing far into a nasty non CoH zone which it takes at the very least an hour for most guilds doing him to get through. And they will not keep shepherd you through it for a few hundred thousand platinum. You'd be a liability and they know that.<br />
<br />
Of course it's not the end all DPS weapon since it's not the one with the best ratio. However it's good both statswise and meleewise.<br />
<br />
If agi isn't below 75 it doen't really matter whether it's 15 up or down, just buff it, click off the CotP your friendly neigbourhoud ranger casted on your group if you're low on slots.<br />
<br />
Conveniently enough the 75-156 hp granted by higher stamina also equates a pretty nice item.<br />
<br />
Just as convenient as that AA regen doesn't give more regen anymore either.<br />
<br />
Nah really, perfectly valid points and eventhough I could've used the JBB once upon a time I don't miss it. I chose my class to play with my roomies monk twink and because it appealed to me RPG wise. I couldn't care less about the JBB and I wouldn't use this for the effect.<br />
<br />
But I find it rather silly to compare it's availability to that of the JBB. You can't CoH someone in to loot this. You can't  get through the zone in the 30mins before it rots. It seems fairly rare. High end guilds do not like shepherding a lowbie on their raids on a regular basis. In effect this item is not in any way available the way the JBB is nor should it be. <br />

The JBB has a bit of ac, WS is better than epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would love to hear about a THO capable guild that would shephard a level 45 guy to THO on the off chance a WS dropped.  Or even one that would decession to zone, invite a level 45, kill him, summon corpse, rez him and let him loot for 15000pp.  I have never heard more tripe in my life.  That is so stupid it's nauseating.  Any guild that can do THO isn't hurting for funds and won't need a measily 15k pp.  They can get that from selling spells, for godsake!.<br />
<br />
You can't buy a WS in the commons.  You have to be 60  or close thereto to get one.  JBB most benefits shaman from levels 45-58, not level 60.  The stats on WS make it a decent item for all shaman, not just iksar--so all of them will be rolling.  Only non-iksar shaman have to roll on a JBB if it drops in group.  One group can get a JBB.  Most guilds will need to raid for THO.<br />
<br />
You guys are so hung up on racial benefits that you can't look at disadvantages.  Go read some other threads.  READ, not look at.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the other iksar shaman, but personally, I could care less about a clickable DD like the JBB or WS at 60.  I just think iksar should be able to use it from 45-59 like the rest of the shaman.  That's where iksar get hurt the most compared to the other shaman, trolls especially.<br />
<br />
No, I am not assuming that a JBB appears on your wrist at 45, either.  You still have to find one and buy it.  Yes, they are rare, and they are expensive.  However, you have a chance to get it.  I have yet to hear one, yes ONE decent arguement as to why iksar shouldn't get it.<br />
<br />
Our bonuses are offset by other racial disadvantages.  Go read the other threads for a list, cause I ain't gonna list em again.  It's not worth my time.  Frankly neither is this post since both of you seem incapable of doing more than quoting a single sentance out of context to 'refute' things rather than look at a basic argument.<br />

These discussions take as a premise that such questioning of the mechanics of EQ is worthwhile. Something that would be hard to accept with a game such as Chess.<br />

I have to say that while, man I can't believe I got involved with this damn useless argument. Anyone else notice how so many discussions go round and round in circles ?, oops where was I? oh yes ...while I have seen some decent arguments both for and against I still am not convinced that the extra effort required to get to lvl 60 as an Iksar Shaman is suffciently rewarded once those lofty hights have been achieved.

2 1/2 swings (91% hasted, delay is 42)<br />
1 1/2 hits(being generous on the hit rate here)<br />
Average hit 120. (120 x 1.5 =180)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Actually the standard reply given by GMs back in the day as to why Kunark armour wasn't Iksar wearble was that you shouldn't be able to twink the new Iksar charachters so much since they we're racially superior to start with. It might have had some initial connection to plate icons being supposed to have plate look, but they've since gone far from that. I presume it sums up to Verant really thinking of Iksars as superior and wanting to keep it in line with Iksar lowbie quest and planar armour being nicer.<br />
<br />
For necromancers I suppose the added regen really makes it the penultimate race.<br />
<br />
What puzzles me is Beast lord though. If you make the assumption that Iksars are superior shamans, shadowknights and warriors why aren't they better as beast lords. This brings it back to maybe just being graphics. In fact the ONLY iksar classes that seem to have a really big advantage from being Iksars are monks and necros, the ones who don't have kunark armour to start with.<br />
<br />
I don't see a rea point in changing any of it though. Well maybe adding an armour for monks since beast lords get one.<br />
<br />
There are mobs against which this weapons right click would be quite usefull of course. Va'Dyn is a nice little miniboss with really high ac, lots of HP and regen. He has low cold resistance and I always have enough mana to torpor modding clerics anyway. I might take a look on whether it's better to use this or a higher level nuke and canni/torpor ro get the mana back once I get it.<br />
<br />
That's a case where JBB might have been usefull too.<br />
<br />
One HUGE advantage Meleeing has over JBB is of course that as long as your weapon is reasonably slow you won't lose much canning midfight. I for one always do. This of course it a bit fast for that and the 40/38 club off of Va'Dyn might be better.<br />

Don't you guys wanna go into KC with a priceless spear in main and a goblin parrying dagger in off hand and pretend to be rogues?<br />

In the end I'm pretty and all you got was a f00gly bracer and you smell bad too...                      <br />
<br />
And Giac you had better go to warrior and rogue boards and inform your fellow barbarians that you as well as being night blind are fight blind because evidently you can't hit the side of a barn with a shotgun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Estopidiera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">If you have a winterstorm, you do the same if not more damage than the JBB, not to mention not losing out on all the stats that you can now gain by equipping a bracer with said stats.<br />
<br />
Those of you who wanna argue that the JBB does more damage are free to. Those of you who wanna argue that you do more damage in melee are free to. I think it's a big upgrade.<br />

Oh BPLEASE. The ac bonus is 40 at level 60. AC comes on just about EVERY piece of equipment. If you can't make up for 40 AC at level 60... well...<br />

I'm saying that the 40ac doesn't matter at level 60. The point is that it makes NO difference once you factor in racial gear differences. Show me the iksar version of IGS that are as easily obtained. The iksar version of the JB BP (not that you'd necessarily be wearing this at 60).

Well, Barbed Rubicite Coif is nice. Barbed Ringmail Shoulderpads, Death Watcher's Shroud, Dragonwing Mantles. Not too hard for a random 60 iksar shaman to acquire.<br />

So your theoretical situation doesn't hold weight when you simply take a look at what people are ACTUALLY wearing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">...and what is &quot;supposed&quot; about it?<br />
<br />
I call it &quot;supposed&quot; because there's no REAL benefit once you apply gear. <br />
<br />
Let's look at 5 level 60 Iksar (I just selected the first five on the list &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1379&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)<br />
<br />
Ssik = 904<br />
Shayman = 1052<br />
Seredith = 1091<br />
Cakaris = 1068<br />
Jilariz = 960<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Average of the first five Iksar = 1015&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Now let's take the first five Barbarians on the list:<br />
<br />
Angbor = 934<br />
Asheran = 1000<br />
Asta = 1113<br />
Batuda = 1193<br />
Balanthor = 1347<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Average of the first five barbarians = 1117&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm... on AVERAGE in this (admittedly small) sample, Barbarians are packing 102 more points of AC. Where is that HUGE MASSIVE innate AC now? In &quot;theory&quot; and on the designer's drawing board, 40ac innate sounds like something special. In practice, we generally have fewer equipment choices, spend less time at level 60 (because it takes us so much longer to get there) and end up with oh... 100 less AC, on average.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course I'd like a larger sample size, but when you gain exp at a 20 percent slower rate for very little real gain (not theoretical but REAL), you end up with far fewer Iksar. <br />
<br />
Just for kicks, here are the first five Trolls...<br />
<br />
Barshin = 996<br />
Bruzza = 966<br />
Gathu = 1353<br />
Kazlaaz = 1257<br />
Krodah = 1294<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Average AC of the first five trolls = 1173&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Hmm.... Iksar are coming in last so far. I guess that innate AC sure makes a huge difference.<br />
<br />
If you actually look at Balanthor and Gathu's gear (the best equipped in the small sample above, NONE of it excludes Iksar, so THEORETICALLY you could end up with an Iksar wearing the same gear. <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;(highlighted for Hrothgar:) In real terms, however, we're a hobbled race that doesn't level as fast (no JBB, higher xp penalty than barbarians) and so therefore spend a relatively smaller percentage of our careers helping knock down the mobs that drop such fine gear. &lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
The innate AC bonus for an iksar means very little in REAL terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">So? the iksar you listed are in wolf callers, planar and some pre planar armor.<br />
<br />
For example look at Kazlaz's magelo.  Nothing he is wearing is non ikky wearable.  So take his AC and ad 42 to it and you have a comparable 60 ikky.</div></div><hr />

My favorite retarded quote from this thread: I'm saying that the 40ac doesn't matter at level 60<br />
<br />
There is also a strong second competitor: Show me the iksar version of IGS that are as easily obtained<br />
<br />
So it all boils down to this:<br />
<br />
(1) Iksar, by far, have the best racial advantages with almost non existant disadvantages. You will however NEVER EVER hear an iksar tell you the zillions of advantages of being one.<br />
(2) They want everything on a silver platter. Easy to acquire, easy to get. Today is the JBB, tommorow the IGS, after that the snare necklace, then the Barbarian Spiritist Hammer, then God knows what.<br />
<br />
You got a mana free nuke that is slightly below JBB DPS. Whaaaawhaaaawhaa! I can't buy it at level 45, it's so unfair! Whaaaa whaaa whaaaa! It's so unfrair, they made baby Jesus cry!<br />
<br />
You can't obtain it as easy as JBB. Whaaaa whaaaa whaaa! I want it now! Mommmyyy! VI made baby Jesus cry again! Whaaa whaaa whaa!<br />
<br />
Goddamn spoiled brats.<br />
<br />
PS: On the notion of easy IGS alternative, I'd dump my IGS in favor of a matchless mantle any day. I am just too lazy to get 6 friends of mine and go kill the dragon that is up 24h a day, easy kill, and drops 75% of the time a good mantle. Of course getting IGS means camping for hours maybe days in the Hole. So wich is so easy to get?<br />

Comparing ac of an iksar to a barbarian is rather stupid and I dont think really matters in the end game. 40ac on a shaman isn't particularlly game altering. Nor is JBB in the end game. It may benefit in your guild in long fights, but I shudder at the thought that your guild needs this right click dmg to kill anything. If anything, its a nice padding so you can say yes I slowed soandso and did x dmg, yipee!<br />

Can't really get a random 5 iksar can you?  Since there are only 6 on the list.   Averages aren't very useful in these small samples with large deviations.  Level 60 shaman AC range from -900ac to 1500+ac.  <br />
<br />
This board and your magelo list does not represent the overall population of shaman.<br />
<br />
Basically your post proves that the the first 5 barbarians and first 5 trolls on the list have better gear than the first 5 (of 6) iksar shaman on your list.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind also that the Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians have been around longer than Iksar.  People like Gathu probably had better stats than I do now, before iksar were even around, lol.  They have had longer to accrue top end gear, join uber guilds, get DKP whatever.<br />
<br />
I still think free 40ac is awesome.   Particularly considering we can all wear the same gear at 60.   Velious quest, vindi BP, and better.  40ac is like getting a free BP that doesn't require a slot... jeez.  If you want to say that's nothing, that's your right, but you will never convince me 40 free ac is not REAL, or worthless.</div></div><hr />

Right on Henora... I was thinking the same thing... while alot of these 60 shaman were probably 50 when kunark came out all ikkys started at 1 and that was before fungi twinking :) So they (the old world races) have had more time to get the phat lewts...</div></div><hr />

Do you get XP penalty on AA XP? No. As a barbarian I'll get faster to 60 then most of the shaman races then what? At 60 an Iksar shaman with equal skill to a barbarian will kill more efficiently racking in more AA points. And your point was?<br />

<br />
You're still thinking like the designers wanted you to think when they were dreaming up ways to sell Kunark to the masses:<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll give the new race an innate AC bonus of about 40ac at level 50 and that'll make everybody want to buy Kunark. But see, the key is that that bonus will essentially mean nothing once you factor in gear and the fact that we're docking their experience by 20 percent. We've made the race LOOK good on paper without actually giving them a meaningful advantage. Balance baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
But of course, they never really thought through the long-term implications of the JBB as it pertains to Iksar. <br />
<br />
Anyways, in real terms, TODAY, that Innate AC means nothing to a level 60 Iksar. If there were some huge advantage to being Iksar, as all of the anti-JBB-for-Iksar zealots maintain, then there should be<br />
<br />
-- many more level 60 iksar<br />
-- higher average Iksar AC and HP<br />
<br />
Fact is, there are fewer Iksar and MOST of the people on thos board that were polled about racial choice would choose to be a Troll if starting over. <br />
<br />
I'm not whining and complaining about being a worthless shaman. Humility aside, I'd say I play a better shaman than 90% of the comparable-level shaman that I've run into in-game. I'm saying that the silly AC argument used every time in JBB-related arguments doesn't hold water when you compare actual level 60s. I'm saying that our racial experience penalty is probably closer to 30 or even 40 percent between the levels of 45 and 55 (prime JBB levels). <br />
<br />
I read that... I dont see its relevance. You get regen no? <br />
<br />
Sigh... Trolls... trolls... get the same regen. We're talking about UNIQUE racial advantage that we might have. &quot;Innate AC&quot; is the ONLY item that you can trot out in such discussions, and it is essentially meaningless.<br />
<br />
Anyways... done with this thread. Just for kicks I'm going to start auc'ing to buy looting rights on Winterstorm.</div></div><hr />

Heh twinks must have hurt you or somthing... i am going to resort to the ol level of the encounter and cost to a normal 1st run through player not getting jbb till way 50+... i didnt and it is a semi-loan jbb.

I could easily turn around everything you just wrote and apply it to you but that would be a waste.<br />
<br />
I simply stated the two items did not have the same risk/reward attached to them. That was never saying &quot;gimme a JBB&quot; that was saying the logic in the original post I responded to was flawed.<br />
<br />
Yet, here you are, showing just how assanine people can be. Trying to enflame an already hostile discussion by using gross exaggerations and name calling. Well, good for you, it's nice to see the idiots of the world being represented fully on this board.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of you...<br />
<br />
This is the same exact **** you see day in and out on Monkly Business. The board that everyone here doesn't want to duplicate. <br />
<br />
We all chose to play a Shaman and we all want to see the class do well. At least, I do. I don't care what race you chose to play or why, I don't want to see anyone at a disadvantage or with an advantage over the rest. And I don't want to argue with you about pixels that some of you are taking way to damn seriously.<br />

It's a game, relax and just play the damn thing.</div></div><hr />

- I know 3 level 60 barbarian shamans, wait only 2 now, one got his JBB last week, so that leaves 2 without JBB at 60. But yeah you are right, every non Iksar shaman gets a JBB magically at level 45.</div></div><hr />

- Sells for 30k on my server, easy. Had a friend and myself look for nearly 2 months to get one.<br />

- Trolls?<br />
<br />
&quot;high wis&quot; &gt; most are swapping out wis gear for hp and ac gear by the time they're in the high game<br />
- I am at 207 WIS. I can't afford to dump more WIS unfortunately. Of course like many Beta 4 people, we didn't know jack **** about stats and what's important. Hey I put points into Dex ... I could also use 30 more AC to get to 1.1k unbuffed. Oh well.<br />
<br />
&quot;awesome location&quot; &gt; evil races can bank in the Outpost. Good Races can bank in Firiona Via. How is Kunark only for the Iksar?<br />
- Goodies take one trip to PoG and they are KoS to some NPCs in FV. Evils can't hunt in HS, parts of Kaesora and most of KC. Iksar are not bound by any faction issues in Kunark. Velious is same faction, SoL is same faction for evil races. And your point was?<br />
<br />
&quot;nonexistant faction issues&quot;  &gt; just like your &quot;nonexistant experience penalty&quot; right? Heh.<br />
- What part of &quot;almost non existant&quot; you don't understand? Almost doesn't include ALL disadvantages, only a great majority of them. XP penalty is harsh but fair.<br />

- Forage alone negates many faction issues of not being able to shop. It's not the best must ultimate racial bonus, but it's nice to have.<br />

Right, Iksar necros can do that. So do monks. I seem the regulary summon food.<br />

But if all your arguments about Iksar weakness boils down to &quot;Summon Food&quot; spell, then you got serious issues about basic game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Okay- here's what we've got:<br />
<br />
Winterstorm offers a right-click nuke that does a little less DPS than the JBB.  WS is harder to get than the JBB.  An uber shammy with nice gear does around WS/JBB damage through melee.<br />
<br />
Some iksars believe this is not a JBB replacement for iksars, and take offense at the idea that others think it is.  Others argue that it is, or that iksars shouldn't get one anyway due to disputed racial advantages/disadvantages.<br />
<br />
That about it?  <br />

<br />
Forage is useless.  Let me put it in caps for you to see better.  USELESS.  Just an FYI correction of someone else, I believe Iksar forage skill tops out at 50, not 75.  Last night for a quest (that new pottery idol that has home ports--horrible failure rate, by the way), I was forced to go sit in the Field of Bone and forage.  Zorlac, I was there for 2 hours.  I got 1 roots and 2 waters as edibles.  In 2 hours.  Forage has a refresh of something like a minute.  It takes freaking forever.<br />
<br />
This thread has devolved into a discussion on racial abilities and balancing of the shaman races.  SHAMAN.  No, necros and monks can't summon food.  SO WHAT???  Jebus, that had to be the most inane response yet.  Shall we discuss barbarian monks and barbarian necros?  It's gonna be a frigging short discussion.  ALL shaman get summon food and drink by level 9 (if they buy them).  Clearly, iksar are more uber because in any given two hour period they can get 2 waters and a root.  Since most people can get to level 10 in 4 hours now just by bind rushing reds, let's give ikar 4 waters and 2 roots.  Ubah!  After reviewing all the facts, clearly I was wrong.  Forage is game breaking.  I'm going to go forage something that will help me kill mobs.  Forage is good for that.  Really.<br />
<br />
Iksar have no chance of getting a right click DD item that is iksar shaman useable until 58-60 on a raid level mob in the Deep.  Obviously, you missed the point again.  JBB is most useful on level 45-59 (or 60 without torpor).  THIS IS NOT AN IKSAR EQUIVALENT JBB.<br />
<br />
The largest benefit of the JBB is that it helps the character get through 45-59 faster.  Since iksar share a 20% exp penalty with trolls, it leaves iksar shaman as levelling slower than all the other races by a substantial margin.<br />
<br />
No, we are not assuming that you magically get a JBB at 45.  However, from both an equity AND a balancing standpoint, all the shaman SHOULD be able to get a JBB at 45 if they could find them.<br />
<br />
For god's sake, think about what you are writing.  Disagreeing with a conclusing is one thing.  However, after reading some of the infernally stupid arguments some people are posting, I actually feel dumber after having read them.  :(<br />

You crack me up sometimes.  All this crusading for a jbb then  you put limits what is a suitable ikky jbb.  Get a clarity and level (easy enough no?). While that barb is jbb blasting he is going to be wasting mana on roots and you can root rot and med/can between and will prolly end up with the same mana now that KEI is being sold for donations outside KC on my server almost constantly.</div></div><hr />

I have no interest in having the JBB changed as I don't believe that it is such a great deal. Your melee with a 20/30 weapon does not fall far short, while meleeing you can canni. Also this is a great way to ensure your melee skills don't lag behind. I for one have pretty much always maxed my melee skills. of course I only use piercing which will be a problem if I get my hands on a Va'Dyn club.

How so? All you have to do is get buffed up over AA Can?  After that all there is Torpor... = &lt;b&gt;decrease&lt;/b&gt; in hps importance at 60 than from 1-59.  I dont see how you can argue contrary to this.<br />

<br />
Well considering I am of the camp that thinks Ikkys shouldnt even get any &lt;b&gt;comparable&lt;/b&gt; item to jbb this item has the restrictions I would see as fitting to an ikky equiv.  less dmg but less casting time ammounts to only 5dps less than jbb.  Less dmg = less root breaks faster cast time = less inturupts against thos war barshing mobs.  I am hardly pretending.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">No you aren't pretending... You're not posting false arguments just not very good ones.<br />
<br />
No Torpor INCREASES the importance of HPs. <br />
Here's why: Whe you cannibalize using just regrowth, fungi (previously fungi staff) and innate regen you can basically keep your HP a few ticks of regn below max without loosing effectiveness.<br />
<br />
When you Canni for torpor on the other hand you need to get down at least 1200hps+the regen of 6 ticks not to lose anything. That means you will be very vulnerable if you don't have a lot of HPs.<br />
<br />
With AA canni you lose nearly two thousand hitpoints in one chunk, now bffs can wear or get dispelled. If they should you may very well get low hp aggro from canni5. Low HP aggro is a very bad thing.<br />
<br />
The most frequent source of damage on high level raids are AEs, thes are often unresistable and the only way to deal with them is though mana effective hwealing. Mana effective heals are slow so you need to have a lot of HPs for them to hit in time.<br />
<br />
All and all HPs only increase in importance with levels, with the addition of torpor and with the addition of AA canni.<br />
<br />
How do you figure these decrase the need for high hitpoints?<br />
<br />
My stance is then the same, I see no need for Iksars to get a JBB, my point is that this is no equivalent.<br />
<br />
What I am responding to is bad or false argments. So you didn't post a fake log with FoN and Avatar stacked.<br />
<br />
You did say that torpor and AA canni reduce the need for hitpoints, I disagree and motivate why.<br />
<br />
You ARE saying that WS will break root less than JBB is clicked when the opposite is true. Root gets and extra chace to brack each time it's hit by DD, totally irrespective of the amount of damage. I duo with a pally a blot his 65DD self proc breaks root just as much as my 775 DD nuke.<br />
<br />
Feel free to try this out using you best nuke and your worst nuke, you'll see that they break root just as much.<br />
<br />
You can feel however you wish about the JBB issue but don't motivate them with faulty logic or misconceptions...</div></div><hr />

All that is needed is an AVERAGE ammount of hp for a level 60.  Buffs wearing have no relevance as they are just refreshed when dropping.<br />

<br />
First, your AA comparison--I know that was a quote from someone else, but . . . it's race dependant.  I don't have numbers since they changed the exp per level (thought the total gross amount was supposed to stay the same), but to max level 60, I think barbarians had a 6 AA point lead over iksar/troll.  Ogres would be about a 1.5 point lead, and trolls would be on a par with iksar.  Vah Shir would be, what, about 7ish?  Not sure.  I don't see that lead changing significantly as time progresses on shaman of equal play time.  Are regen shaman more efficient?  Probably.  How much so?  I bet that if they do narrow the lead other races have on them, it will take a lot of days played to make up a single AA point.<br />
<br />
As to your HP comment, past the AC cap--which most people seem to think is about 1250 for shaman--it's ALL about HP (and resists for raids).  1250 AC is not that hard to get to (for any race shaman at high end of the game).  High +hp items are much harder to come by, especially since they get snapped up by tank classes.  <br />
<br />
And kvetching about putting limits on a JBB equivalent . . . what about a bracer that has burst of flame on it?  That's mana free, right?  Is it JBB equivalent?  Clearly not.  Not comparing the item to the JBB--since largely the whole discussion is a comparison to JBB--is plain stupid.  How about effective level restrictions since no young iksar could reasonably expect to get a WS?  I submit to you that if you can't see that point, you are a frequent rider of short buses.<br />
<br />
And yes, you can get a KEI.  However, so can a JBB enabled shaman.  The JBB provides additional mana-free damage.  The ability to mix the two provides a heck of a lot more flexability and power.   Forget damage for a sec.  A JBB blast, whenever it is used, be it for finishin a mob, getting it to run level, or just attacking is 150 mana without a JBB.  That's 10 tics with KEI alone (Both JBB and non-JBB shaman have med and canna, I know, but there are too many variables to make a better comparison--blasting full time, DoTing, cannadancing, sitting, etc.--too many other variables).  At level 45, that's a lot of mana.  Heck, at level 53, even with canna 3, it's a decent bit of mana.<br />
<br />
And Hroth, no one, ever, will tell you that you need less HP at 60 than you did in earlier levels.  That's a silly statement to make.  Things beat on you for more damage at 60 than at 45 (due to higher level mobs).  You still do canna while they do.  You can't canna 5 safely in battle if you are close to the limit--you will get low HP agro, and you might kill yourself.  Admittedly, I'm a little low on the HP department, but I can't self buff more than about 2400 hp.  After a canna 5, that would be about 3 hits in CT.  Think about raids and AE as well.  HP is godly at 60.  Chances are good you're also gonna get agro from something on raids, too.<br />

<br />
Bah too many variables that mess with your logic.  As a barb root rotting with chloro in the 40s I could make a a very good portion of mana back depending on root breaking prematurly (something a jbb has to deal with.This was without clarity or any form of regen item.) and yes I too said a jbb shaman could get kei but they will use it less effectively than a ikky shaman.   Something you get innate over 2 of the other 3 other jbb enabled races (little rusty from riding the short bus is that a majority?) With regen/regen item/kei you will be killing just as fast as a jbb shaman 51+...  (i have also stated many times I support a move of the jbb to 51) (or do ikkys keep a jbb fund just in spite and to bitch when they could be getting a fungi)... what I am saying is jbbing is slow killing unless you use dots (more mana use while just standing) with root rotting you could be doing at least 10+dps more than a jbb shaman.<br />
<br />
I will admit defeat on the hp thing... short bus or 3 hours sleep you decide.  I will maintain that ikkys cannot cry about having lower hp when they can wear everything in the upper levels all other races can and also only have a ~70hp base hp difference with barbs at 60.  The ol AC bonus argument applies here as well.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure I agree with the efficiency thing, but I can't make a good argument for/against it since I'd have to go back and analyze DoTs available at 45 and 49 versus mana and damage . . . etc.  I'm too used to Bane and Pox to know it off the top of my head.  However, I'd be willing to bet that JBB is MUCH more effective at those levels.  (Again, I freely admit this begs the question of GETTING one at those levels!  :) )<br />
<br />
I think, perhaps, that you are underestimating the usefulness of the JBB at levels 45 to at least 55 (pre bane of nife).  As I said (and you agreed) there are too darn many variables to make a sound argument.  People are going to have their opinions on the matter and keep them.  C'est la vie.<br />

<br />
Soupy thinks that because he's cornered some vodoo special black market he wont share with anyone else, on Stormhammer (a model for for server economies), and can get a jbb whenever he snaps his fingers, so can everyone else.  Back on the other 99% of servers it's still easier to just level, instead of spending large amounts of time farming, trading, buying and selling your way to a jbb so you can level.<br />
<br />
Kylt somehow hits his attack button better then Giac.<br />
<br />
Laproaigh will soon be a GM, and quickly promoted to head server GM.  He's obviously demonstrated his skill by seeing a 3 point damage shield, assuming its Force of Nature, and concluded that since FoN doesn't stack with avatar then Giac is obviously cheating (that ds couldn't possibly be bramblecoat, and Giac's account should be banned right now).<br />
<br />
Soupy doesn't consider high wisdom an advantage, because (this is priceless) &quot;most are swapping out wis gear for hp and ac gear by the time they're in the high game&quot;.  I don't suppose this would allow iksar to trade our more wisdom gear, to add on to their hps and already superior AC value?<br />

Sorry to disappoint you, but the WS was on my shaman already when i bought him for 700$. <br />
<br />
This thread has made me laugh multiple times. <br />
<br />
Wtg multiple meaningless arguments. <br />
<br />
My fav so far has been the guy bragging about spending 700 bux on a shaman. <br />
<br />
Was canadian dollars too! <br />

Im a lvl 60 Iksar Shaman and would never consider for a second to be anything but. I love my regen and use ALL the time versus a situational bracer. I chose Iksar about 5 months after Kunark was released so yes i knew the whole story regarding the jaundice gear, I Still chose Iksar. However, I never once &quot;whined&quot;,as some people have put it, wishing i could use JB items. I dont care for it enough to waste my time and it goes back to making my choice with the facts. I do agree with the people who wishes the WS was still a proc and am a little ticked it was nerfed but what can i do. I really enjoy my fellow guild shaman, who are a mix of Ogre and Barbs and we work well together. Sure we tease but it really isnt an issue and really wish people would not make it one. Iksars did not force a change on anything. That would require Verant to actually listen which any &quot;old school&quot; player knows would not happen. (At least not since the Vulak drop rogue dagger fiasco) As i said before, WS got nerfed IMO and wish it still was a proc. It wasnt my fault though so please leave me out of it.<br />
<br />
One other thing, some one mentioned that comparing the tradeable JBB to a no drop item off a high end mob is not a fair comparison. He is right. And who said THO could be done with 2 groups? I looked back through the thread trying to find that but must have missed it. THO is NOT a 2 group mob. He has 2 AEs one is a feeblemind type AE that causes you to fizzle spells like 75% of your attempts (yes my wisdom is 255) and his other AE is a slow spell that must be dispelled, not cured. He has a ton of HPs but is pretty easy to slow and cast on. If 2 groups went down the clerics would go OOM before they could kill this mob simply bcause your DMG out put could not keep up with his.<br />
Also, all those people who have never been to the THO, dont go quoting what your friend tells you or what you read somewhere about this encounter. The THO has had several changes to him since luclins release. The &quot;strategy&quot; or information you may be sharing could be old or piss poor. He is an easy encounter if you kill the burrower, Tunare or some of the other encounters but he has a lot of HPs and getting to him is a pain in the ass. the Elder thoughts have at least 200k hps and it takes about 20 minutes to clear to the THO from the Burrower. I am not saying he is particularly hard by any means but he does command some respect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me ask you this...<br />
<br />
What level of encounter was the Emp when Kunark was first released?...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
High end yeah thought so.<br />
<br />
May not have been Top top end but THO is not Ssra or Seru.<br />
<br />
Edit: I know ill get attacked for the wrong thread of logic here so let me put it simply.  They are comparable because 1) things in this game scale.  2) When Kunark came out highest level was 50 3) this encounter is of the 2nd expansion later (hence the really good loot is going to be put on 60+ mobs) 4) I look funny in this hat. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">Actually, Hroth, that's a darn good point.<br />
<br />
However, the crypt never needed a raid level force.  A good group of 50s could have handled it (possibly 2).  And yes, it's gotten easier.  However, even if, 2 expansions from now (assuming EQ is still alive since EQ2 will be out by then), we have a max level of 80 and THO is comparatively easier, the items still aren't comprable.  A raid of 60s or a group of 70s might make it.  However, that still leaves 45-60 as a problem for the ikky shammy.  Not so for the JBB.  Not to mention that the item itself isn't really comprable, for reasons already discussed.<br />
<br />
You're point is well taken, though.  It WAS a lot harder for shaman to get the JBB when Kunark came out.  However, I would argue that getting to the WS now is a HECK of a lot harder now than killing the emperor was back then, even accounting for the level change.<br />
<br />
It's a good point, but please admit that WS isn't comprable to the JBB.  It's harder to get, it's available to ALL shaman (and a decent item to boot) so most shaman races will be rolling on it, it's no drop so it can't be sold, and it's in a zone that takes hours to get through without a raid and doesn't have CoH (yes, I remember the summon corpse :) ).  Personally, I don't think it's as good on an item standpoint either--but that's going to be a personal opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">My point is you can compare them on the stance of good loot going on high mobs.  When Seb was first found do you think guilds took 1 or 2 groups into it? I would venture to say no.  They brought full on raid forces.  To do a comparison Emp is to Track as THO is to Seru.  not exact but it is as close to a x=y, w=z, w=x*a comparison as you can get in this game.<br />
<br />
Its harder to get because of this scale of good loot.  And your assertion that it should be back to Kunark level of difficulty just falls under that old balancing argument that nobody wins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">God I love your replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;nuff said.&quot; <br />
<br />
Do you ever move beyond monosyllabic words? Does mere contradiction win the argument in your mind?<br />
<br />
YOU were the one attempting to show how this item fit the mudflationary curve, and so I refuted that argument by asking you to compare the DD damage that WS does vs. Luclin mobs to the DD damage that the JBB does vs. Kunark mobs. Hello? Are you EVER going to respond to the argument at hand? Jesus christ, you have ADD or something.<br />
<br />
You're thinking ONLY in terms of melee damage when you say &quot;compare the stats.&quot; First of all, Luclin mobs have higher AC and therefore 20/22 isn't as impressive on Luclin as it would have been in the Kunark period. Furthmore, melee damage is one of several categories for stats -- you conveniently ignore the rest. Let's look at the whole picture:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You wanna compare the stats?<br />
<br />
Spear of Fate: 20/30 <br />
10str, 10dex, 10sta, 20wis, 30hp, 70m, 10fr, 10cr, 10mr, 10pr, 10dr<br />
<br />
Winterstorm: 20/22<br />
00str, 00dex, 10Sta, 10Wis, 50hp, 50m, 10fr, 10cr, 10mr, 00pr, 00dr<br />
<br />
- Useless Stats (spear of fate wins)<br />
<br />
- Wisdom (spear of fate wins)<br />
<br />
- Resists (spear of fate wins)<br />
<br />
- Melee (Winterstorm wins)<br />
<br />
- DD ratio (JBB wins)<br />
<br />
- Difficulty to obtain (SoF + JBB win)</div></div><hr />

Emp never took more than 6 and THO will still be hard at lvl 70 (if we ever go that high). Thats all im going to say about the difficulty comparison of the loot holder.<br />
Its not comparable, you cant compare a no drop item to a tradable. This spear will never be readily available to every shaman and the bracer is. You wont see /ooc free WS on THO first come first server, or /auction selling : Winterstorm 30k must hurry to bank though it rots in 27 minutes. Now there will be a time where a few shamans across servers will negotiate a deal to be able to purchase the spear should the item drop on a guild raid. Some one mentioned killing THO for a helm but i hate to tell ya all, THO is more killed for the wizard spell thats on his loot table. He is the only mob that drops Eldreniks(sp?) <br />
VI made the change, VI wont change it back and to the endless litny of excuses to blame iksars for this change is laughable at best for the reason i mentioned in my first post - VI does not listen to you or me. Blaming us (Iksars) is only showing how upset you are at VI and you are trying to find the easiest way to vent your frustration. I wish WS was still a proc, its more fun that way, but its not and wont be. <br />
<br />
Oh and dont forget, the bracer is not comparable to the spear.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT Oh hey i do wanna pass on some sweet info though regarding the THO. We killed him friday night and he dropped 4 items! horns of chaos, helm, FT 2 veil and the wizard nuke. I do think the spear is his rare drop though.</div></div><hr />

I have stated many times I have been on the backside of &quot;uber&quot; but what I was saying is... is THO the hardest mob on luclin?  And when you really think about it how many mobs are harder than the Emp?  Sure he isnt hard to kill but you have to have a high level rough ect..  There wasnt much above the high sebellis mobs when kunark came out... (VP...)</div></div><hr />

It's a huge upgrade from JBB. That's all I'll say. If you can out-damage it with melee alone, more power to you. I am pretty sure that you can't out-damage it with a JBB+melee though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't start a human wizard and then complain your starting int is too low.<br />
<br />
It was known since before Kunark's release that iksar would not be able to wear plate armor.  While it wasn't known that jaundiced bone was plate(shamans being a chain class primarily), it wasn't too much time before the first JB pieces started dropping.<br />
<br />
Don't like the fact that iksar can't wear plate?  Don't start one.  Already played an iksar to 60 and want a JBB?  You knew what you were getting at level one(or should have, at least).</div></div><hr />

Make it an easy quest item (ND). Make it useable at level 45. Give it the same AC.<br />

That will shut the Iksars up.<br />

For about a month.<br />

JBB seems nice but I can live without it, I'm not crying and wheeping because I do not have it. By the time you should be getting Winterstorm and are not a twink its useless. If your guild has cleared Ntov a few times you should have a Sprinkler of the Spirits wich replaces Epic anyways.(THO fight is way too easy, I don't know why people are saying its highend because its not)<br />
<br />
There is no way to compare JBB and Winterstorm.<br />

Anyways all you other Iksar shamans out there can either accept that a JBB type item is not coming avaible to us, or do what I did until I read this post forget they existed because its not that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I'd make the argument for trolls and orgres in Luclin as well, since those races aren't represented in the races that &quot;own&quot; those areas, and settled them long ago. A troll would be just as scary to them as in iksar, perhaps more so, being so ugly and all. ;)<br />
<br />
Thurg, Kael and SS have nothing to do with anything else ... everyone is on equal footing because the races there have had no contact with the &quot;normal&quot; races that inhabit the rest of the planet, and hence no preconceptions (you could argue for small races having a bonus in Thurg though).</div></div><hr />
