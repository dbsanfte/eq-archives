<br />
BUT.... if you want to make sure, go hail him and say the quest text and if he replies then it's all good.<br />
<br />
Text is &quot;I wish to prove my worth&quot;.<br />
<br />
You have to stand in the exact right spot to hail him (and maybe to get a reply).<br />
<br />
I think the magic spot is somewhere near his centre.<br />
Just keep moving in and out and around him until he replies to your hail. Then hail him again just to make sure, then say the magic words.<br />
<br />
Got my boots last week and OMG they own $$<br />
<br />
You will need to be non-kos to CoV or his guards will eat you btw. <br />
You used to be able to be CoTH'd in but now he's got 4 CoV faction guards around him.... :(</div></div><hr />
