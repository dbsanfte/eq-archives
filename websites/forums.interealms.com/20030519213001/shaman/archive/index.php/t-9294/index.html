<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm going to have 3 peices of ogre cultural made for me....<br />
<br />
here are the peices(all):<br />
<br />
veil AC 10, WIS 5, mana 30, HP 30 <br />
neckguard AC 11, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 25, mana 25 <br />
bracelet AC 12, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30, 5 to all resists <br />
gloves AC 12, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 25, mana 25 <br />
cape AC 14, STA 10, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
mantle AC 15, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
skirt AC 15, STA 5, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
sleeves AC 16, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
boots AC 16, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
coif AC 17, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
leggings AC 22, STA 5, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
tunic AC 30, STA 10, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
<br />
<br />
now most my gear is ****.. but I decided i'll be replacing my legs first (still using totemic) and my bracer (still using totemic on 1)<br />
<br />
now for the 3rd.. I considered getting the tunic over my iksar regen bp...  think it's worth it or should I go ahead and upgrade a different slot... the other places I would consider would be:<br />
<br />
Face: (current 6ac5wis)<br />
shoulder:(11ac 2sta 2sv fire)<br />
belt: 9ac 5wis<br />
<br />
<br />
so in your opinion, what do you think is best.. don't bother clicking my magelo, i'm a lazy bastard who still hasn't typed in all the stuff to get magelo v.2 to work :\<br />
<br />
oh btw: lvl 52 ogre no aa... no jbb no epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assuming you make use of Canny on a regular basis (in other words you actually use your full abilities), 5 HP/Tick of regen is aproximately equivilant to FT2 (slightly better than 2 actually). Assuming you are able to use the HP for Canny and don't have it chewed away by a mob.<br />
<br />
The 11 extra AC on the new BP may well save you from taking enough damage to offset the 5HP regen of the Iksar. That depends on how much time you actually spend tanking, how hard the mobs hit, and how high your AC already is.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other options you have mentioned (compared to what you have now):<br />
Belt is : +6 AC, +5 Dex, +30 HP, +30 Mana<br />
Shoulders are : + 4 AC, -2 Sta, + 5 Wis, +5 Dex, + 30 HP, +30 Mana, -2 Fire<br />
Mask is : +4 AC, +30 HP, +30 Mana<br />
<br />
Of those 3, the mask is the least advantageous. Belt vs. shoulders depends on just how badly you need more AC. I personally would go for the shoulders, since I do think that the 5 Wis is (slightly) more useful than 2 AC (despite the fact that I prefer AC to Wisdom in selecting my equipment). Unless those 2 AC would push you over a multiple of 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've posted a similar BP question on the General Boards, and the consensus was Regen &gt; AC.<br />
<br />
However in my case, since I'm twinked about 10K, I use the Barbed Ringmail AC30 HP+50 STR+ 9 for 'battlemail' and the Ikky BP for regen and canni-dancing.<br />
<br />
I was still told to sell the Barbed and upgrade elsewhere though, but I like the set-up.  The extra Wis and Manna are awfully sweet though on your BP though :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">regen &gt; all, but i'm well over 800 ac and i don't really get hit that hard. if i do get hit generally someone else in my group immediatly cheals me so i don't have to worry about it. i am rarely/never soloing or main healing. i've recently got my wis up to 210 from 180 and i honestly don't notice as much of a difference as i did when i finally got myself self buffed over 2k hp self buffed when i got talisman of kragg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">keep the regen bp, you'll miss it.<br />
<br />
any of those other 3 would be worthwhile upgrades, but I'd say go for the belt first, the stats on that are quite nice, about the same as what I'm wearing at level 62.  Good belts are so hard to find, that one will last you a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did you consider anything with focus effects, sometime you might want to sacrifice a few ac/wis for extended range or affliction haste.<br />
<br />
heck, i kinda like sitting outside the mobs casting range while nuking/dotting them while fido chomps their butts. if you group alot, you can always sit behind the rest of the group, see everything going on. If you do pull agro, maybe the mob wil stop and pound on one of the other caster instead of you (evil grin).<br />
<br />
If you solo ALOT i'd recommend effliction haste and extended affliction focus effects (longer lasting dots/slows, faster casting times and longer ranged casting) you might even want some mana preservation. <br />
<br />
I'm 45, most of my equipment has focus effects lvl 2, my ac is still in the 800-900 range, my wis is 202 (207 if i swap my Black alloy medalion for my imbued ivory collar). AND i have an Iksar Cerimonial BP. ok, my wis is what i said above with KEI. i have several kei dealers in my guild, it's been sooo long since i haven't had kei, i would not be able to tell you my unbuffed wis.<br />
<br />
when i cast a spell, i have about 4-5 thing that glow/shimmer as a result of the focus items doing their stuff.</div></div><hr />
