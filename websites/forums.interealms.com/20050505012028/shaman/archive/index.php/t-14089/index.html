<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upcoming for June 11th, 2003 <br />
<br />
It's been a fun month for the EverQuest team. With the recent completion of Veksar and the redesigns of Veeshan's Peak and the Plane of Hate receiving such a nice reaction from the folks that have visited those zones, it's a pleasure for us to be able to work on Droga and Nurga in the same way. <br />
<br />
Seeing so many new faces on the Test server recently has been a great. There's no doubt that we need as many eyes on the complicated changes we make to the game as we can get. We wanted to thank those of you that have taken the time to help us out by logging into the Test server recently; you've been of great assistance to us. <br />
<br />
And as players of EverQuest, one of the most enjoyable things about working on the game is the opportunity to add game features that we've always wanted to see. Many of them are listed below. We think you'll like them as much as we do. <br />
<br />
1) Droga and Nurga revamp coming to Legends. The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones will be on the Legends server, Stormhammer, with our next update. The mines of Nurga will be a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 50. The Temple of Droga will accommodate characters around 50th to 60th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of zones. <br />
<br />
2) Veksar moving to all Live servers. Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <br />
<br />
3) Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus. <br />
<br />
4) Experience range increase for characters above 60th level. This is another change that we are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br />
<br />
5) Shared bank vault will be added. There are times when a player wants to trade items from one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br />
<br />
6) Planes of Power access changes will be implemented. Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br />
<br />
Level 55 and over <br />
Plane of Storms <br />
Plane of Torment <br />
Plane of Valor <br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
<br />
Level 62 and over <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
<br />
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. <br />
<br />
7) Enhanced Spell Descriptions added. Spell casters spend hours studying their trade. It takes great mental effort to understand and master the complicated arcana needed to cast even the simplest of spells. We have added new information to the spell descriptions displayed in game. An additional line of text explains what the spell does in general and includes information such as damage and duration when appropriate. <br />
<br />
8) A new method for memorizing spells. There was a day when casters only needed 32 pages in their spell books, with only 5 spells per page. These days spell books have 50 pages and 8 spells per page. Frankly, that's a lot of spells. We've come up with a new method for finding and memorizing spells that will make things easier for the overburdened spell caster. Right-clicking an empty spell gem will open a list of spell categories. Pointing your mouse at a category will display a list of spells. Selecting a spell from that list will make your character sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br />
<br />
We know that many people are happy with the existing spellbook system. Rest assured that the spellbook isn't going anywhere. This new memorization system is an optional convenience for those who wish to try out a new method of managing their spells. The spellbook remains the only way to scribe new spells. <br />
<br />
9) Spell Favorites. Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <br />
<br />
10) Damage Over Time spell messages. Damage over Time (DoT) spells cause a certain amount of damage to the target at intervals. Currently, the caster of the spell is only told about the damage done the first time the spell does damage. All the other intervals were a mystery. What certainly sounds like an easy feature to add required a bit of work, but after the next update DoT spells will report their damage to the caster each time damage is done. <br />
<br />
If the new messages get to be too much for you, you can disable them in the Options window, much like any other type of damage reporting. <br />
<br />
11) Improvements to the game for new players. New players can be overwhelmed by all of the items they find in the game (heck, so do those of us who have been playing for a few years). To help reduce that confusion, we are adding a Tradeskill tag to items that are used as components in trade skill recipes. To help guide new characters, Guildmasters will take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. There will be even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. In addition, NPC merchants as well as other notable folks will have a title that will explain what their jobs are. For example, a baking supply merchant can be recognized as such by the description beneath his name. <br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week. <br />

<br />
Future Plans     <br />
       <br />
 Further Down the Line Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game. Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are. Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time. <br />
<br />
1) Partial Zone Revamps <br />
<br />
These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the older zones. The goal is to improve the playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of the zone. We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as we move through these. We recently finished Veeshan's Peak, the Temple of Droga and the mines of Nurga. Currently we are working on a partial revamps of The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Sirens Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, Cazic-Thule, and Velketor's Labyrinth. <br />
<br />
2) Updated Character Creation Descriptions <br />
<br />
EverQuest has evolved and improved a lot over the last four plus years. With four years of updates and enhancements, sometimes your information gets outdated. One of the things we will be doing soon is updating the character creation information both in game and on the web site. <br />
<br />
3) Damage Over Time Spell Foci <br />
<br />
We are working on implementing focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells. Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast. Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some focus items affected. But the nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be. A new class of focus items needs to be created to increase the effect of DoT spells. <br />
<br />
4) Items in the Planes of Power <br />
<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate. Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed: <br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
Plane of Torment <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
Plane of Tactics <br />
Plane of Innovation <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
<br />
5) Class Balance <br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br />
<br />
6) Shields and blocking <br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
<br />
7) Tradeskills <br />
<br />
We will be looking at the chance of failure for tradeskill recipes. We are aware of the concerns of trades folk in EverQuest, and it is on our schedule to review things such as the fact that masters of trade skills can fail the easiest recipes. That doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to change it, but we will most certainly look it over - and probably will change it :) . <br />
 <br />
=====================================<br />
<br />
Please notice the part about DoT Foci.  So everyone currently with Extended Affliction, Affliction Haste and Affliction Efficiency is screwed?<br />
<br />
Is the current affliction focus line going to effect roots and slows again and those that want DoT extension, efficiency and haste have to get an new item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, now that's a patch....  I'm sure that after a couple of days of emergency patching, I'll be relatively happy with most of it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flamewart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the better patches in a long time :)<br />
<br />
PoP zones are still gonna make a few of the higher level 'ubers' cranky, but the level restriction in place instead will really help I think.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the're ever going to implement combined cash space in banks for players.  With the Bazaar as ever-popuplar as it is, the ability to buy items has improved hundreds of times over from the good ol' 'sit in EC tunnel and spam the zone' days.  Making money a shared commodity would certainly help folks out.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, DAMN!  Took em long enough ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Spell Favorites&quot;?!?!?! HOT DAMN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Two things here:<br />
1.  I wish they would implement bank withdrawl for items in the Bazaar.  UO implemented this 4 years ago, for purchases of boats and houses.  I hate stopping at the bank to withdraw currency all the time.<br />
<br />
2.  Those tiers are opened up, but I'm sure you'll still need the flags for planar advancement.  I.E. if you kill Agnarr, you won't see that flag show up until you've Aided Askr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I quess we can have KEI for a little while longer. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think these changes are amazing and I definetly look forward to all of em.. tactics and torment will not be opened (yaaay)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im guessing new dot foci will increase damage per tic. Im also guessing that it was impossible to implement until they managed to get dot damage reporting every tic.<br />
<br />
Maybe now they will be able to make a spell casting fury like AA line for dots.. where different tics have chances to crit *shrug*<br />
<br />
Its absurdly disappointing  to feel all proud of laying on massive dots on a critter to see a cleric crit dd it for 2200.. making my blood of saryn seem insignificant in the long run heh.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand, I dont feel low on damage at all for fights like Creator heh. 115k in dots last creator.. mm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MojoTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Interesting point on this though - do you realize that at level 62 you could get into HoH and BoT without any flags - and then if you say won an Ornate Pattern drop - you would not be able to complete the quest to finish the armor as Bor Warhammer will only sell you the emblem and container if you have a tier 3 flag.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they'll be re-working the quest itself to be a level-only requirement on it - or make it so you still need to go and complete one of the other Tier3 zone flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think these changes are amazing and I definetly look forward to all of em.. tactics and torment will not be opened (yaaay)..<br />
<br />
<br />
From the first post above:<br />
<br />
6) Planes of Power access changes will be implemented. Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br />
<br />
Level 55 and over <br />
Plane of Storms <br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor <br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
<br />
Level 62 and over <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
<br />
<br />
So the only tier2/3 zone you need to WORK to get into is Tactics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my giddy aunt, I really hope they do change this in the not too distant future.  Its very frustrating to have 200 baking skill and destroy 5% of all wedding cakes because you just can’t seem to slice them right.  It would be really nice if every combine below X percent of your skill would automatically work.  I’d cross my fingers but I might ruin even more cakes if I do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Working to get into Tactics is not such a bad thing, considering how opening it up will hose the RZ encounter.  Of course they could fix it once and for all by finishing Plane of War and moveing Tallon/Vallon Zek there and most of the quest/trade skill items there also.  That way Tactics becomes a zone like Torment or Lair of Terris Thule; a raid only zone with a single purpose.</div></div><hr />

Yup - Right click on the spell book icon (doh - means putting it back in on my ui) and you get a pop up menu with 3 options (cant remember exact wording), Load Spell List - brings up a submenu listint all of your saved lists, Save Spell List - which prompts for a name for that list, and Delete Spell List - once again brining up a sub menu listing all the lists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not specifically a  KEI nerf, even though KEI selling was the prime motivation for it.  You can't group buff or MGB buff someone too low for a spell anymore.  Before you are allowed to cast a group buff, it's going to check to see if everyone in the group is the proper level.  It occurs to me that if that's the only check they're going to do, you could invite someone, start casting and THEN have them accept.  We'll just have to wait and see how this is implemented to see if it's foolproof.<br />
<br />
Remember, the Bazaar was COMPLETELY safe, and there was NO WAY a trader could be killed (until you got MGB SOE and a fat ogur togather  :)  )</div></div><hr />

From what i've heard the check actually takes place when the spell lands rather than checking the target when you cast the spell so you'd still be able to cast the spell with them in the group it just wouldn't work on them. Same too for MGB. You can mgb with them in range and it just wouldn't land on them.</div></div><hr />

And LOVE the fast spell memming function!<br />
Yesterday I entered test server to try this out... Love it<br />
No more searching through the pages for that gate while a mob is chasing you... you can search through the menus while running and when you click, THEN you sit, mem, and stand (Just sitting the time it takes to mem the spell).<br />
And you can have a setup for hunting and a setup for buffing, and... I think I start to look like a SOE employee :) . <br />
DOT dmg showing... don't really care, but I'd prefer a final resume upon mob's death telling the DMG everybody has done to the mob:<br />
...<br />
You hit a moss snake.<br />
You have slain a moss snake!!<br />
Trolebus did 20 dmg to a moss snake<br />
Smith did 19 dmg to a moss snake<br />
Jobeker did 10 dmg to a moss snake<br />
...<br />
...<br />
Wouldn't it be a nice feature?</div></div><hr />

Nope, its because I'm a class that uses a shield by default and it seems possible I am going to be on the receiving end of some some balancing SOE style.  Personally, given the increased need for mitigation in PoP - which we haven't been given yet - I don't see why we shouldn't get the full benefit of this upgrade to shields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a<br />
 while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile<br />
 choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which<br />
 use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. &quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe i get flamed to hell, but i would simply restrict this block to certain classes or scale it's effectivity down from pure melee towards pure caster.<br />
<br />
Sure as a shaman for example i can equip a shield in battle. Can i use it as effective as a fulltime warrior? Nope.<br />
<br />
Anyway i don't understand their reasoning at all ... again. Either shields are bad compared to 2 handers and dual wield or they are OK. If they are OK, no need to do anything. If they feel, that shields are inferior at the moment, why 'balance' (in the loose SoE meaning of the word ...) the classes, which had to deal with this disadvantage for years?<br />
<br />
I have no problems when melees get a slight upgrade with shields, just leave us alone, thanks.</div></div><hr />

I hope they give Shamans the Bash skill while they're looking at this.</div></div><hr />

I would settle for that: just make the new usage of shields an aa skill trainable by melee classes.</div></div><hr />

Being one of a few places that you can get Di'Zok faction it is a pain in the ass killing 2000+ greenies to get out of KOS.  Had I known when Kunark came out killing sarnacks in my 20's would have hosed my faction I wouldn't have done it.<br />
<br />
Been killing there for a week now every night and no where near to getting out of KOS.  Just hope it doesn't make getting faction any more of a pain since they are raising the level of mobs.<br />
