<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jurais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When your Stamina runs out does your attack speed slow down? <br />
<br />
I 2 or 3 box and have never been concerned about my warrior running out of stamina...never noticed a difference in his attack spd...should I worry about replenishing his stamina?<br />
<br />
I have conflicting answers from 2 uber (both with 3+ years playing in high powered guilds and maxxed out 65 chars) friends of mine....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your attack speed slows if you run out of fatigue, only if your STA is bellow 100.  I think that's only on primary too, although I could be wrong on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When on my monk, I've never noticed any problem myself... he does same damage at same rate, but thats not cold hard facts thats just through many times of just looking at whats going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the folks at Steel Warrior say no, but nobody's ever parsed it, and they get grumpy when you ask about it.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I just toss Acumen on them all, if they don't want it, they can click it off.<br />
<br />
My baby warrior seems slower when he's out of endurance, and the animation/sound noticably speeds up when I extinguish his fatigue.  Things don't seem to die much faster, if at all, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure the magic STA number is 100 like FJ said. Your fatigue bar will still go down but as long as STA is above 100 you won't suffer the ill effects of combat fatigue. Just to keep melee happy though I always slap on Acumen. Better that than to have them yell &quot;invigor please&quot; during a long fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jurais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thx guys!  been wonderin about this for a while..:D</div></div><hr />
