<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read these great posts about the hunting on the iceberg in Tim Deep, but never a mention of how ya get there...boat, swim or what? Looks kind of difficult just looking at the map on EQ Atlas. Also you can bind there is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swim or use Levi and SoW.<br />
<br />
Not that hard to get to, it's just waiting on the boat that will drive you NUTS!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The boat is no longer needed to get to Timorous Deep. You may not have seen them, but there are these nice NPCs on some of the docks called Translocators. If you hail them, they'll offer to send you across the sea to a complimentary site in another zone. If I remember correctly, the translocator for TD is on the docks in Butcherblock (if not there, then it's the one on the docks in Firiona Vie). The correct Translocator ports you to the docks at the elf village in TD, which is on the island next door to the iceberg where the golras are. Lev/Sow gets you to the iceberg from the island in about 30 seconds. You can also bind on the docks on the island in TD.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The boats to Tim Deep are not bad.  There are always rafts waiting in Butherblock (Just get on one and wait 2 or 3 minutes total) and the one in Oasis doesnt take too long.    The translocaters as Lore mentioned are best.  Just for some reason someone always kills them on my server.<br />
<br />
Looking at the eqatlas map - http://eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousdeepmap.html<br />
<br />
See the island marked 12? The brown island right north of it is where the translocator puts you.<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way if you have LoY, i think this zone comes pre mapped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it still impossible to bind in TD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think translocaters are only up with boats are broken =(</div></div><hr />
