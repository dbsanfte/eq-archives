<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alrighty , here comes another post from a fello ranger of the glade<br />
<br />
I have dinged to 60 recently and I have been working on stacking my spells. As I have stacked my spells I noticed something strange. <br />
<br />
I have Warder's Protection adn thorncoat. I tried to cast a DS on me and it won't hold. Then a druid casts their group DS and it holds. Is this strange?<br />
<br />
Also how do all the other 60 ranger stack there spells? I am just asking for some input as to whether I should change the way I stack my spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never seen any other castable DS stack with Warder's protection, whether druid or mage, single target or grouped. <br />
<br />
There are many threads on this subject, I'd do a search. I suspect most of us use WP, Nature's Precision, Force of Nature, Thorncoat, Skin Like Nature, and Storm Strength when self buffing. If you use GWF, you lose Force of Nature, so outdoors you do have a choice to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shield of the Eighth (the rings are very easy to get, except the eighth, which takes a bit of camping)<br />
Thorncoat<br />
Warder's Protection<br />
Nature's Precision<br />
Greater Wolf Form unless faction/zonetype dictates otherwise.<br />
<br />
Force of Nature is too freaking short and expensive for me to bother with; I hate Nature's Precision's duration bad enough, and it lasts half an hour.<br />
<br />
Of course, next level my stacking will be changing to:<br />
<br />
Call of the Rathe<br />
Strength of Tunare<br />
Call of the Predator<br />
<br />
And my ring will remain just another pretty trinket unless I somehow manage to acquire 60 new friends for a ring war or somehow, against all odds, get Protection of the Wild.</div></div><hr />
