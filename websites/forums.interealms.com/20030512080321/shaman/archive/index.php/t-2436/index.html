<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone tell where they generally spawn or what table they spawn off of? Been running around like mad in the swamp with a druid, gotten the whole totem, and 2 broken pieces...of course every ton warrior I kill now has got a dup piece I need. After about an hour of searching I seemed to exaust the spawns, even after killing every frog I came across just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you leave Cab - hang a left - follow the path all the way back to the Iksar Bandit camp - you'll see a huge pillar in a large clearing - you'll find the Frogloks for the cudgel quest in that area. It didn't take long at all to get everything together and it's great hunting for level 27 to about 32.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If that's the place I'm thinking of.. I just stuck by that first iksar camp.. and killed everything in the immediate area.. I got everything I needed + a whole lot of the sk quest pages in like an hour. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmmmm, okay, so slaughter everything in that area. Will do. <br />

On a side note, some named froggie Umlump something or other started chasing me around the swamp last night. very MR, hits for like 220 and fast, couldn't root or slow him. Who is this punk and should I try and kill him? Fortunatly he cant outswim me! =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Umlump is a mob needed for the Druid epic quest.  He can be a pain and can take down well equiped tanks.  He hits hard and decently quick.</div></div><hr />
