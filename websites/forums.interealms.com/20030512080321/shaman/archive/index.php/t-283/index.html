<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">. . . I had video card drivers that worked.<br />
<br />
I download Nvidia drivers that say they are compatible with Windows XP, yet when I try to install them, I get an error message saying that the drivers are not digitally signed and may cause compatibility issues . . . which they did.<br />
I can only play for about 2 hours at a time anymore before the game gets bogged down and runs at only a few frames per second :/<br />
<br />
I've tried everything I know of to correct it and nothing works.<br />
<br />
I just wish I could have a computer where all the video components worked properly.  But, as Jodie Foster said in the movie Contact, &quot;that continues to be my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) What card are you using?<br />
2) Have you tried using older drivers (like those that came with the card)? <br />
3) Are you using NVIDIA drivers or your manufacturer's drivers? It seems odd to me that the detonator drivers aren't digitally signed.<br />
3) What is the square root of 289?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm assuming you are talking about the 28.32 drivers, right?  The digital signing really wasn't that scary for me, the part that bothered me was the 12 foreign language file overwrites!  Of course, if I had read the directions first they wanted me to uninstall the old driver first, heh :)  Before this version I think I was using 28.11, which seemed to work all right (as well as anything works on XP, anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm using the 28.32's and have no problems at all. <br />
<br />
Doesnt sound like a vid card driver issues to me. The &quot;not digitially signed&quot; message just means that Microsoft hasn't given them their blessing yet (WHQL certified).<br />
<br />
Is your HD defraged? Paging file set up right? Could be anything, but since performance degrades after a while, I don't think it is your vid card.</div></div><hr />
