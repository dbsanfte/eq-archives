<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im new to the world of Raiding..and am hoping all you Pro's in here can give me any valued advice????<br />
<br />
I am raiding Xanamech Nezmirthafen (POI) Yes maybe he sounds small fry to you guys, but as a first raid target as a shaman im kinda Arghh....Gulp.........Sweat.etc etc...... :confused:  :confused: <br />
<br />
Im really after any advice on Pre raid buffs, which ones and for whom?<br />
<br />
During encounter......I know I slow, DoT and backup heals......but surely theres more to it than that???? Forgive my innocent approach to this, and be gentle with me : ;) <br />
<br />
Im only a little lvl 53...<br />
Barbarian Shammy I may look tough but hell no!!!!!<br />
<br />
Serious note any advice yet again woul dbe gratefully appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Shez :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay, you're 53.  Not DoTs on raids for a while.  DoTs, especially poison DoTs are super high on agro.  Presumably your tank is also of a like level and equipment, so he's not going to be the agro magnet that a lot of high level tanks are.  Don't take risks on agro just to add a few khp of damage--it's not worth it.  If you want to do dps, nuke.  No, it's not large or efficient, but neither can it wipe the raid.  Don't DoT adds either--your enchanters will hate you.<br />
<br />
Get the mob debuffed as you can.  Land malosinXX first (I think you have malosina at your level, or just use your highest debuff).  MalXX is relatively low agro, so you can chain it.  Then land slow.  Don't chain cast slow and pull agro, per the reasoning above.  Ideally, landing malxx will give your tank time to establish good agro and you can slow with relative impunity.<br />
<br />
I regard my job on raids as primarily crowd control/debuff and then healer.  I seldom do much in the way of dps.  However, that's also in part that I don't have the time to switch targets like mad since I'm the raid leader and have a lot of crap to watch.  Whether you really need to heal is also dependent on some other functions.  Are there adds?  Is there an AE?  Do you have sufficient healing at the raid already?  Does the mob rampage?  Does it flurry?  Those are questions your raid leader should anticipate and assign functions accordingly if they know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
You're not going to have the mana a 60+ shaman will have (no canna 4, 5, pained memory, etc.), so conserve some of your mana for emergency heals on healers (or yourself), and keep a good supply ready for debuffing.  You may not want to do much if any dps if you know there are going to be a lot of adds.  Same with healing.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a lot of what I'm saying ends up being raid specific.  I know that's not a huge help.  Listen to your raid leader, don't run around like a chicken if you get agro (someone will peel it off you, or just die).  When you slow, try to get close to mobs so that they don't chase you all over kingdom come (try to stick close to your MT or main assist tank when slowing, so all the may have to do is turn around).<br />
<br />
At your level, a good raid leader should expect to explain some things.  Also check with your shaman elders in the guild for suggestions on the fight.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The most important thing for you to buff will be whatever adds HP, so if you are the highest level (or only) Shaman there, put Harnessing of Spirit and Infusion of Spirit (if you have it - otherwise Stamina) on the Tanks. <br />
<br />
Also give the Main Tank anything he asks for - it's not worth the argument to explain how little Agi or Str will do for him. And use Spirit of Bih'Li for ATK bonus. Plan on everyone having Oil Spray for the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plan on everyone having Oil Spray for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
Be sure to tell your raid that while Oil Spray is a snare spell, you can still STRAFE side-to-side for nearly full speed and move around adequately if you need to get out of the way. <br />
<br />
The raid will be chaotic, with a good number of adds on the way to Xanamech. There are models in POI that are slow immune; I believe they're the ancient ones. Try to slow everything else as best you can, as they hit rather hard on 50's-ish folks. Save your mana at the end for healing ... you're going to need it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Archaics are immune to slow. <br />
<br />
But really, if the fight to get to Xana is a problem, you probably won't do very well on Xana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Archaics are immune to slow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not anymore.  There were a multitude of previously slow immune mobs that were changed a few weeks ago.  Archaics are now slowable, as is Gryme to name only 2.  I did a chanter epic kill (greasy something) in PoI last night and landed slow on 4 or 5 archaics clearing up to the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In terms of this specific raid, the dragon casts a mean fire AE (especially at lvl 53 I imagine.).  You're job should be to keep as many people healed as possible.  Keep the other healers and dps classes alive as long as possible.<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
General raid stuff:::<br />
<br />
In terms of buffs<br />
<br />
1.  Add HP.  Usually focus and stamina.  <br />
2.  Add resists if needed. Shamans should only be responsible for poison and disease resist buffs.  Druids do fire+cold, and Enchanters handle magic.<br />
3.  If you are playing with melee that don't have their primary stats maxed, and you have time/mana, buffing strength and dexterity is also worthwhile.  Usually via Diaku which you'll get later in life.  <br />
4.  Typically things like sow or regen are stuff you only toss on your own group.  Although if you're bored, its nice to toss regen on necro's to help with mana conversion if they don't have a regen'ing class in their group.<br />
<br />
Raid role<br />
<br />
Totally dependent on the raid and the raid makeup.  If you don't know what to be doing on a particular raid, I'm sure a guild or raid leader could help you.  That said, there are some typical roles you will fill from time to time.<br />
<br />
1.  Healer.  Yes, its true.  Primary healer is not an uncommon job for the raid shaman.  You will typically be assigned to heal either other healers, or dps classes.  I'll often be assigned to an all wizard team, for instance.  If the battle involves mean AE effects, however, a paladin or cleric is necessary to provide group heals.  In which case, your job would be to spot heal the main healer, and others.<br />
<br />
Our guild uses /yell to indicate who might need heals also.  If you are a melee, and your groups healer has died, its expected that you'll /yell to get a heal from anyone that has the time.  Now sure how your raids work.  So even if you aren't the assigned healer for a group, you should always be on the look out for people taking dmg. <br />
<br />
2.  Cures.  Depending on the raid, your task might be exclusively to cure.  Sometimes mobs proc mean disease or poison dots and/or slows on the MT or raid.  Some raids, my only job is to chain cast cure disease on the main tank, for instance.  Other raids, like Quarm in Time, I'm assigned to dps group to keep them cured.  <br />
<br />
3.  Crowd Control.  If you aren't healing someone, or curing someone, and there are adds getting on the clerics, its sometimes worth your while to pull the adds away and root them.  In most cases, this is a job for 'offtankers' (pally's and sk's) or 'kiters' (rangers, druids) though.  People with long lasting snare are much better at managing adds then we are, so while you might find yourself trying to save a cleric by pulling an add of them from time to time, its not really your primary role.  The raid would be better served by having a ranger kite that add, and you heal the ranger.  You're better at healing than a ranger, and a ranger is better at kiting than you.<br />
<br />
4.  DPS.  Ok, if you're time isn't filled with the 'support roles' listed above (remember you are a support class... not a dps class:), then by all means, dot the heck out of the mob.  You'll need to be aware of aggro, and know your main tank though, as others have stated above.  Unless your tank is fairly uber I too avoid poison dots.  And in the of chance the MT goes down... those with dots running are next to die (speaking from many a horrible experience:).<br />
<br />
Just remember that your dps is way lower than classes who's sole purpose is dps.  If you have only 400 mana left, using that to cast one more spot heal on a wizard, so that the wizard can cast one more 7-9k crit nuke, provides far more dps than you using your last 400 mana to dot the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, all of the above is well and good. But here is what you really need to know! (no disrespect heh heh)<br />
<br />
1. You don't have to do anything on a raid except NOT wipe the raid. Even if you achieve absolutely nothing, you don't cast a single spell or do a single swing of melee, but you don't do something dumb that wipes the raid, your raid will have been 100% sucessful. Your first raids are all about learning. Don't expect to be amazing everyone with your skills and your contribution. Your best possible contribution will be to not stuff up.<br />
<br />
2. Listen to the raid leader. Listen to your group leader. Listen to everything, say as little as possible. If possible, try to get into a group with at least a couple of people that you know, and word them up beforehand that you are kinda green and just learning the ropes...people are generally pretty good at taking inexperienced people under their wing, provided that they know.<br />
<br />
3. Keep quiet in the raid channel. If you are not sure what is going on, either ask your group, or send a tell to your group leader, or send a tell to a friend in the raid who probably knows what is going on. If you can, try to chat to people about what is going to be happening before the raid. If you don't know what is going on, do ask (just not in raid channel) If you still don't know what is going on, stay close to your group leader and keep your ears wide open<br />
<br />
4. Assuming that you are not the lead shaman, ask the lead shaman (or any shaman that is more experienced than you) what spells they are going to be casting, and if there are any particular spells that you should cast. There may even be a channel specifically for the shaman.<br />
<br />
5. Don't make a pet unless specifically told it is ok to do so or unless you have pet control AA<br />
<br />
6. Find out who the Main assist tank is and hotkey a target button for him. Ditto backup tanks or rampage tanks. Make an assist hotkey and &quot;assist&quot; the mob to target whoever is taking damage for patch heals.<br />
<br />
7. Buffs may be called in a certain order - check with your group leader. If you can MGB, tell your group leader, but don't just MGB because you can - if they want you to MGB a particular spell, they should tell you.<br />
<br />
8. Nobody ever resisted a heal spell<br />
<br />
9. If you have a cleric in your group, chances are you are going to be in charge of healing that cleric. The clerics (and sometimes druids) will have a complete heal cycle going that may not give them time to heal themselves, so if the mob has AoE or if adds are smacking the cleric, you better keep the cleric alive.<br />
<br />
10. If you die, or if the raid wipes (hope it wasn't your fault), consent all the rogues in the raid, but don't even ask about corpse drags / rezzes unless the raid leader or group leaders are asking if everyone is rezzed yet, and you are not rezzed. It is a good idea to bind in a safe spot not too far away from the raid loc (in your case PoT is fine) in case you have to help with wipe recovery.<br />
<br />
11. If you haven't raided before, unless you have a good broadband connection and a whizzbang computer with bucketloads of RAM, you are going be pretty laggy. You may wish to turn settings down/off to reduce the problem: Reducing clip plane, turning off sky layering, taking off NPC names, turning off showspelleffects, all these things can reduce the lag. If that doesn't work, get used to looking at the floor a lot and turning your back on the action when it starts (if you have decent hotkeys set up, you don't need to see what is going on anyway).<br />
<br />
12. Don't worry, its not that hard. Relax, have fun, look, listen, enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and last but not least next to all those very important and correct tips, here comes mine:<br />
<br />
have fun!!<br />
<br />
especially the first raid is the most exciting one (dont know if you entered that guild now and the guild per se has some raiding experience or if its your first for the whole guild), and i remember when i did my first one, it was hard work, i was tensed and thought its 1000 things you have to think of at the same time. Believe me, it will get more relaxing, and again, its most important to have fun while doing your job as good as you can.<br />
there is imo nothing nicer than a kickass raid with a minimum of needed chars where everyone gives his best :)<br />
<br />
and second of all: get used to being one of those with the most deaths. That, of course, depends on how many shaman are in your guild, but when the tanks/enchanters slack and you do your job well, you will have lots of aggro and love from adds, but as long as they are debuffed, a death isnt the worst thing imo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1.  Add HP.  Usually focus and stamina.  <br />
2.  Add resists if needed. Shamans should only be responsible for poison and disease resist buffs.  Druids do fire+cold, and Enchanters handle magic.<br />
3.  If you are playing with melee that don't have their primary stats maxed, and you have time/mana, buffing strength and dexterity is also worthwhile.  Usually via Diaku which you'll get later in life.  <br />
4.  Typically things like sow or regen are stuff you only toss on your own group.  Although if you're bored, its nice to toss regen on necro's to help with mana conversion if they don't have a regen'ing class in their group.<br />
<br />
5) Don't buff agility.<br />
<br />
Some uninformed players will ask for this occationally, but the sad fact is that AGI has an extremely small impact on AC (something like 6 ac per 100 points, according to a post on the BL forums, although the effect is somewhat class-dependant). AGI will, however, waste a buff slot that can be better used for something else.  Many encounters feature an AoE debuff or DoT of some type, so its sometimes important to keep a few slots open, either for those effects (so they don't overwrite good buffs like Virtue, etc.), or for heal-over-time effects, etc.  You'll occationally get some moaning over this, usually from someone who shouldn't be catching aggro anyway (e.g. rogue, etc.); just politely tell them 'no' and refer them here.<br />
<br />
6) make sure you get your curse removal and group cure spells (e.g. blood of nadox, disinfecting aura, remove greater curse, etc.).<br />
<br />
These spells have very little utility in exp groups, but in raid situations, shammies will often be the only classes with those types of spells that are not otherwise engaged; clerics (and sometimes druids as well) are usually in a CHeal chain and Pallies are typically busy beating on stuff or keeping an add at bay.  As a backup healer, one of your main raid jobs after debuffing is to keep others alive and kicking; make sure you have all your tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another thing any raider should be doing is reading up on the strats your guild will be using.  Hopefully, your guild has a website and posts the strat that will be employed on that raid.  If they don't, go to the Science of War http://www.scienceofwar.net/appform/ and register.  They've got an exhaustive compilation of strats from Tier 1 up through Time, good information.<br />
<br />
On the subject of Archaics in PoI, are they slowable by all or does level play a part in it?  Noticed I could slow them, was wondering if a lower level shaman is able to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think Xanamech needs to be slowed at melee range?  Or am I off on that one?  Can't remember now... EQ memories... slowly... fading... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, you'll need to stand practically under the bucket of bolts's stomach in order to slow him. Don't be afraid to do it. Just wait till the tank has good agro, walk over like you own the zone, debuff and slow. Then heal for all you're worth.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can a level 53 actually land spells on Xano?  I think you might see a lot resists.  <br />
<br />
You might be wise to spend your time and mana spot healing, particularly some of the dps classes. Kill him before he kills you, and keep the folks alive who make that happen faster.<br />
<br />
Spot click on dps classes to monitor their health and keep folks alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if they don't care enough to send you a tell with the specific buff needed, they can go to hell.  If you're battle buffing, and you see a need to rebuff go ahead, but otherwise, MGB and tells are what it's all about.</div></div><hr />

If you can't afford an ER item, use tribute for the raid encounters where it's needed.  It's the only effect I keep on trib.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Forget about slowing or debuffing Xana at your lvl. seriously hes a far to high lvl target for you to worry about him. <br />
you are going to spend this fight trying to stay alive, his ae is mean as hell and  all you have is superior healing. my suggestion is stay alive as long as you can while healing the real healers/debuffers. try and time your death to coincide with going oom :)<br />
<br />
Xanas ae really is brutal on the lowbies, you just dont have the hp to deal with it well.</div></div><hr />
