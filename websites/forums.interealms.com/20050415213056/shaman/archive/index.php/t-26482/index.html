EDIT:  I got stars (yippee) so Im cutting/pasting here.  Just because. =P<br />
<br />
As has been stated many, many times beforehand:<br />
 <br />
The reason for such a huge outcry from the community is the perception that SOE is being underhanded, devious, and a bit childish.  These are not the traits a customer wants to associate with his/her customer support.  I can understand the desire from SOE's side of the table to &quot;nerf&quot; this spell. Really, I can.  However, let's examine this from another perspective.<br />
 <br />
With the advent of DoN and it's new spells and abilities; we suddenly witnessed Shaman doing amazing new things. Soloing the &quot;un-soloable.&quot;  Single grouping Mobs of increased difficulty,  becoming highly desired members again.  Doing more than MGB-ing a raid.  Contributing actual destructive force to a raid once again.  All was well in the realms.  Shaman everywhere praised developers for listening to their concerns about DPS.  Forums abounded with tales of exitement and satisfaction.<br />
 <br />
The developers took a step back and looked at what was happening.  In my opinion, the very sudden rise in popularity of Shaman was perhaps viewed as due to the introduction of a powerful new spell.  Perhaps too powerful.  Now, as many Shaman have come to realize and accept, the intended and actual effect of this spell on pets didn't exactly, shall we say, work to perfection.  That's all well and good.  We can deal with this.  Once again, in my opinion, this is where customer service should have stepped in and said ,&quot;WAIT!&quot;  This is where customer service and SUPPORT had the oppurtunity to shine.  A simple message along the lines of: &quot;We here at SOE are expressing our concern over the spell Spirit of Panther.  We made an error, and feel this spell to be slightly overpowering.  More testing needs to be done, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions on how to revamp this spell; in order to meet the needs and concerns of both the developers and the player.&quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Wow.  In just a few sentences, you not only inform the customer of your intentions, you also engender a feeling of trust and concern.  As of right now, there is a decided lack of both.  Improve this, and more than likely the next time a similar situation arises, the entire process will go more smoothly; and SOE will likely not lose as many customers, who have been turned away by a lack of faith and general frustration with the people who are supposed to address their concerns, wants, and needs.</div></div><hr />

Here’s a break down of the problem as we see it with the current live version of Sprit of the Panther.<br />
<br />
The base DPS for an application of panther is roughly 100 (counting crits from applicable Aas) for a focused duration of about 16 ticks or 1:36 seconds.  Theoretically with full focus and extended enhancement, perfect targeting, etc, one shaman can keep it up on 16 players.  I don’t really think that’s a reasonable balance point though, so lets call it 12 for the sake of argument.<br />
<br />
DPS/Target = ~100<br />
<br />
Target/Shaman = 12<br />
<br />
DPS/Shaman = 1,200<br />
<br />
It actually takes a while for this to get going as it’s being cast on several people, so really it ends up being about half that if you don’t reapply it to the first target.  So roughly 600 DPS for 7800 mana, which most shaman should be able to handle for at least those 12 applications, and in most cases longer.<br />
<br />
600 DPS is higher then even wizards in most situations depending on gear etc.  Given that shaman have never primarily been a DPS class, and have a number of other useful abilities to bring to the table 600 is just plain too high.  The spell needs to be reigned in.<br />
<br />
That being said I’m not dead set on (or even particularly fond of) the incantation that presently sits on test.  Other possible solutions I’ve seen that I think have merit are:<br />
<br />
1: Lower the recast to 10-12 seconds, lower the damage/proc so that the spell will top out at about 300 DPS under relatively conducive circumstances.<br />
<br />
2: Make the spell group, triple the mana cost, add a 50-52 second recast, mark the spell as no MGB.<br />
<br />
I think either of those would be viable alternatives given minor tweaks to the actual values.<br />
<br />
I’m open to any more feedback you have on the subject.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">#2 seems that it'd be the better choice to me. At best you will hit 5 melee, and 6 pets. Not sure how many you could get with the 10-12 recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">of the choices, #2 seems more the thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Rytan,<br />
 <br />
First, thank you for explaining this to us.<br />
 <br />
Is there anything that can be done that will not limit the potential growth of this spell for Shaman who have acquired more mana than your average Shaman? The reason the spell worked as it was (aside from the pet proc bug which most people accept as having needed fixing) is because it grew *with* the Shaman. Those Shaman that could keep it on several targets at once through a raid? You haven't taken into account the time spent targeting the next person in line for the buff, mistargeting because of enclosed spaces (just last night I gave up and started taping '/tar charname' because I got the same unshrunk people every time I cast it during RSS queen) or the fact that we're doing more than just Leoparding/Panthering. <br />
 <br />
Last night my guild had three Shaman on our raid, all with Panther, yet perhaps a total of 15 people and pets, if that, had Panther on them for the Queen fight. There are entirely too many variables to limit this spell on a 'best case' scenario. We had two bombs go off at once, my Cleric was dead, I was at 2%, everyone else was under ten, and I had to work *fast* to get them up high enough in case enough bomb escaped and got near us. No one was getting Panthered in that time. Tougher raid targets have higher hit points or whacky events to deal with, and Shaman have enough to do as it is. That's why many of us believed the spell was fine. For us, it was. My guild is one or two night's work from Tacvi, we have one MPG trial down and will have another one or two knocked out this Friday. We have three Shaman with &gt;70% attendance. We cannot generate the numbers some people are tossing out. If you require parsed numbers, I can get it for you from raid logs in the coming days. There is simply too much going on in the raid for this to happen. Maybe some guilds that have more than three active raiding Shaman can bring this to the table, but that's a small number of people. Balancing people under theoritcal circumstances will just hurt the game.<br />
 <br />
I'm going to invite you to come watch some of our raids. Do it in secret if you like so there won't be any accusings of 'you knew someone was watching, so you were intentionally holding back.' I don't hold back when I raid, I go full blast. You can see what it's like. We're Dark Bane, on the Mithaniel Marr server (soon to be Saryrn) and we raid M/W/F from 5:30PST until 11PM PST.<br />
 <br />
Also, the only reason Shaman are outDPSing Wizards on this is because they tend to overnuke and die soon. I should know, I rebuff them all the time. :P <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm tired of theoretical numbers. I'll be posting the actual, factual thing and asking the other Shaman in the guild to do the same. I urge people of various raiding backgrounds, be you in NToV, Ssrae, Vex Thal, the Eps, Time, Ikkinz, Uqua, Inku'ta, Tacvi, or Anguish. We can come up with some way of measuring this accurately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The way that I work my panther line is just open the raid box and start clicking on names and casting.  With over 10k mana I can keep it up on a few people, but it drains me and by the end of it, if I'm not sitting at oom, it's cause some of the people that I was attempting to cast it on died or I had other responsibilities<br />
<br />
In a typical raid setting, there are only a handful of fights where I'm not responsible for something else and do not have to do anything but cast panther.  Assuming that I have another shaman at least to help perform other duties, in tacvi there is 2 fights where I do not have to do anything but cast panther (and those two fights are just beatdowns.. requiring no skill except to avoid AE ramp at the end and/or hope that you don't get charmed) and in Anguish, only really the last fourth of the keldovan fight (assuming that I'm not the shaman on the adds) and the last part of the Warden fight.  That's it.  So out of a possible what, 15 other fights, there are 2 total fights that I really don't have to do anything but panther and slow, and two others that part of the fight I don't have anything real hard to do.  So, throwing out numbers all you like, I cannot reproduce any solid dps numbers over the lenght of an entire night, because my job in most fights are not to supply panther, but to keep my party cured and healed.</div></div><hr />

If one bit just bit it in an AE, chances are more are soon to follow, making the hotkey completely useless, and less effective than 'Click, cast, click' in the long run.<br />

<br />
There exist *bots* that are doing this. If you're this bored on a raid, you better have 5+ Shaman there to make you unable to find something to do. Too many times, my knowing how to play my class effectively has: kept the MA up, saved a Cleric that was in the CH rotation and inadvertently kept the tank up, rezzed a tank in with CoTW so they have enough endurance to be useful, healed the DPS after Panthering them because they were low, retargeting pets, yelling at the GD Berserker to shrink his fat ass already (personal favorite of mine I have a hotkey set up for, actually), rebuffing a rezzed Warrior so that they *can* tank, casting FA . . . <br />
<br />
Sorry, I'mm to useful and efficient to sit on my ass beside a MoB and use hotkeys to do what is maybe 1/5 of my job, if that.<br />
<br />
And yeah, sure it's not fun to do that . . . like we need something *else* not fun for this class.</div></div><hr />
