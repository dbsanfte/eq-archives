<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is a good spot to make money solo as a Shaman?  Ive done the HGs and the IGs and its decent, but 300p an hour is the best I can get, and usually less due to overcamping.  Is there any good alternate spots that I can earn some significant plat (so as to be able to afford Malo and Torpors) either by soloing or by duoing with a pally.  As for me, I can get to 3K HPs (with Virtue), 240 Wis, and almost 1K AC, but I do not have a horse, JBB, or Epic.  (I do have ODS for the MP3).  Any assistance I can get, I greatly appreciate.  Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best money I’ve made in game has come from selling trade supplies in the bazaar.  I used to farm spiderling silks, spider silks, and lion skins and make a HUGE profit.  However, prices have dropped a lot on my server and even before that, considering the time it took to do the farming, I’m not sure if it was really any more money than you could make from Ice Giants.  But depending on what trade supplies sell for on your server, it still might be worth looking into.</div></div><hr />
