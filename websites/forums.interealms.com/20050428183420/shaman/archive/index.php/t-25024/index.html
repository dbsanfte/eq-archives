<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rumors they are plugging them in at 12:01 AM pacific, but nothing concrete, anyone know? Man, getting up at 3:00 Am will be brutal when you gotta work a full day too. Some people have copies already, the local EB said there is a possibility of releasing the games after 7:00 tonight but I do not know yet.<br />
<br />
I feel much shame. Blowing off a perfectly good chick too, priorities! I am a man-geek.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Considering they're doing the &quot;Meet the Blizzard Team&quot; thing at Frye's, and will begin selling the game at 12:00 AM PST, it's probably a good bet they'll start bringing servers up at that time too. But who knows? They may actually wait until later in the day to give everyone a fair chance (remember, they wiped everything from OB for this very purpose).<br />
<br />
Time will tell. Even though I'm off tomorrow, I'm not getting up at 2 AM Central time to find out. :) I'll swing by GameStop tonight to see if they're going to release the game early though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It sure would be a good thing to slowly bring up the servers. Would reduce a bit of the cluster it's going to be. hehe..I can only imagine how crowded the lowbie areas are going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I want tog et on as early as possible to try and escape the newbie zones as fast as I can. Haven't looked forward to a launch like this since EQ. New system should arrive tommorow as well, weee!!!! May as well go buy coffee today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am hoping they are up by atleast 10am EST. Since I called my EB store and they said I can pick it up in the morning. ****ty thing is I gotta work at 2:30 est so I don't have much time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stores being hardcore about releasing the game before tommorow, my brother said he is going to try to bribe the guys with 40 bucks, haha.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just called GameStop. They told me they would be receiving them &quot;late tonight so they'd have them for release first thing in the morning at 10 AM sharp!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Uh...yeh....RIGHT! GIVE IT UP PUNK! You KNOW you've got 'em in the back room already! Don't make me jump over that counter now! Time to hand out a FRESH can-o-whoop-ass! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ugh, my Gamestop said that they aren't expecting the copies in until 1pm EST themselves. :(  But hell , i'll go in at 10 when they open and freakin' WAIT for the truck myself.<br />
<br />
I'm just lucky I got a lot of time off due to the vacations,  Maybe i'll be able to get high enough in level to get out of the newbie areas quickly.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is going to be a patch to download if you install from the CD?<br />
<br />
I deleted the beta client (just completely missed the part where they said we could use that client after a patch for retail) and... well, i'm on a dialup, i HATE patching, no matter the downloader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Detton,<br />
<br />
I imagine there will be a patch from the CD load, they patched the servers like the day before open beta ended, I doubt they could have printed all the CDs afetrwards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ive taken a oath to not let WoW run me like EQ did. I bought HL2 specificly to have a destraction from WoW cause iw as really starting to dig it at the end there and now that im looking back i can see i was falling into the trap.<br />
<br />
I got to be winXP Professional certified by january, this is the best surf season in FL and i simply work a lot too, i cant fall into it too deep.<br />
<br />
On the plus side with all these things happening at one, i cant say im very bored. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Getting cold up here in VT, not much to do in winter, I am gonna be so deep into it it will make EQ look like a good habit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There was a post somewhere before open beta ended about the bought CD versus the downloaded client on your computer already.  Looks like open beta participants have either a small patch to download or no patch at all after registration, whereas the store bought copies are an earlier version and will need to patched for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Btw after speaking to an Ebgames sales rep in the store i was told that they don't care abous PST time. They said game is released on nov23 LOCAL time and date. So that is still tomorrow. Maybe other places work differentyl but i got my pre order with them.<br />
<br />
Ah well tomorrow i will be vindicated.<br />
<br />
edit: And those cawksuckers had the door open to the backroom and you could see all the boxes and all made me wanna cry. The guy was easily 300lb so no hopes i can push him over and grab a copy and run :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The local EB store here said they have the boxes in the store (had them on Friday), but they won't sell them until they open at 10 AM tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">24 hour Wal Mart  (http://www.walmart.com)  Gotta love wally world they are making it available at midnight  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You SUCK! :D  j/k.  I honestly dont know if my Gamestop will even have them when they open at 10am.  :(  So i'm going to be calling them every half hour until they do, lol.<br />
<br />
Must... renew...hunter...goodness<br />
<br />
I wanted to get HalfLife 2, too, but I only had enough for one game, and it was already on pre-order.   <br />
<br />
/cry<br />
<br />
Too much goodness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here, pre-order at EB, boxes in back, not being distributed until tomorrow at opening.  Almost convinced the 300lb female manager to open early, but could not bear to flirt with her.  Guess I'll have to wait until lunch to go over and pick it up.  Will be logged on tomorrow night with the other lemmings.  Cya then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would imagine the game servers are already up (you know those blizzard coders are already playing =P), but they'll keep the account registration servers down until the last minute.<br />
<br />
At least, I hope it all goes that well... 24 hr walmart is literally across the street, if all goes well, I may well be sitting at home with a box at 12:10 am =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmmmmm.....<br />
<br />
&lt;-- Lives maybe 3 miles from a 24 hour SUPER Walmart.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmm indeed! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just got a call in saying i'll be able to pick up my copy in the morning.  It was automated, so I dont know for sure if they'll have it, I can only make the assumption that - since their computer kicked off the call - that their trucks came in after they closed up the front shop.<br />
<br />
So, heres hoping for an early tomorrow session!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Picking my copy up from a Walmart at 0001 tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Let's see, <br />
UNC plays at 9 tonight. (20 minutes away)<br />
Assuming they defeat their enemies, I will be in good spirits at 11pm.<br />
That leaves me 45 minutes to get the battlestation read before I head to Wal-mart for the Midnight Stocking.<br />
It takes precisely 14 minutes to reach the store. <br />
<br />
I will need to pick up the game, a case of Icehouse, some crack from the 90-year old pusher at the entrance, some 100 grand bars, a bottle of Jergens, and a box of tissues. I will read the entire game manual at the stoplights on the way home, soiling myself many times. <br />
<br />
I will have the forethought to leave the front door open when I leave for wal-mart so I don't have to waste precious WoW time re-opening said door on my way back into the house.<br />
<br />
During the installation, I will be watching Orc/Human porn. This is when the Jergens and tissues come to my rescue.<br />
<br />
...and perhaps I share too much.<br />
<br />
<br />
GO TAR HEELS!</div></div><hr />

Theres a fine line between addiction and obsession.  I'm not sure where it is, but that HAS to be several feet across it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Called EB here in Toronto, they said I can pick it up first thing in the morning. So I will be waking up in about 9.5h and getting my copy, woot :)<br />
<br />
They better not screw me over or I'll be pissed.</div></div><hr />
