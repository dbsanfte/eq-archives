Mission NPCs are taking a short break. <br />
<br />
Hey folks, <br />
<br />
It seems that some among our community have figured out a way to duplicate mission crystals and are being naughty. In order to prevent the naughty folks from taking advantage of this obvious bug, we will be removing the mission NPCs from the world for a while. The mission NPCs will return once the bug is corrected and those who have exploited it pay penance. <br />
<br />
We are tracking this issue and are aware of the folks that are using the bug. Their duped crystals will be wiped. Items purchased with the duped crystals will be removed and accounts that were found to be duping may face disciplinary action, which can include banning of the account. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Swift, decisive and impressive ... but disappointing, too. I managed to scrounge up some information on the missions and was looking forward to trying a few. Bleh, people are morons. I hope they're banned.</div></div><hr />

Har.<br />
<br />
My information isn't real valid unless there are NPC's who can give me the missions. I'm effectively grounded - like everybody else - until they can bring the NPC's back.</div></div><hr />

(seems to me, that in the past SOE loves to watch RPGexpert for possible nerfs to implement)</div></div><hr />

Click your way to 20AA in no time.  I dont know if the weapon actually worked that way of it it was just a misprint on the ID tag. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Click your way to 20AA in no time.  I dont know if the weapon actually worked that way of it it was just a misprint on the ID tag. /shrugYah I saw that too.<br />
<br />
Assuming you can reliably click that 2 x / second, though, that's only 100 dps.  <br />
<br />
If you could reliably click it 5 x / second, that would still only be 250 dps.  That's decent, but less than most dps classes can pump out.  And I expect that microlag would prevent anything much beyond 2 x per second.<br />
<br />
So assuming zero time wasted on such non-essentials as rooting, rerooting, healing, slowing, crowd control, or pulling:  150 seconds to kill a 15 k hp mob; 300 seconds to kill a 30 k hp mob.<br />
<br />
Twelve to twenty-four mobs per hour; two to four pct aa per kill; perhaps 75 pct of an aa per hour?<br />
<br />
A good group in most Omens zones would be a more realistic way to get those aa I think.</div></div><hr />

Yup, mistagged... dev has already posted that it's getting changed to the intended &quot;combat&quot; instead of &quot;must equip&quot; (i.e., proc instead of clicky).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh yeah I saw the dd sword being used effectively the other day.....a whole zone of corpses.....like the gms wouldnt see that one lol. The guy had the thing setup somehow on autofire and dark blue mobs to a lvl 70 were going down in under 2 seconds. Guy was getting like 25 aa an hour and he was massacreing the zone for many hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Simple to do if you ever had jboots or circlet of shadow as a necro you would know. Hotkey the item and all you do is press it over and over can even do while running.<br />
<br />
I actually did some testing with m ycirclet and you can easily do 10-15 clicks per second!. The amount of dps you can put out with this thign is sick. Just tag mob with a dot and immedaitly start clicking the dd over and over running around. Would be dead in no time and you can do that non stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The other day?  its only been out for 24 hours, or did you see it in beta?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that this really affects is the fact that now you can't physically see what you can spend your points on, and now you can't turn in your crystals for faction.  It DOES NOT affect who you receive the tasks/missions from.</div></div><hr />

Odd ... I wandered over there (the camp over near Broodlands zone-in from Lavastorm) this evening before our raid and there were no NPC's in the camp at all.</div></div><hr />

  Just out of curiosity, what were these other exploits?  And for that matter the current one if anyone knows.   I like to understand people's goofs, so just giving the name or result of the exploit is like a teaser.  I wanna know what it was the programmers actually overlooked (and the Beta testers presumably)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunatly, beta testers only get to actually use about 50% of the content that goes into an expansion.  I logged into beta almost every day since beta opened and tested what was availible to be tested and never once was I asked to test the turn in or purchase NPC's.  They werent active.  They were there..but I never saw the items they offered or had any interaction with them.  I did miss the last 2 days of beta because of a hardware issue on my end, so its possible they did the testing at that point but the dev crew was working on fine tuning raid content the last time I logged in.</div></div><hr />
