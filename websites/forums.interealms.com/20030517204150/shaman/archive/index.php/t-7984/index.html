<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I recently dinged 54... And after a run-in with a Firiona Vie guard, realized I am nowhere near as awesome as Canni3 makes me feel. I've been grouping with guildies in Maiden's Eye and Umbral Plains, but my exp just doesn't seem to budge. Hours of grouping in UP netted me one blue. After seeing 1% after every kill in HHK, that's a bit distressing.<br />
<br />
So, I'm asking... Am I just really spoiled by the 50+ Paludal (HHK), or am I just in the wrong place? Should I be taking my guildies someplace like The Deep, Acrylia Caverns (we're a bit Pally-heavy)? Or should I just sit on my butt in HHK grinding my way to GBF and Torrent? Is there any better place for a non-epic/jbb/fungi shaman to solo at 54?<br />
<br />
Cash is nice but not a requirement, and so long as it doesn't screw over my Shadowhaven or CoV / Thurg faction, it's good. Looking mainly for solo spots, since grouping is a bit sketchy. Also, I don't have PoP, yes, i'm just that damned gimp.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just to let ya know, yesterday evening about 9 pm EST or so, the Gnolls have taken over JaggedPine.  They are now in the town where you port in, and nothing but Gnolls are on track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gah, hit enter too fast.<br />
<br />
JP is fast decent exp at 54.  The gnolls always drop coins, most drop from 4pp and up.  That may not seem alot at one time, but over time adds up.  If you do go to JP, at this time, you'd need a good group now that the gnolls are everywhere.</div></div><hr />

That may not be on every server. IIRC, I'm pretty sure there is an activated &quot;war&quot; in that zone, similar to the one in Hollowshade Moore. The zone should reset itself after a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, hoping that I can clear up some confusion here.  Yes, there is an activated war in Jaggedpine Forest.  It is done the a few minutes after the head gnoll, Barducks Darkpaw, is killed.  The gnolls come and attempt to take over the small viliage.  If the main guard is saved, then you get a few items from him, but not anything big from what I have heard.  I have seen everyone in the town killed except for the banker, and I have seen no one killed before.  Anyways, the main gnoll is up every 24 hours, and if after he's been killed and then gnolls have taken care of the city, it takes about 2 hours for the zone to reset itself.<br />
<br />
Okay, as far as exp goes, I did 54 and 55 in HHK.  I realize that you may not see the exp move that much there per kill, but I'm telling you that the mobs are soo easy to kill, that you're bar will move fast.  Because the area became perma camped for a few weeks when I made the mistake of telling my roommates brother about the area, I went adventuring to find another spot.  I can tell you that solo wise, it was easily the best place to go to.  <br />
<br />
When I hit 56, i was still able to get 1/2 yellow per C3 there, but I thought that it was slower than what I started to get in JPF (jaggedpine forest).  I did most of 56 - 58 in JPF, and then 58 - 60 in Katta.  All of this was done solo, so I know that it can be done.  I was not able to click on your link, so I don't know what stuff that you have, but I have found that with my limited gear, i was easily able to handle that area.  Oh, and I didn't get the horse and ODS until almost lvl 60, but that did make a huge difference<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out some</div></div><hr />

They root and rot very well but you can toe to toe them without much problem if you have a half decent (75+) FR on.  Their proc is semi-resistable.</div></div><hr />
