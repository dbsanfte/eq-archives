<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry I couldn't answer my own questions but the closest thing I could find was a post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2492) saying a twinkie gear list would be made. If i missed it please post a link. <br />
<br />
I'm twinking a troll shammy with about 3kpp.  <br />
I already have 2x forest loops, 2x 6/56 rings, JB helm, 25AC 50HP shield, Blacked Alloy Medallion, and some random gnome skin - vest, gloves, that was in my main's bank. I'm using a beetle stinger as a weapon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
Should I ditch the forest loops for 2AC 35mana 25hp earrings?<br />
What should fill my armor slots until I can afford more JB? Rygorr?<br />
Should I use 1 and 2hb as well as pierce?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes ditch the forest loops wisdom doesnt do as much as pure mana does at low lvls, and HP is always good.  Yes ry'gorr will do, totemic is another good option.  No, unless you have unlimited cash, dont bother with any skill but piercing, unless something good happens to fall into your lap.<br />
<br />
also ditch the gnome skin chest, if i remember correctly it has bad AC and ry'gorr or totemic or something similar would do better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes even if joo broke bother with both 1hb and 2hb  /doh  this is a no brainer.  Just get any usable piece of junk 1hb and 2hb and keep da skills up.  2hb is fantastic after joo get to lvl 20 and just gets better.<br />
<br />
At da lowest levels pierce and 1hb will do the best for you but after lvl 20 or so 2hb will have a big impact on how fast joo can lvl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmmm... my recommendation depends on the price of Ceremonial Iksar Regeneration BPs on your server.  If they're 4k or less, then sell the Forest Loops (300+ each), scrounge up a little more cash, and get an iksar BP.  This is without a doubt the item that will give you the biggest power increase.<br />
<br />
If you can't afford an Iksar BP for awhile, JB pieces shouldn't cost that much more than Ry'gorr (at least on mature servers) - a few hundred plat each for the minor pieces (boots, gloves, arms) - each is a great value for the money.<br />
<br />
Beetle stinger is a fine weapon.  Ideally you'd want 1hb and 2hb weapons- but I wouldn't consider it critical.  As you level, your melee will become less and less effective.  Around 40 it becomes laughable.  I never trained my 2hb skill as much as I should, but even if I had, the pitiful damage output (compared to the JBB or spells) makes it not worthwhile.  I've even considered going to dolly route (Paw in main hand, 9 AC + 9 WIS... nice!) but I just can't make myself do it.  Matter of principle.</div></div><hr />
