<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I should know this, but it never really came up much until I started doing these LDoN dungeons.  Can you safely dot a mob that the bard is mezzing with a bard song?  I dont know if bard songs are &quot;continuous&quot; so that a dot will not break the mezz in any significant way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should treat it like any other mez.  Your dot will invariably mess up a bard's mez.  Mind you, the bard's mez is a lot shorter duration than enchanter mez so you will notice that the bard has to mez, twist twist, then mez again, twist, twist.  You would help the bard a lot if you malosini'd or malos'd his mezd targets.<br />
<br />
Also, I sometimes root those targets too if they're not close to anyone else to try to alleviate some of the burden off of the bard who has better things to twist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bard mez is not actually a mez, it's basically an automatic chain stun.  The stun hits every 18 seconds, and as long as it isn't resisted, it is enough to keep a mob perma-stunned, giving the appearence of being mezd.<br />
<br />
So, if you dot a mob, and do damage every tick (6 seconds), you WILL break a bard's mez, and they won't be happy.<br />
<br />
Also, a good point is made about malox.  I malos all mobs that get mezd to reduce the chance of an ench/bard getting a resist and getting pummeled.  The chance of resists is even higher with a bard since the check occurs every 18 seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Xev.  Your post raises another question.  In working with bards in these LDoN dungeons, does it make sense for the shammy to hit the bard-mezzed mob with petrifying earth, so the bard can stop mezzing and go melee the targeted mob?  Seems like a waste to keep the bard busy on a single add through the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If a bard doesn't sing another song, they can mez one target indefinitely and melee another at the same time (to proc epic, or what have you)<br />
<br />
One extra to mez won't keep a bard engaged.  2 or 3 is where it becomes fun :)</div></div><hr />

It depends on your relationship with your bard.  You should ask the bard his or her preference or let him know that you will be rooting adds to help him if he wants.  For me, when I group with my brother, I just root a mob when it's convenient and my brother stops mezzing.  He can usually tell the way I play.  If the bard prefers to just keep mezzing, then feel free to just nuke the main tank mob as usual-- just make sure you slow the mezzed stuff first-- according to that visitor bard who was telling us how to play with a bard, he prefers that we maloxxx the mob before trying to slow it.  Again, talk to your local bard for preferences.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yea, regarding the other post, I think the bard mez is in fact mez.  The only component it is missing is the chance to memblur (which Dreams of Ayonae actually has-- but that's the only one).  Think of each mez twist as an 18? second mez/screaming terror without the memblur unless the bard is using dreams of ayonae (stun means the mob can't do anything even when you hurt it, mez means it wakes up when you hurt it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">(of course you could always assume the bard really sucks, and just help him out as much as possible with roots and stuff-- this default method of operating is fine-- doesn't really hurt the bard in any way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rooting for a bard while he mezzes cause the mob is away from camp isn't always a good idea.<br />
<br />
  Last I saw the bard mezzes actually move the target around periodically (not much though, took me forever to notice that the mob was popping around).   It may only be one type of their mezz that does this, but it would mean that even if you root it somewhere safe to kill, mez may break with it rooted somewhere dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bard mez (and first, a caveat, my bard is level 52, I haven't gotten to play with higher level mezzes which may or may not push) works very similarly to Virulent Paralysis.<br />
<br />
It &quot;pushes&quot; the way the bard is facing, every tick.  If the bard is facing away from the critter under mez, this actually becomes a pull.  This can be very useful for positioning stuff.<br />
<br />
When I'm keeping something mezzed and meleeing something else, I'll change the direction I'm facing periodically so the mob doesn't wind up going off at some wierd angle - or up a wall or off an edge or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes no sense whatsoever.  If it was a stun, you could dot it all day long and no one would care.  Since it IS a mez...you cannot dot without breaking it every 6 seconds, just as you said.  I'm not getting how you can call it a stun and a mez in the same post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Plunkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To clear up confusion...<br />
<br />
I have a 57 bard on Xegony.<br />
<br />
I have no experience with higher level mezzes, but they work the same way as the lower level mezzes. (afaik)<br />
<br />
Bard mez is just that...mez.  It mezzes the mob for up to 18 seconds, lowers their MR a tad and also pushes or pulls the mob depending which way the bard is facing each time he/she mezzes it.<br />
<br />
Any spells that do damage to the mob will break mez, but debuffs are ok. (and appreciated)<br />
<br />
I just wanted to bring up that rooting a mob that a bard is mezzing, *may* be pointless, since each time the bard mezzes it pushes/pulls the mob and may break the root.  I can't confirm this though, as I've always been on the bard's end and didn't see &quot;your root spell has ended&quot; messages.  So, either root the mob, or let the bard mez it, don't bother doing both. (unless the mez doesn't break root somehow - can anyone confirm this?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Artebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a level 65 bard used to grouping with at least one shaman, I can reply to a few issues here.<br />
<br />
First, bard mez is a mez and not a regular stun. Any damage will break it, just as with enchanter mez. DoTs will make it impossible to keep a mob mezzed by a bard.<br />
<br />
Second, until level 65, all bard mez songs move the mob a little bit. At best a bard can use this for mob placement, at worst it's an annoyance that a bard needs to work around to avoid the mobs ending up in bad places. (The level 65 bard mez song, instead of moving the mob around, makes it do its dance animation, if it has one.)<br />
<br />
Third, I personally am all for rooting mezzed mobs, but not as a high priority. I'd prefer malos and slow on the mob first, and then root if nothing else needs doing. Rooted mobs also have the advantage of not going straight for the cleric when you start fighting the mob. Note that bard mez movement, not being a nuke, will not prematurely break root. I tend to keep mezzing anyway, because most of the places I tend to fight are close quarters that have mobs with long reach.<br />
<br />
Last, a good bard who uses target toggle can easily keep up a 2-3 song twist while mezzing one additional target. In the worst case, the bard can melee a mob while keeping mez on one other mob. Only when the bard needs to do a lot of retargetting does it get difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is a mez that pulls mob toward bard, one that pulls mob away and one that doesnt move the mob (level 65). So if bard is &lt;65 (or doesnt have 65 song) the mob will move. The movement wont break root though.<br />
<br />
Bard fizzle+resist rate on mez is phenominally higher than a chanter. Malo is very, very important on mezzed mobs. Often I find mezzing 3 malod mobs as easy as mezzing 1 unmalod mob. I would much rather have a shaman malo a mob first, THEN root while malo is refreshing. Also charisma buff will reduce fizzles on every song.<br />
<br />
As previous poster said, communication is everything. Many bards will pull with their 55% slow. Let's say 1 add comes (bard says 'inc 2'). The smartest thing in that case would be for the shaman to assist the bard and immediately malo the add (not slow the target). This would mean 1 mob is easily mezzed and the other is 55% slowed. Unfortunately most shamans will slow the pulled mob, meaning one is shaman slowed, and the other has a good chance of resisting mez and is unslowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heheeh, well, we would malo/slow the add if most bards changed targets with the ADD INC message.  Unfortunately, most dont nor do they OoS the add fore it gets to camp. <br />
<br />
But I like having them around for the most part and would not punt one for an enchanter either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd just like to re-enforce the comments Yodelroy made above, they are superb pointers to working with a bard.<br />
<br />
Most people simply dont play regularly enough with a bard to learn fully what they are capeable of, hell there are so many PoP powered 1-65 in 3 seconds bards about that many BARDS dont know, this tends to lead to way over estimating (claims of DPS &gt; monk) or underestimating (just play mana!) them.  <br />
I was so impressed I switched mains (Wilu and Kare are the same account, not boxed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a very very common misunderstanding of how root works.<br />
<br />
Root doesn't say &quot;keep critter in this loc&quot;<br />
<br />
Root says &quot;reduce this critter's natural movement to zero&quot;<br />
<br />
You can move a rooted critter around all you want, it stays rooted regardless of PC/pet push, spell knockbacks or even Gate.<br />
<br />
For that matter, you can be rooted and gate to another zone and you'll be rooted at your bind spot until it fades.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Most of the important points have already been made, but I can't pass up a thread about bards and shamans together. ;) I have a 65 bard with way too much total /played (although not nearly as much as some!) and a 57 shaman. <br />
<br />
It's pretty trivial far a bard to keep one mob mezzed (using the switch between last two targets button) while melee'ing and twisting - assuming the mez resist rate is low. This means that the best thing you can do to help the bard mez is drop a Mal* on the target. If the mob never resists a good bard can mez while losing virtually nothing (1 of 4 songs out of his twist). <br />
<br />
A minor point that hasn't been made yet - bard mez's last UP TO 18 seconds, but the actual guaranteed duration is only 12 seconds. It's a 3 tick song, but if it starts during the last second of the first tick, that counts as the first tick. And it'll break in under 13 seconds. Bardsongs take 2.5-3 seconds to cast (I forget exactly, pretty much 3 seconds). So this means that the theoretical best a bard can do &quot;permanently&quot; is mez four mobs. And that's with no resists. So if the bard is mez'ing 3-4 mobs, Tossing Mal* around on them is even more important. The bard occlusion/harmony of sound resist debuffs also only last 12-18 seconds, so a bard who needs to use those before each mez can only mez two mobs. <br />
<br />
Judge whether mal* is needed to help the mez'ing by how hard it is for you to stick slows. The resist check is identical, I think. Just a base MR check, with the high level mez's. The L 50 mez's have some MR mods, but the higher ones don't. If you need MR debuff to stick slow consistently, the bard needs it to stick mezz consistently. <br />
<br />
Slowing something the bard has mez'd is very help, just like with a chanter mez'ing. But even morso, since the tiny duration means that a string of resists could pop the mob loose at any moment. Root will play perfectly well with bard mez's. Root parking the mez'd ones is nice, but most likely they'll be right on top of the party when they get mez'd. So if you root them there, the bard still has to mez. A bard COULD move the mob away with the pushback on mez, and then stop mezz'ing, But that'll take time, and unless there's several mobs, it's probably not worth it. In extreme situations (pulls of 5 or more, where the bard has 4+ mobs to mez, which is somewhat beyond his capabilities due to the limited mez duration), it's hugely helpful for the shaman to slow/dot/drag away and root one or two, to get the numbers down to what the bard can handle. In these cases, always pick on the melee mobs and leave the casters to the bard, where mez is much more effective than root and slow (but most all shamans probably know that bit anyway). <br />
<br />
More than you wanted to read most likely, but bards and shamans together is my favorite topic, as they're my two favorite classes, and I always love to have the one I'm not playing in my group. <br />
