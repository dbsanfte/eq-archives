<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grill0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started a Shaman a couple weeks ago to 2 box with my original account. Started a Pally with the first account and the shaman with the second. My Pally is now lvl 24 and the Shammy is 23. I wanted to quickly hop the shammy to 25 for the new spells so I went to PC and got in a group. Within a couple minutes I was oom and the group was acting like I wasn't pulling my weight. <br />
<br />
 :confused: I guess my question is - What is the group role of a Shammy and am I doing something wrong? <br />
<br />
I am mainly using him as a healer and slower. In PC the mobs were dropping so fast that I couldn't get any slowing spells off, so in that situation I was just healing and buffing. <br />
<br />
 :confused: My other question is - How does a shammy succesfully solo?<br />
<br />
I don't do it much with the 2 accounts, but tried to fight a few dark blue solo mobs and had a hard time and ended up blowing through my mana and running for the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow. My group role has not only changed over time (levels), but changes based on group composition, so I don't think I can answer your first question. And I don't solo very much at all, so I can't answer your second question. <br />
<br />
But I think everyone just kind of feels out their niche, based on what they feel comfortable with and what works for them. <br />
<br />
Lately I've taken to only inviting dpsers, and I buff, pull, slow, and heal, doing CC via OT if group has no other CC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Solo?  In the early levels you have two ways:  Root Rot, or Rot &amp; Tank.  You can do these in the higher levels, but you'll probably end up doing a hybrid of the two.  That is, letting your pet tank mostly while you root rot.<br />
<br />
Root Rot?  Cast root on mob, cast several DoTs, sit (or recast root).  Med..... repeat.<br />
<br />
Grouping....<br />
Depends.  Don't blow your wad buffing all at once.  Spread it out.  If the monsters are dying too quick... don't slow.  Blast away or heal or both.<br />
<br />
Life becomes so much easier when you get Regen and Cannibalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well you are right, in PC the MOBs drop faster than Anna Nicole Smith looking to....well anyway you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Buffs. Wow.  If they are whupping up on MOBs quick, then IMO, there is no need to buff EVERYBODY with EVERY buff.  Besides, a 67 point STR buff has been shown to return a 7% DPS gain.  <br />
<br />
If you are the main healer - then heal.  Tell them that buffs will come as you have mana.  If they over pull or pull when you are LOM? Let somebody die (NOT YOU).  Find people who aren't idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I grp'd till about 16 then solo'd straight to 54.  I never liked casting buffs on people and at those lvls buffs didn't last that long.  That is the one thing that drives me crazy is recasting buffs.  I root rotted till I got our first pet at 34 then tanked to raise my defense.  I used this tactic till 54 in OOT then moved on to the planes where I started grp'ing with others.  Now at 65 I hardly do pick up grps unless they are Advens or GoD grps, otherwise I solo diaku's in Tactics with root rot tactic.  In grps now I'm mainly just the &quot;slower&quot; and will toss heals and hot's in when needed as well as nukes.  Most mobs die so quickly so I never use my dots unless solo'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Things will be easier at 29 for group roles.  Still, at 24, you get regen and cann1 which is a decent combo for the level.  Combine those spells with the canni dance (see medicine cabinet for info on canni dancing, has nothing to do a small towel, some heavy breathing and folks pumping money into your thong) and many of your mana issues will be history.  You'll still have to balance buff output, most at that level really don't have all the punch they should for their heavy mana costs, so figure out what you really need and stick to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are as many answers as there are Shaman.  Here's just one.  After level 24, when you get the cannibalize spell, you never get to rest.  If your mana's not full and you have some reasonably safe amount of hit points, you're canni-dancing (cast canni, sit briefly, stand, cast canni, sit briefly...seemingly forever).<br />
<br />
When you have mana, you're keeping dexterity (e.g. spirit of monkey), stamina (e.g. spirit of ox) and agility (e.g. spirit of cat) on anyone meleing.  You might also be keeping fleeting fury on anyone using a weapon that procs.  You're also buffing yourself at the same time so you can tell when to rebuff others.  You're keeping regeneration on yourself and anyone who even might get hit, unless someone else is doing that already.  You're healing and rooting when necessary, especially if nobody's snaring.  You're slowing and/or debuffing if the fights are long enough and nuking if you have spare mana.  If everybody's twinked and/or has temperance, then you're probably mostly nuking and canni-dancing.<br />
<br />
If you're not the healer, or you're with more than one, you can work out with them when they should heal you after you cannibalize your health down far enough to make full use of whatever heal spell they're using.  If you're in a group that's amenable, you're jumping into the mele now and then to get your defense, offense, and weapons skills up.  You want really fast weapons, regardless of their damage, for that purpose.<br />
<br />
The only times you ever get to rest are if the group's pulling slower than necessary, you have excess healers, or your health and mana are both dangerously low.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, there are lots of methods.  Probably the simplest is to either root the MoB in place, or pull with slow (drowsy) or debuff (malaise) then root and move out of mele range.  Then stack on your damage over time (DoT) spells and canni-dance until root breaks or a DoT wears off and continue until you're sure of success, then practice meleing.  Once you get a pet it gets more fun.  If you want to remove the challenge, level faster, or plow through yellows and lower reds, get temperance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your grping strategy will change every time you get a new grp.  At lower lvls you dont get very many grp spells.  I would suggest when you find a new grp, let them know that you are going to be buffing only the main tank.  If your grp is too new to understand the concepts of main tank, try to explain it to them....try :)<br />
<br />
After you start getting your grp spells it will get a lot easier to buff a grp, but still gonna get mana intensive.  Sorry but thems are the breaks, it dont get too much easier.<br />
<br />
For solo, i would suggest the root rot method only after you have maxed your defense to the highest lvl.  You will really be doing yourself a favor if you make sure your def. is maxed.  Once mobs start summoning, you are gonna need the ac to withstand a few seconds of attacks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Group environment:<br />
Haste buff dps classes<br />
Hp buff only the MT<br />
Sit on your kilted butt all the time and heal as necessary<br />
Once you hit level 24, regen on self all the time. Make a Cannidance hotkey and use it all the time<br />
<br />
Solo Environment: <br />
Until you hit 24, don't bother. (back in the day, I got smacked around by light blues until I dinged 24, then I went straight out and soloed a yellow)<br />
<br />
Level 24 - 33:- Root 'n Rot (max your hp / mana pools)<br />
Pull with Maolsi (from max range) (if you run away while spell gems refresh, you should be able to get next spell off before mob gets to you)<br />
Root mob<br />
Cast disease DoT<br />
Cast poison DoT<br />
Reapply root as necessary (whenever you re-root the mob, move to maximum spell casting range)<br />
Reapply DoTs as necessary<br />
Cannidance wherever possible<br />
Use &quot;flash of light&quot; if you need to buy some time<br />
Run around a lot if you need to regen some hp / canni some mana - SoW is faster than mobs<br />
<br />
Level 34 onwards - Tank 'n Pet (wear your best AC gear and buff your dex). Buff self with hp, str, dex, haste, sta, SoW, regen<br />
Make pet, give pet 2 rusty weapons, buff pet with hp and haste<br />
Pull with malosi<br />
Send pet (pet will take aggro)<br />
Slow mob (you will get aggro)<br />
Move into melee range and tank mob while pet bites its ankles<br />
Back away and let pet get aggro if you need to heal yourself<br />
Move back in to melee if pet hp get low<br />
Tank n pet is great for getting your defence skills and weapon skill up<br />
You can also cast a DoT if you want to kill mobs faster, but Pet n Tank, IMO works best without - you save the mana for heals and reduce downtime, and you are doing to max weapon / offense / defence skills anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
On that note, I'd assume &quot;plz&quot; means &quot;please&quot;?<br />
<br />
Great advice here in this thread. Memorize what Faern and Weyalan wrote. <br />
