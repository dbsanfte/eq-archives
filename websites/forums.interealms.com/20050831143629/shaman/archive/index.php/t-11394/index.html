<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was sitting down to make some haste potions for a friend. He gives me the ingredients, I get everything situated, summon my folded bags and put the first ingredients and hit combine. &quot;These items will not combine in this container&quot;<br />
<br />
I check my recipe book to make sure it wasn't me. Recipe checks out so, luckily being right next to bank, I go and pull out my old bags. Bingo! Ingredients combine. Tested making 10 dose potions with other folded bag and it wouldn't work either. Pulled out old bag and voila 10 dose potion. I /bug'd it so hopefully will get fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry to hear that.  Hopefully your right and it’ll be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i sat down to make a batch of folded bags for friends <br />
<br />
after the 2nd combine, i realize its a lore item <br />
<br />
<br />
i dont know of very many lore tradeskilled items .. sucky sucky</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah found the same bug :( and reported it too.<br />
<br />
funny thing is the you can combine the new dyes in the folded bag.. but no alchimy component so far. weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The colapsables supposedly work on all the LoY alchemy recipies but not on anythingolder than that.<br />
<br />
THat is supposed to be fixed in the next patch (whether that means the next emergency patch or the next scheduled patch is something I don't know)..<br />
<br />
I say this based on a news item on the front page of eqtraders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This was fixed last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was not fixed for me as of tonight. Tried making a swamp potion using the folding bags.</div></div><hr />

Was not fixed for me as of tonight. Tried making a swamp potion using the folding bags.  <br />
Will be fixed next patch , atleast eqtraders.com says so heh<br />
<br />
I would assume they mean the next big patch , not a emergency daytime patch either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm, sure am glad I got rid of my non-folding bags now. :(  /sigh  Was going to try to bring my skill to level max today too.<br />
<br />
On a side note anyone tryed combining any drops in gunthak/nadox in the alchemy bags?  Druids got new spell by using a brew barrel I guess.</div></div><hr />
