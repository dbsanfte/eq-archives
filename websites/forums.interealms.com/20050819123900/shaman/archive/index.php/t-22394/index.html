<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, I'm stupid. I can't figure it out on my own. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Post 100 times on random threads without getting too many low ratings (&quot;one stars&quot;).  Once you have 100+ posts and a sufficiently high average rating, you can edit your posts there.<br />
<br />
I found that adding comments here and there on random threads in the newbie and tradeskills area was an excellent way to pad post counts there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You need to have over a 3.0 rating average, and 100 posts, plus 2000 page views.  Then you hit Master rating and can edit your posts for about 15 minutes after the initial posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah, thank you very kindly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some good info was collected here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=80295) regarding the rankings on that board, and what it takes to edit and eventually get your own avatar pic.<br />
<br />
And you guys think the Crucible's rep system leaves much to be desired...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">rofl, you have to have a high enough rating to edit your posts ?<br />
<br />
How ****ing lame is that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The worst thing is trying to get a name that actually fits fro your class.  Took me almost a week of working at it to get swapped from &quot;Master&quot; to &quot;Elder.&quot;   The shamanistic titles are all on the lurker path, which means going through all the old posts and just opening up page after page of posts so that you get them counted as viewed, then once you get enough psots viewed, you have to set up a couple dozen pages on a 1 minute refresh timer overnight for a while so that your raw page views gets up to being high enough.   But I am quite happy to have elder as my title there now, even though by color it looks almost like I am a newbie :(<br />
<br />
  Hopefully someday I can get a custom Avatar, but with how much I have been gettin upset by random developments and how little time I have to play of late, not too likely I will reach that post level anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/sigh - 55 more posts to hit Master and get the magic EDIT button...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">28 left for me.  Hopefully, I won't slip away from &quot;Seer&quot; then.</div></div><hr />
