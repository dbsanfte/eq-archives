<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xishi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, and thanks for taking time to read my post.  Long story short, I'm returning to EQ after about a 10 month self imposed break.<br />
<br />
I'm back, reincarnated as an iksar shaman and I'm having the time of my life.  I don't want fast experience, I don't need fabulous gear, I don't want to be rich... just enough plat to sustain myself in spells.  I'd like to take my time this go around and see all the pre-Velious zones that I missed during my previous EQ life and quest.  I'm semi-twinked (stripped my retired cleric/ranger) and do 2box with a shadowknight pet and have no desire to powerlevel .... much to the chagrin of old friends who want me to group with them.  2boxing is not a requirement for me (I'm no power gamer), I made the SK because I couldn't find anyone to group with in the zones I wanted to explore.  For instance, I went to LOIO to forage mudcrabs (cursed wafer to start the skull quest!) and was amazed when I did a /who to find only 4 people in the zone.  2 of them were my lizard girls and the other 2 were 60+ levels heading to another zone.  Man, a big change for a year ago.  I've got PoP, so travel as an evil race is much more convenient than in the past.  So far at level 19 I've been to FoB, Kurns, LOIO and WW... and I'll be revisiting those zones as part of the skull quest.<br />
<br />
Could some of you &quot;old schoolers&quot; take a moment to reflect and mention a pre-Velious zone that you explored and why you loved/hated it?  If you can recall, what level did you go there?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.   ;) <br />
<br />
Oh, as an aside..... part of my choice in being a shaman was grouping with shaman as a cleric.  I always thought, damn... how versatile.  I was fortunate to be guilded at that time with a particularly stellar shaman who was always patient with me when I had questions about the shaman class.  I don't know if he still plays, but Barshin .. if you're out there..... *bow*.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always loved Unrest . .its a decent zone from 20-30ish.  <br />
<br />
Lower Guk will always hold a special place in most peoples memories that have played since the beginning.  <br />
<br />
Dalnir is a mid 30's zone - decent zone, great layout, good feel to the zone.  <br />
<br />
City of Mist is a mid 40's zone, pretty good exp, intereseting zone nonetheless, and requirement for your epic.<br />
<br />
The Hole is upper 40's mid 50's - can't go too deep at those levels, but can get a feel for the entrance mobs<br />
<br />
Highhold / Highpass - if you can get over the whining people complaining about camp stealings and bard / noble camps - the decent is half ok . .just crowded.<br />
<br />
Permafrost - I love this zone . .hardly anyone goes there . . but its really fun, some decent items / quest items etc . . its about mid 20's - 40's in there.<br />
<br />
Soldungeon A - Lots o goblins and FS, great ZEM and all around good times . .about 20-30ish<br />
<br />
Soldungeon B - 35-55ish .. lots of kobalds, bats, bugs and Fire Giants :)<br />
Runnyeye was changed . .its a bit different now, but still fun.  I'd say about Mid 20's to high 30's now<br />
<br />
Najena - heh old school!!  20ish - 30ish . . I love this zone . .its just great all around  :D  Thank gawd they removed the jboot camp from there though lmao!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All the hours and days trying to lvl to get a group in LGuk(35-40)...then when you get there the hours spent waiting to get a group at entrance and avoiding trains...then the tedious time of getting to the group with out training the zone...oh the good ol days before Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great suggestions ny Sshasta, I just wanted to add my 2c to the recommendations :)  I'm going to assume in most cases, you'd be either solo, or 2-boxing, as it's pretty rare to find anyone in these zones nowadays.<br />
<br />
I always loved Unrest . .its a decent zone from 20-30ish.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Yup - fantastic zone - the only problem I had (pre-PoP) was trying to sell all my loot, as not many people around there like Iksar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lower Guk will always hold a special place in most peoples memories that have played since the beginning.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Can't beat LGuk.  Once you learn your way around it, it's a fantastic zone.  As Iksar, you may want to consider killing in UGuk as well, unless you have some issues with killing frogs, or want to *shudder* raise faction with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dalnir is a mid 30's zone - decent zone, great layout, good feel to the zone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I love Dalnir. Really, I do. I think it's a fantastic way too underutilised zone. However, unless you've got resists of around, oh, 100+ in Fire/Magic/Poison/Disease, any pre 40 character is going to get eaten alive by the casters.  They nuke from 100 to 300/400 (from memory) and as the healer for your SK, you'll be hard pressed to kill much.  Plus, there are a lot of casters...  On the other hand, the melee mobs were fairly easy to slow (from memory again.. hehe) and the xp was very nice!<br />
<br />
<br />
City of Mist is a mid 40's zone, pretty good exp, intereseting zone nonetheless, and requirement for your epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 Thumbs up to this one - can start killing here from high 30's, and it will take you to lvl 50 without being more than a 30 second run from zone out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hole is upper 40's mid 50's - can't go too deep at those levels, but can get a feel for the entrance mobs<br />
<br />
<br />
Watch the slow resists on the Crusaders - even at lvl 62, I can sometimes hit the annoyingly resistant one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Permafrost - I love this zone . .hardly anyone goes there . . but its really fun, some decent items / quest items etc . . its about mid 20's - 40's in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Great fun zone, and unlike Dalnirs, the casters aren't quite as populous, or nasty<br />
<br />
<br />
Soldungeon A - Lots o goblins and FS, great ZEM and all around good times . .about 20-30ish<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're 2 boxing, the population can get annoying.  When you're getting xp off them, you can also inadvertently aggro 5 or more at once, so caution when pulling is advised.  Once you get a rythm going, there's some sweet xp to be had, and some drops thataren't half bad for the appropriate level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soldungeon B - 35-55ish .. lots of kobalds, bats, bugs and Fire Giants :)<br />
Runnyeye was changed . .its a bit different now, but still fun.  I'd say about Mid 20's to high 30's now<br />
 <br />
<br />
You might want to think twice about killing in runneye.  It's the only place in the old world zones that an Iksar can bank without having to do faction work.  The upper level will be agro to you, but if you invis past them, the lower lvls are indifferent or amiable (can't remember which) and there are merchants and a banker you can use. <br />
<br />
I would suggest using runnyeye as a staging area, and killing halfling guards.  Duo'd with the SK, you could start killing them at mid 20's, collect their weapons and stuff and sell them in runnyeye.  You can make 3-5pp per guard if you do this. Plus, you'll be making a start on raising your faction with the DE's (dreadguard outer and inner I think, or is it just outer.. hmm) and if you're not in a huge levelling hurry, it's fun to be one of the very few iksar that can walk around inside Neriak.  Of course, there's a lot more factioning involved than just killing the halflings, there's dwarves, gnomes, elves, humans... Certain mobs (not all) will raise your faction with the various factions inside Neriak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Najena - heh old school!!  20ish - 30ish . . I love this zone . .its just great all around  :D  Thank gawd they removed the jboot camp from there though lmao!<br />
<br />
Great zone, and if you're lucky, you'll get some tradeskill items you can sell for cash :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helped out some anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah behind the times.  Use PoK as a staging area to kill halfling guards.  There's a book conveniently INSIDE the wall.  Good thing they have that wall there to keep the rifraff out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dalnir is a great zone for young broodlings, and not too far out from cabilis.  I started there at 30 with some friends, and spent most of my time until 35 or so there, often duoing with a Shadowknight, or in a group with him and a monk or 2 from the guild (all iksar guild).  A tough zone, but definitely a fun place to learn.<br />
<br />
Kaesora would be good too, but be careful, there are a lot of 1 way passages and getting corpses out can be a trick sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I certainly got the most mileage out of the old Cazic Thule and Sol B.  <br />
<br />
I have a particular soft spot though for Mistmooe.  Hordes of tough casting mobs with bad pathing can't be beat!  <br />
<br />
Seriously, some days I died 7 times (this was before anybody ever got a rez in their 30s).  It was remarkably frustrating, yet also fun - especially when a good group got together and plowed through to the garden in the castle.  That was our path typically.  <br />
<br />
We felt pretty badass for working our way through to there.  <br />
<br />
It's a cool zone, and it's a shame it's so neglected now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Troll shaman here, I tended to go off the beaten path and soloed most of the way:<br />
<br />
5-20 I spent in Uguk killing crocs and spiders - sweet ZEM<br />
20-28 I spent in Najena killing tentacle terrors/ogres - sweet ZEM, slow respawn time<br />
28-31 I exclusively hunted the Named Kobolds in the Warrens - ended up amiable to Paineel and got my necklace quest items<br />
31-37 I hunted in Uguk along the zoneline to Lguk live side<br />
37-39 I hunted the deadside zoneline in Lguk<br />
39-46 was in Crystal Caverns (orcs, terrors, geos)<br />
46-51 was in City of Mist<br />
51-52 was gnomes in Echo Caverns<br />
52-53 was Gnoll pit in Jaggedpine Forest<br />
53-54+AA currently at Giant fort in Burning Woods - sweet loot!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xishi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you very much for all the suggestions.  Now I've got a tourguide of sorts to keep me adventuring for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain that I'll be soloing in zones fit for lvl 20 (I don't think I'll find a group in the zones I want to visit) because I'm giving the second computer to Kidlet_01 who has come home after graduating highschool.  Of course, this just means that I'll have to build a faster machine to compensate myself.  *koff* ....  God I wish she'd EQ &amp; duo with me, if I hadn't seen her born I'd swear she couldn't be my daughter because she's lacking ANY desire to play.. but that is another rant all together.<br />
<br />
Again, many thanks and now it's time to work on my soloing skills.</div></div><hr />
