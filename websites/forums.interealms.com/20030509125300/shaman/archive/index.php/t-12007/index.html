<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know with the advent of PoP and new equipment and spells that Sont isnt as hard as he used to be, but I'm still excited that my guild took him down this weekend. He's our first first-brood dragon kill and attempt. We had 22 people, 20 theoretically (2 were 2 boxed, not sure how much the 2nd char was contributing) and we took him down. Took us 3 tries. First try was a total learning experience (got him to around 58%), Second try we had him but walled him at like 15% health :(. However, third try (always a charm) was flawless. Noone died, healers had plenty of mana, disc's hadnt even recycled on the melee yet from the previous attempt. I'm just wanting to share my excitement with my friends here on the crucible. I can't wait to try some of the others!<br />
<br />
On a side note, i never got him slowed. after about 4-5 attempts, i just started healing.<br />
<br />
*cheer*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">malo/tash/oos at the bare min to slow him. If malosin/a lands then its cake. Expect to have to reslow/debuff him at LEAST 3 times, and with 22 people probably more like 4-5 times. <br />
<br />
Congrats!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrrm reslow him that many times? That seems a bit much, we killed him in like 4-5 mins at most. Slow lasts ~6 mins, and since the cure change it cant be dispelled, it has to be cured, right? When i tried to slow, i had malo + malosini + tash + oos, and still couldnt get it to stick :/. I was in melee range, maybe i missed him dispelling malo or something in all the spam. Thanks for the tip, ill keep it in mind when we kill him again (soon hopefully).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sont is kinda strange in that he casts a dispell/cure on himself, every 45 seconds I believe. Sec while I look it up in lucy...<br />
<br />
ahhh crap I cant remember what its called...<br />
<br />
but its a cure and a dispell. Removes a ton of counters. Malo/tash/cripple/turgurs are frequently all removed.<br />
<br />
Honestly slowing him isnt really going to help that much. If you have the healing power to take him down you are gtg. The only reason I got into the habit of doing it was dumbasses would take agro from the MT from time to time, and if he was slowed it seemed to be easier to get him back to the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Annul Self - http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2830&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Doesn't remove tash because that is poison-based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh good call, didn't know it didn't take poison counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">His dispell is timed (like 45 secondes) or it's also a proc ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He casts it ASAP when he can, so its actually every 36 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't tell if he really does cast Annul Self.  A shaman in my guild swears he doesn't because he never gets the message slow is off.  I've been really unlucky even trying to land slow, I'm usually dead before it lands.<br />
<br />
But congrats!  Sontalak is a tough guy to kill.  We usually take 6 groups at him so I'm impressed with your low numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hint:  Keep Insidious Decay above Turgur's in the mob's buff list.  Unless they changed the way cures work again, doesn't matter how many counters it removes, only one line of cure on lucy's = only one spell can be cured per shot.<br />
