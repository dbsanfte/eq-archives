<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been hunting larvae for a few days now and it seems to work pretty good. My monk and my shammy gear is certainly not great monk has about 3.2khp's and I have about 2.7khp's with my buffs. It is pretty simple. I cast torpor on my monk who is right in front of the larvae, I then immedietly cast malo on the larvae, while casting my monk attacks it I slow the bug which then comes running to me and my monk runs over and hacks it away. I'll throw a dot on in everynow and again but of course gotta watch agro. There are larvae spread near the entrance of pov enough to keep me busy. No deaths, nothing real close. Anytime I screw up somehow I just run to gy.<br />
This seems to be the best way for me I would try to just slow, but if slow resist(about 40% of the time). It sucked to try to recast, since they are fairly fast and can't be rooted. Loot as with most pop mobs suck you can get a random vendoor piece that sells for 70-100pp, but don't expect many of those. Kei wouldn't hurt but I almost never get it. HP buffs would be very nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The worms are an alternative that I will sometimes do with my SK.  They're actually pretty good xp for sub 65, since they're lvl 58-59, with the named festering worm being higher.  The named drops a decent resist earring from time to time, and surprisingly, I've gotten more ethereal parchments off the worms than the other mobs in PoV.<br />
<br />
They hit pretty hard and fast without a slow, however.  If you're not slowing them, your monk is taking a HELL of a lot more damage then he needs to.  However, you're also going to get aggro when you slow it, and monks don't have taunt, so until your monk gets it back through damage, you're the one that's going to be taking the hits, which can hurt.<br />
<br />
These worms were the very reason I started an SK after PoP came out.  I tried 2-boxing them with my then 60 warrior.  After I slowed, the worm came after me, and I had to take the damage until the warrior could taunt it off (he has a willsapper and the red epic).  But, it wasn't fun, and there were a couple deaths that occurred before I could get to the gy.<br />
<br />
Slow will sometimes be resisted.  However, it rarely will be resisted on the second cast.  If you cast malo first, it will always land.  Problem again will be the mob is now on you, and the monk will have to beat it off you.  <br />
<br />
Some people like monks for 2-boxing.  However, this is the problem with hard hitting mobs and slow.  No class generates snap aggro like an SK.  Their snare/dot is a bigger aggro producer than our slow, and usually even bigger than a malo/slow combo.  <br />
<br />
I'm not telling you to re-roll an sk.  However, this is going to be the problem the entire time you try to two-box in PoP.  You're going to be the one taking damage after slow.  You have 2 choices.  Take the damage after the slow and survive until the monk gets aggro back, or not slow, and let your monk fight an unslowed mob that can double for 435, and hits fairly fast.  It's going to be a mana drain this way.<br />
<br />
You might be able to kite the mob around while the monk beats on it from behind until the mob finally turns on the monk.  However, this is not a fun 2-boxing technique.  You want to sit on the horse/lizard and regen mana while the melee tanks.<br />
<br />
Pre-pop, monks were an excellent choice for two-boxing, because the majority of mobs only hit in the 200 range, and that was easily survivable with reasonble shaman hp/ac equipment.  PoP changed all that.  If you think the worms are bad.  The golems and razorfiends are worse, and double over 500.  You have to slow those, or else you or the monk is going to die.  These can be rooted, however.<br />
<br />
It won't take that much time to level a taunting class to 65 (i did it in 10 days playtime, and that's not any big feat).  If you want to do a hardcore PL, you could get a plate class tank to 65 in 5-10 days easily.  If you want to stay in teir 2 or higher PoP, I think this has to be an option for you.  Another area that is almost as good are the caves in PoJ.  Mobs hit for 300 there, and won't beat you up so bad.  Just keep your bearings when pulling so you don't run down the wrong tunnel.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are some monk/shaman two-boxers out there that would disagree.  This is only my observation (I also have a 55 monk), and suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Can you give us an idea of the XP per hour that you are getting with this method?  And the XP vs AA split you are using while getting this?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is to compare against other XP spots and the methods employed there.  I have a monk I can duo with and have found that without the defensive AAs it is actually more mana consuming to have him DPS the PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
Given KEI and a few bazaar items (Rallican's Bracelet for BA4 and Ceramic Hammer for AE4) I can usually get more XP as a team by doing root rotting.  The monk is still good to assist with the pulls; but once the mob is being rotted the monk can just stay feigned.  Healing him costs me more mana than DoTing does.<br />
<br />
I'll post some non-pop examples of hunting using a Monk / Shaman combo and the xp for each to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could also try PoN Gargoyles.  They are on the far side of the river, so you'll need to levitate over and carefully (emphasis on carefully) make your way over to them.  Once you reach them, there's a large grassy safe area between the gargoyle &quot;fort&quot; wall and the zone wall where you can sit and med all day long with no possibility of roamers or agro.  Seriously, you could sit there for hours AFK safely.  Once you're there with both toons, it's pretty straight forward.  Gargoyles from the top of the wall are single pulls (at least they are for me).  Malo, Slow, and sik the dog on them.  The gargoyles hit for around 387 max, so it's a little easier than PoV.  I 2-box with a shaman/SK, so I can't speak to the tanking ability of a monk on these - but they'd have to be easier than worms or golems.  I usually net about 3% AA per kill on these when 2-boxing (for both characters), which I don't think is bad at all.  The BEST thing about this spot?  Not a soul ever comes here.  It's never camped.  Drops are sparse, but you'll occasionally get a Raw Diamond or Blue Diamond or Flakes of Gold (sellable for ~11pp I think?).  It's a good quiet spot to grind out some AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With torpor it's not a big deal taking the damage from the larvae. I do have to malo first even if I get a resist 2 in 10 it's tough to reslow  you have to channel a slow through his hits which is never fun and very scary.<br />
Yea, I know about the whole SK thing, I wish I had started a sk instead, the weight is a pain and they really do have almost no agro managment, like I mentioned earlier though if I can get my monk to hit fear it snaps over agro pretty good and I can lay a few dots on without worrying, but fear is tough to skill up. He maybe has a skill of 50. Fear doesn't affect mobs over 55 btw so he just gets the high agro and doesn't have to worry about them running. I do like my monk though he is fun to play, instant fd, mend, and stone stance are all very handy.<br />
I will try those gargoyles, sounds like fun. <br />
How much exp per hour? I'm guessing maaybe 50% aa, guessing it is probably a bit high. I'll kill them again for a few hours and tell you how much exp I get.<br />
<br />
oh, btw these guys can't be rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I spent some more time there I am guessing maybe like 40% aa an hour(no kei) That is goin full force. That is duoing, I wouldn't try these guys solo, since you can't root these bad boys. It might go by faster if you get another pet class since you don't have to worry about healing. <br />
On a side note, as odd as it sounds I get better exp in velks, almost everything is light blue to me, but the kills are pretty fast and the loot is great. I only do it if I can take named or I have someone else pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks bigbadbowlindude,<br />
<br />
     40% per hour is very good xp for a duo.  I'm assuming that each toon saw that 40%.  My forays into Luclin have shown a net of 25-30% an hour per toon for my monk/shaman duo team.  Tier 1 has been about the same without the benefits of loot.  I'll definitely check out PoV and HoH to see if the xp jump is as good for me.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.  Sounds about right with Velks.  Those mobs were easy at 55 so at 65 they should go like popcorn.  I need to head back for some components for my monk's gate potions and might stick around for an hour to log what the xp is like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It just so happens that I have just started in the world of 2-boxing and am currently using my 62 Shammy to level my now 58 SK.  I've been Plevelin the SK in Greigs (ungrouped) and the exp has been pretty good.  <br />
<br />
However, all the exp is going to my SK and I am looking for a place to start exping them grouped together.  These PoV larvae seem like they might be a good place to try and I was wondering if somebody could post some details about where to set up camp and get singles/avoid roamers (if possible).  I am 2-boxing on a single PC so I have to switch back and forth between windows regularly.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.  BTW my SK weilds a 2hander for the added DPS (Blackened Greatsword) and has about 1430ish AC with my shammy buffs only (including Avatar). Shammy has torpor but no malo or epic. I might go buy malo soon though :)<br />
<br />
Thanks Again,<br />

Actually there are two different kinds, the bigger 'fat' ones are immune to runspeed changes, the smaller ones are not.  Unfortunately at this time the terrain around the GY seems to cause them to poof a lot when on low health which is frustrating when you've spent a few minutes rotting them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, I didn't know that I'm going to have to check it out. I've stopped trying to root them, if so it coudl be handy and keep them on my monk.<br />
I've been trying to frogs too, since the monk has lull now easy to split. :)<br />
Has anyone tried PoS? Seems like a decent possibility I heard they summon but that is no big deal, just manage your agro like a good shammy knows how to. :)</div></div><hr />

The static Frogs at zone in in PoS don't summon however you'll need to FD split them as the NPCs close by are on the same faction and will assist.  They also hit hard (near 600) and fast and never run so tanking them isn't much fun.  The roaming Frogs in the Bees/Forest area are similar but have a nasty poison proc and run when on low health so fight them well away from possible adds.<br />
<br />
Leave the 'interior' Frogs alone as they summon and seem to be a random mix of casters and melee.</div></div><hr />
