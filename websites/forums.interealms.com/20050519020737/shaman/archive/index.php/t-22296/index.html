<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok -- my main char is a level 65/80 Iksar Shaman and even when I was active over 6 months ago(before GoD came out) I was seeing how little stackability we had in raids etc...  <br />
<br />
Do you think it would be better for me to work on my shaman or powerlevel a new character(yes I can put 2 computers side by side that can play everquest)?<br />
<br />
Note my shaman is early elemental(access to all but fire) -- note I did try to join the top guild on my server and it didnt work out 6 months ago -- was actually the main reason I left(only thing I got out of that stint was a bad taste in my mouth, and a rathe stone)...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I have heard that shaman actually have a hard time getting into guilds these days due to the class balancing problems...  <br />
<br />
At any rate I want to be useful...  and am fearful that shaman will only become less useful in the next expansion than they already are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What server are ya on?  Not that it really matters.  I play a 65 Shammy with 680ish aa, my guild has 8 active shaman and it works really well on raids!  One shammy Malos, one to Slow, one to malosinia, then rest to patch heal and nuke and buff.  I think shaman can be very stackable on raids.  We aren't a class that you usually see 2 of in a group, so until we join a guild that raids you don't tend to see the benifits of more than one shaman.  My advice to you is to app to another guild that raids at a decent level and carry on with your shaman, then if you can't get a group....just PL an alt on your other computer while still looking for a group on your shaman.  Don't give up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you enjoy playing a shaman, I can't think of a single reason not to do so now.  There are so many people leaving EQ nowadays that competent shaman (on Bristlebane, at least) are always in demand.<br />
<br />
Edit: Typos, and to reinforce that COMPETENT shaman are in demand.  There are a lot of one-note wonders who do jack on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually where I felt best was when I was doing LDON hards -- in a single competant group against monsters of that caliber playing a shaman works...<br />
<br />
In raids where I didnt have the main slower or main debuffer role I usually ended up nuking the easy parts and patch healing at the end(target main tank -- cast heal over and over interrupting if the tank is over 40%)... Yes I did land a magic based slow on MM when raiding him(trivialized the encounter)...  <br />
<br />
As for server I am very likely to change server if I return -- mainly because I am on the east coast and tend to prefer playing in the daytime rather than the nighttime which is not served by being in my timezone on a mainline server...<br />
<br />
Seriously considering moving to venril (the england server) to be able to play at more reasonable hours.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As to why I am thinking about coming back at this time...<br />
<br />
1) There just arent any other worthy games to play -- tried out CoH recently -- got badly nerfed twice on powers they said were working as intended the day before they nerfed them<br />
<br />
2) My new computer will be arriving soon that I will be using to play EQ 2 when that comes out and I want to try it out -- I was never able to use any lulcin models etc on my current computer. (3500+ 6800 gt 1gig)<br />
[one I am typing on now 1.3 amd athlon geforce 3 256Mb]<br />
<br />
3) OOW seems like a good point to come back -- I seem to retire and come back a lot that way -- Played a druid to 50th in OLD EQ had everything did everything bored sold 7 monthsish pre kunark-- Created the iksar at Kunark quit sometime into vellious at 54th.  Returned a little before LDON -- got to 65/80AA Elemental access quit when GoD was just starting beta ... which leads us to now. [and yes I have played AC to max, Daoc, CoH, something else I cant remember right now]</div></div><hr />

The last time I looked, Shaman were closed on the Raiding Guild boards.  But maybe some opened up recently.  I do agree that the amount of competent Shaman has reduced drastically...probably on all servers.  Although for you competent Shaman on BB waiting for a spot, OoW is just around the corner =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The thing you have to remember is that class balance is something that commonly runs in cycles. Classes go from high to low all the time, with very few exceptions. Thats why it annoys me so much when people say things like &quot;Don't start a shaman, when you get to the end game you won't like it as much&quot;. Thats quite possibly true, but that ONLY applies if they somehow insta-transform to the end-game that week. Who know what coming months have in store for any class. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt make any decision on the class until after OoW ships, and we see what SOE has in store for our &quot;purpose&quot; in life. I know there are some OoW spells out now, and they seem moderate at best, but I do not believe they are final, and I truly feel that SOME of the things we have been asking for will be addressed. <br />
<br />
As it is RIGHT NOW, Shaman are still fairly powerful. We are still desired in groups. We have value at some of the high end. Yes, in some cases, the preference people used to show shaman has changed. This is the evolution of EQ. WHo remembers when Rangers sucked? Who remembers when Rogues were horrible? Or Knights? I agree that classes SHOULDNT go through these &quot;semi-worthless&quot; stages, but then I have to rememember that balance is a difficult thing, and that adjustments tend to affect all the surrounding classes in a parallal manner. <br />
<br />
IMHO, our future as a class is bright, but it will never be as stellar as it was in our hey-day during Kunark and Velious. Thats ok, I am all good with being &quot;one of the best classes&quot; instead of &quot;The Best&quot;. All I really want is for groups to say &quot;Theres a Shaman available, hows that&quot; and the answer is &quot;Thats cool&quot; instead of &quot;Look for a BL&quot;. All I am really looking for is something more to do on raids than my puny heal or my puny nukes. <br />
<br />
I may be overly optomistic though, but I guess I feel I have to be, because pessimism is just a miserable way to spend your days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You will never be as attached to a powerlevelled character as you are to one you levelled over time.  So basically I see your situation as either spend the next 2 years working a new main up, or PL one up and then get tired of it a few months later.<br />
<br />
Or just continue playing your shaman main and make the best of things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Screw the guild, do what you enjoy.  If all he cared about was the &quot;guild&quot; then he should roll a cleric (can never have enough of those).  Play the class that you enjoy most.  However, I'd bet that you will enjoy a high end Shaman over the next few months a lot more than sitting in some noob zone (God help you in Paludal) PL'ing a new toon.  It may not take very long to get a new character to 65, however, it is still a boring, mindless grind.  Been there, done that, don't wish it on anyone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">YES! Re Roll!<br />
<br />
Wizard, Cleric, Warrior, Monk, Rogue<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the good classes! Wizard barely need much gear to start being good, Cleric needs some gear but that will come really quickly even as a trial if you seem competent, Warrior is really a great class these days but pretty much needs great equip to be a fun class, and Monk/Rogue both have a bunch of utility and are &quot;fun&quot; classes in that they can explore and have a get-out-of-jail-free card.<br />
<br />
I box a wizard on raids with my shaman, because I as soon as I joined the guild 4 shamans retired, and since then we have gotten 1 new one. So me/other guy are it, if we had too many shamans and I was just coming in, I would switch in a heartbeat. But being needed is really nice too :)<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief its really easy to box a shaman/wiz on raids and in groups. Especially when alt-tab between EQW's is activated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Boxing any non-melee isnt to difficult.  A shaman w/ druid, mage, wizard or even necro is very doable.  <br />
<br />
But, if I was going to re-roll I would do a Beastlord.  A friend returned to the game after over a year.  H eused to play a rogue and finds that class pretty boring.  Beastlords are fun though (and LoY is nice XP now from what I am told).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Trust your own advice and play what you want, how you want.<br />
<br />
From your post detailing your EQ history, a steady one-for-all class (or the game itself over the long run) does not seem to be what you are after. Or, perhaps, it is just that you haven't found the right character that gives you consistant, long term challenge and enjoyment. Then again, maybe the game itself and how it is played will never hold your long term interest. <br />
<br />
Powerlevel or not. Again - your choice. If it makes you all warm and fuzzy to zip into 65 and start 'playing' there, then more power to you. If spending the next few months/years working a character up slowly and 'doing more' at each level is fun for you, then again, more power to you.<br />
<br />
If your game reality is &quot;I really like my shaman over all other characters I have or could ever play but everyone says they are the **suck** now and I want to be liked by everyone,&quot; well, I am not sure what to tell you. It is a game. For fun. Enjoy the character YOU want to play. Play that character well. All else falls into place as you meet folks, group with them and they learn you are not one of the 'many' shaman out there. You are one of &quot;THE SHAMAN.&quot;<br />
<br />
While every class is limited to their abilities by game design, the better players compensate for their limitations and play a class better than it was designed to be played. In short (and this is very much a generalization) talented players don't see brick walls stopping them - just obstacles to overcome. If that is how you see your shaman (or cleric or ranger or ... ) then go have fun. Others will notice and it will be YOU they want, not just another (insert class here.)<br />
