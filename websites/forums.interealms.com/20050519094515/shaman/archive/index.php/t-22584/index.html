There were others, but I don't remember where they came from so I can't look them up now.  Most of these would be upgrades from what I have now, too.</div></div><hr />

Won one of these of my first Vox raid, and then had to give me account to a &quot;friend&quot; for a few months while I concentrated on school. ****er took it off my shaman before he gave me back the account, said his uncle wanted it for more frequent skill-ups while tradeskilling. What a winner, eh?<br />

And my missing piece, either Epic or Fungi.</div></div><hr />

The other, shortly after I got over my desire for the Rune Etched BP, was the ToV BP.  I lost on a few and went on a bunch of ToV raids trying to get one.</div></div><hr />

A guild shaman said I was ineligible for random (weee, back in the good old random days!) because I was late to the raid. I backed down, she looted it and quit the guild 2 weeks later. I'm still in the same guild, 4 years later. <br />

No, I'm not still bitter. Really.</div></div><hr />

Then my dream weapon was the barbarian spiritist hammer. One dropped the first time I was on a Cazic Thule kill, but I lost the roll to the only other shaman there - Yukawakasenmu (yes, I never forgot her name after all these years). Never got that. Saw one for sale in the bazaar a short time before I retired for 250 plats. /sigh<br />
<br />
I had full Rune Etched set and the Spitestone shield, but it took many months to get it. Was one of the first to complete the epic, and still had that when I retired. <br />
<br />
Never got the Skyshrine bp or legs, but I had all the other pieces, and I had the Incorporeal Chain of the Spectre eventually so didnt need to go back for those. Never had a fungi or a bracer, and didnt matter much to me.<br />
<br />
Wanted the feign death ring too, but just never did Sky enough.</div></div><hr />

Heh, my Epic is basically my only piece of &quot;old school&quot; gear I missed out on. I am up to 21 Fear raids now, have seen each mini fall probably 2 times each....soooo thats nearly 42 chances at my tear...the last one I saw drop went to a botted shaman cause the guy who played him raided more than I did at the time. /guildremoved on the spot and gated.

Nothing ever looked as good as the old barbarian model in a full set of jaundiced.  I eventually got Kael legs which were a yellow chain so it wasn't too bad.<br />
<br />
With new models my chain looks like a potato sack that you can see my nipples through.  You'd think northmen would dress warmer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">When the old DE mask was available my buddy and I were too lazy concerned with getting cash to gear his new chanter up (he swapped from a warrior).  So we finally decided on like Tuesday to spend the whole weekend camping the mask if we have to.... This is when there was a Wednesday morning patch EVERY week.  Well guess what they implimented that wednesday.  :*(  Never did get the DE mask but I did slave away at getting the Wood Elf mask from Guk.  And wouldnt you know it but while I was clearing all of the Undead from Guk I let about 15 New DE masks rot.  But I still have one of the new ones in the bank.... just for old times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Being somewhat of a sentimentalist, I have bags and bags of old gear in the bank (well, all except my Hate stuff, XP is XP after all, ya know, LOL).<br />
<br />
The big thing I missed was the DE mask. Back then, my main was a  50 Paladin, and my troll was a twink. I remember parking him at the bottom of the ladder the day before the patch that would nerf the mask to &quot;must equip&quot;. A friends sister had tipped us off, she was a RL GM. So me and him (50 druid) went to the Ass chamber and sat there. Hours and hour, like 6 solid hours, not kidding (I was REALLY hooked back then, heh). Anyway, during that time, we got something like 4 Suppliers, and 3 Assasains. Supplier dropped 1 TBB and 3 bags, but the Ass only dropped Dirks. We had to bail, and the next morning there was a patch and the mask was gone forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got the other dragon hammer, what's the name, offered a friend he could borrow it for a twink, and he declined, since it was rubbish ;)<br />
The morty staff I never wanted to camp since the lizard wasn't a static, and I thought he be too diffcult to get  - about a month or 2 ago, we get the fabled Mortificator, and he drops the vest as the special item, but he also dropped the staff :D So I actually carry around the morty staff right now :)<br />

Rest of the stuff mentioned I pretty much got from the dragon hammers to RE BP to JBB and fungi to TOV armor. Of course I got the fungi at 59 after losing 5 rolls in a row on it at 54! so I kinda missed out on the prime levels for it.</div></div><hr />
