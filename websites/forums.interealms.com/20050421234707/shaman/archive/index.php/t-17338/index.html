<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok last night I(27 Pally, now 28) and my g/f (27 Shaman, Now 28) went to Crystal Caverns with a 26 Enchanter, a 30 Pally, and a 28 Cleric.  We also had a 55 Cleric there to keep us alive and pull, at one time we had like 15 Mobs on us at one time. Now the Group mentioned does group alot, everynight if we get the chance or if people arent off playing alts. My question is This, where is the best place for use to group and live and level fast? HHK? Havent been there at all, been to the pass as a youngin killing orcs, but does the Pass have the same EXP mod as the Keep or is it different.  What level and type of Mobs are we going to meet there? <br />
<br />
Where are other good places to level quickly, besides DSP? or Echo or NL cause the exp is wearing thin there. MS is out too cause thats all slow too. Paw is just a PITA. so any suggestions you could make would be greatly appreciated.  Oh btw some of us are twinked and some are lesser level twinked. Thanks again<br />
