<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taradoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following quest is for Rangersthat have aquired one of two items to help them complete this quest. The first item is a Tolans helm or any other item that will allow you to cast invis indoors, or have achieved a level high enough to cast Ultimate camo. <br />
The quest begins in the Great Divide South of Thurgadin. You  must kill a Wurm named:<br />
Vluudeen<br />
Type: MOB<br />
Race, Class: Wurm, WAR<br />
Level Range: 49 - 51<br />
to get to this wurm you must follow the stream South to the Wurm cave. Invis up as they cannot see through invis and head into the cave to the open area. At this point head south through the cave until you come to an opening on the left and you can from here see the exit out to the south. In the enterance to the cave on the left is Vluudeen's spawn point. Pull him from here to the South into the open area and careful to watch for adds. I have read where it was estimated that this mob has around 35000 HPs, but it didnt seem like that many when we took it down. Once the mob is dead loot the corpse and get the:<br />
Vluudeen's Tail<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: 1HS  Atk Delay: 21<br />
DMG: 7<br />
HP: +25  SV COLD: +10  <br />
WT: 0.0  Size: TINY<br />
Class: WAR RNG DRU BRD<br />
Race: ALL<br />
** You will need to have a Lev or SoE for the next and last part.<br />
Now take this to Kael Drakkel, it is best to start on the WL side of the zone and head towards the bank(Invis'd).When you get to the first set of stairs going up take a hard right until you see the passage way leading up (You will know you are at the right spot when you look to the right and see the wolf pit down below you). Looking up the passage way you will see two giants standing on each side of the passage (DONOT GET CLOSE TO THEM) These two giants do see invis. At this point there are two options.<br />
1) have a couple of high level characters pull and kill these two giants to clear the path.<br />
(OR)<br />
2) Do as I did and /ooc that you are completeing the Bow of the Huntsman quest and that there will be a LARGE train to WL zoneline in 5 minutes. Have someone pull these two giants and train them to the WL zoneline which opens the passage ahead. <br />
<br />
Once the passage is open stick to the left side of the wall (still camo'd) until you get to the end of the passage (other side of bridge from 2 see invis giants) Here you will see a guard on the right, stay camo'd and to the far left and you will not get agro. Once you are beside the guard on the right look down to the left side and you will see a drop off,  there is a ledge here on the left side you can drop down to. At this point you will need to make sure your lev and camo is up and keep in mind if you do fall off of the ledge there is a stair step up. Move along the ledge away from the bridge until you come to a point where you can no longer move forward and look down at the giant below you:<br />
Gleed Dragonslayer<br />
Type: MOB<br />
Race, Class: Giant, WAR<br />
Level Range: 50 - 56<br />
The following is the key to a sucessful turn in:<br />
First turn up your PC volume and hit the sneak button, then stand and sit until you cannot hear your clothes ruffle (this will let you know when you are sneaking) at this point stand and drop invis and take Vluudeen's tail out and try to give it to Gleed, if all goes well you will see and hear the Quest completed sound and you will now have the bow in your inventory:<br />
Bow of the Huntsman<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: RANGE<br />
Skill: Archery  Atk Delay: 30<br />
DMG: 20<br />
Effect: Spirit Strike<br />
WT: 2.0  Range: 180  Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR RNG<br />
Race: ALL<br />
While still sneaking turn around and go back across the ledge to where you are closest to the bridge you came inacross and while still on the ledge Camo back up and stay close to the right wall on the way out. <br />
If done correctly and if Vluudeen is up when you get to caves this quest can (and was) completed in about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Best of luck, and the bow is GREAT!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did Vluudeen with a Shaman buddy, and parsing the results show him to have around 20K hp, not the 32K plus I've seen elsewhere. Of course, it is possible that his HP does vary with level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dinas Silverbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">True you can do that full quest. Or just walk in zone and wait about 20 mins like I did. Wait for a group to kill Gleed and ask to loot bow. Its is no drop and a lot of them just rot.</div></div><hr />
