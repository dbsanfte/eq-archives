<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I was looking at a few items that I would plan on getting once I get to a higher lvl when  I noticed that the effect (Zephyr Of Brell), which is on the 8th Shawl, gives Flowing thought  II and it adds an extended 15% duration on all buffs. Would anyone happen to know if this will stack with the  Spell Casting Reinforcement  Mastery? An increased duration of 65% on all buffs would be quite nice :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm...I was browsing some other boards and from what I've been reading it does stack. At least someone who said they tested it said it worked with their Spell Casting Reinforcement Skill when they had it to 30% . So that brought it to 45%. Still kind of curious if it would stack with the Spell Casting Mastery though.</div></div><hr />
