<br />
Anyone saw those 2 nameds? Where they pop? How they look? how hard they hit ? Slowable?<br />
<br />
I am looking to get that 1HB toy that proc 350dd ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've only killed Swordfang. He had a PH kind of close to the entrance. 1 good group can kill him. 8 or 9 ppl makes him easier. We had 2 clerics. He was slowable and I forget what he hit for, but it kind of hurt.<br />
<br />
And it's a 450dd proc. 900 crits with SCF.</div></div><hr />

I've only fought Gigadon myself. Hit for 1250, double. &quot;Slightly&quot; Slowable with Turgurs. Probably 1 groupable, but you'd need a defensive tank. We killed him with 10 people and a pally tanking.<br />
<br />
Supposedly Razortooth is the best mob to kill for the sword, and Swordfang is the best for the club. /shrug</div></div><hr />
