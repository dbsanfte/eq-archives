<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In more and more threads (not just on these boards) I'm seeing statements that seem to reflect the opinion that if you are not squeezing maximum exp out of your groups, putting on precisely optimum buffs, and getting exactly the right balance of classes in the group, that you're not playing &quot;right&quot;.  I've heard that: You're stupid if you group a chanter rather than buying KEI and grouping more DPS.  You're lazy if you use group buffs instead of stronger individual buffs.  You're completely out of your mind if you get AAs other than canni5 before getting 65.  <br />
<br />
Is it really not possible to play &quot;right&quot; unless every move you make is the statistically most effective one?  Does doing some things differently in order to have more fun make you a Bad Shaman, unworthy of these boards?  Isn't there room for personal preference anywhere?  Grouping chanters so you can let them haste and tash and don't have to stop to go buy KEI?  Using group haste so you can skip some hassle?  Going for fun AAs just because they're...fun?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that the number crunchers aren't accurate.  I'm not saying that it's wrong for someone to enjoy that approach.  And I'm certainly not saying it isn't nice to have those facts available.  But when did maximizing your numbers become the only socially acceptable style?  Is it just because powergamers are the folks most likely to frequent message boards, so that's just the perspective I see most?  Or has something in the culture of EQ changed?  I'm not a powergamer but I am an old timer.  And I'm getting tired of hearing that I'm a newb or not a good shaman because I have additional priorities beyond exp.<br />
<br />
Can't we all just...get along?  *snickers*<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
WOW....do people actually believe this putrid pile of horse crap?  Imagine if people started saying this about shamans.  Just goes to show you how much the enchanter class has been hurt by recent nerfs (of which I remember some people on this board joyously celebrating...I am forever bitter about that) and the absurdly long length of the KEI buff.  I mean come on, they REALLY need to bring kei's length in line with that of tranq and voq for this reason alone.<br />
<br />

 <br />
Gee thanks  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Really depends on your style I suppose.  People often come to the boards asking for the &quot;best&quot; way to do something.   <br />
<br />
For example, people come here asking what's the &quot;best&quot; path for AA.  Certainly they haven't come to the message boards for me to tell them what they would find the most fun.  I am sure they could figure that out for themselves.  So I will tell them the most useful AA, the ones that would improve your character the most (making you more powerful or efficient).   Because being more powerful and efficient makes it easier to do your job while still slacking off! ;)<br />
<br />
In regards to group composition.  When dealing with guild groups and groups of friends.. if you are LFG that's fine with me, come on over.  We need someone to get hit and someone to heal and hopefully both of those are not me.<br />
<br />
If I am setting up a pickup group (which I never do) with a group of strangers.  My sole purpose is to use them to make my exp bar go up, possibly you might want a chance to random on items as well.  So I would prefer to have a group that gets me the absolute most exp and is capable of killing the loot dropping mobs in the area we might be hitting.  I am not interested in making new friends or becoming buddies with these random people, probably from guilds I hate, heh.<br />
<br />
I don't think powergaming is the only &quot;socially acceptable&quot; style, but if you come asking for advice it is probably the advice you will be given.  If people come here asking for the &quot;best&quot; way to do something people are going to give them the powergamer perspective.  People share their own experiences, recommend what they know and a lot of people here are powergamers so that's what it is gonna be.  Kinda depends on how rigidly you define your goals and how goal-oriented you are, overall.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Isevenl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont like to crunch numbers, but I am also particular on the people I group with.<br />
<br />
-I dont believe a shaman/chanter should be in the same group.  Unless the chanter is dire charming and adding mass DPS.<br />
<br />
-I dont believe a group should have a cleric, druid, and shaman in a group at the same time as well.  <br />
<br />
-I dont like to have more than one of any warr, pal, or sk.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, I am pretty fair game.  I usually dont /ooc out for people to join my groups, and usually dont join other groups.  I like to put together groups and form them to my likes for a decent amount of DPS and relatively safe hunting.  I think a shaman and enchanter are pretty interchangable.  <br />
<br />
Both haste/slow, one slight better than the other in both cases.  I dont think chanters are nerfed any.  Anytime I say I need to leave and ask if a chanter is a suitable replacment for me, I never get any criticism.  If anything needs revamped...its warrior taunt/agro.  I am prejudice against warriors simply because of this......take a sk, or pal anyday over warrior, even if he is less dps, or less hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once I hit 65 things changed for me.  The race was over.  I won.  <br />
<br />
Now, I log in to raid, or hang out, or quest, or PL a friends alt.  Whatever.  The exp I earn is no longer relevant.  If I spend hours and walk away with no exp I am fine with it.  I am at 100 aa, and happy there -I could easily spend another hundred, but i dont feel rushed to get there.  The things I do in game are no longer built around filling that bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, let's just erase the boards and replace with them with a big banner that reads &quot;do whatever you feel like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of COURSE you can do whatever you feel like.  That isn't really much of a topic of conversation.  So the conversation naturally drifts towards the efficient achievement of goals within the game.  <br />
<br />
But fear not, even in very clearly directed threads like &quot;I am 100,000% indifferent between ogres and trolls and was wondering whether from a strict powergaming perspective you think that unstunnability or regeneration is more valuable&quot; you will still sometimes find some braniac who thinks he is being oh so very deep by posting &quot;play you want!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alright smartypants.  I deliberately avoided specific examples because I don't want to direct this at anyone in particular.  If people ask for &quot;what is the most efficient way to...&quot; or &quot;from a strictly powergaming standpoint&quot; then of course that's what they want.  But while not all the threads on these boards are asking questions like that, those are the answers they almost always get.  And replies from anything other than the most efficient, statistically supported perspective usually get you told that you're a bad shaman, lazy, noob, etc.  <br />
<br />
Being a sociologist, I find this interesting.  Being a so-called casual player and an old timer, I find it a little disturbing.  I want to know if optimizing every moment is all folks are interested in or if there is another explanation.  <br />
<br />
After reading the replies so far, I can say it's true that there are far more posts asking for number-based information.  That alone probably leads people to give number-based answers out of habit, even when the poster asks for or implies that that's not what they're looking for.  That's understandable, and I probably wasn't giving it enough weight before because I was too busy thinking about the fewer threads I have in mind.  And the rest, well, maybe it's just the obligatory sarcasm.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies :)</div></div><hr />

I don't much care for min/maxing in exp groups as far as picking classes goes.  Sure it's nice when it all works out . . but there's no &quot;perfect&quot; group, only perfect players.  I like to think that I can put a group of any six different classes together and have it work not only well, but great!</div></div><hr />

I don't need to cannibalize to regain mana because it's too much hastle and not very fun!<br />
I like using my level 49 poison dot instead of my level 65 dot because it's not very fun spending so much mana on a single spell and having to get the mana back.<br />
I like telling the tanks in my xp groups to wield the weapons that look the coolest, instead of the ones that do the most damage, because after all, it's a lot more fun to kill mobs looking cool than looking not as good, right?<br />
<br />
Numbers matter.<br />
You get focus effects on your armor to help squeeze out a bit more efficiency from your spells.<br />
You get healing AAs to make your heals a bit more efficient.<br />
You use cannibalize instead of meditating when indoors because it's more efficient to regain mana than sitting down.<br />
You cast your good haste spells instead of crappy ones because you want your tanks doing as much damage as you can.<br />
Everything you do makes you more efficient (or not so efficient as the case may be)<br />
<br />
Effort = reward.<br />
If you feel like being lazy and doing the bare minimum, go nuts.<br />
Your minimum xp reward will be your fair return.<br />
When I'm in an xp group, I like to see progression as fast as possible with the friends I'm partying with so I don't have to xp as long to see the results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To others, EQ is a video game, that just happens to have built-in IRC.<br />
<br />
Personally, I fall in the latter category.  I don't play video games (or do much of anything in life, for that matter :/ ) to dawdle; I play to win.  That's why I badmouth people who use ToA over SLTW, for instance.<br />
<br />
I'll just go with Uggok on this one and say that, while it may be easier to say &quot;do what's fun for you,&quot; it certainly isn't very helpful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Numbers aren't everything, though I agree in a pickup group, people tend to go for optimal classes because they're less likely to have optimal players.<br />
<br />
One of the best exp-rate ever groups I have been in ever was with a few friends and a few pickups in Inner Caves, Plane of Valor. The group had both an enchanter and shaman, and the shaman (me) was only 62 at the time. We had a warrior tanking too. At one point, I clocked under and hour between one AA ding and the next.<br />
<br />
I was in a guild group in PoE the other day, with a necro pet tanking... then a monk tanking. I was tanking adds. Not ideal, but still good exp, and with friends.<br />
<br />
I agree, the main point of a game is to have fun. But EQ can be more than that - there's a good deal of satisfaction in attaining that item you were looking for, in getting a new skill or level, and in being a part of a group of people that accomplishes something they haven't done before, whether it's an exp group killing a tough named in a dungeon somewhere, or a guild killing a god for the first time.<br />
<br />
I agree that it's not all about doing whatever is most effective, but speaking for myself, being more effective helps me contribute more, and I like being able to say, &quot;I made a difference&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The number crunching can probably be laid at the feet of PoP. Prior to PoP, gaining experience took a considerable amount of time. Gaining .xx dps per hour wasn't going to have a major effect at the end of the day. In PoP, that same extra dps might mean an extra aa or two per day. <br />
<br />
To a lessor extent, the new generation of players isn't helping. In most cases, they're racing to catch up to their friends. After 50+ levels of optimized leveling (pal caverns, etc), they've probably gotten use to what it takes to get to the next level the quickest. <br />
<br />
For us 'old timers' who remember spending a month in a hell level (a blue a day?), experience today, even outside the planes, is pretty damn good.  <br />
<br />
As you stated, it's not the number crunching that annoys me, it's the fact that if you don't follow the optimal route planned by the number crunchers, you're somehow unfit to play a shaman. <br />
<br />
I was told the other day I was a pretty good shaman. Not because I used single buffs over group buffs (I don't), not because I time my buffs (I don't), not because I knew that SltW was .056 more effective then ToA (I didn't). It was because I rarely got agro from the tank after slowing and if I did, I stayed put until he had agro back. He couldn't care less what I buffed him with, he just didn't want to have to chase the mob around. Am I good shaman because of that, nah. It was, however, his perception of a good shaman. <br />
<br />
I guess that's what it comes down, perception. The extra dps might be perceived as the only thing that matters to some, while having a good time might be my perception of what matters. <br />
<br />
I think, in part, that's what Dandi is trying to get across. Whatever perception you may have of our class, please remember that it's only your perception/opinion. We're all different. Prejudging someone because they don't see/do/feel the same way you do, is a dangerous path to go down. <br />

Personally, I try to max stats for challenging encounters, whereas I tend to use group buffs like ToA instead of SltW for regular exp grinding.  Frankly, I play the game to relax sometimes (usually exp grind) and to challenge my ablitilies at others (raids or dungeon crawls).  <br />

<br />
I feel that attitude is prevalent here.  Perhaps it's unavoidable on class boards such as these.  I'll still be using ToA tho, Uggok, in my experience groups regardless of what you may think, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love it when a chanter is in the group.  Then I dont have to worry about haste, usually they can tash on incoming while I slow.  Mob is slowed usually right about the time it gets to camp.  DC is  nice, mez is nice, not having your cleric run off for kei after 2 hrs is nice.  Chanter doesn't provide huge dps unless they got a good pet, but can nuke and haste etc.  Also, can also make it so I have more time to dot or toss down a few more rains.<br />
<br />
We had fun in PoV with the DC pets.  We had one group with a chanter, druid and necro, all with DC pets.   That was fun, which I think really is the most important in EQ.  You play in a way that makes it the most fun for you.<br />
<br />
Do I play a shaman like most consider is &quot;right&quot;?  Nope, probably not.  Do I have fun?  Yep, sure do.  So if you are doing what is &quot;right&quot; and having no fun, who is the smarter player?  You do the math.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're either a Type A EQ player or you're not.  If &quot;Just have fun&quot; doesn't seem to be too &quot;oh so very deep,&quot; then it's probably because you're a powergamer that is more influenced by &quot;the right way.&quot;  <br />

If Ugg's condescending sarcasm reflects the attitude of those that follow the &quot;right path,&quot; then that is a path I certainly would not choose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I am certainly not a &quot;type A&quot; player, and my point was not that &quot;do whatever is fun&quot; is not a viable playstyle, my point was that it is so painfully obvious that it is a viable playstyle that it is stupid to even mention it.  That is why I thought this thread was silly, and that is why I (and others) mocked it.  Tone aside, the actual content of my sentiment was pretty much identical to Henora's.  If you want to criticize me for playing a role in the general decline in the quality of discourse around here, you have a valid point.  In my opinion, that battle was lost long ago, but I am glad to see someone else taking up the banner of civility.  <br />
 <br />
If &quot;just have fun&quot; seems like anything other than a banal truism to you -- much less some sort of deep revelation --  then you are one who is either being a bit dense or a pathetically addicted &quot;type A&quot; player.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There are a few folks that still belive the game is to be played. Not to be parsed and crunched down to the optimum path.<br />
<br />
Of course. I read and listen to the powergamers. And Honestly am a powergamer myself. But I powergame a roleplaying game. Not a tactical simulator.<br />
<br />
If you meet me in game you remember me. Not because I am the best. Or because I have the most hitpoints. Or any number of best or uber things. You remember me because I am consistantly the best I can be. Be that making friends. Pissing people off. Leading friends on raids. Getting killed in oh so painful ways. Grinding oput xp in tactics. Roleplaying the 60 Int shaman who has a serious case of bloodlust and a deep seated belief that to stand back there is somehow beneath her.<br />
<br />
Play the game to have fun is damn good advice. And the roleplayer and the powergamer can coexist. If they respect each other. The problem is many many more powergamers respect only those ahead of them in the game and they have no way of quantifying who is best when someone else is level 40 and speaks in thee's and thou's So they mock them. <br />
<br />
Hey the ogre warrior or the Iksar shaman might be the so called Best. (Or whatever) But when the total differance tween an ogre warrior and a Gnome warrior at the end game comes down to unstunability from the front and Xp penaltys, compared to Never needing a shrink and tinkering and such.. Who really gives a rats ass. All classes and races have advantages and disadvantages. And if you are lucky enough to find a class and race that suits you. be it powergamed or roleplayed or whatever. then you have won EQ.<br />
<br />
And Yes I have won EQ. I won it The day I retired my level 60 thief and in no uncertain terms decided that the path of Justice and the cold frost encrusted hammer was the path I would walk. And I walk that path proudly with friends. <br />
