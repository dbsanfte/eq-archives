<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sitting here at work, minding my own business, and trying to play EQ.<br />
<br />
Boss keeps coming in here and I'm forced to turn off my monitor so he doesn't see what I'm doing.(playing without sound)<br />
<br />
Anyone else have an inconsiderate boss like that?<br />
<br />
Just wanna tell em to get the hell out, I'm busy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use EQW:  You're only one alt-tab away from a full-screen spreadsheet/document/whatever.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tisnotme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Play in windowed mode :)<br />
I dont play when my boss is around only when he leaves.  Even then I am not really playing for exp cause I am to busy here at work, its just to glance at the /aucs and run errands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eclectik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Put a sock on  the doorknob so he thinks your doing uhm..'official business' with your secretary!<br />
And don't forget to close the shades</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">haha...I don't have a secretary..but that gives me an idea &gt;:)<br />
<br />
I've heard of the eqw...but wasn't sure if it was safe to run it.  Thought they had fixed it.<br />
<br />
Guess I'll so a search on the internet for it and see if I can get it installed.  Thanks for the help.<br />

Rude much?<br />
<br />
I posted this joking around.  Pull that stick out of your arse and get a sense of humor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ctrl+alt+r will pull you out of the window so that you can minimize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I used to play at the office (can't anymore since Luclin came out!), I would always stand up if my boss came in.  Head him off before he sees the monitor, I say!<br />
<br />
But that all depends on where your workstation/desk is situated.  If you're in a small cube you're probably out of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Truc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">we had a computer down for a while at work on the front counter, where i work. so i brought in my second machine untill they could build up another one. anyhow it had eq on it and i would play when no one was here. but eqw is a lifesaver! hehe i cruise the forums, boss doesn't care so long as all my work is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are going to use EQW it's much easier for me at least to hit the ALT key to get out of the window. Just run EQW once, it will create an ini file, then edit eqw.ini and change cntrl + alt + r to something you like. Just thought I'd pass that tip along that someone taught me.</div></div><hr />
