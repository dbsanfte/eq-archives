I only want to upgrade the crappy Cloud of Grummus spell with a new useful one. That's all.<br />

Sha's Revenge (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3462&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Oh, I see.<br />
<br />
Sha's Revenge is pretty much Turgur's but 65% and different timing.  Note how Sha's Revenge and Turgur are both magic resistance and both add disease counters (resist = magic, cure = disease).<br />
<br />
Whereas Grummus is unique to shamans.  It's 40% and slower casting, but it's disease based resistance and adds disease counters so it's curable with cure disease spells, just like turgur's and sha's revenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ack!! That's true. Sha's revenge checks against magic and isn't a real upgrade. Turgur is much better. I was wrong. Sorry for the mistake.<br />
<br />
What I really want is an upgrade to the shaman's disease slow spell line.<br />
A disease slow spell equivalent to Sha's revenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spells Id like to see:<br />
<br />
Poison based nuke for 1K plus base damage (350-400 mana, 5 sec cast time)<br />
Group FA (12 minute base duration, 5 minute recast)<br />
AE 60-65% slow<br />
Upgrade to Quiscience (+100 mana +1000HP)<br />
Focus upgrade (+700ish HP, 80str dex, sta, END regen)<br />
Upgrade to Bih'li (60-75% speed increase, +90 atk)<br />
<br />
AA's Id like to see:<br />
Cannibalization cast time reducer (1 level, 9 points, cuts 60 to 90 seconds off timer reset)<br />
Melee accuracy boost (3 levels, 3,6,9 points increases melee acuracy by 15, 25, and 45%)<br />
Melee damage boost ( 3 levels 2,4,6 poitns increases base damage by 5, 10, and 15%)<br />
AA slow ability (6 points, 65% slow  2 minue recast, disease based with a -50 mod )<br />
Group HoT (simmilar to Q, 3 minute recast)<br />
Group Cannibalize (converts 1K hp to 750 mana for every group member, 15 minute recast)<br />
<br />
Some of these are kind of off the wall and probably would not happen (group canni, melee boosters) but are all things I have though of while fighting (If I could only do this, Id be better off here...).  Fun to think about anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AE Malos<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Group HoT (simmilar to Q, 3 minute recast) would be far to overpowered and all the rest of the preist classes would complain, both wood and paragon are 15 minute reuse, and i don't see getting a aa grp Q for anything shorter, would be nice tho for shaman #4 to have something to mgb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it would be nice to have a Turgur's AA, 5 minute refresh.<br />
<br />
For those times when Turgur's gets resisted.<br />
<br />
Actually, that would suck, because then you get resisted twice and then you die from agro. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">a group heal would be great but imagine having to save mgb for ae mobs and therefore having to do fo7 by groups, ugh.<br />
<br />
and for the list you forgot canni 6.<br />
<br />
for a bona fide slow upgrade I'd suggest a fast-casting 50% slow with a -50 resist mod. Hell make it 65% :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AE Malos at the very least. A group heal would be handy and group FA would OWN. Or, make the duration of a new avatar spell at least equal regen or SLTW. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Upgrade FA to a group spell.<br />
<br />
Give it 20% overhaste.<br />
<br />
Give it a END regen component.<br />
<br />
Then it would truly be the ultimate melee buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">grp fa spell, <br />
grp cure over time, ie 6 poison/disease/curse counters a tic<br />
aa grp Qwould be great, <br />
perhaps an over cap stat buff, instead of making your 305 stats, give 350-400ish, really only good for sta, or maybe dex, <br />
ae, or pbae slow and malos, <br />
someone mention improved invis, most other classes with it get some kinda aa invis, at least rangers/druids do, <br />
<br />
finally cani6 in 1 of 2 forms, either as a true upgrade or as an insta cast cani, w/ maybe a 5-6 recast, so its basically cani4 w/o casting time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spells I wouldn't mind seeing:<br />
<br />
1.  A pbae poison nuke.<br />
<br />
2.  A targetted (4 target) spell along the malosinia line (not 75% though, that's too high for an ae one... put a -50 resist mod on our something)<br />
<br />
3.  A Tigirs upgrade (fast cast, short duration ~1 min, 4 target, still 50% to not overpower, -50 resist mod or so)<br />
<br />
4.  A spell along the lines of a cleric's Word of Replenishment... basically an upgrade to blood of Nadox.  Give us a ~500-750 heal on top of our Blood of Nadox.<br />
<br />
5.  Don't really need an upgrade to cann5... it's borderline overpowered as is.  An upgrade to Cann4 (which would most likely get called Canniballize 5), which takes bout 300hp and gives (well they haven't changed our ratio on it in a while so keep hp-mana ratio the same).<br />
<br />
6.  A focus line with built in haste (50-60%).  Increase the duration to be in line with pot9/bot9.  Increase the hp (accordingly as other class's hp buffs would be upgraded).<br />
<br />
7.  An aggro reducer.  A wizard could alternate their highest nuke and a concussion on a raid level mob and maintain hella dps, but if I was to dot a group or raid mob like I could be doing, I'd become a 6800hp rune for the MT.<br />
<br />
8.  Another set of &quot;ancient&quot; spells.  Well not really ANCIENTs, but just raid level spells, couple per class, highly unique to each class.  It would have been nice to see these in PoP off Quarm or something.  (i.e. for shaman, a hella dot, ~100dps, some kind of built in aggro mod to keep it along the lines of normal dot aggro or even lower... possibly make it risky by giving it a frenzy line of spells type of recast, where it greys out all spells for ~15 seconds.  Other spell could be an FA type spell... but make it outrageous... ~200atk or something... yeah stats too but everyone has max stats at that level of the game, their important stats at least)<br />
<br />
<br />
AAs I wouldn't mind seeing:<br />
<br />
1.  Targettable shrink aa.  Enchanters have target illusion to cast shrink on people... why can't we have an aa to allow us to cast our shrink spells on people outside of group.  There is no hazard to this... even enchanters can KILL people with target illusion... just give someone an illusion in DN.  This would also give the original shrinkers some merit with the spell.<br />
<br />
2.  An aa that is along the lines of Spell Casting Fury for dots (chance of a crit on each tic), also one that increases each tick's damage (think of Healing adept for dots).<br />
<br />
3.  An overhaste AA buff (targettable, ~15-30%).  Give it a &quot;significant&quot; reuse time, ~90 mins, with a rather short duration ~3-5 mins.<br />
<br />
4.  Perma Rabidity... basically make rabid bear worth a damn by letting us keep it on permanently or something.  Oh no, a shaman with a bunch of haste, stats, and some cold resist... it's the end of the world...<br />
<br />
5.  If not Perma Rabidity... Targetted Rabidity... this would kind of be like an FA aa of sorts... wouldn't be too bad giving Rabid Bear to a melee... but a shaman, c'mon.<br />
<br />
Well have a lot more ideas, but I'm bored at work and bout to get off and go home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm my wishlist is simple. <br />
<br />
-group HoT<br />
-lowered aggro on our dot's, whether than be aa's, a de-aggro spell or new dot's with less aggro, I don't care.<br />
-pet with built in sow, even if I never use a pet again I want it on principle:) My damn run speed spell is named  SPIRIT of the WOLF, my pet who can't run fast on his own, is a SPIRIT of a WOLF.<br />
<br />
-lastly, I want the trend of making shaman spells weak or more mana expensive to make up for our canni to stop. If the trend continues canni will mean less and less. Down the road we might have &quot;HUGE&quot; mana regen, but how much will that mean if we get watered down damage or heals at inflated mana costs? Canni will no longer be a class defining bonus, it will instead become something we are assumed to be doing every second of our time logged in, just to break even and cast spells that other can do for 1/3 the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a new slow and im good.<br />
<br />
im level 65 and still using a level 52 slow.. kinda weird if you ask me :p<br />
Maybe a little more % slow, possibly 80%, and much less chance for resists, or whatever..<br />
<br />
I just cant stand using a level 52 spell, sometimes i just use Grummus instead.. :p</div></div><hr />

Shamans will NEVER get sha's revenge, go read some stuff about &quot;sha&quot; it has to do with beastlords, maybe a spell similar with a 50 or 60% disease slow but they arent going to give shaman the same spell, unless they give beastlord a better one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Would like a new AA for the holidays: An instant, neg 50 resist adjust, 8 second 40% disease slow, reusable every 6 minutes.  Oh, and give it negligible agro on success.  And make it annul-able (as opposed to curable) so that it adds some complication to using it. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">AoE Malosomething please.  I'd actually prefer it be Malosini or Malosinia.  AoE Malo/Malos would be too much, I think.  Not to mention that chanters would scream bloody murder (and rightfully so) if we got an unresistable multi-target MR debuff that was also very low aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh... another round of the new spell game! Always fun to play.<br />
<br />
Let's see...<br />
<br />
- A level 63 upgrade to Turgur's Insect. We haven't had a MR slow upgrade since *Kunark* after all, so we're definitely due for one. I don't think it likely they will ever let an 80%+ slow in the the hands of the players, so best play on the other components of the spell: Still 'only' 75%, 200 Mana, 3s/5s cast recast, 16 disease counter, Magic based with a -100 resist adjust. Slightly faster recast. A bit cheaper, a bit faster to recast and a LOT less painful to land.<br />
<br />
- Either an unmitigable 40% slow, disease-based, or a 3.5K/80% Incomplete Heal. They used our Slow as a reason not to upgrade our heals... then they went right ahead and introduced slow mitigation. Time to review THAT line of reasonning<br />
<br />
- A level 64 upgrade to Bearform. A *serious* upgrade. First, get rid of the bear model for both the new and the old spell and put in either the Velious Kodiak model or the PoP bear model. Second, up the regen to +7 HP/Mana, with the mana component not stacking with the Po9/Bo9. Up the WIS bonus to 15, with a +200 raw mana bonus. Basically, make it a self-buff with the 'oomph' of the other classes self-buffs. Also, upgrade the bear illusion itself with 'Slam'... I can slam as a Barbarian but I can't Slam as a bear? Pull that other one, it got bells on...<br />
<br />
- UV, See Invis, Lev and +65% Movement speed buff. We're the original SOW caster, after all... it's only right we end up with the better spell. Spirit of Crow at 52 for the single version, Murder of Crow at 62 for the group version.<br />
<br />
- A spellcast upgrade to Canni IV, something along the lines of 250 HP for 140 Mana. Baring the AA, we got our last Canni upgrade with Velious???<br />
<br />
Of course, the sad part is that, beside those example, there is dozens of other things we could ask for. After all, the last 2 'new' things we got added to our versatility were 'Avatar' with Kunark (as an ATK buff, which got pimped the very next expansion to every melee that went to kill in Sleeper's Tomb) and 'Bearform' with Velious. Oh, we got better at doing what we already could... but even then, not quite as much better as the other class got to become at what THEY did. Class inter-dependance, my ass... The last thing they want to deal with is a shaman with a new trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Spell: Summon World of Warcraft would be enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Spell: Summon World of Warcraft would be enough for me. Amen.<br />
<br />
Wish List<br />
- Group haste that is at least equal to SLTW<br />
- Cannization enhancement or lowered refresh AAs<br />
- A true Cann5<br />
- Group Avatar<br />
- Non-suck Bear Form (above suggestion was good)<br />
- Non-suck nuke (read: doesn't take all day to cast, 1k+ damage base)<br />
- Improved slow. Honestly, you put Turgur's on a clicky, something better is now in order. How many class-defining abilities are on a clicky?<br />
- PBAE something.<br />
- Group heal would be nice. You gave Beastlords one and we don't have one?<br />
- Improved Q (rate of healing)<br />
- 5kish base incomplete heal (don't care about mana cost)<br />
- SoW that doesn't suck (2 hour duration please)<br />
- Focus that lasts as long as other 'essential' buffs (2 hour duration)<br />
<br />
I agree that 80% slow is probably something we'll never see. That said, we do need something better than Turgur's, or we may as well find a new class defining ability. Lower cast time, resist rate, mana cost, and refresh time are all things that can be improved upon. Otherwise, no Shaman will ever bag Time's Antithesis for any reason at all.<br />
<br />
I'm also very sick of rebuffing during an average adventure. Other than haste, regen, and avatar I shouldn't have to rebuff at all. Even with the 8th shawl and SCRM an adventure that goes down to the wire may need to be rebuffed. That's really silly, and it's something that should be corrected.<br />
<br />
We also need an improved rate of healing if we are to stay competitive with the other priest classes. There are lots of threads debating this, but we are handily out-healed by druids. There is a certain cap of how much DPS a Shaman can keep up with, and although we can keep up with it for a long time, it's significantly lower than the amount of DPS a Druid or Cleric can keep up with. Slow mitigation and immunity has only exacerbated this problem (there's your word of the day kids).<br />
<br />
And most of all:<br />
NO MORE RABID BEAR ANYTHING. Just give it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1) either Group FA, or a long-duration version of single-target FA.  Even 1k mana for 15 mins would be fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Lots of good ideas, some I don't like so much<br />
<br />
 I for one do use my pet and wouldn't mind an upgrade to our pet buff on the lines of focus plus haste. Increase in attack would be neccisary, ANYTHING to keep the poor dog from missing 90% of the time :P Nothing on the line of making our pet anywhere near a BL Warder however.<br />
<br />
 Please PLEASE upgrade the graphics of Bear Form. I don't care if they add a new spell. <br />
<br />
 I liked the idea of Slow and Cripple together. That would be a good way to improve our slow spells without making them too powerfull.<br />
<br />
 AE Malo? That would be okay I guess.<br />
<br />
 Poison AA? SURE! Add an upgrade to the Disease one too and toss in snare so we can Quad Kite! No thanks :P<br />
<br />
 Dmg Shield? That's a Druid/Mage domain. No need for us to go there. <br />
<br />
 Uber Nukes? I'm a Shaman not a Wizzie. I might aprechiate one, but don't feel it's necisarry. I do know that our nukes should never even remotely approach the dmg a wizard's or even a Druid's do. <br />
<br />
 Group Avatar? Does everyone in the group need it? Would there be stacking issues? Would we be recasting it every fight? No thanks! <br />
<br />
  Curses: I haven't been on many high end PoP raids, but I understand some of the boss mobs have interesting AE's, the one I have heard about prevents everyone from casting. Why not allow us a single target version? Perhaps someone who knows more about those high end encounters can elaborate. ARE there other AE's in those encounters that would make nice single target curses for us?<br />
<br />
 What I would like to see most is new Buff spells that break the stat barrier. A lot of people have equipment that almost maxes some of thier stats. Give us a buff that breaks the stat cap and moves them up above it.<br />

Maybe a little more % slow, possibly 80%, and much less chance for resists, or whatever..<br />
<br />
I just cant stand using a level 52 spell, sometimes i just use Grummus instead.. :p<br />
<br />
I really hope your kidding.<br />
You do realise that the lower the spell the lower your chance at a resist and fizzles.<br />
How often do you Fizzle turgurs? Personally hardly ever.<br />
How many times do you see clerics fizzle CHeal?<br />
<br />
An 80% slow will never happen. That would be like walking up to a vender and paying for your exp.<br />
<br />
The recast, although can be painfull, is perfect simply due to the fact that if it was faster, we would die more from resist aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While you are at it, remove the lazy and artificial limitations of focus effects on CHs and revamp the spell line.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
- include more big heals<br />
- spread them out throughout the levels (make a spell progression, as there should have been one from the start)<br />
- lower todays clerics CH a bit and place it somewhere lvl 58 (nobody below that needs a 7.5 K heal ...)<br />
- implement a new big heal only slightly better than clerics actual CH at 63 (maybe even high-end only 65) for clerics only.<br />
- make all the new spells vendor buyable, no need to punish players for developers design errors.<br />
<br />
Granted that is slightly off topic, i just wanted to show, that i think it IS possible to fix CH issues - keeping clerics, druids AND shaman in mind.<br />
<br />
Some of the suggestions here are seriously overpowered btw - a group Q? So your whole group has a constant regen of 300? no way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Some of these ideas seem a wee bit overpowering to me.  I guess when you're pretty sure you'll never get any significant change/addition you may as well dream, eh?<br />
<br />
- I'd like to see tiny companion work<br />
- I'd like to seen an upgrade to bear form with an added +hp component (more in line with the existing +regen and we all like health, ya?).  Totally out there but I wish my bear form did emotes...rather than always looking the sameeven when sitting.  When I /rude a resisty mob I want to be standing up on my hind legs and giving the finger or something.  Having no slam in bear form makes no sense to me...it's not like I melee a lot anyways.<br />
- I'd like to see an upgrade to turgor's in a reasonable way...maybe a slightly lower mana cost or lesser recast timer.  I don't think a MR adjustment is reasonable to ask for (especially 100!) when we posses MR debuff spells and unresistable MR debuffs.  You could argue that not having an upgrade to turgor's, which we get at a relatively early level, stinks - but you could also be thankful that we get turgor's so early and don't have to wait that long to get our awesome slow.  I know I was overjoyed when I got turgor's, mostly for the lower casting time!<br />
- I'd like to see more of our spells have alternate ways of obtaining them.  Some spells you can't live without, some are trash, and regardless some have hard quests, drop from tough named, or are dependent on sheer luck or a big bank account to obtain.  Some spells can drop and be researched.  For some spells your options are very limited - I'd like to see that change.<br />
- I'd like to see us get a pet aug like all other pet classes.  Even something weak would be nice just to know they care.<br />
- I don't mind refreshing buffs and usually plan ahead and refresh them before they drop...BUT...it'd be nice to have slightly longer base buff durations on some of the buffs since many other buff class buffs last way longer than our, the debatable kings of buffing, buffs.<br />
<br />
I'm a happy shaman...I mostly just wish I could shrink my pet...</div></div><hr />

ARE there other AE's in those encounters that would make nice single target curses for us?<br />
<br />
the problem with this is, was pally's had a single target silence spell, but it would stop mobs ae's, so they could chain cast it and solo like ww dragons(was like early luclin i think...not sure) because the hard things were remove ie the 1200 pt graveflux completely trivilaized encounters.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me it's fairly in line with what else is out there, especially if it's made as an AA.<br />
<br />
Just a quick edit... we are the only priest class that has no group heal.  Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Beastlords, all get group heals as either spells or AA's.  We're overdue to be brought into line with other healers and hybrids in that regard.  I'd settle for a group blast heal even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wouldn't there be a mana cost there to contend with? What if it's 1200 mana per cast eh?<br />
With quick mass buff or whatever it is, would be nice to have something to do with it besides just rebuff the raid every 30 mins. On that note, make nadox mgb'able too somehow. Hey make a combined group quiescence with built in nadox effect! yesss!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">While I don't agree with much of what the original poster had to say, I have been thinking a while on the kind of spells I would like to see in a new expansion or in the interim.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Cannibalize. <br />
Our last manaregen upgrade was in VELIOUS.   Every other mana-using class got a luclin and/or pop spell upgrade.   ALL other mana-using classes have PASSIVE manaregen.  That means they can be doing OTHER THINGS while regaining mana.  Shaman cannot, if we are using our sadly outdated Cannibalize 4 to regain mana, we cannot be doing anything else, not moving or casting or sitting.  We most devote a precious spell slot to this spell.<br />
<br />
Let's look at raid buffed figures, assume everyone has Blessing of the 9, VOQ and Spiritual Dominion. (leaving out bard for now)<br />
<br />
Clerics, Yaulp = 57<br />
Druids, Mask of the Forest = 49<br />
Enchanters, none = 45  &lt;--poor guys<br />
Mages, Xegony's Phantasmal Guard = 51<br />
Necromancers (no VOQ), Seduction of Saryrn = 67<br />
Shaman, none = 45<br />
Wizard, Greater Familiar (or better aa) = 49+<br />
<br />
That's assuming raid buffs.  Assuming self-buffed only<br />
Clerics = 20<br />
Druids = 12<br />
Enchanters = 28<br />
Mages = 6<br />
Necros = 50<br />
Shaman = 0<br />
Wizard = 4<br />
<br />
and our class is constantly punished for our &quot;superior manaregen&quot; by making our spells more resisty and cost more mana.  See Bane (shaman) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live) vs Horror (necromancer) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4098&amp;source=Live) for a plain example.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 4 - 2.5 second cast time, 3 second recast, for 5.5 seconds to regain 82 mana.  So it is roughly 82 mana per tick.  For this we pay the price of 148 hitpoints (1.8 hp per mana) and 4.5 seconds of being unable to cast anything else AND a spell slot we always have to have canni4 in.  The necromancer lich spell is the only real similar line.  Their trade is basically 63 hp for 50mana or 1.26 hp per mana.  However, I have no issue with the necromancer mana regen.  They pay the piper by not being able to use VOQ/KEI.  Remember the most other classes pay no penalty at all for their manaregen and we are penalized in spell slots, cast time and hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
The point of all this is that I do not have time to chain cast cannibalize.  Give us a cannibalize with a very short cast time (like yaulp) and a longer recast time (20 seconds?) that does significantly bigger chunks.  I feel the lack of passive manaregen most keenly when doing serious healing or debuffing a large number/continous stream of mobs.  In terms of healing, I feel, with our heals being so small that most of the time when we are healing we are blast healing.  Just casting tnargs over and over.  During times like these we cannot devote the 4.5 seconds of casting time for a canni anymore.  <br />
<br />
Right now it is possible for us to get 820 mana back in one minute (10 casts of canni4) doing NOTHING besides casting canni4.  Say we want to get a maximum of 1100 mana back in one minute but with only 5 casts of Canni6... 220 mana for 375 hp, .5 second cast, 20 second recast.  Maybe I am nuts, but that would be much more useable to me than our current canni.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Avatar<br />
I already have to cast FA all the time.  I want something that sets it apart again.  The avatar line used to be the ultimate shaman buff.  I remember reading the spell list when I first started playing and thinking WOW!  There was no one else that could buff pure attack, nor buff stats like that.  People did not max their statistics.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there is no more wow factor to the Avatar line.  It was given out on weapons and then other buffs that are similar were introduced for other classes.  If you want WOW factor from me, see the beastlord spell Ferocity... +65 all resists and more atk than our very best avatar.   Because in reality when you are level 65 on raids you cap str, dex, sta... the things that matter on ferocity and avatar are the atk and the resists.   Give our avatar something special again +damage (like those new disciplines) or some of the special melee abilities that you are granting now or endurance regen or something.  Some shaman will cry that they hate buffing.  If we must buff, give us something special... especially for a spell that permanently occupies a spell slot and must be maintained constantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agro reduction<br />
I would like some agro reduction abilities.  We do not get spell casting sublety.  Either an aa or spell, short duration, self only agro decreaser or a pure istant agro decrease spell or button.... mostly so I can use dots.  You give me bane and that's great, nice short duration for mobs that don't live long.  Unfortunately if I slow and then Bane, I have to tank the mob as well.  In fact, I don't ever use Bane unless I plan on tanking.  We get new dots every expansion and they become less and less useable overall because of the agro they generate.   Fixing dots and fixing warrior agro might remove the need for any agro reduction for shaman, from my perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
I would like the ability to heal an entire group.  Druids can do it with AA, our HYBRID class can with AA (and regen mana /sigh), clerics can since forever, pallies can too.  We are the only priest type that has no ability to heal a group.  Group Quies would probably be overpowering, even with a high mana cost.  Something else would have to be done, even if you lowered the healing per tick (but added some attack or something interesting) it would be a very useable spell.  I'd like to see Quies upgraded a bit in a single target version, if not to include more healing per tick, add some +mitigation or avoidance in it, we've been healing 300hp per tick since ....the turn of the century!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other<br />
I'd like to see a more diverse assortment of focus effects available in ldon.  Like improved healing type stuff and different focuses for specific mana-pres (disease based only or cold based only or whatever).  I'd like to see focuses that increase damage on rains.<br />
<br />
AE malo would be nice, I wouldn't say it is overpowering there has been AE tash forever.  Make it even weaker than Malo, but keep it unresistable.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Heh, improved invis.  Such a simple thing.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see armor textures be able to be purchased in ldon, i miss velious textures! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 shaman, 2 mgb's.  I don't think they are gonna keep it on a full raid indefinitely.  They certainly aren't gonna make a group Q with the mana it is now, so again, they  aren't gonna be keeping it on a full raid indefinitely.

<br />
2) It has been said that Turgurs is a level 52 spell.  This made me flinch.  Actually physically flinch.  Our class defining spell, and some people (LEVEL 65 some people!) dont know what level we get it.   Its a level 51 spell.  Not 52, not 50,  level 51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Good post, Henora.<br />
<br />
Edit: I still want to add what I have been saying for months now. <br />
<br />
There needs to be a significant resist adjust added to our DoTs and Debuffs to reflect our mastery(in the case of debuffs)and bring us in line with other DoT casters(in the case of DoTs, because it can't be that they benefit from their resist adjust to their DoTs on top of my debuff, thus often leaving me way behind)<br />
The only way to fix Shaman Slow, *if* you want to keep the Slow Mitigation working as it is(which looks like it, since you are using it in LDoN as well), is to give me a &quot;Turgur's&quot; with a high resist adjust(or make this an innate feature of our class for all debuffs scaling by the level of the character)AND a &quot;Turgur's level&quot; Slow for all 5 resist checks(alternatively you can add a Slow that checks vs. the lowest resist trait of the mob EVERY time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I personally did think that group quiessence would be kinda overstepping intially. Since we are not the masters of healing, nor should we ever be. Clerics have this title. A moderate say 100 hp/tick COULD be good although it would again increase the number of spell slots. <br />
<br />
I also agree about cannibalize, that having to cannibalize every second just gets ever so neurotic.<br />
It would be interesting to consider which class does the most clicking lol. Ferine avatar, slow, malos, cannabilize 4. Someone gets dotted, mem cure, cure. Seems so much more like work than actual enjoyment and enrichment of the game in some aspects. Buffing in particular is one aspect I am considering. I wonder, would it be stupid if buffing did not use mana, exclude quiessence as a buff.<br />
<br />
Similar to a pure melee bar all they have to do is cast endurance based attacks with it, if the mana bar was to only cast heals and detrimental spells. Summoning a pet should use mana though.<br />
<br />
Also what happens if you had a 2nd set of spell gems beside the first, in which you can arrange buff swapping. For example, beside the first spell gem is a buff, horizontally to the right is another gem. Press a button, both switch spells. I have thought beyond the topic header though, but its an improvement which will make the game possibly less work in some aspects.<br />
<br />
As for spells, what I would like to see, hmm. Yes I guess a -33 mr/pr/cr/fr AE spell could be handy. I would however like to see more innovative spells to the spell lineup. Imagine, having a 10-sec poison/disease immunity aa or buff.  I don't think improved invisibility is something we really need.<br />
<br />
I do think we need something to enchance melee, since especially in highend guilds most people have maxed their stats. Ac and hp being the most influential buffs at high levels, atk/resists also. Divine Avatar is reportedly one of the aa in next expansion, if it went like 5/10/15 min duration as you scaled up in aa that could be quite nice.<br />
<br />
Ldon is chaos, cast malos, cast slow, cast dot, try and be on crowd control, heal, AE slow if many come. It would be nice to divide that down. Being able to combine roles so we can free time to concentrate on one task. So a spell that somehow combines some of the roles. So maybe a 60% slow with a combined dot, or a 60% slow with a -33 resistadj. Or an atk remover, Thats my thoughts at least. A -100 dr for pvp only would be nice also. I like the suggestions of innate Rabid bear, an aa that scales a 1.30 hour reuse to 45 mins to innate. However it could be argued that innate rabid bear would confuse the role of a shaman to some.</div></div><hr />

I am aware of that, but isn't that more of a reason to NOT get it? If shamans need a boost in the healing department (and i think they do), sure go for it. But i am not a big friend of looking at other classes and just copy their spells/abilities.<br />

My view is 3 classes have already such massive group regen abilities (see above), so it would be better to give shaman some other toys to play with, not group regen no 4.<br />

Most here probably weren't playing back then, but Celestial Elixir was practically copied from Torpor(when Kunark was released Shamans were the only class with a HoT till they replaced one of the cleric spells with CE, which healed for the same amount as Torpor for 100 mana more and no drawbacks). <br />
Of course in PoP they screwed us, making Q just a minor upgrade, while upgrading Celestial Elixir(300/tick) with Supernal Elixir(500/tick) was a pretty nice one.<br />
I'd like to see a Torpor(not Q) upgrade, which healed for 800/tick costing 400 mana and a Q upgrade for 500/tick and 275-300 mana</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I personally did think that group quiessence would be kinda overstepping intially. Since we are not the masters of healing, nor should we ever be. Clerics have this title. A moderate say 100 hp/tick COULD be good although it would again increase the number of spell slots. <br />

Im going to post this spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3291&amp;source=Live) that beastlords get.  Now, I KNOW that this is an AA.  The reason that I bring it up is because I dont think that giving us a 100hp/tic group regen when out HYBRID gets a 200hp/tic regen (I KNOW its an AA, I KNOW its on a 15 minute timer..really I do) is quite right.  If we are going to get any type of group regen spell I think that it should be on par with ..say...CE.  <br />
<br />
And I'm going to say &quot;Yay&quot; to Henora for pointing out the disparity in mana regen rates and forms.  I had never really considered it from other angles before, and thank you for crystalizing some of the problems that I had running around in the back of my noodle.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you.  It makes it even more of a slap in the face that the spell also grants 80 mana per tick for 6 ticks.  That is 480 mana and 1200 hp for the entire group in 30 seconds.  After seeing the druid aa Spirit of Wood, the Beastlord aa Paragon of Spirit, and Paladin group heals...I scratch my head wondering how Shaman's got left out without any form of group heal. <br />
<br />
 I was playing a cleric when torpor was introduced into the game, so I remember that it was a unique ability to Shaman until clerics got the Celestial line of spells.  I feel that a group heal over time is long over due for Shaman's and it should be at least on par with Ethereal Elixir, to stay in line with the efficiency of Torpor compared to Celestial Elixir.  Even if it roots and slows the entire group by 30%, it would still be more useful than anything we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Yeah sucks Beastlords do get that, but I imagine it was to give them extra raid appeal/group appeal to enable them to get groups on par with other classes. <br />
<br />
I don't think we want a raid appeal of MGBing a group quiessence, like Sharok above I would prefer a unique ability. For groups though, although group quiessence would be nice, a 100hp/heal tick over the group would be great. Maybe combine the 100hp/heal a tick with a cure and then we have more of a Shamanny like spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirit of the Raven, Similar to soe only Sow+levi+atk. we were the first to get sow...and we STILL DONT HAVE AN UPGRADE! christ how about a sow with a 1hr duration? how about a scooby snack?<br />
<br />
Dog dog that comes with Sow **** you cheap basterds this should have been in game when ANTONICA WAS NEW!<br />
<br />
Double attack aa. yes I still mellee at 65 damnit.<br />
<br />
<br />
aa gate is an awesome idea.<br />
<br />
upgrade to the cani line would be sweet, either a bigger one or one with a significant ratio increase.<br />
<br />
ae malo type spell, maybe not unresistable but one with a mod tacked on.<br />
<br />
a new ae dot. does anyone else just wanna fall down laughing whenever some 60+ necro/shamy mob casts that dumbass lvl 19ish ae dot on the party? yeah time for an upgrade to that line.<br />
<br />
a mana buff, tack it onto acumen, or bear form, or make it a new spell, but damnit give me some form of mana regen besides the endless cani.<br />
<br />
a Dot that ticks agro reduction for us, one with a recast like a poison dot...nevermind, thats just stupid.<br />

<br />
NO!  Shaman have had restrictiosn on good heals since Torpor was introduced.  With Torp, it was snare/slow.  With incomplete heals it was greatly reduced healing power relative to druids.  Quiscience is what Topr should have been (IMO)  Lets talk about possible spell ideas but damn it do NOT try and hamstring yourself! <br />
<br />
Have you heard people bitch and moan when you Torp them?  Can you imagine what 5 people doing that at once would be like?  Even casters give me crap about tossing a torp on them, even if it saves their worthless lives.  If Torp went to a group version with snare/slow in place it would not change ot healing abilities at all.  We would not be allowed to use it during raids (except in downtime), it would be foolish to use them in an exp group setting (except in downtime).  I dont NEED a downtime healing boost; I need a combat healing boost.  Chain casting Tnargs in order to prop up a group when things get dicey is NOT effective healing.  Being out of action for 10 seconds to cast a 2K heal is NOT effective healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">They can't give Shamans a Group-Torpor. <br />
You could MGB an unresistable Slow/Snare, which will never happen(Yes, even though you can click it off).<br />
<br />
Don't worry about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">They CAN do it, and thats what worries me.  They did it with single target Torpor and later, with stoicism.  And since it appears to be SOE's MO to give shaman gimped heals it is a very real possibilty.<br />
<br />
Im just sayign be very carefull with what you ask for.  I hear people say now that they wouldnt care if they got a group heal that snared/slowed the group as long as they got a group heal, but the day after its release the shaman on this board would be up in arms complaining about it.  (You know its true)  If youa re going to ask for it, ask for what you want.  It is not outside the bounds of reason that Devs might just read threads like this on boards like this looking for new spell ideas for upcoming expansions.  <br />
<br />
But always be carefull with how you say you want things.  People said that monks were too powerfull and they sould be nerfed.  And they were...their abilities were mitigated to almost uselessness.  Though they have had a rollback to original abilities, the sting is still there.  Dont ask for something that you will settle for...ask for what you WANT.</div></div><hr />

Spells<br />
Better heal -comparable with druids<br />
lil better nuke -just let me break 1000 with out mods<br />
Improve on Billy - faster run, maybe comparable to bard speed<br />
something that gives mana to our groups - comparable with bst spells (they are after all part shaman, why can't we give candy to our groups?)<br />
better slow- less cast time, less resists, i dunno.  we need to move on from lvl 51<br />
Pet buff - like a focus/haste combo<br />
<br />
AAs<br />
-Crit DoT ticks<br />
-Spell Resist Blanket (an AA that makes all your -spells less likely to be resisted by blah, blah, and blah%)<br />
-and the ultimate AA... Unresistable slow.  No exceptions.   Maybe not a full 75% slow, but unresistable.  So it costs 50AA and it refreshes every half hour... that will work   =)</div></div><hr />

This is a wish list thread.  These are spells and spell ideas that shaman would 'like' to see happen.  This is not a list of demands or an attempt to stage a 'sit it' at the Nexus stone in PoK untill we get it.  <br />
<br />
What you see here are proposals and debates of spell ideas.   Your contention that everyone that posts to this thread is either physically or mentally challenged (a remark that will endear you to no one, rest assured) is not helpfull.  If you want to be constructive, highlight what spells or ideas you find problematic and point out your reasons why.  <br />

If you dont want to help, go back to your hole, troll (no offence intended to our green brethren out there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">-and the ultimate AA... Unresistable slow.  No exceptions.   Maybe not a full 75% slow, but unresistable.  So it costs 50AA and it refreshes every half hour... that will work   =)<br />
<br />
As much fun as it sounds like to have an unresistable slow, I would not be in line to ask for it.  Why?  Unresistable slows will lead very quickly to more mobs that are flagged completely immune to slow.  This isnt like the Malo line, where unresistable is ok and SOE just jacks up the resist mods that mobs have. An increase in non slowable mobs means a decrease in our overall effectiveness.  I'm not saying that we cannot be effective against unslowable mobs; we still have some of the best debuffs in the game which go a long way to helping take mobs down.  But a shaman that cannot slow is working at only 75% effective level.  (I have not done tests on that; I pulled 75% out of the air as a good number to work with.)<br />
<br />
As many different ways that I look at it and as many different opinions are expressed I only see one direction of out slows moving to.  It has been almost universally agreed that 75% is as good as slow in EQ is going to get.  What constitues a &quot;better&quot; slow now is cast time, mana cost, recast time, and resist modifier.<br />
<br />
While a 1.5 sec cast time like Sha's Legacy might be too much for Sony to handle, 2 secs is not.  That saves us full second on the cast.  The recast could be 2 seconds as well.  Knock 75 to 100 off the mana cost and toss on a -50 to 60 resist mod and then we are talking about a good upgrade.  Because, lets face it, when your best ability gets put onto a clicky you NEED to get an upgrade.  Clerics had CH tossed onto a BP; asside from the nastiness that happened because of that decision, clerics were given different heals that were faster/more efficient in compensation.  Is it too much for the shaman community to be tossed the same bone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was playing a wizard, the familiar used a buff icon, just like any other self-only mana regen buff.  And many classes get those, including druids, clerics, necros, and probably a few I am forgetting.</div></div><hr />
