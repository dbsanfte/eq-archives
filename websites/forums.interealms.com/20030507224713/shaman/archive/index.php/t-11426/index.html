<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deehoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man its hard being a newbie again. I havent played in years, and decided to start a troll shaman. Im level 6 and am still using the newb tunic and weapon. I dont see how anyone who doesnt have acess to twink gear (like myself) could ever be able to level a shaman. Props to those who did it the hard way.<br />
Now anyone have any strats for leveling? groups are scarce, and nobody is ever around to save me if i get into trouble. Im lookin for a hunting scene a little more stable than ecommons (guards and lions are my enemys=/). Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm...maybe try the moon somewhere?  Somewhere where your not KOS at least heh :)  As for getting gear, maybe try getting somewhere where you can kill some spiderlings  for exp and collect silks while you're at it to sell in the Bazaar. Can make a nice profit off it, for your level at least.  Also, you can make a lot of cash vendor farming, just keep a look out for the good items :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you have Luclin, do you have PoP?<br />
<br />
If you have PoP, get to PoK and then hit Feerott, via the portal.  Kill the Lizards and Froggy Tads for Netted and Mesh armors. (yeah they suck, but are free, and fill up those slots)  You can get a full set in about 30 mins of exp'ing.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have Luclin, and PoP, get to Shar Vahl (sp).  Hunt in Shadeweavers thicket (after soulbinding in city), and then at 9th (sow) head to Paludal Caverns, and hunt at the Shadeweavers zone area.  I soloed a Mage from 7 to 12 here in about 2 hours.  Oh btw look for the armor quests in Shadeweavers; some of it is pretty nice for lower levels.  Then with all the plat you will make  ;)  goto the Bazaar and get some upgrades.  Saw a Rygorr Mail for 25pp the other night...there are many deals to be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, when i did it, i started in everfrost.  everfrost is wonderful, the gnoll pups and goblin whelps drop containers.  jump on everything with a rusty weapon, collect pelts, etc.  at level 6 you can probably solo at the top levels of blackburrow easy enough, and the zonelines are close just in case.  <br />
<br />
good luck!  and please don't resort to begging.  i'd hate to have to dislike you ;).</div></div><hr />

Perseverance will make you tougher in the end. I was totally broke until in my late 20s when I soloed wooly mammoths in EF for money. Their tusks sell for 8-10pp and it's the damn best money you can make at that level. Those tusks helped me pay for the dufrenite for a few pieces of totemic armor and for some my spells. At 49+ you can solo the IGs for moola and at 60+ you can do PoG for really nice cash. Yea it's a long road as a nontwink but you'll get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did all sorts of things for money as a newb.  When I hit 9, I took off for Crushbone, and sold the belts there until I left at 14.<br />
<br />
From there, I took up hunting Bears for HQ pelts and buying them, then reselling them to a tailor in my guild.  He paid me in coin and/or bags, which I resold.<br />
<br />
At 20, I moved into Cazic Thule (not reccomended nowadays ;) ) and made a lot of coin buying fine steel for 3 pp each, then selling it in nearby Oggok, my home town, for fine money.<br />
<br />
My next wacky scheme was the Gatorsmash Maul quest, selling those over and over again, as well as the Dragoon Dirks which sometimes drop off D`Vinn and always off K`Rynn (does he even still exist?  I saw the Beastlord guild is over there now).  I also made some money looting excess crude steins off ogre guards (lore and used to be common as dirt).<br />
<br />
Then, I went into alchemy heavily and actually sustained myself by becoming one of the only gate potion sellers on the server.  At the time, there was a fair demand for them.<br />
<br />
Plus, Gornit and then Seafuries on the way to 50, spent a lot of time in OOT.<br />
<br />
Why the heck am I so poor now?  Oh, yeah.  Spells.  (rolls eyes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Concentrate on farming trade skill items.  These can be sold in the bazaar for quite high prices.<br />
<br />
Stay away from Crushbone - killing Crushbone orcs gives you bad faction with your home town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't give up!  I play a troll shaman on Zeb and I love it.  <br />
<br />
The posts from others here are solid information.  The only thing I might add is that SoW potions are not as profitable as they used to be due to the bazaar.  What used to sell for 100pp is now selling for 70pp and even lower.  Not to mention, there are hundreds of them for sale at any given time.  Tradeskill loot is your best bet early in the game.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons I think that Trolls make the best Shaman is their innate regen.  When you get Cannibalize, your main source of mana will come from wincing.  With the built-in regen, you'll be able to generate more mana.  If you stack your bear form, with your regen spell, and your innate regen, you're getting a lot of hp per tick.  Because of this I am hardly ever ever out of mana.  My hp bar climbs very rapidly.  <br />
<br />
Moving on, you're probably a follower of Inny.  (I think you have to be, forgive me if I'm mistaken on this.)  If you are, then you need need need to do those Symbol of Innoruuk quests which take place mostly in Neriak.  This is a neck piece that casts darkness as a clicky effect when worn.  It is a soloers dream!  Look up the quests and do them all, the last one is called a Regent Symbol of Innoruuk.  I'm level 51 and I still use mine.  <br />
<br />
On Zeb, Troll Shaman are rare.  I've met a lot of folks who didn't even know that Trolls could be Shaman.  It's a pretty cool feeling to know that you're not like everyone else.  Not to mention, the Troll Shaman is the most despicable, hate filled, evil, monstrous, vindictive, and downright nasty character in the game (according to Verant).  To me, that's pretty cool.  <br />
<br />
In short, imho, shaman are arguably the most versatile, independent, and capable characters in the game.  I've played a Pally, a Wiz, a Cleric, and some others, and I've never been as satisfied with my play experience as I am with Big Green.  After learning from the veterans here on this board, I was able to equip my shaman in such a way that makes him as hard as a cockroach to kill.  And if I don't want to group, I can solo just as easily and do quite well.  Personally, I think that the Shaman is way undderrated.  They are much more powerful and versitile than they get credit for.  <br />
<br />
So, play this guy out for a while.  I think you'll be quite satisfied once you get to know him.  If you're on the Zeb server, give me a tell. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What home town?  He's a troll.<br />
<br />
Sorry had to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol.  That reminds me.  Always charge frogs for buffs.  I charge triple.  ;)  Let their blessing from Marr be a curse on them.  I'll be going on a frog-only diet now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i like using the shar vahl portal and hunting in their newbie zone. tons of shadling silks drop that sells pretty well to crafters.  even more mobs than everfrost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hello, I am on the server called Luclin and I was wondering how much I could sell a stack of these spiderling silks for. I am still working on my newbie quests and  Iam a froggy. Sorry , that you hate me but I just got EQ and it looked pretty cool to be a frog. <br />
<br />
BTW, in all seriousness who's regenration is the best? Iksars? Trolls? Frogs? Thanks for any tips , I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know that frogs get regen, but I may be mistaken, it would make sense that they get a bit of it.<br />
<br />
trolls and iksars are the same regen.</div></div><hr />
