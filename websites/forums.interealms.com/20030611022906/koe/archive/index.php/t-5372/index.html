<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stumpp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1"># 9 A man is in a hotel lobby. He wants to ask the clerk a question. As he <br />
turns to go to the front desk, he accidentally bumps into a woman beside him <br />
and as he does, his elbow goes into her breast. They are both startled and <br />
he says, &quot;Ma'am, if your heart is as soft as your breast, I know you'll <br />
forgive me.&quot; She replies, &quot;if your penis is as hard as your elbow, I'm in <br />
room 1221.&quot; <br />

# 8 A young man walks up and sits down at the bar. &quot;What can I get you?&quot; the <br />
bartender inquires. &quot;I want 6 shots of Jagermeister,&quot; responded the young <br />
man. &quot;6 shots?!? Are you celebrating something?&quot; &quot;Yeah, my first blowjob.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, in that case, let me give you a 7th on the house.&quot; &quot;No offence, sir. <br />
But if 6 shots won't get rid of the taste, nothing will.&quot; <br />

#7 A businessman boards a flight and is lucky enough to be seated next to an <br />
absolutely gorgeous woman. They exchange brief hellos and he notices she is <br />
reading a manual about sexual statistics. He asks her about it and she <br />
replies, &quot;This is a very interesting book about unusual statistics. It <br />
identifies that American Indians have the longest average penis and Polish <br />
men have the biggest average diameter. By the way, my name is Jill. What's <br />
yours?&quot; He coolly replies, &quot;Tonto Kawalski, nice to meet you.&quot; <br />

# 6 One night, as a couple lay down for bed, the husband gently taps his <br />
wife on the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm. The wife turns over and <br />
says: &quot;I'm sorry honey, I've got a gynaecologist appointment tomorrow and <br />
want to stay fresh.&quot; The husband, rejected, turns over and tries to sleep. A <br />
few minutes later, he rolls back over and taps his wife again. This time he <br />
whispers in her ear: &quot;Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow too?&quot; <br />

# 5 Bill worked in a pickle factory. He had been employed there for a number <br />
of years when he came home one day to confess to his wife that he had a <br />
terrible compulsion. He had an urge to stick his penis into the pickle <br />
slicer. His wife suggested that he should see a sex therapist to talk about <br />
it, but Bill indicated that he'd be too embarrassed. He vowed to overcome <br />
the compulsion on his own. One day a few weeks later, Bill came home <br />
absolutely ashen. His wife could see at once that something was seriously <br />
wrong. &quot;What's wrong, Bill?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do you remember that I told you how <br />
I had this tremendous urge to put my penis into the pickle slicer?&quot; &quot;Oh, <br />
Bill, you didn't.&quot; &quot;Yes, I did.&quot; &quot;My God, Bill, what happened?&quot; &quot;I got <br />
fired.&quot; &quot;No, Bill. I mean, what happened with the pickle slicer?&quot; &quot;Oh...she <br />
got fired too.&quot; <br />

# 4 A man was visiting his wife in hospital where she has been in a coma for <br />
several years. On this visit he decides to rub her left breast instead of <br />
just talking to her. On doing this she lets out a sigh. The man runs out and <br />
tells the doctor who says this is a good sign and suggests he should try <br />
rubbing her right breast to see if there is any reaction. The man goes in <br />
and rubs her right breast and this brings a moan. From this, the doctor <br />
suggests that the man should go in and try oral sex, saying he will wait <br />
outside as it is a personal act and he doesn't want the man to be <br />
embarrassed. The man goes in then comes out about five minutes later, white <br />
as a sheet and tells the doctor his wife is dead. The doctor asks what <br />
happened to which the man replies: &quot;She choked.&quot; <br />

# 3 A guy walks into a bar with a pet alligator by his side. He puts the <br />
alligator up on the bar. He turns to the astonished patrons. &quot;I'll make you <br />
a deal. I'll open this alligator's mouth and place my genitals inside. Then <br />
the gator will close his mouth for one minute. He'll then open his mouth and <br />
I'll remove my unit unscathed. In return for witnessing this spectacle, each <br />
of you will buy me a drink.&quot; The crowd murmured their approval. The man <br />
stood up on the bar, dropped his trousers, and placed his privates in the <br />
alligator's open mouth. The gator closed his mouth as the crowd gasped. <br />
After a minute, the man grabbed a beer bottle and rapped the alligator hard <br />
on the top of its head. The gator opened his mouth and the man removed his <br />
genitals unscathed as promised. The crowd cheered and the first of his free <br />
drinks were delivered. The man stood up again and made another offer. &quot;I'll <br />
pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try&quot;. A hush fell over the crowd. <br />
After awhile, a hand went up in the back of the bar. A woman timidly spoke <br />
up. &quot;I'll try, but you have to promise not to hit me on the head with the <br />
beer bottle&quot;. <br />

# 2 A small white guy goes into an elevator, when he gets in he notices a <br />
huge black dude standing next to him. The big black dude looks down upon the <br />
small white guy and says: &quot;7 foot tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch dick, 3 pound <br />
left ball, 3 pound right ball, Turner Brown&quot; The small white guy faints!! <br />
The big black dude picks up the small white guy and brings him to, slapping <br />
his face and shaking him and asks the small white guy. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;. The <br />
small white guy says; &quot;Excuse me but what did you say?&quot;. The big black dude <br />
looks down and says &quot;7 foot tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch dick, 3 pound left <br />
ball, 3 pound right ball, my name is Turner Brown.&quot; The small white guy <br />
says, &quot;Thank god, I thought you said 'Turn around. '&quot; <br />

# 1 There was this couple who had been married for 50 years. They were <br />
sitting at the breakfast table one morning when the old gentleman said to <br />
his wife, &quot;Just think, honey, we've been married for 50 years.&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; she <br />
replied, &quot;Just think, fifty years ago we were sitting here at this breakfast <br />
table together.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; the old man said, &quot;We were probably sitting here <br />
naked as jaybirds fifty years ago.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Granny snickered, &quot;What do you <br />
say...should we get naked?&quot; Where upon the two stripped to the buff and sat <br />
down at the table. &quot;You know, honey,&quot; the little old lady breathlessly <br />
replied,&quot;My nipples are as hot for you today as they were fifty years ago.&quot; <br />
&quot;I wouldn't be surprised,&quot; replied Gramps. &quot;One's in your coffee and the <br />
other is in your oatmeal!!!!</div></div><hr />
