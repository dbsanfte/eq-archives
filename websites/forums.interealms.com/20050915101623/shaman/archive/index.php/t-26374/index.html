<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have cancelled my EQ account. My current subscription expires on May 30th, kind of ironic that's the day they Tunare and Eci server mergers scheduled.<br />
<br />
EQ has lost it's luster for me. The thought of grinding through another zone, keying and flagging another new zone makes me physically nauseous. <br />
<br />
Since the release of DoN I've been so dishearted by EQ, DoN is nothing but LDoN revisited. Many aspects of the game dynamics are lacking.  The increase in the alchemy cap, foraged components for potions, BL's getting equivalent slows, pallies healing better then us, and this announcement of a server mergers was the final nail in the coffin. EQ is imploding. They've lost the faith of their customers. They've been top dog for too long and have become complacent. They can't compete with the new games and are scrambling and playing catchup. <br />
<br />
I've logged on a couple times this last month to chat with friends, but I just cannot bring myself to play. It's time for Ougabouga to retire.  Farewell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've only been playing EQ a year.  I enjoy the game.  Maybe it's because I haven't had to grind for years and years, and everything is still fresh and new to me.<br />
<br />
I was hoping they wouldn't merge my server (quellious) but they are.  It's ok though, because there is a TON of content I still haven't seen and so many things to do.<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you are leaving, but for me there is so much more I want to do and see in game.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you whatever you do.</div></div><hr />

It just gets old after awhile is all. I just came back to the game and I've been playing since day 1. I've quit twice over the years but I have to admit this time coming back has been as fun as the game originally was. So much content has been added for the better and the game has changed for the betetr in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Take care, Ouga, I hope you have fun wherver you decide to go.<br />
<br />
Denorea, havn't really seen you around before that I can recall, should send me a tell or something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Take care Ouga... miss seeing you around!  You were one of my inspirations as a younger shaman... going to an alliance Ixiblat Fer raid and seeing you slow it after my younger slow bounced, that was one of my goals: I WILL SLOW THAT OVERSIZE FIREBALL SOMEDAY!  Yes, long ago, when it took a raid to take him down :p   Yes have slowed him since, a few times (and darn near soloed him (an enthusiastic monk jumped in)) but the memory remains!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best of luck Ouga. I left 5 months ago for EQ2 and have just enjoyed not having to grind and grind and grind. I haven't looked back, though I do miss a lot of my old friends and of course Dogdog too. :(<br />
<br />
I'll never forget those fun times we had when HBA and SoD got together and helped each other knock off our epics. I still remember you getting yours and how excited you were. Those were really fun times. :)<br />
<br />
Take care and I hope whatever path you choose next brings you as much fun as EQ once did.</div></div><hr />

Hey Dirkin~<br />
<br />
I've seen you around here and there, though I have been called an elitist because I tend to only group with my guildmates.  I dread pickups.<br />
<br />
I saw you the other day in the guild lobby, and if I see you around I'll say hi.  Always good to have another shaman to chat with.  :D <br />
