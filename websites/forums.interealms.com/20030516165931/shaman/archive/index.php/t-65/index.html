<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I managed to get allied with the alchemist and trainer - do the Trade Commisioner about 5 or 6 times. There are also 2 delivery quests from the Bazaar to Shadowhaven - one is given by the alchemist to deliver something to one of the 2 gnomes in the back-corner behind the bank. He will give you something to take back to the alchemist.<br />
<br />
The other is a delivery from the dwarf ore vendor to the other gnome in the bazaar - back-corner behind the other bank.  That gnome has a continuation of the quest - but I didn't bother with it.<br />
<br />
If you do the deliveries in the right order you can do the cycle really fast - it took me 2 hours to get to allied - and I bound at the bazaar so I could just gate back after Fungus grove.</div></div><hr />
