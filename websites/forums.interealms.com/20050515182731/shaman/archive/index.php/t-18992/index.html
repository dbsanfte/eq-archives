<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been awhile since I've posted much less spent anytime in the game.  Burn out, Guild blowup, friends, and family dropping out to play FF, DAOC, Horizon's, anything but a SOE based game ... it's been a sad past 6 months.   But I could not pass up a chance at my 2 cents on GoD spells.<br />
<br />
Personnally, I would rather see a few more spells upgraded from the middle of our spell books.  Last expansion, there were a number of spells ran through test/beta as trial balloons gauging feedback from testers and general public.   Out of the process, we got Tears of Saryrn as a useful upgrade for Torrent of Poison - AE Rain (some note this is the best damage per mana spent for our class - so not a bad spell really).<br />
<br />
So why not take Balance of the Nihil and turn it into something like &quot;Mist of Nihil&quot; as a AE upgrade to Tigir's Insects.   Why you ask ... because Tigir's gets resisted like crazy, hard to figure out which was hit or resisted , and a Disease based AE Slow with high resist adjusts would help doing adventures.<br />
<br />
Compare Tigir's Insects <br />
  <br />

<br />
~to~<br />
<br />
Mist of the Nihil  <br />
  <br />

<br />
Other ideas for spell upgrades ... <br />
<br />
1).  Cripple upgrade that targets STR, AGI, DEX, AC along adding a STA debuff<br />
2).  Infectious Cloud upgrade for a Disease based AE area effect with no inital DD <br />
<br />
3). Or either a Poison or Cold Direct Damage PB AE - high mana and long recast.  Ok maybe it's a play toy but it would be really nice to blast more than 4 targets at a time like our fellow priest classmates.   <br />
<br />
Something like:<br />
<br />
Blue Northern or Acid Bath<br />
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 850<br />
Mana: 650 Skill: Evocation <br />
Casting Time: 6 Recast Time: 24 <br />
Fizzle Time: 6 Resist: Cold or Poison<br />
Resist Adjust -10 Location: Any <br />
Time of Day: Any AE Range 35</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1).  Cripple upgrade that targets STR, AGI, DEX, AC along adding a STA debuff<br />
I don't believe NPCs are effected by Stamina. Buffing your pet does not increase it's HP. If a mob's HP *can* be effected by STA buffs, debuffing their STA would also decrease their HP, which would indirectly cause this new spell to do damage to the mob. I personally wouldn't like to see the change, because it would more than likely break mez.<br />
<br />
My first thought is to ask for SOE to add an upgraded Cripple with ATK debuffs on it, but that now seems to be the realm of the Druids. In addition to ATK debuffs, they also have resist and AC debuffs (pretty nice ones, too) - E'ci's Frosty Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3442&amp;source=Live), Immolation of Ro (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3437&amp;source=Live), Ro's Illumination (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3440&amp;source=Live), Hand of Ro (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3435&amp;source=Live). The thing about these spells is that most of them have a resist adjustment or a DoT tied to them. Hand of Ro has a -200 Fire resist adjustment AND it decreases Fire resists by 72. And it stacks with Malo(s). E'ci doesn't stack with Ro's Illumination, but everything else stacks with each other. If you add up all the Ro spells, you get a total of -57 AC, -180 ATK, -107 SV Fire, and -1400 HP over a minute. Substitute E'ci for RI and you have -66 AC, -100 ATK, -107 SV Fire, and -55 SV Cold. By comparison, with Cripple, Malos, and Malicious Decay, we have -70 DEX, -80 AGI, -80 STR, -34 AC, and roughly -55 to all saves. And we all know that debuffing stats doesn't have near as much effect as directly debuffing AC and ATK.<br />
<br />
If they are going to give Druids low-resist debuffs and debuff/DoT combos, there's no reason why they can't either combine Cripple with a small DoT or give us a low-resist debuff that is a combo of Cripple, Malx, and/or ID. Turgur's and Malos are easily the most useful debuffs in the game, but I feel like Druid debuffs are a little too close for comfort. They already have better DPS and healing than us and buffs that are on par with ours in usefulness. Do they really need to have that many low resist combo debuffs and debuff/dots as well?<br />

Edited second paragraph so that it was a little more clear. :p<br />
