<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some friends and I are forming a low level group to hunt in LDoN dungeons.  We all have level 50 characters that will be hunting in LDoN but wanted to see the difference on how the instancing works with lower levels.<br />
<br />
One friend has made a high elf enchanter and the other friend has made a warrior (he will not tell us the race).  I 2-box.  I have made a barb beastlord and want to make either ogre or troll shaman.  Troll has the regen and snare necklace.  Ogre has the lesser xp penalty, better melee stats and has the front unstunnable.<br />
<br />
I currently 2-box a level 50 barb shaman and bot a 52 dwarf warrior.  I just love the shaman.  I can't believe I had spent so much time with the shaman as the bot before level 44.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am leaning toward the ogre because I like meleeing but is the troll's regen and snare necklace better for a dungeon group?  I have never missed snare with my 50's duo until I started fighting in Dhulag but I make up for it by rooting a lot.<br />
<br />
I wanted to get your thoughts on troll versus ogre shaman for a low level dungeon crawl group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say pre-44, the Troll regen's going to be a huge factor in your mana production, probably making Troll a better choice.<br />
<br />
The better your HoT gets, the less of a difference it makes, and the more attractive the Ogre becomes.  Err, well... figuratively.<br />
<br />
Honestly, both are good choices.  Flip a coin or go with whatever you feel like.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, go with whichever you like the look of most ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ogres &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cats are soft furry things (yuck), Barbs wear skirts and paint their face (nuff said), Iksars are basically reptilians that barely know how to walk on 2 legs and Trolls are just plain uggly!<br />
<br />
The only sensible choice is the beautiful, unstunnanble Ogre!<br />
<br />
OGRE POWAH!!<br />
<br />
 ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
On a serious note, I would like regen from Iksar/Troll - but I hate being stunned - wouldnt change if I could.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went with Ogre.  Thanks for the postings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as much as I love my barb.. when I look back now I wish that I would have picked the ogre... only for the frontal stun immunity.  That is a GODSEND while soloing alot of things.<br />
<br />
On the other side.. I don't like the way that they look... however I might have been able to get past that for frontal stun immunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As much as I firmly believe Iksar &gt; All, I would kill for stun immunity.  /mutter</div></div><hr />

cause Paladins can hear a zipper a mile away...<br />

Do you know why Shaman's turn into bears?<br />
cause Paladins can smell a Goat from across the zone.</div></div><hr />
