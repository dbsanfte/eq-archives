<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that I should really be emailing SOE about this, but hopefully someone can help me out.<br />
<br />
Due to a Credit card issue  I managed to get into the situation where I now have all the LoY files on my computer but was not enabled on my account. I have now just been to the SOE website and purchased LOY.<br />
<br />
I'm at work at the moment, and I'm one of those really impatient people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will this now mean that when I go home and log into EQ it'll say that I have all expansions enabled? Or will I have to wait a while, or do something else?<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

In the other expansions, you had to enter a CD-Key into your account, but this one is an expansion in the ether...</div></div><hr />
