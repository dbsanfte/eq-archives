<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple questions...<br />
<br />
I asked this in the Crucible chat and got some different answers...<br />
<br />
'When on a horse, are you always meditating or only when standing still'<br />
<br />
And...<br />
<br />
'If I have the buff Icon for the horse, am I getting the benefits for it?'<br />
<br />
(I had graphics turned off, had buff icon for horse, but still ran SoW speed and could sit/stand)<br />
<br />
And that's it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">only when standing still, when you're running its regular standing mana regen...<br />
<br />
yes, if your have the buff icon it means u are getting the benefits, its bugged so your mana bar doesnt update unless you using a clicky item or until you cast a spell, but the mana difference is very noticeable especially with kei :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You get the mana benifit when you are not moving, and you are not attacking.  Clicking the JBB works just fine thow.<br />
<br />
It is also clear that SOE does not want poeple using the horse with the grpahpics turned off so why push it.  I consider it exploiting a bug.<br />
<br />
The only reason to turn the graphics off is becuase the horse is<br />
a) slower then SoW<br />
b) has start and stop delay<br />
c) can make it harder to loot unless you shrink 2x<br />
d) no ducking to interupt spell casting<br />
<br />
It only takes 3 seconds to cast a horse.  Just click the ikon off and do your running around / pulling and the put the horse back up for the duration of the battle.  It is not like you get any benifit from the horse when you are running around anyway and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are not exploiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The coolest part about having a horse is being able to med and JBB at the same time.  That's why I bought it.  I now find that I'm at 60% after a fight that I used to be at 20-25% after.  <br />
<br />
Is there any way to interrupt casting on a horse?  /dismount doesn't work and you can't duck..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Click off the horse icon and duck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">humm..  /dismount then duck just work fine for me. if there is an emergency that is what i do.. <br />
<br />
other way i just move a bit to interrupt the spell and wait the  end of the casting to be able to cast another one.<br />
<br />
a macro might help if you /dism a lot :)<br />
<br />
of course click off the icon works just fine too.. but as i have tiny icons, sometimes i click off the wrong one :) like KEI or focus. kind of embarassing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just so I get this right....  If you are on a horse and standing still, you can cast spells and still be medding at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does that mean you  have to have horse models switched on to notice the medding while standing or not? I got confused :o And just bought back my horse after realising slowing spiders in PoN without being able to sit and med is just too nasty without one so I want to know for certain this time ;)</div></div><hr />
