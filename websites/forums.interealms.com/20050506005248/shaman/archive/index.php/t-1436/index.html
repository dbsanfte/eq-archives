<br />
[Sun May 05 18:42:50 2002] You feel focused. <br />
<br />
WOULD suck if you didnt MGB focused yourself ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh I was the first person in that guild with MGB, Fatsow. :)  I recognize most of the names.  Tell Gomorrha to level Sworm's AA points already.<br />
<br />
It's great for bragging rights, but to tell the truth, I don't use it often at all.  By the time everyone is assembled for most raids, simple group focus has already been applied several times, sometimes by several shamans, and there's not much point to doing MGB.<br />
<br />
It's great for getting things going quickly on a wipe-out, though.  IF...everybody is rezzed.  But usually, rezzes are spread out over several or a dozen minutes or longer, so again, the use of MGB is pretty limited.<br />
<br />
It's really great for clerics though, who have more mana problems than we do and have to pay for and carry stones for buffs.</div></div><hr />
