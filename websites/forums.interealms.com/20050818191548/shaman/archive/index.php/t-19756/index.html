<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bumblesnot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, prior to the release of LOY my troll shaman was kos to neriak after killing forrest guards.Until now I wasn't too bothered as I could use the POK library for my spell needs. Am I mistaken or was there an npc introduced to correct my bad faction. Any help on this subject would be great.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what bad faction?  Why do you need faction in Neriak?<br />
<br />
Neriak is not my home town, it is just where they put the wayfarer dude and the tribute master.<br />
<br />
I had to invis to get ot the wayfarer dude (start of the mini-quest to get the wayfarer stone).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tribute master for trolls is in the FQ - guards there (trolls, mostly) were just indiff to me.  <br />
<br />
Never heard of a way to &quot;fix&quot; faction when the government assigned ya to a new place of residence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may have to pay a visit to elf land and start killing prisoners in Crushbone.  Been ages since I worked on Neriak faction.   Also there is the Wine Quest you could do.  Just go to the 3rd gate, get a pal to by you a bag of red wine, Turn it in to a guy in the library (even KOS i dont think he attacks)  till he gives you good faction so you can buy wine yourself.   This might take like 5 bags of red wine.<br />
<br />
I know Iskar used to do this quest more but I can't seem to remember the name of it.  Ill see if i can find a link somewhere.<br />
<br />
PS im told the Red wine guys name is Lokar ToBiath. Hes in a room to your left as you enter the Library.  its a closed door so you wont get aggro from other people.  IF you are KOS to him you may have to go to elf land and get non KOS then do the wine quest. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have mentioned this before, but it is worth repeating....due to this move, trolls and other dark races that ruined neriak faction have sucessfully petitioned to get their neriak faction restored to &quot;newbie status&quot; thing about this is that it resets ALL your faction to that of a brand spanking new troll shaman.....any faction work in Velious, PoP, Luclin, etc is all lost.<br />
Worth it? meh, your call, I dont think so however. PoK and Luclin basically removed all necessity to going to places like Neriak and Freeport unless your starting from scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As I recall, long before even Kunark, the Indigo Brotherhood faction wasnt repairable.  It may have been fixed since LoY. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trolls are still welcome in Oggok, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Trolls are still welcome in Oggok, I think.<br />
<br />
Yep.  Watch out for the Guildmasters though.  I was showing a DE buddy of mine around, and one of (I think) the Guildmasters (halfway up the tunnel that leads to the forge) yelled something about his religion and ate him.  He was fine in the rest of the town though, and with the guards.  Might be some anti-Inny sentiment involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is an npc out in front of Neriak that mentions something about faction.  Think you have to do stoopid quests and give him bits to appease the inkies.<br />
<br />
Dunno, anything shorter than me usually = food.  Would you let a pot roast tell you how to run your life??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just get a full inventory of red wines and have an enchanter charm the guy in the library.<br />
<br />
hand in wines in 4x4 amounts till charm breaks then have the chanter gate.<br />
<br />
by that time you should have high enough faction to do the rest yourself.<br />
<br />
or have the chanter DC the guy and go to lunch while you turn in your bazillion wines.<br />
<br />
that's how i got my iksar necro non KOS in neriak to buy coffins (when it was the only place to get them)</div></div><hr />
