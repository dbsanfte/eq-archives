<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think about it, the decrease in power of a focus effect above it's level is pretty much the same for all the other classes as mitigation on slows for shaman.  <br />
<br />
When anyone complains about the time+ focus effects not being moved up to 70 from 65 but being progressivluy weakened,  tell them that it's just like shaman slows being mitigated.</div></div><hr />

At least they seem to be lubing us up good with other things that SEEM spiffy. Typical &quot;Give em what they want, just not very much of it&quot; attitude, heh.</div></div><hr />
