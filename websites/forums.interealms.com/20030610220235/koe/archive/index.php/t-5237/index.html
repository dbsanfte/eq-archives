<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazzir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My new Pentium 4 - 1.6gzh - 512m rambus - geforce3 will be arriving this weekend. Look out Norrath!<br />
<br />
I want to dual box with just one cable modem and some kind of software to share the connection. I think Windows has connection sharing software built in now, right? Can someone confirm EQ will work like this? Or will I need two seperate modems, two IP addresses, etc?<br />
<br />
Any info links or tips appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have a cable modem (or DSL) I recommend you get a small hub like a Linksys. This is what I had when I had cable and will be using again when I get back on cable. <br />
<br />
You only need one IP address and it is very secure. <br />
<br />
I think a 4 port job like I have runs around $100.<br />
<br />
Works like a champ.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep I just bought my Linksys 4 port cable router at Best Buy for $90 with a $10 rebate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a Cable/DSL Modem Router (they do both) with 4 ports.  That way you only need 1 IP address which the Router will take and it will generate local IP address for your two machines.  As far as models, I use a Linksys, others use SOHO. Not sure which is better.  Either runs EQ just fine.  I avoide using ICS too  much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or you can go ghetto and do like I was doing.  Put two nics in one system and have the other networked up and use internet connection sharing.  You can get a network card for 10 bucks or so now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I second the vote for the Linksys routers.  Very easy to setup and a small, but nice layer of security.  I've set a few of them up (Valfaroth's over ICQ :p ) and they're the easiest I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I &quot;third&quot; the recommendation on the Linksys Router.<br />
<br />
Going strong since I bought it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh my god get a lynksys 4 port router. If you closely follow the Baracus posts, like so many do, you're already aware that my internet prblems stopped when I took Daelen's and Moe's advice on buying one. <br />
<br />
Get a router, get a router, get a router.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazzir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the info guys, I will grab a linksys and avoid software routing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Woot! Ludaian sighting!<br />
<br />
Good to see you swing by bro.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Use a dial up and internet connection sharing myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Never have a problem I could trace back to this setup.  Just be sure you have Win2k or better ( Win98 sucks for connection sharing ), and follow the instructions EXACTLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">man you dont want to 2-box, really, once you do, youll never be able to play single box again....its a bad thing.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use the linksys 4 port router as well. I love it. No problems at all.</div></div><hr />
