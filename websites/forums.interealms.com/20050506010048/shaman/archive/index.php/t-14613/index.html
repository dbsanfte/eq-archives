<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dunno how many of you do this but thought I would share a little tip we use on some raids. When you know you are going to be pulling multiple mobs and they all need to be maloed before slow, we usually have one person on malo hitting them all then the other Shamans slowing. Especially when you get mobs with the same name this works well. The problem you run into is that malos is a 10 second refresh and I want the mobs maloed NOW. So I loaded up malo in addition to malos, I mean they are close enough right? And I made a hotkey that goes<br />
/cast (malos) <br />
/rs Casting MALO on %T<br />
/cast (malo)<br />
<br />
That way no matter what was the last one you just cast, the other one will fire off if the other isn't ready. No waiting on malos refresh. Works for me anyway, the 10 point difference isnt normally a problem.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

&quot;/cast (malos) <br />

/cast (malo)&quot;<br />

I'm probably not reading it correctly. Been one of those days at work. <br />

Well, guess i know what he's saying. If he casted Malos, he will get the spell isn't ready yet message(/cast Malos) and then proceed triggering malo(/cast malo). By then Malos will be refreshed and the next time he hits the hotkey Malos will be triggered(/cast Malos) and he will get the spell isn't ready message for Malo(/cast Malo). <br />
He merely forgot to add that he still keeps targeting the different mobs with his cursor before activating the hotkey, which caused the little misunderstanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You cant cast two spells at once, so If Malos is castable it will cast, and Malo wont.  If Malos isnt ready and Malo is, it will cast.  If niether are ready, then nothing happens at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, that looks to be kinda handy.<br />
<br />
The trick to it is that there's no pause between the two, so if Malos is ready to cast, it'll do so and then tell you you can't cast Malo yet.<br />
<br />
If Malos still hasn't refreshed, you'll get a message about that, then cast Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use both malo and malos on raids for the above reason but I don't have the hotkey like above. I just have two hotkeys one that calls and casts malos and one that calls and casts malo. I just rotate which I click. I have trimmed down my hotkeys so I actually have room for both of them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">very cool.  my question is how do you guys have the spell slots?<br />
<br />
i was main shaman for a good 10 months and had to keep up malos, malosinia, tugurs, tnargs, random spot (often root, ae slow, avatar buff, grc depending, buff slot (kept focus up for the dead mostly), Torpor then Q, and canni<br />
<br />
I just never had spell slots and quit before the quick memorization thing came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Malo(s) multiple incoming targets???<br />
Real shaman just throw a Tirgirs (AE slow) and hope for the best!!! :) <br />
<br />
Haha!<br />
<br />
That's probably why there are so few around... they all got SQUISHED! (see pictorial guide below).<br />
<br />
(_._)   &lt;--- shamans rear-end BEFORE throwing a Tirgir's<br />
<br />
(_O_)  &lt;-- same shamans rear-end about 7 seconds later!</div></div><hr />

OMG ! thats the funniest thing ive ever read ! too bad I had jucie in my mouth.....which is now on my screen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">good tip litchbane, going to pass it along to my guild.<br />
<br />
leave malosinia to the magicians, and some of those other spell slots can be allocated to other shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My spell slot on raids:<br />
<br />
Tnargs<br />
Quiescence<br />
Can 4<br />
Focus or other buff.. switch out slot<br />
Cripple or other debuff/root/nuke/dot whatever situation calls for<br />
Turgurs<br />
Malo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my malos key is a bit difference, just upgrade from my old Malo message key; my old Malo key is like :<br />
<br />
line 1: /chat #shamanchannel or emote message say I start casting Malo and land in 4 second ..<br />
line 2: /cast 2  // mem malo here in old day, and now Malos<br />
line 3: empty, <br />
line 4: /pause 36<br />
line 5: /rs malos message in raid, or guild<br />
<br />
when I mem both malo+malos; I just upgrade my key and it become : <br />
<br />
line 1: /chat #shamanchannel or emote message say I start casting Malo and land in 4 second ..<br />
line 2: /cast 2  // mem malos at slot 2<br />
line 3: /cast 3  // mem Malo at slow 3<br />
line 4: /pause 36<br />
line 5: /rs malos message in raid, or guild<br />
<br />
really, I rarely mem both; most multi pull can use AE slow, or single Malos is enough for name; it good for some hard raid like RZ, which need pull those &quot;black-man&quot; fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good tip.  I use a similar tactic for dueling but never thought to use it for malo/malos.<br />
<br />
Annul and Nullify both have semi-long recast times.  It is easy for someone to hit their clickies when you are just casting annul.  If you chain cast annul/nullify, though, the dispells will be coming fast enough that they won't have time to cast any spells or they will lose their buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I must admit it had never occurred to me to do it that way, but it makes logical sense. Makes allowances for the recast delay and is rather elegant if you are in a &quot;must malo em fast&quot; situation.<br />
<br />
heheh am familiar with the Tigirs diagram above :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dunno how many of you do this but thought I would share a little tip we use on some raids.

Especially when you get mobs with the same name this works well. <br />
<br />
this looks like a good tip, but will someone explain to me why the tactic is good? it must be because so many ppl are using it, but I just can't see why.. in my mind lets say HOH2 you have 4 lions unmezzable comming in, 1 guy is malo/malosing all 4 same named lions while the other shaman (lets say 3 others) are slowing? why doesn't each guy malos and turgurs a mob? We have about 8 shaman at any given raid and that's the strat we use..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you have 8 shaman, then you can say screw tactics.  But if you only have 2 shaman on the job of slowing, then when one hits the Malo hotkey, the other hits a slow hotkey along the lines of..<br />
<br />
&quot;/assist Malo Shaman<br />
/cast turgur<br />
/announce SLOWING %T&quot;<br />
<br />
  And if turgur lands/resists they then plug the appropriate calling hotkey.    This way with only 2 shaman you can slow all the mobs MUCH faster than if each shaman chose their own targets (and quite likely double Malos'd at least 1 of them thus wasting time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">a little off topic, but here is another tip:<br />
<br />
you can also use the double casting for your heals..<br />
<br />
line 1: /say Healing %t - stay close for 10sec.. or die :)<br />
line 2: /cast (heal)<br />
line 3: /cast (heal)<br />
<br />
this will save the &quot;so precious&quot; 1sec you will need to notice that your casting has fizzled and you need to cast it again before your tank dies because your 2nd heal will land .. too late.<br />
<br />
i was quite surprised by the amount of clerics i met that didn't knew about this tip.</div></div><hr />
