Yup, this will do it.   No more lag  :p <br />
Now all i need is about 5k, and I will be all set.<br />

<br />
If you dont know about the new generation of hardware for PCs thats going to come out, they are going to discontinue the AGP slot and bring the PCI Express into mass production on all MBs.   The new graphics cards that are going to come out are going to come with 2 options, either with AGP(8x) or PCI Express(16x) slots.   <br />
<br />
So there is no sense buying the new graphics cards until you get a MB that has PCI Express slots on it.</div></div><hr />

 No use buying a new motherboard just for PCIX when AGP 8x still has not even been filled.  Waste of bandwidth for now maybe in 2 years it will be needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most companies are readying boards for 05 with no agp slots so it may be hard to find an agp slot soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PCI-express, DDR2 and the new intel socket-T are all a big joke about to be forced on the consumer by Intel.<br />
<br />
As stated before, PCI express is not needed at the current time because we have barely scratched the bandwidth of AGP 8x.<br />
<br />
DDR2 is slower and much more expensive than DDR. At least for now. DDR needs to hit 1ghz before it will really be faster.<br />
<br />
The new Socket-T or Tejas is seriously flawed for everyone except Dell.  Enthusiats and system builders alike will morn the day this hits. Not only are the pins on the motherboard but they are SUPPOSE to bend to make contact with cpu. The problem is you only get a handful of cpu installs per motherboard before the pins stop working correctly then you toss the board!  Having 775 small pins next to each other will make for a very bad situation if the un-trained try to install the cpu and a pin bends. Straiting pins on a socket 478, socket a or socket 754 cpu is pretty darn easy if done with care.  Straiting pins on 775 motherboards is gonna be hell.<br />
<br />
The promise of &quot;more bandwidth&quot; of the new technologies is more or less a lame duck. The truth is with serial ata and new chipsets hard drives and ethernet are already off the PCI bus so thats most of what your doing. That leaves pretty much sound, usb and firewire left on the PCI bus and I think they can deal with the 132mb/sec limit of pci.  <br />
<br />
AMD has already solved the bandwidth problem with Hypertransport.  And they did it without forcing people to purchase all new components or shifting problems of bent pins to motherboard makers.  Using all hypertransport links internally and onboard memory controllers means there is no need for pci express or ddr2 anytime soon. <br />
<br />
Times like this makes me glad to have 5 AMD systems in my home.</div></div><hr />
