<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about to hit level 52 with my shaman.  And I wanna try and do something not done before (I hope) and try to One group, or less Either Vox or Naggy.  I was wondering if I could get some pointers on how to make that possible, like what other group members and such to bring ect.  I don't really wanna hear that it *can't* be done, as I'm gonna try whether it can or not.  I'm looking for some ideas on how it might be possible.  like:<br />
<br />
Can Vox or Naggy be Stunned?  I play on Rallos Zek, so a 52 enchanter could use their new ToT spell (from LoY) and steal mana from me while I use the new Stoicism spell (from LoY) to have reletivly infinite mana, to keep one of them stunned for a long time.  Slow, some Melee, a cleric and game over?<br />
<br />
How many hitpoints are we looking at dealing with here, obviously staying power is important.<br />
<br />
What are their DPS?  We need to know how much damage mitigation and healing we need to get.<br />
<br />
Are there focus effects I can get at this level to extend buff duration to make Stoicism more efficient (I already have spell haste 2 and mana prev 2)<br />
<br />
I've never been on a Vox or Naggy raid, which one would be better suited for this kind of attempt.  Are we looking at needing 200+ resists? or can we get by with less.  Obviously we want to avoid any spells we can get hit by, as its damage that can't be mitigated, and if resisted we don't need to heal it either.<br />
<br />
Which Melee classes would be best, DPS vs. Damage mitigation vs. Spell choice possibly even based on disciplines?<br />
<br />
Do we need a cleric? If Vox and Naggy can't be stunned, do we need a chanter? what other classes would provide the best support and or let us survive the battle.  Is it worth it to get a bunch of different types of potions?  What buffs should we try and get before engaging the beast?<br />
<br />
thanks :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would highly suggest going on a regular vox/naggy raid first just to see what you will be dealing with.  As far as info about the dragons, vox is harder due to her C-heals.  I think they are around 30k hps.  If you push naggy into the lava then his regen will skyrocket I have heard(never had that happen).  Don't push vox onto a wall, you won't be able to hit her and she will heal up(had that happen before).  Stun only works to interrupt spells, you can't actually chain stun to keep them from not attacking.  You will need a cleric for sure, but not to do C-heal(will get summoned and ate).  Just Superior Healing works I believe.  That said, I think we get SHeal at 52 but never been to a raid where the shaman was main healer :).  Stoicism is nice and all but against the dragons, don't think it will cut it.  You need all the DPS you can get.  Classes for DPS- rogue, monk(think a 52 BL with new pet is awsome also).  I think you could do with an equipped Pally for a MT, you will probably need the extra healing they can provide(even though it's just a little).<br />
Can't think of anything atm.  Never heard of a single group taking them down but good luck to you :)<br />
<br />
Another question, can they be slowed?  Never found this out.<br />
<br />
*edit* Forgot resists, yes you should try for around 200 if you can.  And make sure that all of you are lvl 52 for you to have a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One group will get eaten pretty fast.  Even with great resists, I seriously doubt that any one group could take down Naggy or Vox.  However, if it were possible, this is the group that I would want (with gear if applicable)<br />
<br />
You want the biggest WARRIOR you can find.  They have the most HP of the tank classes.  he will have to have incredible gear.  Red epic and a Blade of carnage. Max possible haste.  Fire and magic resists should be 200+<br />
<br />
Cleric with biggest mana pool that you could possibly get.  Fire and magic resists 200 plus.  Manastone and a Fungi tunic, with KEI.  Have to chain heal warrior and hope  and pray that cleric doenst get summoned.<br />
<br />
Enchanter to Tap the dragons mana.  Would have to keep calming visage on the cleric, rogues, and wizard and whatever the hate increaser is on the warrior.<br />
<br />
Rogue-best gear possible<br />
<br />
Rogue-best gear possible.<br />
<br />
Wizard-biggest mana pool you can find and FT15. would nuke like hell when Naggy gets to 40 or so.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I would add another 3 or 4 wizards and another rogue or 2, but then that breaks the &quot;1 group&quot; requirement.  Fire and magic resists should be 200ish.<br />
<br />
The smallest force that I ever fought Naggy with was 18.  Smallest Vox was 24.  We had 1 wizard group, 1 rogue group, 1 cleric/shaman group (4 clerics and 1 shaman) and 1 tank group (MA, SA, others.) for Vox.  Naggy warranted TAnk group, Cleric group, and damage (rogue and wizard) groups.  <br />
<br />
This was awhile ago though....with current equipment it might be a little easier, but I still dont think that one group could pull it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matdowns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A guild on our server did that a while back.  They used a ranger to tank Vox.  It was a 5 person group.  Granted the Ranger had dropped from 60+ because of that bug when PoP first came out, but I believe the rest were legit alts.  Definately doable with skilled players. <br />
<br />
I couldn't find the actually news message because they dont seem to archive, but you can find a picture here. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nagafen is MUCH easier than Vox.<br />
<br />
You should have some level 60+ buffers to buff outside of the dispell range. Get your resists thru the roof, and your MTs hp thru the roof too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Nagafen at the weekend, awesome raid, well led and everyone was pretty much on the ball.<br />
<br />
We did it with twelve people. I was main healer of group 2, and I lost one person due to not being able to keep up with a whole group using SHeal.<br />
<br />
To do it with 6, you need a lot of luck and you will all need to be twinked out the wazoo.<br />
<br />
Warrior, cleric, chanter and DPS, DPS, DPS!! Try to get 3 epic rogues :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe bring a bunch of stinging wort potions too? <br />
<br />
Smallest force I ever did Naggy with was 16, 2 of which were level 40 and feared the entire time.  We killed him with a comfortable margin of error using standard boring raid tactics.  I'm sure we could have gone much lower if everyone were 52 and we'd gotten more creative with our tactics.<br />
<br />
I think if I were going to try to 1-group Naggy, I'd bring:<br />
<br />
Paladin - main tank<br />
Cleric - main heal<br />
Bard - singing resists, heals, haste, damage shields, runes, etc<br />
Epic Rogue<br />
Epic Rogue<br />
Epic Rogue<br />
<br />
I'd make sure all resists are so high that the AoE won't even touch you.  If you have a 60+ buffing team standing by outside the lair, that'll help a lot.  Also, stack as much damage shield as you can.  Bard + potion + magician at least.<br />
<br />
Since Naggy can't be slowed, I'm sad to say I don't think I'd bring a shaman.  But if I did bring one, I guess I'd hope that the shaman could be main healer and I'd drop the cleric for him.  Not sure a 52 shaman can really main-heal for naggy.  That's why I chose a paladin for MA, so he could lay hands in an emergency.<br />
<br />
Please report back here with whatever you try.  I'm fascinated by this sort of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Naggy can't be slowed at all?<br />
<br />
Can Vox?<br />
<br />
other questions:  Is Naggy's AOE fire based? Does Vox have an AOE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Naggy can't be slowed at all?<br />
<br />
Can Vox?<br />
<br />
other questions:  Is Naggy's AOE fire based? Does Vox have an AOE?<br />
<br />
Naggy's AoE is fire based.  I don't remember whether Vox has an AoE.  I think she does and it's cold based.  Both have and AoE fear attack.  <br />
<br />
And I don't believe either one are slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guild on Tribunal did it with 9 that I heard of (both Vox and Naggy).  Their requirement was 150 MR/FR/CR unbuffed.  They were doing it regularily too until they decided to disband.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They can't be slowed, both are magic immune, as far as I've been able to determine... my necro has never been able to land a single lifetap on naggy or vox, which are lure-based... so I doubt slows will land.<br />
<br />
Perhaps disease slow, though... although, do you even have that at 52? I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The smallest force that I ever fought Naggy with was 18I've lead a raid that had 18 people. We had 1 cleric and 1 druid as the only healers ;) there were 4 paladins though, I had them toss some GHs around :D<br />
<br />
As far as ability to slow... You're gonna need tash, and bard procced tash... I was able to slow Nagafen once back at 52 (then promptly got eaten hehe) but it IS possible... Chances are he'll be dead before you actually are able to do it however...<br />
<br />
Also, taunt is useless on him since it's an old world zone, and warriors cannot tank mobs over thier level (or over level 50) in them. Your best bet is to have a paladin or SK tank him using spells for agro management. If you have a SK, toss him a Heal over time, have him run in first and unload HT and throw a shadow vortex at him immediately, and he should have no problems holding agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, so having a tash proc, with an SK tank to hold agro, a Cleric and shaman (slow will be necessary, as with only 6 people, the fight will last a while)  If we are doing Naggy (which is my plan)  Then Fire Pets should avoid the AoE, making a Mage possible better than a Wizard for longevity in DPS.  That's 4.  A Monk for DPS and agro managment and Mend (which is a life saver, FD to loose agro) and a Rogue for DPS and agro managment (Evade)  and I think I have my raid:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Mage<br />
SK<br />
Monk<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
we will need a weapon that can proc tash.  and I'll pick up an intellectual superiority spell and potion to help with landing the slow.  Cleric will heal the SK (who can also tap and proc heal himself) and I with Soticism (got it 2 nights ago) can heal the secondary melees.  Project Alpha Dog should last a while with my fire resist and magic resistance at 200 and Mage can heal hit pet, then spam nukes at 40%, along with me doing the same.<br />
<br />
Next trick will be figuring out buffing<br />
4 crap buffs/recast buffs<br />
PoTG/Virtue<br />
Fo7<br />
Symbol<br />
Stamina<br />
Circle of FR<br />
Group MR<br />
Blessing of Replenishment<br />
Haste/Spell Casting Haste<br />
Call of Earth/Intellectual Superiority/Gift of Magic<br />
Another buff?<br />
Heal over time slot<br />
<br />
that seem about right? anything I'm just being dumb about?<br />
<br />
In this fight also I'm thinking Resists &gt; HP &gt; AC across the board... is that a good way to look at it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looks okay, you going to have higher levels buffing before hand or are you going with what you have?<br />
<br />
When are you going to attempt this, sounds like it is going to be interesting to say the least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Morel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The &quot;guide to slowing&quot; in the spells forum has both naggy and vox as unslowable.  If Grizlor is mistaken about being able to slow him, you're going to waste a lot of mana trying which would be better used healing your group.<br />
<br />
I don't know if they'll be useful, but if your resists are high enough and you're not taking much AoE damage, you may want to make sure everyone has a mod-rod also.<br />
<br />
Also, get a full set of high-level magician gear for the pets.  The extra HP and haste will be useful.<br />
<br />
So, list of things to bring along if you can:<br />
<br />
 - mod rods<br />
 - 10-dose stinging wort potions for your MA<br />
 - muzzle of mardu and other high-level mage gear<br />
<br />
And don't forget to leave room for damage shields on your MA.  I'd get the level 65 magician one and stack kilva's skin of flame with it.  <br />
<br />
The dragons are NOT magic immune.  You can nuke them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Forochel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The dragons are NOT magic immune.  You can nuke them.<br />
<br />
That's for sure. A critical Ice Comet on Naggy really gets his panties<br />
in a grind. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I saw naggy done with a 52 sk 52 rogue 52 cleric and 52 mage.<br />
 <br />
they had aego kei and vog  cast as debuffed and sk had full SS except for bp ( filthy twinks ) took them about 15 mins IIRC and the mage was chain summoning water pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Magic immune is different from spell immune....<br />
<br />
Notice how you have magic resist, cold resist...<br />
<br />
When I said magic immune, I meant that you won't land any magic based nukes or spells on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I misunderstood the phrase &quot;magic immune&quot;.  My bad.<br />
<br />
But if you happened to bring an enchanter, they should be able to land theft of thought, which is magic based.  I think the dragons just have a &quot;ridiculously high&quot; magic resistance, but are not completely magic immune.  Call it &quot;effectively magic immune&quot;.  Many people think this is an important tactic on Vox, to help prevent CHeals.  Won't matter on Naggy.</div></div><hr />
