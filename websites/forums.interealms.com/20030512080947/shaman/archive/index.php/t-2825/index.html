<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Allaric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I lost my iksar child's tear last night after giving it to Lord Rak'Ashiir and having him despawn.  Now I'm posed with a problem:  will my faction be off for the quest?<br />
<br />
I was told that there might be a faction problem with turning in the tear again, since my TS faction should be maxed now, so I'm wondering if anyone knows if the faction for our epic has been fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a shaman who recently shared your type of problem (though in a different manner), allow me to offer you my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you have completed all other steps of the quest as intended, (which is what it sounds like) and Rak did aggro you after your first tear hand-in (but unfortunately your raiding party failed to take him down), I do not think you would have any problems turning in a second tear.<br />
<br />
The generally recognized faction range obstacle is at the Ghiosk books turn-in.  <br />
<br />
If Rak didn't aggro and accept your tear, then I think you will have problems trying again.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carnabua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As of right now I have turned in the woe and envy part and I am about to switch servers so all my prior work on my epic will be gone. Will I have a faction problem because I have to do that part over again or might my faction be reset when I move servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've heard several stories, sometimes conflicting, of how the epic quest is completely faction-based and so forth; however does anyone KNOW if it's possible to increase your TrueSpirit faction to maximum Ally, then simply turn in the Iksar broodling's tear to make Lord Rak'Ashiir aggro and then turn in the Iksar Scale to the spirit in Emerald Jungle for the Spear of Fate?  Is this possible, or is there a faction range obstacle in the final turn-in/Lord Rak's turn in?</div></div><hr />
