<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I admit shamans = god heh, but I need to level another character to 60 and I'm wondering whats a good class. I love to group but if i cant find one I'm not patient so I like to solo while waiting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BLs are nice, though might be a little bland with 80% the same spells as shamans.<br />
<br />
But they really are quite versitile and fun. They have great soloability and can contribute quite nicley to a group with the great DPS (Probibly best melle DPS in the game if you take into account there pet)<br />
<br />
The only downside is the EQ community isint familiar with a bst and unsure what he can bring to the party. So they are widley ignored if ever LFG.</div></div><hr />

They are possibly the most fun you can have outside of a shaman. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Landragoran while u are right the game sis also extremely racist 45+ if u do not play what is considered the &quot;right&quot; race finding a grp can be very very hard and i f u happen to be a class that does not solo well then that affects your enjoyment of the game.<br />
Rangers may be fun (c'mon shootign a bow IS fun) but they still don't get grps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a ranger first, shaman 2nd.  I have no problem getting groups usually.  Of course every class has times when they can't immediately find a group.  But that's more bad luck than anything else.</div></div><hr />

But in answer to your query SamTheMan67, have a look at Paladins or SK....if you plan on doing PoP they pwn Warrior in exp groups (a sad thing to say really) and are possibly the best combo you can have.....mix it up with a paladin 2 box and your set with some of the best heals/buffs and debuffs in the game bar none.<br />
Go SK and go a different rout...with their snare, fear and your dots, its over for most mobs. And for single pulls I prefer SK over monks due to their sheer ability to take a beating and keep on ticking.<br />
But above all, play something you will have fun with, as others much more wise than I am have said, it is a game and its supposed to be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well ive tried everyone in the game other then a Wizy so far.  Right now i would rank SK as my favorite , its the oppostie end of the spectrum from us , its a tanker. The wonder of this guy is he is almost as effecient a soloer as a shaman , so there is no NEED for a group  , i know SK that solo in PoV and thats what im lookign for. After that i dont have a fav , bards asre incredible , but all the damn button pushing really turned me off as i would like use of my hands in 10 years :p  Rangers are fun , but thats mroe for me i think cause i like to ROLEPLAY a tracker. Warrior is great ,but he NEEDS a group , so if you dont mind that they can be TONS of fun cause you are the wall between your group and the mobs. There is something fun about that. Bst i found cute , but annoying , basicly you play cleric to your pet , i dont like healing alot and playing cleric , so i got bored with him , plus his weak self heals made it kinda annoying.  Mage ... Tons of fun , powerful , lacking ALOT of utility and meding .... i hate meding :p  but a good class none the less.<br />
<br />
<br />
like it was said , just piture what wold be the most fun to roleplay , what imagrey you like and go with it . Thats how i got my shaman and its worked out wonderfuly</div></div><hr />

My main is a 51 SK and she's a kick to play. Gives me a chance to go swat all those do gooders. Taunts are nice, and there is the solo factor. And the spells. Down side is youare hated pretty much every where, but who cares eh?<br />
