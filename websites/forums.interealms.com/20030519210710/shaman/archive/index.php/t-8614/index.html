<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyppon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I've been working on Alternate Advancement and I just got Baron last week. I was wondering what I should go for in Archtype AAs, as well as why. I've been thinking about doing Spell Casting Reinforcement, but I'm not sure how useful that is really. Also, I've been thinking, that perhaps I max Mental Clarity, so after I get Mass Group Buff in Class AAs, I can go immediately to Cannibalization..<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />
