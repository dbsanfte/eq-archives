<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slackjawd_Yokel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all! ive been a retired EQ vetran for over 6 months now. My comp quit out on me about 2 months before SoL came out. I had a couple of 50+ characters wich lost all their equipment, when i died breaking into PoF w/ a guild and then couldnt log on (6 months ago). Pitty.. i lost a rogue epic along with full suit of mrylokar minus the BP/gaunts. owell.. i was wondering if any of you could help me with buying the right computer?<br />
<br />
heres some questions to kick around:<br />
<br />
1) what type/brand of computer do you use?<br />
2) does it run all the EQ expansions efficiently?<br />
3) did you buy it whole from the company? or buy seperate parts and build it yourself?<br />
4) what seperate parts did you buy for it? quality? ie: pentium _, geoforce_, ram, dialup..cable...dsl..etc?<br />
5) about how much did it run total money wise afterwords? what price range am i looking at?<br />
6) what is your opinion on the best computer set up, to run EQ? (mind you, ill be using the new comp to play EQ 90% of the time)<br />
<br />
id love it if you guys/gals could help me out! been so long since i could gear up and kick some tail w/ the shaman community... and i want to be well equiped once i finaly do get back in. So a good comp that will run EQ to the best of its abilities.. and nothing more. I just use the comp for games.<br />
<br />
thx in advance everyone.<br />

<br />
Here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1352)  it is.<br />
<br />
Now to answer some of your questions point-by-point.<br />
<br />
1) what type/brand of computer do you use? <br />
I built a Athlon XP 1800+ with an EPoX KHA+ motherboard..512 ram with GeForce 3 Ti200.<br />
2) does it run all the EQ expansions efficiently? <br />
I'll say yes, and set aside the fact that VI has no idea how to efficiently code anything. During last patch it has been locking up for me everytime i begin to walk forward for like 1 second, however i believe this is purely a software problem and not a problem with my computer/internet connection. It will probably disappear soon, but all of my other games run smooth as a baby's bottom.<br />
3) did you buy it whole from the company? or buy seperate parts and build it yourself? <br />
I bought seperate parts and built it myself. It was pretty easy. visit the link to PCMech (www.pcmech.com)  on my other post. It is a very good place to start learning about various computer components, and gives you reviews from other sites about hardware, and even a step by step guide to building your own PC.!<br />
4) what seperate parts did you buy for it? quality? ie: pentium _, geoforce_, ram, dialup..cable...dsl..etc? <br />
See question 1. Be careful. AMD names their XP chips 1500+, 1600+, 1700+, 1800+, etc but this is not a direct indication of processor speed. Indeed my 1800+ is clocked at 1.533Ghz, but they use something called Quantispeed Architecture with their chips which helps the 1800+ compete with Intel's 1.8Ghz the 1900+ compete with Intel's 1.9Ghz etc..you get the point right?(they benchmark pretty close together that is)<br />
5) about how much did it run total money wise afterwords?what price range am i looking at? <br />
For my system which I think is pretty mid ranged i would shoot for $1,000..you can get a decent one for maybe $600-800. I already had a monitor though so i only had to get the case, motherboard, cpu, RAM, graphics card, wireless card, cd drive, etc. add about 200-500 bucks more if you need another monitor.<br />
6) what is your opinion on the best computer set up, to run EQ? (mind you, ill be using the new comp to play EQ 90% of the time)<br />
Get a decent graphics card and solid motherboard. People oftentimes place most of the burden of problems on the speed of their computer on their cpu chip. This is not true. A good graphics card will get you less choppy gameplay (i.e. on raids when it is crowded), a good motehrboard will keep you from crashing liek crazy if it is instable, and a good amount of ram (i recommend 512MB or 1gig if you can, ram is pretty cheap these days. Keep in mind that Everquest is not very efficient use of CPU resources :) and i think this may be on purpose. VI didnt want anyone to do anything while playing eq. So just keep that in mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) what type/brand of computer do you use?<br />
<br />
Self-Built. Athlon 1400, Hercules Prophet 4500, Hercules Game Theatre XP, 256 DDR RAM, Linksys Ethernet, and a trayless DVD drive.<br />
<br />
2) does it run all the EQ expansions efficiently? <br />
<br />
It ran the all expansions up to Luclin very nicely.<br />
<br />
3) did you buy it whole from the company? or buy seperate parts and build it yourself? <br />
<br />
Built it myself, but then again I did work tech support for three months before I built it so I had a very good idea of what I was doing.<br />
<br />
4) what seperate parts did you buy for it? quality? ie: pentium _, geoforce_, ram, dialup..cable...dsl..etc? <br />
<br />
Most decisions were price-based. Everything was very cheap except the sound system, and it was worth every penny for that.<br />
<br />
5) about how much did it run total money wise afterwords? what price range am i looking at? <br />
<br />
I already had a monitor. The entire setup with case and all accessories (including extra fans) was about a thousand dollars last August.<br />
<br />
6) what is your opinion on the best computer set up, to run EQ? (mind you, ill be using the new comp to play EQ 90% of the time)<br />
<br />
The processor is really your own preference; buy an Athlon if you don't mind the problems caused by extra heat, otherwise pick up a Pentium. EQ runs best on a GeForce chipset imo (the card I have chokes on anything designed for DirectX 8+) so I would heartily reccomend any GeForce card. Hercules' Game Theatre XP and Sound Blaster Audigy are both excellent sound cards even if they cost a little more. RAM is going to be based on your motherboard, but it's the cheapest part of the entire machine for the most performance increase, so get lots (a gig or more if you are running Windows XP). Get a big case that has extra fans in it, the new GeForce cards put out an awful lot of heat and can cause computers to hard lock even if the processor is running cool. And don't skimp on a good monitor-- your eyes will thank you :)</div></div><hr />

In my experience, going with onboard sound or video has always been a bad idea, _until_ the NForce motherboards have come out.<br />
<br />
Developed by NVidia, my motherboard has GeForce 2, sound and network card all built in.  The GeForce 2 sounds a bit dated, but it also has an AGP slot to drop a better one in later.  Besides, how much software is out there that is optimized for GeForce 3+ yet?     The 2 will last you a good 6months - 9 months.<br />
<br />
All of those components built into the motherboard and it still runs in the $140 - 180 range for teh motherboard.  So you need to go upgrade your Video card in a year, the immediate savings you get now makes up for that fact.  Performance of the NForce motherboards has been within a few percentage of any other motherboard, too.<br />
<br />
Hard to beat the deal you get with that motherboard.  I'm certain the newer versions (which I haven't been following since I bought mine in January) have gotten even better, too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bought an Alienware computer a few years ago, like the poster above has.  Good company, good customer service.<br />
<br />
I would advise that if you build your own, you be VERY careful about matching the motherboard and cpu up.  Right now for instance, you could buy I think three different kinds of Pentium 4 CPU's of the same speed -- I think 1.7's for instance, come in socket 473 and in two different socket 478 configurations.  478a's are the most modern versions.  The two types of 478's will fit in the same type of motherboard, but the 473 is an outdated chip that is still selling like hotcakes, as are the motherboards that go with them.<br />
<br />
Keep it very much in mind that MANY MANY vendors are trying to clear out their inventory of socket 473 motherboards and chips, and when they build stuff for the unknowledgeable, they will often stick them with the outdated socket 473 stuff.  What that means to you is that when you want to upgrade, you won't be able to.  Socket 473's are not being built to a level you'd want to upgrade to by the time a decent computer you make now starts to seem old.  You'll be looking at socket 478 chips, which won't fit in your old motherboard.<br />
<br />
So be VERY sure you get a socket 478 motherboard and a 478(make it a 478a) chip, if you're going the P4 route.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother getting less than a GeForce 3 video card.  They're great cards.  Research well before buying -- there is a GeForce 4 card out now that is basically only a GeForce 2 in disguise; no point in buying that at this point.  <br />
<br />
And Luclin is a huge memory hog -- 512 RAM minimum.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on that ram -- don't get one of those rigs that uses a nice modern chip but uses SDRAM.  SDRAM will NOT let your computer live up to its potential for gaming; you really need the newer types of RAM -- PC 2100 or PC 800.  There is no question that it is worth the extra money.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd stay away from built-in anything except for built-in RAID, which can actually give you extra EIDE channels -- places to plug hard drives, CDRW's, etc., into.  That's actually kinda nice, but will probably run you 25 bucks more or something like that.  But built-in sound and video cause problems for an awful lot of people, not all of them technical know-nothings.  The N-force or whatever motherboards may be different, I don't know, but I think it's probably a whole lot better just to follow the Army's creed when it comes to building computers -- KISS.  Keep It Simple, Stupid.</div></div><hr />
