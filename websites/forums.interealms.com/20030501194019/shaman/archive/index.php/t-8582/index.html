<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had to go into Business Depot today to pick up some stuff for work, and while I was there I noticed Planes of Power sitting on a shelf, taunting me. I've been retired from EQ for about 5 months now, and thought I was over it. Somehow, without any conscious thought, it worked it's way into my arms and ended up at the checkout counter with my other purchases.<br />
<br />
Now I'm sitting here staring at the box, still unopened, trying desperately to ignore it. I don't want to open it and install it, but it keeps taunting me! A little evil voice in the back of my mind keeps whispering for me to open it and give it a try, an hour of EQ won't hurt!<br />
<br />
Someone tell me that EQ sucks! It's not worth coming back to! The levelling grind makes level 59 look like a walk in the park! For the love of god, anything! Make it stop!!!<br />
<br />
/em goes back to drinking his beer and chain smoking while staring at the pretty artwork on the box, mesmerized.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you have a cure for cancer lying around and you are playing EQ instead of working on that...load up PoP, get into a guild and start playing again.<br />

And remember, there are people in third-world countries that will never have a chance to play EQ.  And yet, we take it for granted.<br />

<br />
My hobbies:<br />
<br />
1) Leathercrafting - can get uberly expensive if/when I need a new side of leather or new/replacement tools.<br />
<br />
2) Music - equipment to keep my home recording studio up to snuff is uberly expensive. Not to mention all the consumables I use (mainly strings and picks).<br />
<br />
3) Fitness training - gym membership(s) + dietary supplements...don't EVEN get me started.<br />
<br />
4) EQ - a mere $13.81 US/month<br />
<br />
If I were to break down how much I spend on a monthly basis on each of these, then break it down into an hourly cost.....you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Tulson was right. A hobby is a hobby. Enjoy it when you can.<br />
<br />
And as I said to someone else a couple of days ago....welcome back to the dark side. :)</div></div><hr />

I've been a gamer ever since I got my ADAM when I was 6.<br />

My guild is far from uber and we xp in PoP quite often. The xp there is insane and a lot of fun! SOE didn't make as many glaring errors as they did with a number of other expansions. This one is the best expansion by far.<br />
<br />
I'd say as long you don't let the game control you, PoP is a good investment. :p</div></div><hr />

there's a difference.<br />
as a hobby you can remain detatched and objective, able to leave it alone if something more important (new gf, more RL work, night out with the boys) comes up and needs your attention. <br />
If you can't handle it tho, don't play.  <br />

I'd say don't come back to EQ and a top end guild unless you plan on spending a lot of time playing.   You have to be there to get flags on raids with your guild to advance.  If you can't be to every raid then you may be left behind.  Flag mobs are contended, your guild may not have an opportunity to kill the said mob again anytime soon.  Meanwhile you could be missing additional flags they are getting in higher zones, getting left farther and farther behind.<br />
<br />
Since you are already late starting you're probably already behind.  Depending on your guilds commitment to its members and the current state of their advancement through the expansion so far, this may or may not be a problem.<br />
<br />
Anyways, its not like Velious when you could login once a week and run over and raid NTOV.   If your guild is top on the server, that is.   For smaller/lesser guilds, pretty much pass the plane of justice trials and that's all you get from POP.<br />
<br />
Just my humble opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Don't count on getting flagged quickly if you come back.  I won't elaborate really except to note that there are quite a few of them, and some depend on your having others.<br />
<br />
You guys still need vex thal, too, and it will be quite a while till you get there.<br />
<br />
And -- there are a lot of shamans around these days.  A LOT.  In your guild, in WL, everywhere.  Many have been unretired, many more are actively botted.  Due to the utility of shamans in PoP, more are being made every day.  We used to be pretty rare; that's no longer the case at all.<br />
<br />
If you rejoin, you can get 65 quickly, which is nice.  There will be plenty of what you could call either incentive or peer pressure to do it.  I'm not sure you can do much with it until your guild hits a higher level.<br />
<br />
Make the decision soon, though, if you can.  The longer you wait to get into high-end PoP stuff, the harder it will be to get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your post reads like a recovering alcoholic looking at a bottle.  If you had misgivings about purchasing PoP and moving on in the game, then it's not just a game to you.  If you live to play, then you shouldn't come back.  <br />
<br />
RL  &gt;&gt;&gt;  EQ<br />
<br />
Addiction and escapism are always there, always ready to welcome you home like a lost friend.  It just makes it that much harder to let loose.  I repeat, if you have trouble balancing EQ with the rest of your life and puting the game down when you should, then LEAVE THE BOX ALONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I intentionally worded my original post to sound that way, I didn't mean for anyone to take it seriously :) Basically I just want to know if PoP is worth coming back for,  or am I in for more of the same; waiting for mob X to spawn and try to beat guild Y and Z to it, the long XP grind, etc etc. <br />
<br />
I guess when it comes right down to it, is PoP like Kunark, Velious and Luclin? I wasn't much impressed with any of those expansions, as they all involved the same thing - big raids necessary to kill mobs, xp grinding. Does PoP have anything inventive about it? Small group raids, dynamic content, fun stuff to do in your downtime? And by fun stuff I don't mean an updated version of gems or something idiotic like that =P<br />
<br />
I was impressed when I saw our spell list, and some of our new AA abilities, but I'm looking for your impressions of PoP a couple months into release. Is PoP original enough to be the saving grace for EQ or the final nail in the coffin?<br />
<br />
edit: I forgot to ask about key quests - are there any? One of the main reasons I retired several months ago was the absolute mind numbing boredom of shard camping for my VT key and spending countless hours staring at the same snakes in Ssra farming components from Comm1 and Comm2 for key quest... The flag concept sounded interesting to me until someone pointed out the possibility of getting left behind and trying to play catch up if you miss raids. Basically flags and keys are pretty much the same when it all boils down I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yep, key quests abound. <br />
<br />
You have two options, either be in a guild big enough to take down the mobs that get the raid flagged....or camp zonewide rare spawns that drop parts needed for a key to the zone.<br />
<br />
When you hit 65 there are three zones you can get into without too much trouble for xping.  They are all outdoor zones just like dreadlands.<br />
<br />
The rest of the zones require lots of camping or being part of a large guild that can take down the mobs needed.<br />
<br />
This is NOTHING like Kunark, Velious or Luclin.  All three of those expansions had very few zones that required annoying key quests to get into.  The actual content was challenging to advance instead of being a horrid campathon to even zone into the next zone.<br />
<br />
When you hit level 65 all of the old world content is green (except for a very few spots) and the spots that aren't green give terrible xp because of the challenge xp nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">sorry for the racial thing.  It's true tho.  I live in Alaska and have for most of my life.  That segment of society simply RACIALLY can not tolerate alcohol.  They haven't got the genes for it.  There are MANY &quot;dry&quot; towns up here that recognize this fact and ban all alcohol from the town to keep the population from self destruction.   Denying it and/or calling me a racist doesn't change that fact.   I don't offer my friends of that persuasion booze.  I know it's not good for them and I don't tempt them.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for making you edit Thantu, but seriously, not everything in this life has a rose-colored tint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you have a good system (512 - RAM), like to do quests, want to have fun, install it.  If you have an old system or it's just slow, don't install it.  I have an old system that did fine up until Kunark next to my new one that can do PoP.  The difference between the two is so much that I would quit EQ if I still had to use my old system for raiding.  The system requirements are just too much unless you want to use it as an excuse to upgrade.<br />
<br />
Is EQ fun with PoP?  IMO, yes.  In other peoples opinion, no.   Will you see every zone in PoP?  Probably not but that's no big deal.  I've been playing for over 3 years and have yet to see, 8th Isle in PoA, Veeshan's Peak, a successful Queen of Chardok kill, the 2 hardest dragons in NToV, Sleeper's Tomb, Zlandicar, Vex Thal, Blood or Emp.  Basically, less that 15% of the entire EQ population will ever see every single zone in EQ.  Keep that in mind when the naysayers say PoP is an uber guild only expansion.  Play to have fun, don't play just to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">There are different schools of thought on that and many people believe it's a stereotype. <br />
<br />
http://www.gryphon-communications.com/msr/fire.html<br />
(of course, you can find a link on the internet to say practically anything)<br />
<br />
The author is a native american and I find the following quotes from the article particularly interesting:<br />
<br />
&quot;For well over 400 years, the traditional assumption of a &quot;special weakness&quot; causing behavioral problems for Indians after ingesting alcohol has largely been anecdotal. Other explanations, with a social orientation need to be addressed, such as poverty, high unemployment rates, low education attainment, and centuries of forced acculturation which might help elucidate the relationship between alcohol use and abuse among Indian people today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, studies have shown that many native Americans suffer from alcoholism. Is it genetic, or is it because of feelings of poverty and hopelessness (among many other reasons)? <br />
<br />
Although you obviously believe it, I think it's a pretty nasty stereotype.<br />
<br />
Feel free to send this one off to The Grey :)<br />
<br />
More fun myth debunking:<br />
(I'm sure if you searched, you could find just as many links that say that alcoholism is a genetic flaw of Native Americans, but as you can see there are numerous people that hold the idea that the stereotype is offensive. I thought your statement was VERY offensive.  Of course, the first 3-4 Yahoo search result pages I saw, not ONE stated that it was a genetic trait)<br />
<br />
&quot;Medical reasons<br />
<br />
Why is there so much drinking on the reservations?<br />
<br />
Some doctors believe a predisposition to alcoholism is passed on genetically. One early study, for example, found that Indians have difficulty metabolizing alcohol.<br />
<br />
However, that study was flawed, said Philip May, former chairman of the sociology department at the University of Montana and outgoing head of the University of New Mexico's Center on Alcoholism.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the remaining studies of alcohol metabolism among Indians found Indians to metabolize alcohol as rapidly, or more rapidly, than matched controls who were non-Indian,&quot; May said.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Indians are uncomfortable with the medical model because it suggests alcoholism may be inevitable, said Dr. Kathleen Masis, behavioral health officer for the IHS in Billings.<br />
<br />
&quot;But being children of alcoholics predisposes people to alcoholism, whether or not it's inherited,&quot; she said. &quot;Sons of alcoholics are four times more likely to become alcoholics themselves.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.gannett.com/go/difference/greatfalls/pages/part8/blackfeet.html<br />
<br />
&quot;Causes of alcohol abuse among Native Americans<br />
<br />
The cause for our rate of alcohol abuse is still an issue of great debate. The most persistent myth about Indians is that we have particular bio-physiological reasons for &quot;not being able to hold our alcohol.&quot; Only one study ever reported that Indians metabolize alcohol more slowly than non-Indians, but it was criticized as highly flawed in its use of controls. Remaining studies of alcohol metabolism among Indians have found Indians to metabolize alcohol as rapidly as or more rapidly than matched controls who were non-Indians. Furthermore, liver biopsies have shown no discernible difference in liver phenotype between Indian and non-Indians, (Philip A. May 1994).<br />
<br />
I personally believe that our population is not genetically predisposed to the abuse of alcohol. I see the “predisposition” theory as a way of dismissing our socioeconomic conditions and the repercussions of colonization on us as a people.&quot;<br />
<br />
http://ct.addictionprofessionals.com/newsletters/2000-03-3.htm<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is alcoholism so prevalent among American Indians?<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, Mail says, there is no conclusive proof that American Indians are genetically predisposed to becoming alcoholics.<br />
<br />
''There are a lot of crackpot theories out there,'' says Mail. ''But the research on the metabolism of Indians is quite mixed. There has not been enough research done to allow any definite conclusions.'' <br />
<br />
High rates of poverty, unemployment, depression and discrimination are more likely factors contributing to American Indian alcohol affliction, Mail says.<br />
<br />
On Passamaquoddy reserves in Pleasant Point and Indian Township unemployment hovers around 50 percent. <br />
<br />
''The poverty and conditions under which many Indian people live has created a climate or a subculture of drinking in Indian communities,'' Mail says. ''And when things become hopeless and people feel helpless, alcohol is a great sedative.''&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.portland.com/specialrpts/alcohol/d7gene.htm<br />
<br />
&quot;Presently, alcoholism is three times as prevalent among Native Americans as among other groups, ( “Prevention Primer” on American Indians from the Internet). In a poll conducted by Joy Leland of the Rudgers Center of Alcoholic Studies, eleven authors out of thirty three on the subject of alcoholism believed that alcoholism is a prominent problem on Native American reservations. The U.S. Office for Minority Health reports that this high incidence of alcohol abuse may be attributed to the fact that the Native Americans have had their traditional way of life disrupted, and have been left with feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness. Besides the alarmingly high alcoholism rate, the unemployment rate is also extremely high among Native Americans. Presently the Native American rate is ten times that of the rest of the nation.&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.essaynow.com/new/History-American/American+Indians.asp<br />
<br />
&quot;A once popular theory, the firewater myth, proposes that Native Americans are constitutionally unable to handle alcohol. Although the idea that Native Americans are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol has been propagated for more than 3 centuries, it has not been previously directly investigated in the laboratory.&quot;<br />
