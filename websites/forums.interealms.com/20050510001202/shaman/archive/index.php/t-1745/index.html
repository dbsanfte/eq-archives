<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok folks...DAMNIT SPELLS ARE EXPENSIVE!<br />
<br />
And I'm sure you'll say, &quot;welcome to the club.&quot;<br />
<br />
9th level Shammy here, just bought my 9th level spells, and Ill list my spells to date:<br />
<br />
Inner Fire<br />
Strengthen<br />
Minor Healing<br />
Cure Disease<br />
Cure Poison<br />
Feet like Cat<br />
Frost Rift <br />
Drowsy<br />
Spirit Pouch<br />
Summon Drink<br />
Gate<br />
SOW<br />
Light Healing<br />
Tainted Breath<br />
<br />
Now, I skipped some, like the first DOT (forgot name), Spirit of Bear, Fleeting Fury, Talisman of the Beast....<br />
<br />
What I really want to know is...there seems to be a lot of damn spells lol...anyone have a &quot;must have list&quot; for 1 -24?  I wrote down all the spells I thought I would need for those levels...but I leave usually 1/4 of each levels spells out...so....<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Shaman<br />
<br />
Thats what i've been using since level 1, has yet to fail me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree that CastersRealm is a great site to refer to.  I have a printout of the spell list at home so I can use it while playing. <br />
<br />
As to which spells you should get....well I think it is personal decision really.  Healing, DOTs, slows and major buff spells are my top priority.  Actually as I am looking at the list it is hard to choose which are the most important.  I have most of my spells, although I have to admit that I was very frustrated at times farming loot to get the money.<br />
<br />
My best advice is this:<br />
<br />
You can get away with not having some of the &quot;perk&quot; spells for awhile like Levitate, endure breath, spirit of the snake, etc...depending on where you hunt.  Here are some of the ones that I use the most (besides the ones you already have):<br />
<br />
All my DOTs and Healing spells<br />
Root<br />
Serpent Sight  (must have especially if barbarian)<br />
Bind<br />
Slow spells, but mostly Walking Sleep<br />
Spirit Strike<br />
Buffs (especially strength)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its probably easier to tell you which you dont need from 14-24, don't forget everyone plays differently, what I would say may not be what someone else would say<br />
<br />
Spells you can live without:<br />
<br />
14<br />
Burst of Strength &lt; tricky this, some love this line, others dont bother with it. If you end up meleeing alot then get it or wait for Frenzy at 19.<br />
<br />
Enduring Breath &lt; get this eventually but you're unlikely to be spending much time underwater for a while, come back for it.<br />
<br />
Invisibility versus Animals &lt; useful in some very specific situations only.<br />
<br />
Turtle Skin &lt;  Uses snake skins which can be a pain, just dont bother<br />
<br />
19<br />
Frenzy &lt; as with Burst of Strength<br />
<br />
Grow &lt; useful in certain indoor situations, can wait if youre outside alot.<br />
<br />
Infectious Cloud &lt; AE, dont bother<br />
<br />
Vision &lt; might be useful for banking/using merchants through elven size doors if you ever get non kos with any.<br />
<br />
24<br />
Creeping Vision &lt; didnt they nerf this? Not sure I ever bought it<br />
<br />
Invigor &lt; you wont have room to mem it anyway<br />
<br />
Poison Storm &lt; AE, dont bother<br />
<br />
Spirit of Cheetah &lt; useful for travelling but can get it later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My opinion on essential spells to 24:<br />
<br />
Spirit of Wolf (always have this memmed - saved my bacon more times than I would care to remember)<br />
<br />
Root (always have this memmed)<br />
<br />
Poison DOTs (I rarely use the area effect DOTs or the disease ones)<br />
<br />
Slows (always memmed - this really defines our class)<br />
<br />
Regen - essential<br />
<br />
Canni - essential<br />
<br />
Buff spells - strength, stamina, and dex are arguably the most useful although the charisma buffs let you buy spells cheaper :)<br />
<br />
Healing spells - essential<br />
<br />
Debuffs - not too critical early on, but essential as you level<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so my list includes most of our spells :) . Luckily (or unluckily depending on how you look at it) most of our spells are pretty darn useful. There are some duds and many situational spells, but overall we have a pretty nice line-up. <br />
<br />
If you are having money problems, just farm some low-level mobs for cash. High quality bear pelts sell for 20-30pp each to another player and drop off of newbie mobs. Bone chips and bat wings are easy to farm and sell for 2 - 5pp a stack.<br />
 <br />
If you have a magic weapon you can start hunting wisps - graeter lightstones have a quest associated with them that can get you nearly 10pp (check alakazam's website for quest info).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />
