<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LostSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am kind of interested in trying this out.  Do many people do this and is it hard to do? I was thinking I could do a Warrior and Shaman or somthing.  I could use the shaman to pull with slow and then switch to the warrior and just hit it.  I suppose an SK might even be better, or maybe a monk.  <br />
<br />
For a 2 account newbie what would you reccomend, or is this just a bad idea all around? What would be the fastest duo to reach say lvl 40?<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I two box on one PC using EQWindows (http://www.eqwindows.com) I find it much easier to use than the botched job Sony did.<br />
<br />
I run Haleice at 1024x768, and run my second account at 800x600. I use two different UI's and  overlap the screens with Hals stats on the left hand side of the screen, and my trade mule/druid/pet SK/ etc on the right hand side. This way I can see that stats of both chars, and more importantly who is getting beat on.<br />
<br />
A few things you need to bear in mind are that you will need to swirch the sound off on at least one of the accounts, otherwise you end up with loads of lag. I also turn down the clip view and turn off spell effects on the second account.<br />
<br />
It takes a while to get used to using two accounts but it's not that hard<br />
<br />
I used to two box a lot more before pop came out as I was leveling up my druid for ease of getting about, but now I tend to use it to log on my friends cleric for ressing people.<br />
<br />
As for the two fastest chars to level up? I don't think it really matters with places like PC to level up in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best way to do 2 accounts on 1 computer is to use http://www.eqwindows.com/<br />
I hear that EQ can actually run 2 windows of itself on it's own, but does it really crappy.<br />
EQW runs EQ in a window much better than EQ does.<br />
WARNING though that using EQW may actually be against the EULA, but I'm not sure anymore.<br />
I heard that it wasn't bannable anymore since it doesn't do anything to EQ other than what EQ already does on it's own.<br />
<br />
Running 2 EQ windows on 1 computer works ok.<br />
Be mindful that it will be much laggier than just the 1 session running.<br />
You will also have difficulties playing both characters at top efficiency.<br />
One benefit though is you have &quot;instant communication&quot; between the 2 character classes.<br />
I love to duel comp shaman/chanter.<br />
When one mob is mezzed, I don't have to try to explain to the enchanter that %t mob is slowed, and mez the other one that I didn't root yet.  I can just alt-tab, target, and mez right away.<br />
Duel comping shaman + cleric is ok too.<br />
I was debuffing and playing main healer for a powater group hunting sharks and stuff and did quite fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can run 2 EQ windows and it runs just as good if not better than EQWindows, imo.  I use Windows XP and had to download the Windows Compatibility Toolkit to get Alt-Tab to work, but I run 2 windows all the time.  Generally not on raids, but for regular xp-grinds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ditto to what above posters have said.  Once you get the hang of it, it can be impressive.  When you get abit of practise you'll be casting on one and switching to the other without waiting for spells to land.  One other thing to note I have 512m o' ram and if I tried anything else while running 2 instances of EQ, ie surfing the net I would somtimes get low memory problems.  Oh yeah and zoning can suck if you try to zone both accounts at once.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to let you know, EQW is no longer against the EULA. When they added in the ability to alt-tab outside of the game, the only thing that EQW was doing that was against the EULA (that is, letting you run programs outside EQ) was no longer not allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EQW is great for farming items. <br />
<br />
If you wanna do it for make plat, I'd strongly suggest a snarer.<br />
Track is pretty nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the shaman/SK combo myself.  Darkness and FD will make things a lot easier on yourself.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is I actually started my shaman to duo with my SK.  I leveled them up together but found out that I liked the shaman a lot better than the SK and he's still sitting at level 38!  <br />
<br />
Once you get the hang of switching back and forth between characters it's pretty easy and will start to feel weird when you only play one!  My bit of advice is to get a horse if you plan on xping outdoors.  This way you dont have to worry about sitting/standing and casting while switching back and forth.  It can get confusing sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LostSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What is this windows compatibilty tool kit?  If it allows me to alt tab between windows quickly, I would think that would make playing eq alot better.<br />
<br />
Is this possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Due to how fast technology works, just do a google search and find the program.  Even found directions which have been stickied to other class boards.   Doing a quick search myself found me 3 different versions of the dang thing.  You will have to decide which to install yourself.<br />
<br />
Read this first (http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/expertzone/columns/mcfedries/03june02.asp) <br />
<br />
Download this second (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/appcompatibility/default.mspx)<br />
<br />
Following Quote is taken from Druids Grove Post (http://pub149.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm9.showMessage?topicID=668.topic) <br />
You'll need to download and install the toolkit. Then:<br />
<br />
Open the Compatibility Administration Tool.<br />
<br />
At the top go to Search - Query.<br />
Search for EverQuest.<br />
Double click the item the search finds.<br />
Right-Click the EQGame.exe entry and choose Disable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are other considerations to take in than just 2 characters when you are trying to 2 box. I, myself, HATE waiting to see if there are new files to be downloaded every time I start up EQ. I generally know ahead when a patch is going to occur, and I can run the program then.<br />
With EQ windows, you can skip the entire file check and just go straight into EQ. With Windowed EQ, you still have to run the file check.<br />
<br />
the reason I hate running the file check is because I'm on dialup and it takes an extraordinarily long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do this.  I find it much easier to do than 2 boxing on 2 diff computers.<br />
<br />
You can operate both at very near max capacity with a bit of practice.  One thing that is important is you not try to do this with 2 melee cha's.  Keeping both in melee range is kinda hard.  2 casters is ok or 1 caster and 1 melee.  <br />
<br />
Over time I find my self just using the alt commands for all spells on shamans screen as a reflex.  tab over target send pet start casting slow/malos depdning on mob  tab back in under a second.  Watch for hit or miss message on monk screen while fighting.  <br />
<br />
The performance decrease isn't to bad if you have a decent comp it should be fine.  Even managed to do 3 without to much trouble a couple times running a friends account for a rezzing hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I do this on one system and single box on the other. I'm still about 50x more effecient with the two characters on seperate systems then the two on the same one. <br />
<br />
I also think EQW is a lot better then just using eq's windowing functions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not exactly related to this but could be of interest...<br />
<br />
If you want to use other resolutions than the standard ones offered by the EQ interface (800x600, 1024x768 ....) you can actually edit the eqclient.ini file and put in other values for horizontal and vertical resolution. I am running 2 EQW sessions side by side on a 1920x1440 resolution monitor so I changed my eqclient.ini for both accounts to 960x720. Works like a charm.</div></div><hr />
