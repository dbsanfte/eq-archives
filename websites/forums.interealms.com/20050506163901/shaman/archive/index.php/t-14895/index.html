<br />
This morning I must have lucked out and was able to log in at 6:00AM PST.  I used my OT hammer to get to Kunark to check out the new Nurga.  I was really surprised to see what I did; Nurga is not a solo zone anymore. The mob placement is totally different, so watch out, and they are clumped together. The drop from the waterfall used to be a safe spot...no longer.  There are 2 or 3 mobs, casters at the time I was there and light blue to a 56, waiting for you.  The deeper that I moved in the more mobs that I saw and the dark blue they became, my heart began to race.  Only talking to other shamans would they understand how unreliable our invis is and if I knew that if it dropped I was in for a long CR.  The Nurga Goblins in the past were kind of caster heavy but now it seems that the huge majority are casters with new names (life drinkers, fire dowser, arcane master, stabber.....).  Also there a different kinds of mine rats now too, all dark blue to me.<br />
<br />
I have admit I can’t wait to get home and check out this place.  Great faction and XP in one zone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zones with primarily casters suck - they can gate while you pound them senseless, they can nuke you, they can dispell, they can slow, they heal, they can charm....<br />
<br />
If the loot isnt really really good the novelty will wear off soon on zones with many casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Apparently Nurga/Droga being utterly deserted for level appropriate people in their 40's convinced them to do a revamp for a zone that will now be utterly deserted for level appropriate people in their 50's and 60's.  Caster heavy dungeons were, are and always shall be ghost towns other than a few groups occasionally farming bazaar gear or perhaps faction.  Faction for Chardok in an out of the way, one way zone with lots of casters? Right on! &lt;-- sarcasm<br />
<br />
Oh wait, caster mobs give much higher xp for their greater difficulty.  Oh wait again, no they don't.  :confused: Silly.<br />

<br />
Actually I've been to those zones a ton for the iksar cudgel quests, iksar monk shackle quests, etc...  They sucked horribly then, increasing the level and difficulty of the mobs will do little to change this.  I actually enjoy LoY for the loot, but the xp is bad compared to PoP and getting to them is a major pita, just like most kunark dungeons including nurga/droga.  Hence, after initial interest these zones will remain largely deserted while PoP remains packed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Daedric, do you mean the Overseers or other named mobs in Nurga?<br />
<br />
BTW - I killed ~15 mobs in Nurga this morning near the old &quot;slave pit&quot; room and the average coin drop was between 5gp and 3pp.  Where are these gobbies that drop good coin?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The three I killed weren't Overseers.  I can't remember the names though.<br />
<br />
I do recall one Overseer up.  I was gonna try to kill him, but got a multipull (only one I got there) and I gated.<br />
<br />
The MoB that dropped the earring was a rogue named goblin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Went to Droga and Nurga earlier today to check them out.<br />
<br />
Gobbies close to zone-in in droga were red and RTA to me (52 ogre shaman) Nurga however was half Light Blue and Half Dark blue (didnt see anything any higher).  There are lots of spawns that are close together, but most single pulled easily (I was pulling, was grouped with a 54 shaman only), I think I only got 2 once.  Respawn isn't bad either, seemed 10 mins or so...<br />
<br />
Killed one named &quot;Traitor Efuin&quot; or something who dropped some decent caster sleeves that I gave to a 54 mage guildy (he wanted them so they prolly werent too bad). They were called Sleeves of the Adept. No listing in Lucy that I saw. We killed the named twice and he dropped sleeves both times. Respawn on the named was somewhere in an hours time.<br />
<br />
All in all it was fun and we were never in any real danger. Some of the gobs Harm Touch and could be bad if you are already low on health, but not a prob if you dont let yourself get too low ( i believe i was hit 500ish)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Nurga was fun, Droga was above my level so nothing to report there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well i took my SK through droga/nurga and it was rough but good exp, now its been changed and i have to say, im sad for my alts, but happy for me. The loot is outstanding and common, the exp is great and the casters are gimpy. once you start getting deeper the melee start hitting around 200, but nothing you can handle. Didnt seem muchharder then deep seb to solo and with a group its smooth like butter. Well in nurga anyway, didnt try droga.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up ..  Chardom faction, great loot, great exp, 17ish plat per mob.<br />
<br />
whats not to like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I didn't went to nurga, I spent 2 hours in droga tho.<br />
First thing is that entrance mobs are now darkblue at 65 and are ok xp.<br />
All mob I saw there were running at low life, but aggro range was small at top of Droga. Average hit was 140ish, almost no resist to tugur on those mobs.<br />
Average coin was 10 to 15 pp and no special drop found on trashyard mobs.<br />
After the arch thingy, mobs are tougher.<br />
They begin to hit for 200ish, they have a normal aggro radius (aka large) and have nice MR (I loaded up malos for pulling).<br />
Near the dinning room I found a named up in a room of 4 mob.<br />
I was able to single pull the first mob, but I died on trying to single pull named (all came and resisted slow / root etc).<br />
After my CR (nothing saw invis from what I was able to see), I pulled the closest gobi of the named (I rooted it) and named came alone.<br />
After a malos and a tugur on both (named + rooted mob in room still) I unloaded dots (pant pox + blood of saryrn).<br />
I'd say mob there have around 8-9k hp.. It's a rough estimation from the number of dots I was stacking, my pet dmg and my melee dmg.<br />
Named dropped some 45hp/mana + stat droppable priest neck (level restriction 53).<br />
XP was ok I guess. It was about 2% AA solo kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dunno bout Nurga, looks like the highest mobs in there are light blue to a 65.  But Droga is ok.  I explored a bit there this morning.  Mobs were easy to slay, low hps, bout like a shroom in FG.  The mobs have low aggro range, so u might get two on a pull, but probably not the whole room.  Aggro pulls would be back in style for this dungeon.  Caster mobs are anything but deadly.  They're quite a bit easier and don't do annoying **** like dispelling u very much at all.  Keep one or two fakes up and yer gtg.  The AAxp was surprisingly ok.  Was a valid exp spot actually.  I'd highly recommend this place for PLing lower 50 folks.  A shaman can rip right thru this stuff in a hurry.  <br />
<br />
plat drops varied from nothing to 15pp per mob.  Gems also dropped with frequency.  Good plat farm perhaps, and you can work on yer chardok faction while u exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, looks like I was a bit to soon to write of Nurga just because it has casters. :-)<br />
<br />
Thankfully there are almost no healers (if there are any at all) and the goblins have extremely small aggro range so not much assisting either. Way in the back all the mobs conned darkblue to me at 63. The exp was actually suprisingly good. Strange drops off the named mobs though, nothing that could be used/equipped.</div></div><hr />

Amen brother! Caster mobs imo are 100x easier than melee.. think about it, our mana regen is like no other, which means if they let you cast spells ie not smacking you around, then you are golden.. torp/q yourself dot him and root him, he dies as he nukes your or tries to root you or whatever they try to do usually.. and if you have high resists,.. those nukes for 10 just keep you from meding at all times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Casters are easier to kill than melee mobs...<br />
<br />
1.  Caster mobs have noticably less HPs than melees.<br />
2.  Casters are easy to resist with proper gear (resist gear).<br />
3.  Casters spend their time casting 5-8 second long nukes that do no damage instead of meleeing you for many times the damage.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather fight casters than melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think what you mean is that you would much rather fight a caster one-on-one. Areas that are filled with casters that assist each other are still more difficult than melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not for a shaman.  I'd rather have four casters aggro me at once than four melees.  Casters will cast (duh) which gives me time to control them before my hps --&gt; 0.<br />
Melees will charge in, interrupting my attempts to control them, and it will be a chancy thing for a while.  I better get at least a little bit lucky if they're challenge mobs at all, or there's gonna be trouble.  Caster mobs are much easier.  They hardly touch me with spells anyway.  And my DoTs rip right thru em.  Plus, my mace of pwn will give me my mana back while i kill them.  What's not to love?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And how do you prevent the other casters from healing the one you are trying to kill? And how do you prevent them from gating? Im not saying its impossible but in my experience its not quite as easy as you make it sound.<br />
<br />
But in Nurga it wont matter since the casters cast very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You prevent them from healing by killing healers first.  You prevent them from gating by killing close to spawn point.  Any other questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just occurred to me, I don't recall any cleric-type healers in there.  Shaman, yeah, but the shaman tended to Mal* us repeatedly.  If Radiant Cure didn't get rid of Malo, they'd use Pox of Bertoxxolous or Torrent of Poison.  If Malo was removed, they'd spend their mana putting it back on a couple of us... and then die.  I don't recall any of us getting slowed by the shaman, and I don't recall any of the shaman healing others.  One tried healing himself with Chloroblast, but that was futile.<br />
<br />
One thing of note: all the 60ish seers had Malo.  This being a Kunark dungeon with level 60 mobs, you think SOE would put our spells on the mobs that could use them?  I'd love to have class-appropriate spells added to the loot tables in there.<br />
<br />
As it is, they're very heavy on cash, drop an occasional gem, but the average goblin had nothing else at all.  Whipcrackers had no whips, even.  No more ore, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dunno about anyone else, but I'll take twice as many caster mobs as I would melee mobs.  Much easier to control them than it is meleers.<br />
<br />
Plus as a side benefit, I can mana sieve caster mobs for mana if I'm inclined too.  Nothing like putting blood and breath on and getting the mana back while doing so :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you can magically kill a wanderer close to its spawn? I guess being uber means you have special abilities that I can only dream about.<br />
<br />
And you can kill mobs you can't see? Thats impressive too.<br />
<br />
I was wrong you are right, sorry ;-)</div></div><hr />

Guys guys guys....<br />
<br />
At any city, and in PoK, there are potion vendors. Go there. Buy Cloudy Potions (+/- 10pp). Put the potion in a main inventory spot. Make a hotbutton for it.<br />
<br />
These potions, while not stackable, are INSTANT cast invis. Meaning... you can click it While Running!!! <br />
<br />
&quot;You feel yourself start to appear...&quot;<br />
Click. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have to disagree with the fact that no one has EVER hunted in Nurga / Droga..  Our guild, back when we were young, fought there almost exclusively.  It was especially nice because we almost always had it to ourselves. <br />
<br />
We'd start at the top, and fight our way down to the hidden-swim-to room, and then evac out.  Was a ton of fun.  Checking out the new area is going to be a ton of fun.  Will we fight there regularly?  Hard to say.. I doubt it's as much fun / good experience as HoH or BoT.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is, if you don't like it, don't go there.  More room and less lag for me.  =)  <br />

My impression of Nurga is that its a decent xp zone, if anyone would take the time to go there. I was messing around with my war/shaman duo in there the other day, trying to pop nameds for quest bits. The agro radius there is silly small, even though the mob density is pretty high. The stuff I was hunting was mostly light blue to my 65 warrior, even so, I was gettting visible movement on my aaxp bar with each kill (about half a tick per kill it seemed). It is probably a great exp zone for the 50 something folk now. I had my ranger logged there to track every so often for nameds, and every time I've logged her on there have been people hunting near the zone. Not a lot, usually small groups of 2, typically a melee and a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Went to Droga last weekend, ran into no cleric mobs, but we did not get all the way through either. Down at the entrance to the inner sanctum, mobe went from being dk bl to yellow to lvl 57, and parses showed about 18-20k melee damage to them, along with epic druid and a couple of chanter nukes Re-spawns are fairly quick, so can't get too bogged down in any one area unless you plan on staying there. Most I remember being hit for was just over 200 melee. One time a wizard nuke hit me for full 1100, most of time was half or less. We didn't run into any named, but I'm assuming that they can be found in approx the same places you'd find them before revamp<br />
<br />
In about 2 1/2 hours in the zone, got about 25% of regular exp at level 57. Not Planar, but nothing to sneeze at either, and with much less headaches...just grab 5 friends and have a party</div></div><hr />
