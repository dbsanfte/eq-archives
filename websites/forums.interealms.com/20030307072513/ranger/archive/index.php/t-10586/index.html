1. Introduction<br />
One of my goals as a Ranger since the day I first popped into the world of Norrath and fell off the walkways of Kelethin was to become a Grandmaster Fletcher. Although fletching is not the hardest tradeskill it is far from being the easiest. Grandmastery of the skill requires the patience of a Saint and the pocketbook of a Baron, though the latter requirement can be eased through the help of a domesticated Gnome. <br />
<br />
OOC: If I remember correctly it took around 500pp to get my fletching into the 180s. At  that point I started breaking even or even making a few pp per stack of arrows all the way up to a skill of 202. That is the level that the last &quot;simple&quot; arrow goes trivial. By simple arrow I mean an arrow you can buy the fletch, nock, tip, and shaft directly from a merchant. To increase your skill beyond 202 you can take three routes. The Acrylia arrow route requires a lot of time (or money spent in the bazaar) for component gathering. The Mithril arrow route requires you being a Wood Elf with a some smithing skill and a lot of money. I have heard it takes around 35kpp to get from 202 to 250 skill on Mithril Champion arrows alone. The third route involves making 1-Cam and Compound, 2-Cam Darkwood bows. Like the Mithril arrows these are also horrendously expensive, IF you have to buy your cams from an NPC vendor. If you have a pocket Gnome you can actually break even going from 202 - 215 skill, and then make a tidy little sum going from 215 - 235 skill, which will finance most of the cost to finish the final stretch form 236 to 250 with Mithril or Acrylia arrows. This method is not cost free however. It will take around 2k upfront to take this route. This guide is basically my experience of leveling up a Gnome Enchanter to 16 from a Ranger point of view.<br />
<br />
2. How to go About Capturing a Gnome<br />
If you travel to the land of the Steamfront Mountains you will find all sorts of different Gnomes making their home in the city of Ak'Anon. Ak'Anon is an underground city that most Dwarves would find comfortable except for the constant racket of all the mechanical clockwork servants. Remember to watch your head while walking through this city. Gnomes are unnervingly short so some of the city passages have rather low ceilings, and that should mean something coming from a vertically challenged Wood Elf like myself.<br />
 <br />
2.1 Picking a Class<br />
All Gnomes have the inherent capability to tinker but Gnomes with certain occupations are more desirable in my opinion. I think the best class for a pocket Gnome is an Enchanter. If you feel no need for the extra benefits an Enchanter would bring and have the means available you can always pick a Gnome from a less sophisticated line of work. A Gnomish warrior will bash his way to an acceptable level of Tinkerhood (OOC: need to get to level 16) very quickly in a Fungus Scaled Covered Tunic or Iskar Ceremonial Regen Breastplate. Since I did not have the funds available to do this when I was raising my Gnome I  will not go into those details.<br />
<br />
2.2 Basic Qualities to Look For<br />
If you do pick a Gnome of the Enchanter class, the quarter height Phantasmist will not only be highly intelligent , making tradeskill advancement go much quicker, but will also be able to eventually perform other valuable task for you such as enchanting metal and clay (OOC: At level 16 the Enchanter can enchant clay, electrum, and silver I believe which is useful if you do other tradeskills besides fletching). I would recommend picking a well rounded yet intelligent and amiable looking Gnome to be your servant (OOC: When you create your new character first get all stats to at least 75, except str, then put the rest in int and maybe a few in cha). You also need to consider that once a Gnome has been tamed they are very hard to get rid of and will follow you around everywhere constantly talking about nonsense. Therefore I would recommend picking one that believes in no particular god. I made the mistake of picking one that is a devout worshiper of Brell and sometimes her long winded sermons can go on for hours (OOC: The best deity for an Enchanter is agnostic, NPCs can see a PCs deity through the illusion making it worthless in some cases. I discovered this after I had leveled my Gnome to 12 and did not feel like starting over). <br />
<br />
2.3 Dressing Up Your Gnome<br />
Recently the Eldritch Initiative, the Gnome magic caster guild in Ak'Anon, has added many new quest to help young Gnomes just starting out. I highly recommend helping your Gnome complete these quest since nearly every piece of awarded armor will boost its intelligence. (OOC: The quests start with Xalirilan Zarinokosalio. If you want to be a little more efficient check out Allakazam's for the quest info and get all the parts at once. What I did was collect all the droppable components with my ranger and then transferred them over to the Gnome. For the no-drop items, like the Kobald furs, I would rampage through Kobolds camps and then camp out. Then I would log on my enchanter to loot the pieces).<br />
<br />
3. Seasoning Your Gnome<br />
Although even 1st season Gnomes can tinker with average skill you will want to season your Gnome a bit so it can make cams for you more efficiently (OOC: All Gnomes start out with a skill of 50 in tinkering but the failure rate of cams at that skill level is dismal. A skill level of around 100 is required to make cams with a 95% success rate. In order for a Gnome to get skill ups in tinkering beyond the initial 50 tinkering starting points, the Gnome needs to be at least level 16. After level 16 there are no more restrictions. I think you can make a level 16 Gnome into a Grandmaster tinker if you desire).<br />
<br />
At this point I am going to stop doing the in-character shtick because its just too silly.<br />
<br />
3.1 The Purest Route<br />
This method is simple: don't twink and level up to 16 just like you did with your ranger during the first two months after you first bought the game (that's roughly how long it took me anyways).  Some people don't like twinking and they do have a point that it ruins some of the fun. I was going to try and level up my Enchanter the hard way but after I saw the stats on the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt my resolve to do so went right out the window. The BFT made my chargeless Raincaller that I had been using for the last 10 odd levels look like a sling shot and I was suddenly in a big hurry. If you are in the anti-twinking camp you might want to skip to the next section because some of the following advice may make you cough up your skull: its pretty shameless.<br />
<br />
3.2 The Somewhat Quick Way (How I Did It)<br />
I fast forwarded my Gnome to level 9 with questing: basically lots and lots of bone chips, Orc belts, and Crushbone shoulder pads all collected by my ranger (If you need descriptions of how to do these quest just look on a spoiler site for quest starting in Kaladim). Another quest you should do a few times is the Traders of The Haven quest in Shadow Haven. This quest will improve your standing (faction plus a faction boosting necklace) with the Shadow Haven merchants so you will get the best prices on your Tinkering supplies. The quest is basically has you run some errands to the Bazaar and Fungus Grove. The mobs in Echo caverns on the way to Fungus Grove (Booglings and Needlites) are very mean and will kill your little Gnome in a few swipes but its not a problem for the patient player. I did this quest at level 1 with no SOW and no invise. Most mobs can be avoided by walking around them and the ones directly in your path will eventually wander off. Make sure you stay away from the un-targetable tentacle things on the walls in Echo Caverns, they will try to root you if you get to close.<br />
<br />
Why stop questing at level 9? Well one reason is at that level the Crushbone shoulder pads start showing diminishing returns. The real reason is that at level 9 you can take your Gnome to the most hyper-fast experience zone in Everquest: Pauldal Caverns.<br />
<br />
Before taking your Gnome to the Moon go and pick all the spells it will need up to level 16 with your ranger. All the regular ones can be found in the Felwithe or Ak'Anon caster guilds. Just like some ranger spells are in the druid guild hall, some enchanter spells are in the magician and wizard guild halls. The level 8, 12, and 16 enchanter pet spells can be found in High Pass Hold.  Breeze can be found at the docks in Firiona Vie. Also make sure to pick up some Tiny Daggers from the enchanter guild because they will be used to summon your enchanter's pet or animation. Tiny Daggers can also be found in Shadow Haven in a few places. Just look on the EQ Atlas map for the vendor locations.<br />
<br />
After your Gnome comes down from his quest-leveled high, take it to the bazaar and find a friendly enchanter to case Kodiac's Endless Intellect on you (this is one off those shameless parts). The going rate for high level characters is 100pp a cast but, no one ever turned down my 30pp offering  as a level 9 character. Some players even buffed me for free. One chain-casting-on-yourself session with KEI should be enough to get all your lagging casting skills maxxed out. Since you have KEI and really do not need to worry about mana just go for the quickest casting spell in each school of magic. This will bring back painful memories of practicing conjuration with Dance of the Firefiles as a ranger.<br />
<br />
While practicing spell casting in the Bazaar try to find some cheap int gear for your Gnome. The /bazaar function has driven the prices way down on low level gear and I was able to get my Gnome to 163 int with less than 1kpp. The high int will help with leveling as well as making tinkering skill-ups come faster. You can always resell the gear later if you do not plan on playing the character past level 16, just don't sell the +int items until after you have mastered tinkering with the Gnome. <br />
<br />
One other great piece of gear for your little Enchanter is an Embalmers Skinning Knife. It procs a stack of bandages (partial stack at these low levels) which helps reduce downtime a lot. My Gnome borrowed a knife that my ranger happen to have sitting in the bank.<br />
<br />
Next, bind in Shadow Haven and then invise up head over to the Shadeweaver's Thicket zone line of Pauldel Caverns. If you can, get another KEI before you leave the Bazaar. It will make the levels scream by. This is not that critical though since leveling is still very fast in PC even without KEI. Also you will most likely die a lot while figuring out how to play the Enchanter at first so you will be rebuffing yourself many times.<br />
<br />
The Shadeweaver's Thicket zone line is in the south east part of the zone. If you want to get there with out dying and you will probably need a map. For me the zone was hard to navigate at first because it is so different from anything in the old world: its dark with lots of bumps and edges. Also one note: unlike Rangers, Enchanters get invise at level 4 that works indoors. I did not realize this until level 10 and cringed thinking back to the time I asked for an invise for my level 9 enchanter in the Bazaar. I am sure a lot of people had good laugh at my expense over that one. This leads to another note: Print out an enchanter spell list from one of the spoiler sites. It will give you a more complete description of the spells then presented here. <br />
<br />
Once you are over at the hunting spot by the zone line you will be going after the various Muck Diggers and Mushrooms that con at least blue. When I was there I would just run around the caves and the first pond nearest the zone line attacking mobs. That way the zone is always close by for a handy escape. <br />
<br />
The beetles are social but there is enough spacing to take them on one at a time. If you do get an add just mez it: Remember your playing an enchanter not a ranger. One time I formed a group and found myself trying to &quot;Ranger Mez&quot; the occasional adds we got with root. I was doing a good job of it (I even had a &quot;rooted&quot; hotkey set up in group chat) but after a few minutes a group member politely asked me why I was rooting instead of mezzing. After I told everybody that my main was a Ranger we all had a nice chuckle.<br />
<br />
The mobs do have some loot worth a few gold pieces to a vender but I never really bothered looting much since my Gnome was very twinked.<br />
<br />
Basically my spell gems looked as follows when fighting. Use your printed out spell list to find the highest spell of each line.<br />
1 - Your best shielding spell (Minor Shielding 1, Lesser Shielding 8,  Shielding 16)<br />
2 - Your best AC buff (Haze 4, Mist 12)<br />
3 - Mez (Mesmerize 4, Enthrall 16)<br />
4 - Your best magic debuff (Tashan 4)<br />
5 - Your best pet spell (Pendril's 1, Juli's 4, Mircyl's 8, Kilan's 12, Shalee's 16)<br />
6 - Your bet damage over time spell (Shallow Breath 1, Suffocating Sphere 4, Choke 12)<br />
7 - Your bet Direct Damage Spell (Chaotic Feedback 8, Sanity Warp 16)<br />
8 - Root (Root 8)<br />
<br />
The basic strategy is to summon your pet, buff self, buff pet, find a single mob and melee (or lead off with the Tash magic resist debuff) until your pet comes to your rescue. You have very little control over your pet and it will only fight if you are attacked. After the pet engages cast your DOT and then maybe one or two DDs. Let the pet tank for a bit longer and when the pet gets down to half health jump back in and melee yourself to finish it off. The idea is to finish the fight with you at half a bubble from full health and your pet at half heath. Med until the pet is back to full and repeat until level 16. I would med back to full when I was at 2 blue bubbles of mana. I saved that mana for a quick mez or DD when I needed to save my pet from dying. <br />
<br />
Usually your pet can hold the agro off you pretty well at this level but if not just root mob and back off. It the same method you use as a Ranger when your group's main tank has trouble holding aggro. Also if you have KEI its almost easier to root and then DOT, DD, DD, DD, DD.... with the pet just playing bodyguard. Those mushrooms and beetles will fall very fast if you chain cast your DD spell.<br />
 <br />
At around level 12 or so move to the north side of the zone to the Hollowshade Moor zone line. The general strategy is the same and the beetles and mushrooms there will take you to 16. At 16 your done fighting because your high enough to start tinkering. If your having fun you can stay though, the experience in Paldual Caverns is great up into the mid twenties on the Bandit camps. Note: stay away from the Phlarg Fiends because they have a nasty disease that last forever.<br />
<br />
3.3.The Quick Way (keep questing)<br />
Basically do the first 10 levels as in the previous part and then after Crushbone pads dry up use the Cordance of Research lightstone quest in North Karna to get to level 16. Your Gnome will have the combat skills of a fire beetle but it dose not matter if your only going to make cams. <br />
<br />
3.4 The Really Quick Way (Have You No Shame!)<br />
Hirer a druid or get a druid friend to power level you in Pauldal.  If your in a hurry this is obviously the quickest way to go but I would recommend against this. In Paldaul even without KEI it will only take a few nights of playing to get to level 16 and you will have a lot of the fun playing the Gnome. Yes I said it, although my main will always be a Ranger I did have a lot of fun playing an Enchanter for a few nights. <br />
<br />
4.0 Sending the Gnome to Tinkering School<br />
Head back into Shadow Haven after Dinging into level 16. There is a Gnome Tinker merchant named Marchap Biddinight that has every thing you need to get started. <br />
<br />
Before buying supplies in mass quantities you should have done the Traders of the Haven quest a few times (see above). Also invest in a few +25 charisma Opal Encrusted Steins. I got mine for 50pp each in the Bazaar. The key to getting the best prices is to have your faction at indifferent or better and your charisma above 106. According to the good folks at EQTraders increasing your faction above indifferent does not matter and increasing your charisma above 107 does not matter except for greedy merchants (need 136+ or so for them). We are not dealing with greedy merchants so 107 will do. You can test if you are getting the best prices by browsing a merchant that sells Perdots, the best price you can get is 10.5pp or so.<br />
<br />
Buy a Toolbox or get a smith to make you one and you will be ready to start skilling up your Gnome. I skilled my Gnome up to 75 in tinkering on Standard Bow Cams and then up to 102 on Stalking Probes. All of the non tinkering components, such as the bottle and Gnomish Spirits, are also available in Shadow Haven as well. You may wonder why I got my tinker beyond the cam trivial level of 75. Well even though cams are trivial to a level 75 tinker, the fail rate at that level will severely eat into your pocket book. To get the 95% success rate you need you must raise the tinkers skill above 100. The cost of doing so will be earned back many times over when you can regularly make 19 of 20 cams instead of 15 of 20.<br />
<br />
The recipe for Bow Cams is:<br />
1 Gears <br />
1 Grease<br />
1 Gnomish Bolts <br />
<br />
The recipe for a Staking Probe is:<br />
2 Gears<br />
1 Bottle<br />
1 Metal Rod<br />
1 Firewater<br />
<br />
The Recipe for Firewater is:<br />
1 Gnomish Spirit<br />
1 Water Flask<br />
<br />
Keep the Cams you actually make while skilling up so you can transfer them to your Ranger but sell back the Stalking Probes. You may wish to transfer over one or two of the Stalking Probes to your Ranger as well, the effect (Eye of Zomm) is the closest thing your Ranger will ever get to having a pet.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you are getting the best prices for the cam parts. If you are being over charged see the above section about faction and charisma:<br />
Gears at best prices are 47pp per stack.<br />
Grease at best prices are 147pp per stack.<br />
Gnomish Bolts at best prices are 58pp per stack.<br />
<br />
Also you can save some money by slowly working your way up through the Tinkering trivial chart by only moving onto the next highest item rather than jumping right to Cams and Probes but I but I did not think it was worth the extra time. <br />
<br />
Also there are a few tools that improve Tinkering skill much like the Geerloks improve all the other tradeskills. I think they are rather expensive and do not really make much of an impact at sub 200 levels. You would be better served by spending your money to get your tinkers base skill above 100.<br />
<br />
5.0 Putting your Gnome to Work<br />
You now have a cam making machine. Transfer over some fire emeralds from your ranger using the methods described in the later section to give the Gnome some starting cash. Have the Gnome send over 20 Cams at a time and occasionally have the Ranger send back some completed bows for the Gnome to sell to finance more cam supplies.<br />
<br />
6.0 Single Account Item Transfers (i.e. Fake &quot;Two-box&quot; Fletching)<br />
DISCLAIMER: It is Verants/SonyOnline's position that anything dropped on the ground no longer belongs to you and you are lucky if you get it back. If some other player wanders by and takes your stuff during a transfer they will do nothing to help you. That being said, the only time I have ever lost items is when my dial-up ISP crapped out.<br />
<br />
No friend is going to remain your friend very long if you ask them to help you transfer 1000s of cams between your characters so if you do not have two accounts  you might as well get used to the idea of single account transfers right from the beginning. You can transfer items using stationary tradeskill containers in cities but I like the drop method better. <br />
<br />
The drop method is very simple. Find a VERY out of the way spot (a place with no PCs or NPCs wandering by) and move both characters there. Put the items you want to send over the other character in a droppable container. Sit down and hit camp. Wait until the camp counter gets down to 5 seconds. Drop your container. Wait nervously for the character select screen to pop back up. Log in your second character.  Pick up the items.<br />
<br />
If you find the right spot there is roughly zero chance of somebody wandering by and running off with your stuff. The spot you pick must be clear of NPCs or wandering NPCs because they WILL pick up items they come across. The only time I have got burned was when my dial-up ISP stopped working during a transfer and I could not get back in for an hour. If an item stays on the ground for too long, five minutes or so, it will poof. The 2kpp in compound darkwood bows I lost on my one screw up is what finally prompted me to get a cable modem. This is the one advantage of using tradeskill containers, items left in stationary tradeskill containers will stay there for hours.<br />
<br />
Also the best transfer drop container I have found is the Fier'dal Fletching Kit. Its graphic when dropped looks like a small brown bowl , which is much better than the humungous,  &quot;please pick me up and run away&quot; bag graphic of deluxe tool boxes and tailored backpacks. The fletching kit sits half &quot;in the floor&quot; when dropped unlike the other bags which almost float above the floor. The kit is a 1.0 weight, 10 slot container that is especially hard to see on the floor in Shadow Haven. If your going to be making a BFT you are probably a Wood Elf Smith also. As you skill up to 163 in Smithinig on these fletching kits, put a few on your bow cam making Gnome to do transfers.<br />
<br />
You can transfer also money to your Tinker by buying Fire Emeralds with your ranger, dropping them on the ground in a quiet out of the way spot, and logging in your Gnome to pick them up.<br />
<br />
A final note: do NOT do drop trades in Ak'Anon. If your drop something in the Gnome city it will instantly poof and you will get a message about a clockwork cleaner scurring out of a floor panel and picking up the item.<br />

Inspired by this post, i went to Shadowhaven today only to find that the Bow vendor and TInkering vendor are no longer there.<br />
<br />
I did some searching here and at EQTraders, but couldnt find anything. <br />
<br />
So I went on a search of the city, and lo and behold, I found two new vendors selling bow and arrow fletching supplies in Shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
Junun Rawkins sells bowyery supplies at loc 251/966.    His partner, Tabart Taliforth stands next to him selling arrow supplies.<br />
<br />
They are in a small room just west of the bazaar zone-in area.  Defender Yoel is outside the area, and there is a a gnome vendor named named Bilkel Biddinight outside their shop.<br />
<br />
In my searching i found a &lt;a href=http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfletching.showMessageRange?topicID=705.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20 target-_blank&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on eqtraders that indicated the Tinkering vendor is also gone from SH, but someone suggested there is one in Echo Caverns.  I have not confirmed this.<br />
<br />
Thought you might want to update the guide.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
