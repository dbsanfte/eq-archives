<br />
I'm making a shaman twink and have approx 10k to spend.<br />
<br />
Wis has gotten fairly cheap (thanks acrylia).  But, how important is Wis really fo shaman?  I have Heard that HP is King for shaman, but at what point do you sacrafice Wis for HP? <br />
<br />
6ac 65 HP rings or 7 wis rings?<br />
<br />
2ac 25 Hp 35 mana earrings or 4 wis earrings?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm making a Barbarian so there will be no natural regen but dont think blowing 10k on a Iksar BP is worth it since thats all i'm spending.<br />
<br />
Any equipment advice will be appreciated.  thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/sigh  there are a large number of treads detailing this very question.  The &quot;search&quot; button is your friend, try it.  <br />
<br />
Wis is not very important, Ac and HP are.<br />
<br />
Blow 4k (or so) for the Ikky BP ( you will be happy you did) and get the Ac 6 65 Hp rings.   Most importantly have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes i would go ac/hp before wisdom  you stay alive more when you slow and also at lvl 20 or so (dont rember) we get canablize and dont bother getting canablize 2  its not worht the effort <br />
<br />
if your willing to sacrfice that whole 10k for a potc earring then go for it  i have mine and i like it <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy the iksar bp, the 6AC/65HP rings, imbued ivory earrings, and some cheap armor.  It is worth it.  Regen + canni = heaven.  10K sounds high though.  I paid 8K for one a year or so ago and now they are like 5K on my server.    <br />
<br />
You can put some stats on your chest that improved your game .01% or you can add a mini health and mana factory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nikki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks, I used the search (after you told me to) and found some good info.  I have always wondered though why does HP &gt; wis for shaman?  Is it because they can regen HP faster than mana then turn HP into mana?  For that to work the ratio would have to be pretty good i'm  guessing.<br />
<br />
On Vaz Iksar BP ~ 10k  - and they sell pretty fast at that price.  I may eventually go camp the cycle for a few weeks with my bard and hope to get one, but 10k is too much to pay for one IMO.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips.  I am completely a Noob with regards to shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The ratio is about 2HP = 1 mana - the exact figure depends on which canni spell you use.<br />
<br />
Imagine the combination of iksar BP (5 hp) and regrowth (15hp) = that's 20 hp a tick, or in other terms, flowing thought 10.</div></div><hr />
