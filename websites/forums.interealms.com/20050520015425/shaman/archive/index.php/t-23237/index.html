<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Runspeed3 and either regen# or metabloism3 depending on which you prefer if you use stat food and ride a mount a lot I would go for the metabolism. Once that is done get Mental Clarity3 and then Massive Cannibalization. It is a game changing ability but after that you are pretty much on your own and it really really depends on your play style. There are plenty of other threads discussing what others have done depending on their seperate circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like Rehunh said, get Can 5, then come back :) <br />
<br />
Just to clarify, Mental Clarity 3 (2/4/6) is the PRE-REQ for Can 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys.. doin the regen metabolism route...  to get to clarity then canni 5 then hopefully MGB that will help my guild out alot..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely agree with the above.  Only thing that I wanted to add that the AA to get after Canni5 is VP3, adds a new ability (knock back root) which is very useful in a number of situations.  After that Suspend Minion can be very useful (more useful when they add the AA so you can zone with a suspended pet :-) if you need to invis in a zone.  After that, lots of fairly useful AA but most tend to be incremental improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say that 2 AA for RC 1 is a very good deal. With the first level of RC, you can remove a bunch of annoying stuff (AE tash) from your entire group with just a click of a button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes RC1 is a great deal for the price. VP3 is flat out awesome for the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know where you are in progression, but I would definately suggest doing LR5.  That AA itself will change your game play.  Mitigating incoming damage helped me stay alive just long enough for the MT to regain aggro.  It will help you live that much longer to run away or maybe get a heal off.  It really increases your odds when you reach the EP range.  Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) Run 3<br />
2) Regen 3<br />
<br />
(First Class AA title)<br />
<br />
3) MC 3 (total AA's 12) (Opening up Archtypes)<br />
<br />
4) VP 3 (if you need more CC)<br />
5) Can 5 (if you need more mana)<br />
<br />
6) Combat Agility 3 Pre-req for: <br />
7) LR 5<br />
<br />
8) ND 3<br />
9) CS 3<br />
10) ID 3<br />
<br />
EDIT: LR does NOT mitigate incoming damage, it offers you a chance to be missed COMPLETELY. (Contrary to what the poster above said). ID is what the above poster was referring to.  Also a very useful AA.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is your Magelo up to date? If it is and you have 1648 HP and 767 AC at level 65, then Canni 5 can be a situationally dangerous thing to get. And if your spell list is up to date and you don't have Q, then it's going to be even tougher to survive when you draw low HP agro. I would recommend re-evaluating your gear options first.</div></div><hr />

Dasha, I would recommend that you look in the bazaar for HP gear.  You have a lot of WIS gear, and I think you are selling yourself short because of this.  I follow the philosophy of HP/STA &gt; WIS.<br />
<br />
First off, I would replace your rings.  Valorium Ring of Gallantry would be a nice addition to your equipment ( HP +65, STA +8  as well as give you some much needed AC ).  These could be pricey on your server.  If you do not have a lot of cash, I would search in the bazaar for rings by HP.  If there is something that is in your price range, I suggest you get it.  OR, you can farm the pieces in PoV.  The Golems drop the Metallic Liquid, the Razors drop the talon, and you will need a brick of valorium.  I am sure you could find a jeweler to help you with the combine for a nominal fee.<br />
<br />
Second, earrings.  Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.  ( HP +70, STA +8, and AC ).  These could be pricey on your server.  If you do not have a lot of cash, I would search in the bazaar for earrings by HP.  If there is something that is in your price range, I suggest you get it.  As with the Ring of Gallantry, you could farm the components to make the earrings in Plane of Tactics.  If you are not Tactics flagged, you can do the side quest in PoS by killing Diaku.  There are four Diaku that drops a quarter piece of a medillion.  Once you collect all four, go to Wembly and turn it in.  Make sure you bring a group with you that is not flagged for Tactics.  I say this because this flags your whole group for tactics.<br />
<br />
Third, gloves.  Leaf Scale Gloves.  Again, it has HP and better AC than your current set.<br />
<br />
Forth, Neck.<br />
<br />
Fifth, Face.<br />
<br />
Sixth, Boots.  For now, I would switch to your epic boots.  It has some STA on it as well as some resists.<br />
<br />
Seventh, Primary.  I would replace your current weapon with something that is more stat friendly.  If you have your epic, I would suggest that for now.  If not, I would work on it.  It seems that you started it because I saw the Fur Boots in your inventory.<br />
<br />
Eighth, Secondary.  I would look at getting a shield.  The Tactician's Bulwark would be a nice addition to your gear.  It drops in Tactics, or you can purchase it in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Since I see that you hunt in BoT ( you have the ring in your magelo ), you can camp various areas to try to win some ornate for you.  In BoT, you could get Gloves, Sleeves, Bracers, Pants, and in the Towers, BP.  An alternative to Ornate would be LDON's.  You can work toward earning adventure points in Everfrost to gear yourself.  Also, you can work towards earning runes for your level 65 spells.  The two biggest spells I would try to get is Malos and Q.<br />
<br />
Overall, you went heavy on the WIS gear.  To use the power that SHM possess, you need to beef up your HP.  I am sure you can get decent upgrades for HP in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure that you have canni iv spell memmed and cast it til your fingers bleed.<br />
<br />
Finally, for cash, if you are keyed for Sebilis, this will be a nice zone for you to play in.  It will give you some experience in dungeon crawling as well as earning cash to either: 1) buy spells or 2) replace gear.  Another good area, and it has some decent upgrades for you, would be Droga.  There are quite a few threads on the boards about Droga, and I would take the time to read them.<br />
<br />
My 2pp.<br />
<br />
Enjoy playing your Shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks so much I appreciate your tips..<br />
<br />
I will have to go do that..<br />
<br />
I will have to manuver some gear around..  Got my rogue that Im sure I can throw some of it to Dasha since I semi retired the rogue to play Dasha full time..<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill post Dasha's magelo with my rogue's gear on her...<br />

<br />
Looking good so far.<br />
<br />
Things you can take from your ROG still:<br />
<br />
Blood Earring of Rage<br />
Mushroom Veil<br />
<br />
Slots, when you have cash, to concentrate replacing will be:<br />
<br />
Neck, Arms, and Feet.<br />
<br />
Lozidal Shields are nice, but they do not have any HP.  You can use it for now, I did for a while, but you might want to find something with HP in the future - bag the Lozidal until you need an EB device.<br />
<br />
With KEi/VoQ, horse, [ when you get canni v ], and canni iv, you should not have trouble mana-wise - unless you do a lot of healing.  Now you can safely canni v when you are buffless [ when geared of course :P ]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks again Korelen..  I really appreciate your help.  I am a casual player of 5 years turning into a hardcore/raid person now..  WoW everything is different..  I was thinkin of quiting EQ cause it was boring now I have had the breath of life put into me....  <br />
<br />
I will go try to get the tactitians bulkwart thingie..  Prolly start grouping in GoD zones to work on those spells..<br />
<br />
Again thanks so much for you help and pointers.  Much appreciated from this old Shaman / new Shaman lol.....<br />

<br />
As you continue on your path, you will find out that each Shaman plays their character differently.  There are a few things that we agree on, but that is the beauty of being a Shaman.  Our arsenal is so vast that there is really no wrong way of doing things - solo, grouping, etc.  There are a few instances in which being a Shaman is a pain - for example, high end GoD zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Catching up late, but here's my advice on AAs:<br />
<br />
1. Run3 and either Metab3 or Regen3. You'll really want Run3.<br />
<br />
2. MC3 and Can5. No question.<br />
<br />
3. RC1, SC1 and VP3. They are that good.<br />
<br />
4. Playstyle will determine where you go from here. Lots of posts about the others, just search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Catching up late, but here's my advice on AAs:<br />

<br />
I agree here, though SC1 I'd put as a lower priority than RC1 and, at least, VP1. Granted, the order I went in is quite a bit different, though, being a non-raider myself, my magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80537) might be able to give you a good jumping point.<br />
<br />
The only thing, from my short (very, I can stand about a week and get bored for months...) raiding stints in that list, is the PoP charm upgrades. Aside from that, everything else is one groupable (sometimes hard LDoNs) or soloable (including bazaar purchases).<br />
<br />
The only thing anyone may have problems equipping, or getting, is the Officer's Cloak of Service (Vah Shir only) and the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl (requires you take over all 9 grimling camps in, obviously, Grimling, then take out the Vah Shir (scowls, no faction hit) in the upper most camp - I did it with 2 rogues, myself, and a botted cleric, with the owner off on an RZ kill)<br />
<br />
One more Everfrost win to open the 1492 stuff there, but hopefully it might give a good springboard for the non-raider to get a good plan going without feeling completely useless for a while (the helm was a temporary upgrade really, but for 442 Mistmoore points, it's not too shabby).<br />
<br />
My AA choices might be a bit weird (no Spirit Call, at all), but they work for my situation so far. I don't find the urge to play all that often anymore, so I just squeeze in what I can, when I can, when I feel like it. If you have questions on where something came from, my suggestion would be to check allakhazam for info, but if there's nothing there, feel free to ask and I'll try to dig up where it came from. (I haven't upgraded anything in a while actually, finally being 1 win away from Everfrost1492, will finally get rid of that Tae Ew Chain Tunic once I get the 1492 available).<br />
<br />
Hope it helps a little bit. (I've never been a fast leveler either, took nearly 2 years to get to 65, year and a half of regular playing around, but my skills reflect the slow level process and I get commended on it regularly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">3. RC1, SC1 and VP3. They are that good.<br />
<br />
<br />
You should have ND3 ranked above these.  Receiving 10% boost in HP will help you a lot when you need canni safely.<br />
<br />
I purchased SC3 later in my career.  I did not see it worth to get it in my first 100 or so AAs.<br />
<br />
RC3 is something every priest should have.  I remember grinding for that when the guild I was in was trying to kill Grummus.  I use this AA all the time.<br />
<br />
VP3 is another AA I purchased later in my career.  I am on the fence with this because one half tells me - &quot;I should have gotten this AA sooner&quot;, and the other half says - &quot;See, you did not need to get it then&quot;.  If you solo a lot, then this will do wonders for you.<br />
<br />
Not including the standard path to get to canni v.<br />
<br />
Generic Path<br />
--------------------<br />
1. ND 3<br />
    a. 10% HP<br />
2. RC 3 ( Or at least a rank in it )<br />
    a. Ability to cure a plithera of ailments<br />
3. CA 3 / LR 5<br />
    a. Melee Avoidance  ( for those times that slow is resisted )<br />
4. SCR 3 / SCRM<br />
    a. 50% extension to buffs<br />
5. SCM 3<br />
    a. 30% chance to increase the use of specialization ( mana efficiency )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">These guys are giving advice for their particular play style. I would say for someone who is casually raiding once in a while, with less than 32 people, to get AA in this order:<br />
regen 3 - hps for canni<br />
motab3 - food for horse (buy a horse NOW)<br />
<br />
mc3 - ft is good, pre-req as well.<br />
canni5 - mana yummy.<br />
nd3 - you need hps, in your situation nothing else is more important.<br />
scm - this is THE premiere mana preserve, get it!<br />
<br />
That's a nice chunk of AA. The rest is all situational, rc1 is nice for 2aa, crit dots, vp, all nice / handy. See you when you get those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for your advice khozik..  Right now I am trying to get into the guild Freedom Guard on the povar server they raid about twice a week..  From all over just yestarday they killed the emp in ssra on there first try woot...  I am done with the boring casual route thats what made me take a break from EQ and try other MMORPG's wow what a mistake there...     I am an aggresive shaman player I am always doin something in grps or raids keep buffs up slow everything even if it dies in 10 secs..  Who here hates seeing there mana bar full..  I for one hate it when my mana bar is full and im either in a group or raid force gosh that bugs me..  Anyone else think its wierd that when you canni at 100 mana it goes to 99 hmmmm weird.....</div></div><hr />
