<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I'm about to hit 45, a friend of mine just offered me MQ of chain legs AND arms for 5k! I would need to get gems and 4k more. I was wondering if I should sell my jbb to buy the mq's and then try to buy another with the money left over, Ive never used the jbb before so I dont know what Its like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't do it.  JBB &gt; mq armor at 45.<br />
<br />
'nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NOOOOOoooooooooo don't do it.    You are just about to be able to see the impact of a JBB.   Wait till you hit ... say 48 and have used it for awhile ... before selling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuxman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No offense but are you out of your mind?????? The jbb imho is by far the best twink item in the game for a shamen. Hell i love mine better than my epic, you have no idea how powerful that item is. DO NOT SELL IT!!@!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont sell JBB.<br />
Having MQ armor from Thurg = 5k<br />
Having JBB at lvl 45 = PRICELESS<br />
<br />
I got mine at lvl 47 and it was overpowering enough at that level . . . can't imagine how spiffy it would be at 45 /drool.<br />
<br />
JBB is easily the most class defining piece of armor at lvl 45.   You could have gimp armor at that level and still outlevel anyone just by having a JBB.<br />
<br />
*Edit*  A guy contacted me two nights ago out of the blue, asked if I had a JBB, then asked if I would trade it to him for RL money.  I declined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you do it, you'll regret it.  Take your JBB butt to RM and solo TONS of HGs with it to land the 5k.  Not the best exp, but by far the best cash.  Better still, take your JBB butt to SolA and loot FS weapons by the bucketload while your JBB lands all the time for max (2-4 JBB blasts=FS weapon, free money for no mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sell it sell it sell it!!!!<br />
<br />
See if you can get payment in bonechips....like 100k stacks or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol krakster<br />
<br />
p.s. don't sell it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're an Iksar, by all means SELL IT!<br />
<br />
If not, keep it.  Don't sell it for any amount of money...or bone chips.  You'll regret it.  I got my JBB at 51, and it's really cut my down time considerably.  I can only wonder what it would have been like at 45.  I had the money for it at level 45, but it took me 6 levels to find a seller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lol,<br />
<br />
no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Take the bracer to RM and solo giants.  5 Hours = about 5k pp.  Then you can get your MQs and keep your bracer.<br />
<br />
