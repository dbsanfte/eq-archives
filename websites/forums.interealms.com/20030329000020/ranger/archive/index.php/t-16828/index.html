<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the hardened mixture and the bowl dealy ready to turn in to Ella. Alot of people tell me I have the hardest part of the Swiftblade part done. Is this true?<br />
<br />
Also, Im currently looking for a guild (Fennin Ro if anyone is recruiting :D ), so I guess attempting VSR is kinda outta the question right now. How much easier is he after he's respawned?<br />
<br />
Last one.... the part of the quest where I have to goto PoA, what kind of a force would I need for this? Ive never been on a Raid (ive been anti-social thus far) so I dont even know anything about what to expect.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A large style raid for PoA, as its pretty deep in there, unless raiding 24/7 it might take a day or two or more(logging off and then on again).And what do you mean, is VSR easier after he respawned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ehh, I got confused about the difference between VS and VSR. Thats all cleared up now, thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
Is the stone I need from PoA on the 5th or 7th island?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5th from memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">4th Island I beleive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Essence Tamer that drops the stone is on the 5th island.  The easiest way to get it is just to buy a multi-quest for the stone.  It tends to drop so frequently when you go to PoA that most guilds that have been there more than once or twice have at least one sitting around.  Barring that, find some friends or a good guild, and you can take care of this in a few hours.  3 groups max can get to the 5th island and take care of the tamers for you (though now, with added levels and spells you could probably get by with 2 solid groups).  As for VSR, I did it with 15 level 50-60's, including a 60 warrior tank.  With the proper people, it's a 3-5 person fight, but 2 groups of moderately equipped 57+ should be able to take him without incident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">5th isle? Sweet. This guild im applying to is letting me come with them tomarrow to PoS and they are going to the 5th isle. Maybe they will let me loot one. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Teon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have friends that go to Howling Stones often in order to kill Druseilla Sathir ( Spirit Wracked Cord Quest ) and she drops a necklace; I hear you can turn the necklace into VSR and he will give you the green pulsating stone before poofing.  No fights, no 10min preps, no worries.  However, this is usually frowned upon by other players since killing him produces 2 stones where as the necklace simply gives you one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can anyone else confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The rumor is that Drusella drops a &quot;phylactery&quot; which, when turned in to VSR, causes him to give you one pulsing green stone and then poof.  This is completely unconfirmed, I don't think it's ever been anything more than just a rumor.   Killing the VSR-spawned VS is just about as easy as getting to and killing Drusella anyway, if not easier.</div></div><hr />
