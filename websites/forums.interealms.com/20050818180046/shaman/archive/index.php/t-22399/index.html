<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is a sort of decent graphics card to use for EQ 2? I was promised one for my b-day. I do not want to hurt my mothers wallet, and i only want one that meets the requirements for EQ 2. I looked at the ATI Radeon x600, but I dont know any prices for them, so could anyone who knows a bunch about this sorta stuff help me out? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">64MB meets the requirements, but from the feedback so far people with 256MB cards still have to stare at the floor most of the time.  It will definitely be easier to determine closer to release date what &quot;true&quot; requirements will be.  I would wait it out or just get an ATI 256 Pro if you are getting impatient :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seriously if you want less headache and guaranteed compatability buy an Nvidia card...<br />
<br />
(its no coincidence that nvidia logo is displayed on the EQ installer)<br />
<br />
However, you are shooting for performance in a yet-to-be-released game, if you want to be able to run tomorrows games, you have to have todays top-end cards... Its gonna hurt the wallet no matter what brand you buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get an Nvidea 256 XT 5600 or better, but make sure it says XT and you wont go wrong..you can pry get one for less then 200, that radeon your talking about is easily 350 or better..do your mom a faver and get the Nvidea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably your best bet would be an Nvidia Geforce 6800 GT, but buy it closer to the release of EQ2 so you save money.  If thats out of the range, I'd suggest a GeForce 5700 ultra GDDR3 version.  Very good bang for your buck on that card, it doesnt have shader model 3.0 which EQ2 will be supporting, but then again no cards as of yet beside the 6800 line will support it anyhow and I'm sure you can live without it.  <br />
<br />
Eitherway good luck with your vid card purchase =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, thanks everyone. Currently Im using a GeForce 2, which is very craptific. SO i guess I would make my decision in the Nvidia range, but wait until later to actually purchase anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Will OoW graphics changes make my Geforce3 Ti500 cry? I'd like to buy a new card anyways, but it would seriously cut into my beer and cigarettes fund.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For the leasr hastle choose a Nvidia card. ATI generally have problems with compatability and are often harder to install. However if done properly they are equally as good, if not better. I'm running a ATI 9600SE 128 MB for EQ atm, took a while to figuire it out, had to take the computer back a few times but it was sorted eventually.<br />
<br />
If you do get a ATI make sure you turn ATIxxx off from start up (msconfig &gt; start up &gt; uncheck the box). This program causes more hastle than its worth I find, also don't get the latest ATI drivers, they're faulty, go for one of the earlier ones (4.5 i think is fine).</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmmm, you might have hit upon something there! I was thinking of purchasing the extra memory myself 512 or higher is fine for me, but I would prefer 1gb. Since my parents are sending me to Military school this september I better get a whole new computer! (and a car, a car would be nice)</div></div><hr />

<br />
x600 will be too slow to run EQ2 at a decent resolution. <br />
<br />
I see a lot of misguided info here, the new Nvidia and ATI cards are running neck and neck atm. They are both fast and have nice image quality. However, the top end nvidia cards have a requirement for 480 watt psu, 2 power connecters. Keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
You can't really go wrong either way, as long as you have a beefy power supply for the nividia card that is. Compatibility is an old issue with the ati card. They are just as compatible as nvidia these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I haven't kept up with the last few releases from Nvida, but at least until recently, they did not have much in the way of implemented dx9 features.  They were using driver work arounds on unsupported features which is why the dx9 rollout went so much worse for nvidia users.  Ati users actually saw a rather nice frame increase from dx9.  Of course, all the clipping bugs, etc, are common to both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It went fine with my systems.  <br />
<br />
Intel 1.8MHZ Pent 4. Geforce3<br />
AMD Athlon XP 2700. Geforce4 MX<br />
Intel 2.6MHZ Pent 4. Geforce4 Ti 4600<br />
<br />
However I intend to replace the Geforce4 MX with a ATI X800 Pro just to see how it works.  The Geforce3 system is going to be replaced with a new system sporting the Geforce 6800 Ultra.<br />
<br />
I'm getting ready for Doom3 and Half-life 2.</div></div><hr />

Where did you get your info from regarding nVidia?<br />
<br />
I had absolutely zero problems, and also had a quite nice FPS increase from DX9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">[QUOTE='Aruman']Where did you get your info from regarding nVidia?<br />
<br />
It all started right here:<br />
<br />
http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/hl2/<br />
<br />
There are lots of articles explaining the problem that nvidia had with dx9 features. This won't be true with the new generation of nvidia boards, they do dx9 very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just a quick note. A lot of peoples problems with ati cards are due to the fact they are upgrading from nvida to ati. Nvidia drivers (and ati drivers) leave a bunch of crap behind on the system after they are uninstalled. This extra crap causes some huge driver issues when installing a new ati card after using a nvidia card. If you do decide to switch from nivida to ati make sure you download a cleaner to completly remove the nivida drivers.<br />
<br />
I'm an ati fan simply because I think AA looks better on ati cards then nvidia cards. I've personally only ever had one problem installing an ati card. And that was on a nvidia nforce2 chipset. Using Omega's drivers instead of ati's fixed that right up. I suggest you go with what you know and wait as long as possible before buying a new card. I have a ati 9800 pro AiW 256meg. I love it and its working great. My girlfriends pc has a 5900 in it, again looks very great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think your best bet would be to have your mother save her cash, and not buy a new graphics card just yet.  As better and better cards are always comming out, and EQ 2 hasn't been released, you don't need a graphics card for it untill it gets released.  If you can wait untill EQ 2 comes out, you would be able to get quite a bit more bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In addition to the whole 'shader day' issue, there was a lot of posting at the time of the rollout about problems with the graphics.  In large part the complaints were by nvidia owners, with ati owners being a touch happier.<br />
I haven't got any bone to pick with either graphic card, my house comps have a gf2, gf3, and radeon 9800pro.  Last generation Nvidia card simply did not support dx9 in hardware.  Functionality was implemented in software, working around the hardware limitations.<br />
The whole thing about half life2 was a little unfortunate.  Until that point, developers had used Nvidias' optimised pathways in their engines.  Nvidia controlled the market, so it always made sense to make the software as fast as possible with that hardware.  Hl2 was being developed along strict dx9 guidlines, and Nvidia suffered horribly.  No one really knew that it would be that big of a problem before, since there were no big name developers working along strict dx9 functionality.<br />
That lack of hardware functionality affected eq as well, some of which has since been improved.</div></div><hr />
