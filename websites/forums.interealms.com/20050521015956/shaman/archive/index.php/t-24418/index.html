<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kreft78</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
       I've been lvl 65 for a long time now and just got my 65 spells and now have 178 aas fully buffed i have 5800 hp and 1230 ac. I would like to know if theres a solo spot in god for runes, as well as oow for em.<br />
<br />
       Just bought god 2 months ago and dont know the area that well, same with oow just got it and would like to know the solo spots for runes been looking through the threads and only found one thats soloable so far in nc. If any of u know of any other spots pls let me know Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a general rule, OoW runes drop off named. As far as I know, given your stated hp/AC/AA I do not think that soloing named is going to be viable for you. Named in Noble's causeway are duo-able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the packleader in nc is soloable, but i think thats the only one.<br />
<br />
glad that i got my own little armee ( 4 box ) to kill lots of nameds  :D</div></div><hr />

Grab yourself 2 other people and farm named in Dranik's Scar expeditions. You will need a puller type because most mobs come in 2 - 3. The fire pit named (Kyv Something) is very easy to kill and drops 66 - 68 runes every other kill. He also drops a melee neck item common and a FT3 shield rarely that will help your mana and stats. Once you have the spawn broken you could probably solo it if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have someone who is level 66 who gets you the expedition, named are single pulled (A mage friend told me this and the times we have duod the expeditions we never got an add off named - so I don't know if that's the real reason or not, but it works for me :) ). Just got to find 2 people, or use bots, to get the expedition. <br />
<br />
I can solo them, I have more hps then you though, and they do summon. Quicker to duo with a mage tho, that's what I usually have done, they can be your coth bitch :P and more dps. They are slowable, mostly slowed if I remember right, hitting in the 600s or so. Only two ph's in them, bat and rat. They are really close together, can just run back and forth, bring IVU potions or clicky to move around in between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Recent patch nerfed the bats and rats.  All are KoS, now.  There's really very few places to camp in the Murkglider expo.  This was great before the patch.  Haven't bothered since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*MOST* of the murkgliders don't see regular invis.  There will be a few.  You can still run to the two named spots in the 68+ expedition and COTH the rest of the group there.  If you get a few see invis mobs in a bad spot, just get a new expedition.<br />
<br />
  I havent tried the other 2 expeditions yet.....</div></div><hr />
