Posting a thread on this forum on WoW's intial sales.<br />
<br />
I've also received grey's when I talked about replayability.  Of course all my positive ones are signed and the neg are not. <br />

Just thought I'd share the laugh with you guys.</div></div><hr />

Hey Mill if it was the done thing to give rep for Grey posts then yer yours would be minus several million.<br />
But not seen you be an arse on WoW board or EQ board yet so your rep is safe for a while :).<br />

Ops should just do away with neg and neutral bumps if they want the system to have any meaning, and make all reputations relative.</div></div><hr />

No way Sunmoon!  I love seeing folks get all up in arms because someone takes an anonymous, meaningless swipe at them.  Just proves that folks like Faern are part of the &quot;VERY Insecure People on This Board.&quot;  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Should I just do away with reputation?<br />
I would.  If you make it so that the rep bumps can't be anonymous then you end up with more personal battles between posters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My latest -ive rep bump:<br />
<br />
You don't even play anymore yet you come back to lecture those people arguing over a game they still play? Tell me, who is the biggest idiot, the one who comes and doesnt play but argues, or the ones that play/argue?<br />
<br />
I started playing RPGs with the original set of D&amp;D books, probably before the moron who gave me that negative rep bump was born, I played EQ for 5 years.  I've played two other MMORPGs since then.  I work in the video games industry.  Yet I am no longer allowed to comment because I have stopped playing EQ?<br />
<br />
Sunmoon: I suggest you either remove the reputation system or else talk to those people who are abusing it like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">don't think it really matters to most. but, if it is a useless feature, why waste resources on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Should I just do away with reputation?<br />
<br />
Yes, please get rid of the reputation system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My suggestion would be to either:<br />
<br />
1) remove anon bumps.  make morons take responsibility for the crap they spew.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) remvoe negative bumps and scale the reputation rating to the highest rep person so that it is relative.<br />

<br />
The system is abused by the lack of accountability.  Drop it.<br />
<br />
Anybody who judges the merit of a post simply by virtue of the number of green pips next to the name of the author has bigger issues to deal with anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you conveniently forget Serepi, Izmalis, Sundancia, Faern and myself.  Of course, your ideas of Republican/conservative views are pretty objectionable, so its probably best if we aren't associated with your psychotic rantings.</div></div><hr />

Not my fault I am smarter than most people. You would be amazed how many PM's I get from people too scared to post, totally agreeing with me. Try again.<br />

I hate talking about Mill as if he can't read this - but anyway.<br />
<br />
My view has always been that Mill is a Pat Buchanon / Archie Bunker Republican.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with putting America first. Especially as an American.</div></div><hr />

Yes, In theorie it's good but in practice it's just being used to greif by bumping any opinion you disagree with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the rules of the board isnt anon flaming no allowed?<br />
<br />
I dont mind at all neg bumps. but when people put snide little remarks in there and do nto tag who it is from I do mind that. <br />
<br />
If the rep system had a nametag next to everyone who gave a rep bump it would be a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
As it is at this moment though. I would reather see it gone. The anon flames from it are childish and just a small enough thorn to get under my skin. <br />
<br />
My thoughts of course. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would.  If you make it so that the rep bumps can't be anonymous then you end up with more personal battles between posters.<br />
<br />
Hey personal battles that are civil are entertaining to read. The pot has to be stirred you know. It makes for good drama and conversation. In an old book I read. (Snow Crash I think) They had people who were hired to go to message boards and stir up some drama and controversy to liven places up some. <br />
<br />
I have always thought that the more intresting and entertaining people on the board were the ones who had an opionion. and stuck to it but could voice why and hows behind it. Blazz is at the top of that list. I might not agree with his stance on many things, but the board would be a less fun place to be if he stopped posting. Much like Mill and the grey. It is a calmer place without him weaving his tangled web, but it has also lost much of it's allure as well. <br />
<br />
The anon rep system is a poor one though. it needs to be modified to include the posters handle or be removed in toto.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I like the idea of automatically including the handle. Leaves more room for a more precise explanation for why the rep bump (neg or pos) was given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The board is for information it shouldn't be a soap opera of emotions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Seriously, who actually cares about their rep via the tool on a board like this?  Your reputation in the community and the quality or lack thereof of your posts will speak for themselves.<br />

&quot;There Are Some VERY Insecure People on This Board&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this not irony also then?  Since you are clearly insecure about your &quot;virtual&quot; reputation on these forums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Should I just do away with reputation?<br />
<br />
This has been a forum request for a long time bro. Or atleast find a way to take the viel off the person rep bumping you. I dont mind neg rep bumps at all, but the idea that they can hide behind the system and not catch repurcussions of their actions is what irratates me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Should I just do away with reputation?<br />
Yes please do away with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rep is utterly worthless, but far too much  fun to throw out with the bathwater</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If supported by the board engine (or relatively easy to implement), how about a system where you have a checkbox option for signing the rep bump? If you sign it, your name will be displayed and the bump will affect reputation, but if you don't, you can leave an anonymous comment to the poster (that will not affect reputation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The rep system, in its current form, is the best tool for estimating people's online personalities.  Some don't know about it, others could care less, and some feel it controls their lives and are quite verbal about it.

My vote would be yes, but I really don't care too much either way since I don't think it's a good way to judge posters.  (it seems to be more of a popularity contest to me)<br />
<br />
I hadn't looked at my rep in months and I just looked because of this thread...<br />
<br />
I recently got an anonymous negative bump (and called an idiot  :rolleyes:  ) because I said WoW's launch was smoother then EQ1's launch...  The funny part is they agreed with my statement, but they apparently didn't think it was a valid way to compare the games...not sure why they didn't just post their sentiment on the board instead of giving me a negative rep bump  ;) .</div></div><hr />
