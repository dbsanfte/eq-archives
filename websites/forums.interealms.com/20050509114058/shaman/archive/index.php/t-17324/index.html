<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You know how when you activate MGB that the timer starts it's refresh countdown then, and not after you actually cast your spell?  I had always wondered if there would be a way for you to activate the MGB ahead of time for raids..say an hour or so, do the MGB once most are there (if they are there within that hour) and have only a few minutes left over until another MGB is available.<br />
<br />
Well, last night someone &quot;tested&quot; this theory out.  They activated MGB, but didn't cast their spell for another 10 minutes.  Their MGB went off for them, so I thought I would try to extrapolate upon this.<br />
Well, I used the MGB ability and waited 30 minutes to actually try and cast the spell...all it did was single buff me (didn't even hit the rest of my party) with Focus of the Seventh.  I thought it might just be some random bug, so I have tried it a few more times since then....same effect happens.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what exactly your window of opportunity is with MGB once you activate it, before it just &quot;doesn't work&quot; anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am surprised that it worked after 10 minutes for yer buddy.  the very first time I tried to MGB I hit the MGB button, then was asked to hold off - and it did not MGB after about two minutes.<br />
<br />
So I treat it like a 30 second fuse.<br />
<br />
Would love to hear from some more authoritative sources</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've waited 30 minutes before casting mgb fos once,without a problem.. this was a long time ago, back when we were fighting in HoT.<br />
<br />
Something you need to remember is that if you zone, your mgb becomes null</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also can't any spell, possibly even a clicky will screw it up so you can't go on slowing and canning and qing yourself while saving your mgb. You basically have to be afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is not only true, shaman in my guild do it regularly.<br />
<br />
This is the way we can have a single shaman buff a raid in no time.<br />
<br />
You click the button when you first enter the zone - it will deactivate and the timer start over if you zone or camp.  Wait however long you need to to begin your buffing.  In the background, the timer counts down.  If it takes long enough to begin buffing, it is possible to MGB back-to-back.<br />
<br />
As far as authority on the subject... /shrug.  I've done it many times.  Hope that's enough.  I've never had a MGB not work because the button was pressed for a long time before casting.  The biggest problem with this is forgetting you have MGB triggered and casting Acumen or Regen or something... I've massed those two to raids while assembling..... talk about a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know it can't be done because there's no buff window - but on Maelin we always get lots of random folks in PoK who are constantly /ooc MGB nnnnnnn spell incoming at nnnnnn in 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Just ONCE, I've wanted to be able to /ooc MGB True North at Bank in 3 minutes. ... hehehe<br />
<br />
I'm still 3 AAs out from getting MGB, never bothered with it before.  That's good information about zoning in, clicking the button, then getting a head-start on a 2nd MGB - thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Line dancing in PoK!  Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive done it plenty of times and still do it often, when I zone in, I hit it and wait, and its ready again before anyone elses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks -<br />
I probably hit Canni in the interim - its a reflex, after all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wasn't clear.  You can cast any normal spells - single target - without messing this up.  You just can't cast any group spells.  When I said &quot;acumen and regen&quot; I mean the group versions.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion.  Canni away and it won't hurt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you die before casting the mgb spell, you lose that occurence of mgb.  Well I have anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">True, Ronax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anything that causes you to zone will make you lose it, LD, death, large train.</div></div><hr />
