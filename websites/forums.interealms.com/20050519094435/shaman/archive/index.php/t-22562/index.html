Anyways, how many of these guys are still active?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just curious.. how was that shot taken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well if you mean how are all those people from different servers in one screenshot, then the answer is they were at the serverwide best of the best finals.<br />
<br />
If you mean how do you take screen shots,then the answer is the minus key.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Imagine how long that contest would take if we tried it today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thats a blast from the past.. I havn't seen Gathu in a long ass time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">swiftraven's gone... long retired now.  Char is still around on fro, and still tagged TMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure who the terris thule one was, that picture doesnt show the names too well (allthough I think the TT one is an ogre at the back). The screen text at the botton has a /random by Blapx, who is probably Blap, the much dispised (by us anyway) GL of the #3 guild on the server at the time. Divine vengeance or something like that (it was a long time ago). They moved over to DAoC when it came out I believe, and didnt come back. I remember seeing him once much later (early PoP?) and commented on it in /gu, but as far as I know he hasnt been seen since by anyone.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised to see so many ogres/trolls there, most of our shaman have been Barbs or lizards. Just one Iksar in that picture as well, talk about the man keeping them down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, Nixx.<br />
<br />
Miss him sometimes :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mooshfu, who beat me in the final match for the bristlebane title, sold his charater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Luthe who in that picture was from Tallon Zek can be seen running around here and there on Maelin.  Right now, I know the character is being used by a set of friends, some in my guild and some in another guild.  The guy that I originally knew that was playing Luthe gave it away prob about 8 months ago.  I honestly have no clue if he was the original Luthe though.  I just know that when I asked him how he got the title, he said that he won some BoTB fight :)<br />
<br />
Obviously most of us here know that Jenamder retired a few months back as wel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, Slithur was such controversey at the time. He was a TWINK!</div></div><hr />

Apparently a capable twink though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jenamdar, from my server, is long gone.  He came back for a little bit a couple expansions back but he's gone again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow that was a long time ago.  <br />
<br />
My win on Tribunal was controversial to some, because it is said that there wasn't any real competition at the BotB event for the server.  I say that they just didn't want to be embarassed :).<br />
<br />
Anyway, my account is active and I've played a couple times in the last week, but I wouldn't say I'm active, since 1-2 hours a week is probably all I have time to play.<br />
<br />
Does anyone remember what most of the equipment worn at that time was?  Obviously Jaundiced Bone armor was common, and all the chain shirts are fungi tunics.  What were the chain greaves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Old School names I remember (who are now gone from board / game):<br />
<br />
Tudamorf<br />
Eduin<br />
Krakster<br />
Tugg (ma finger)<br />
<br />
Even older names:<br />
<br />
Sam</div></div><hr />

I am just to the right of you in that picture (two left of Jen).  That day was a blast even though I was moving that day.  I wish I had more time to enjoy it.  It was great to meet Tugg, Nixx, Talamay, etc.  Swift not only stood out in appearance by being in full Skyshrine but he also had pet control down to a science.  /rude pet poof bug (made mistake x2)  I also remember the super long fight between two Trolls in fungis.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

Jarsath Scale Leggings, from KC. I wanted a pair so badly, but I never could get the Undead Jailer to pop! After I finally got a pair and was camping the basement for VP key mob, a guild monk pulled TWO undead jailers to the basement to taunt me.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing a pair in this lovely screenie, the day I got my epic.<br />

<br />
I actually had really weird luck with legs. I finally got RE legs at 59. In the space of 2 weeks I upgraded to Thurg then SS. I wore the SS legs over 2 years until I finally upgraded to LDON. Then, a couple of weeks after that, a pair of elemental legs went dirt cheap in guild. Thank god for the new LDON sell back policy!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gromble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Jenamdar was a Shaman on the Mith Marr Server, - Guild Afterlife, which left the game a few months back and i believe now are in WoW betatesting and such<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All I can say in looking at that shot is . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor Lodi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thats a blast from the past.. I havn't seen Gathu in a long ass time.<br />
<br />
Yea Gathu doesnt play anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thats right.  I had the Jarsath legs too.  I remember the chatter all day being Swiftwind's skyshrine quest armor.  Most people didn't have any of the velious armors yet at the time - obvious from the abundance of Jaundiced Bone!<br />
<br />
I remember that troll vs troll fight - the GM removed their tunics while they were fighiting.  <br />
<br />
I lost my first round because of the pet bug, against Jalen from Nameless.  I almost beat him despite my mistake, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The character Helor is still around on Bertox but I don't think it's the original owner.</div></div><hr />
