<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Paying 35k (and growing) for Torpor on Ayonae Ro - please contact me online or via PM if you are selling.  Hopefully there is some kind shaman out there with it who sees this eventually, as I'm getting pretty damn tired of seeing it pop up once every 2 months in bazaar for &lt;30k and having one of the resellers snap up and reprice at 70k+ within the few minutes it takes me to get my cash there.  And then there was the time my clueless friend said just after a patch they they had seen it on a vendor in overthere the day before.. =(<br />
