<br />
Dropped off Rumblecrush last night (woot slowed him first try and promptly ate 4 hits for 400-720 :p )<br />
<br />
Stats are as follows:<br />
<br />
36ac<br />
15 to str, wis, and sta<br />
75 to HP and Mana<br />
10 to all saves<br />
<br />
I wasn't going to ask to be on the roll, was just going to hold out for a vindi... but nobody else present wanted it so I was told to just loot it.<br />
<br />
Was using an Iksar chestplate before... will probably switch to iksar when soloing or medding a lot.  seems to be great, because it threw me past 1k ac Self buffed, which seems to be a HUGE boon when soloing and grouping a like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats bro, it's a really nice chest piece. If I didn't have a vindi BP I would definitely go in on it whenever we do Rumblecrush.<br />
<br />
BTW, Rumblecrush is a really fun fight for any of you who haven't killed him before. He's a Luclin mob where multiple shaman's can actually be useful, since Slow lands on him pretty easily and our Ice Strikes usually do full damage. It's fun standing around and being able to nuke in between heals =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forgot to mention that RC can drop an amazing shield, the Grand Shield of Faith, better than even the NToV shield IMHO.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dang nice shield. I want one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, that shield does beat out the shield of the wurms from nTov.<br />
<br />
There is a nice selection of Luclin priest shields really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm using the Wicked Mail right now and may keep it over Vindi BP because of the 75 mana, which might be a good trade off for 25 HP and the resists for the extra AC on the Vindi.<br />
I also still have a Spined Chain Mail that I can lug around to right click bramblecoat for an AC boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sheild is pretty rare, im hoping to get one. Been in on about 15 rumble kills and seen the sheild once.<br />
<br />
Likes to drop the caster robe alot it seems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Definitely a nice bp. Personally I use a vindi bp but one of our other shaman wears the wicked mail. Depending on the rest of your gear I definitely could see someone wearing the wicked over the vindi for the wis/mana on it over vindi.<br />
<br />
The sheild is a great peice too. I was hoping for one of those untill i got my grand sheild of faith this week.<br />
<br />
Rumble is a interesting fight. Get him debuffed before he kills the raid and you should be ok =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wear wicked mail, and I most definitely like the extra wisdom, mana, and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its a viable alternative to vindication bp, neither one is really better than the other imo, and it largely depends on style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wear Wicked Mail also.  I had the choice between Vindi and this and I chose this.  I also like the fact that it has a chain appearance...doesn't look like I am wearing a life preserver.</div></div><hr />
