<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I bought this AA and I never remember to use it! According to posters, it's one of the coolest AAs we get. I only seem to use it when I need to buff a whole raid with Wunshi after a wipe (still no group focus). <br />
<br />
Can you give me some scenarios where you've found this ability to be amazing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Time Rallos Zek, Spam healing the Tank.<br />
<br />
Zun Muram Volklana, Spam healing everybody, including myself.<br />
<br />
Feratha after getting battle ressed, hahaha. No mana, hide behind the crystal and get to healing.<br />
<br />
Any time I'm Low on mana from chaincasting damage or heals. by the time it wears off, I've gotten probably 40% of my mana back just from flowing thought and clairvoyance.<br />
<br />
uh... Duoing Cazic Thule it came in handy! ;)<br />
<br />
Basically this ability is so absurdly retardedly good, you have infinite mana for 4 and a half minutes as long as you Serenity yourself. As a bonus, you can pop ancestral aid or click your epic for a little bonus healage if you don't have time to serenity yourself, and if the person is in your group that you're trying to heal, those clickies will heal the both of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, i don't use it a whole lot, but when I do it's nice to have.<br />
<br />
I've used it at times like.. when we did one of the tacvi named.. all the tanks died but a paladin, and she tanked it for a while while we got a few more people standing.  I chain healed her for a long time.<br />
<br />
Most of the time that I end up using it has to do with this, I generally only use it when we are doing something and I know that I'll eat through a lot of mana that I think I might run out or need it just in case.<br />
<br />
Oh, prob my favorite reason to use it usually has to do with whatever fight we are doing and I die.  Depends on where we are in the fight and what's going on, if I get rezzed, I usually liked to pop canni5, mod rod, ancient canni, and then hit up SS and then finally SC.  So basically i'm not using my reg mana pool so I gain mana back, plus I'm actually able to cast and do whatever I need during the fight to contribute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love to piss the... well, everyone else off by getting rezzed last, buffing the whole group, and being FM first. I have 9 AAs banked now, and I'm gonna get this just to piss them off even more.<br />
<br />
Hell, a game's supposed to be fun, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I finid it extra useful on single group PG trials (plus some of the stuff others mentioned).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use this just about every boss fight there is.<br />
Pop it off.<br />
Cast your heal over time on yourself.<br />
Chain cast heals for the next 4.5 minutes.<br />
End the fight FM.<br />
<br />
Use it on:<br />
Every named boss type in PoTime<br />
Every named boss type in Ruined City<br />
Every named boss type in Walls of Slaughter.<br />
Every named boss type in RS.<br />
Uh.  Just amend this list to be, &quot;every named type ever&quot;.<br />
<br />
Between our own HOT, massed HOT, epic, and paladin/clerics doing group heals, you have zero need to worry about dying from low health using the ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">any boss fight with a mana drain, save this till you are oom. braxt comes to mind as i just did him tonight.<br />
<br />
i use this in PG trials all the time so i can crank up DPS/heals and not worry about mana.<br />
<br />
when i group for xp i overuse mana in the form of larger dps specifically to run myself out.  pop this, keep doing what i was doing...full mana by the time it runs out...repeate mass mana useage =p<br />
<br />
soloed a summoning named unbuffed the other day...forgot to buff and didn't have pet up...i mass dotted and ended up running myself out of mana. popped this inbetween summons and chain healed myself till another round of dots killed the named.<br />
<br />
especially good if you are having nasty barb sex with your favorate troll or ogre and you find yourself running low on mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Further to what I said above...<br />
I recently got Spiritual Serenity.<br />
Casting that HOT on myself, and using Spiritual Channelling, I was physicly unable to lose health chain casting heals on a target.<br />
In fact, I ended up gaining about 1/3 of a bubble of health per tick even after spending X amount of health to cast my level 68 heal spell on a target as fast as I could.<br />
<br />
Sample uses I've had with this AA recently:<br />
Fought TZ in potime.  Healed the main tank every single moment the gems refreshed for my spells, except for reapplying HOT on myself.  Ended the fight full mana.  I don't know how long the combat went, but assuming the fight went for 5 minutes, and I healed once every 6 seconds when I didn't need to reapply HOT, I healed the MT about 42 times, did HOT on myself about 7 times, and it cost me zero mana.<br />
<br />
Fought Zun in Ruined City.  Cast heal over time on myself.  Spammed heals on group members and MT the entire 3 or 4 minute fight.  Ended the fight at 70% mana (his AE lowers your maximum mana pool size.  Drops me to 70% maximum mana pool).<br />
<br />
Fought whatever his name is that guards the entrance to MPG, in the WOS.  Spam healed the MT or whoever happened to get on aggro during the fight.  Ended the 5 or so minute fight FM.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, if you can think of a time where you'd want to cast Canni5 in a boss mob fight, you want to use Spiritual Channelling.  If I could make this a permanent effect, I'd be in heaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pretty much what Juujuu said. I mainly use it for chainhealing for obscene amounts of time. Heal normally a couple of times. Cast canni 5. Heal a couple of times more. Hit Cannibalisation. Heal once. Cast HoT on yourself (or get a massed heal, a paladin or cleric heal, click epic, hit ancestral aid, etc.). Chaincast more heals, pausing only to reapply HoT as needed and to use canni 5 again. With a little practice you will always be at full mana when cannibalisation ends. Proceed to spam heal. Use canni 5 as needed.<br />
<br />
On pretty much every boss fight that exists you will simply be chaincasting the entire fight, except for the time needed for HoTs, canni 5 and cannibalisation. If you have both your 1.5 epic and ancestral aid and if you can catch the odd group or AE heal you will not even need to waste time to heal yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are soloing, and you are on the verge of needing a med break, pop this AA and continue.  By the time it wears off you'll have nearly full mana (if you hit your cannis) and can continue without a break.<br />
<br />
If you are raiding, you can rebuff an entire raid in this AA's timer, particularly if you have a cleric around to CH you every once in a while.<br />
<br />
If you are raiding, you can spam heal for minutes on end.<br />
<br />
I fidn it least useful in group situations, where my mana usage is often limited moreso by aggro than by mana availability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Er, I think we should close this post before you-know-who reads it and the secret is out how good this AA is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I first got this AA I was skeptical as to how often I would get to use it.... well, now I love it.<br />
<br />
Some of the things I use it for:<br />
<br />
5 minutes free unlimited mana any time you care to use it.... and you regen regular mana at the same time (this is just too nice).<br />
<br />
Buffing a raid.  No one in my guild has group wunshi yet....so I cast wunshi's focusing a hell of a lot of times when buffing raids of 70....and its no problem after mashing SC.<br />
<br />
Just rezzed.  Mash SC and you have 0 downtime waiting to regen your mana...you can get back into the fight and/or start rebuffing yourself and the raid.  The cleric that just rezzed you and the rest of your group and raid will be very impressed because no one realizes shamans have this godly AA.  It's a great feeling!<br />
<br />
Mana burners.  This is my absolute favorite... we were killing the Arch Mage in PoF, kinda just a pickup guild raid.  Well pop goes the mana burn...all the clerics start screaming at the necros for pumps, the druids start dropping like flies.... mash SC and surprise you're now the best healer in the raid because YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WITH MANA (ie hps!).<br />
<br />
BTW, in addition to using Q/ serenity to heal...you can just spam regular heals on yourself too (they heal more hps than they cost ;))<br />
<br />
Really fun AA to have, especially if you are in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does anyone know what the ratio is for mana to hit points with SC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pretty sure its 1:1 -- so a 1500 mana champion costs 1500 HP.  I do not know and haven't checked if Mana Preservation effects / specialization / etc lower this cost.  It really doesn't matter though.  With Serenity effectively giving you 820/mana per tick, you would be hard pressed to spend that much anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tend to be on &quot;Spam heal duty&quot; when we engage a bossmob . I like too spam Yoppa's untill I get down to 30m , Then I pop Spiritual Channeling .. Quiessence myself ... pop epic effect ... pop ancestral aid ... Then chain like crazy till im near death :D<br />
<br />
useing this method I can chain yoppas pretty much constantly for like 6-7min or so .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pretty sure its 1:1 -- so a 1500 mana champion costs 1500 HP. <br />
Actually, I think the ratio is closer to the 8:5 of the Canni line. I also think that its calculated from the unadjusted spell cost, not the &quot;Your Cost with Mana Pres&quot; value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yah agree with all the above, I often blow it at the start of the raid if only shaman for buffs, because it will be back by the time we get to anything hard.<br />
<br />
I also tend to click it when about 40m if in a high pressure situation (certain Time healing P4 up, MPG trials etc), so If I live when SC wears off, clair/bard+ft and the odd c5/pained memory sees me on fm easily.<br />
<br />
However, you have all missed the main time to use spritual channeling - whenever your grouped with a necro ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe, <br />
<br />
Some uses recently:<br />
<br />
A less then 20 person Super Goat Raid in Qvic ... debuff the first goat, wait for the 3 animals to pop (they unslowable), chain Yoppa the MA while 3 animals beating on him, run down to 30% mana, pop SC, continue to chain heal MA while the 3 clerics medded, once the Goat repops, go DPS (Putrid / PR Rain / PR DD) ....<br />
<br />
Weaponary trial in MPG (before the change, I used to be the only healer, and the main DPS on the spell guy) ....<br />
<br />
Basically, it can be used to get to FM anytime you are LoM .... so even in XP groups .... go harder on the DPS (DD / Rains / MR DoTs) and once you are at 30% mana after a Can5, pop SC and continue to go hard ....<br />
<br />
There are times where Shaman's have saved the Raid with SC and chain Yoppa's after Clerics have gone either OOM or Died ....<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I duo a lot and found the AA to help me keep my mobs/hour ratio up.  Basically, I work through mana at a very healthy clip so that when it refreshes I pop it so I can continue fighting while I use canni and FT to get my mana pool back to full.  It lets me get another 2-3 mobs into a cycle since I rarely have to take a med break.<br />
<br />
It's also a lifesaver during buffing / rebuffing.  Can cast single target wunshi on 1/2 of the raid in a single run of Spiritual Channeling.  No-one wants Fo7 these days, and no one in guild has Talisman of Wunshi yet.  :(<br />
