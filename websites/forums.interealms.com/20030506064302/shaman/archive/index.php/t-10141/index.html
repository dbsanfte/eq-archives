<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 48 SK RL friend needs an RBG upgrade to the spiked seahorse belt so I wanna kill Fellspine in SG. I have soloed and duoed a fair number of normal seahorses they aren't too bad. The post I copied below says hes pretty resistant, is he? If I can't slow him I can't kill him. I have a 60 monk 62 shaman and 48 sk, torpor, malo etc. is this enough?<br />
<br />
Anyone tried him solo or duo?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To get to fellspine go to western wastes zoneline and follow tunnels till you get to the lake with the well that leads down to the siren area... go down the well and go through the cross shaped tunnel into a larger water area with 2 water type servants above... keep swimming under them into the next tunnel and follow that until you see a coldspine seahorse. When you find that, kill it. That is fellspine's placeholder. <br />
<br />
He can and will spawn anywhere from the bottom of the well (3 spawns here... 2 normal mobs and a servant mammal) all the way to the end of that tunnel below the 2 watery/icy servants. The end of that tunnel has 4 exits and is very obvious when you reach the end. <br />
<br />
Spawn time is approx 28 mins. <br />
<br />
Recommend only camping this if you can solo a coldspine seahorse till fellspine spawns... after that call in some guildies for help. <br />
<br />
Fellspine hits for 210s, highly resistant, but has same hitpoints as the other seahorses... about 12k is my guess. <br />
<br />
common drop: mask of swirling water 4ac 5dex 5wis 25hps 0weight all all <br />
<br />
uncommon drop: *spined seahorse hide belt* 10ac 4str 4sta 4dex 4agi 4wis 4int 4cha 1svmag 1svcold 1svpois 1svdis 1svfire 25 hitpoints 25mana 0.0weight all all no level restriction. eff: haste 34% according to many haste parser websites. <br />
<br />
rare drop: spined seahorse hide breastplate 29ac 15dex 50hps 4.4weight chain classes usable... looks like regular chain when worn. <br />
<br />
ultra rare drop: fellspine's tail somethin like 7dmg 17dly 9wis 9int rng pal and sk usable and a 300dmg dot in 3 ticks with blind effect... recommended lvl 55 is on that. <br />
<br />
So, to reiterate... from the center of the well to the end of the long tunnel opposite the well in the water is fellspines location... when he spawns he moves slightly then stops and never moves again due to broken pathing. So you have to kill him where he spawns even if he spawns next to 2 molkors or sirens. Same with his placeholder... pathing is very annoying here but its still very possible to kill this guy without exploiting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know a 60 druid used to solo camp him for belts to sell.  If he can do it, should be no problem for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seen him twice in SG, bugged in different ways each time i ran across him.  First time he just sat there at his spawn point and didn't attack me, but I don't recall landing turgurs at all after malo, but I did get epic on him almost every time IIRC.   Second time he was between the well bottom and his spawn point, but he did attack me.  That was a fun fight, had to gate a few times cuz of bad tactics(tanking while trying to slow).  Finally just did /pet attack and after a 3 minute dance he found Fellspine, and I landed grummus, and swam to a corner and tanked him for a few seconds till dogdog had enough aggro to hold him.  Kept casting Kragg's mending on pet when he got to 50%.  Very close fight w/ just self buffs.  Don't recall first try, but I relanded Grummus on him as it wore off when he was at 50%, and just used epic and dogdog for dmg.   Did this at lvl 63 both times and got that crappy mask both times.<br />
<br />
In your case, if you have a 60 monk, 48 SK and yourself 62 shm, pretty sure you can win.  Keep in mind he was bugged both times i fought him.  Grummus be a big help if you have it, otherwise you're stuck w/ plague of insects but I think you can still do it. Tricky part is getting past all the bugged seahorses and other crap to get to him.<br />
<br />
As for your location, I have to assume the first time i saw him he was at his spawn point, so he was about 6 npc's deep, and if you don't aggro any see invis I THINK you can find a good spot to set up camp to solo him at.<br />
<br />
Remember to have EB items or fish scales before you go, and back yourself into a corner if you are planning to cast, cuz if you start tanking and try to cast you're gonna be pushed all over under water.</div></div><hr />
