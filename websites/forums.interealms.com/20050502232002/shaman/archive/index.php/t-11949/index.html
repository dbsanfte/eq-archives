<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So the other day I was grouping in Velk's and I realized just how cool two shaman are in a group.  Keeping the other four party members + pets fully buffed is sooo much easier with a backup person, for one thing.  Add in to that two uber pets ripping up the mobs, plus two sets of dots.  We didn't need to malo, but every mob was also slowed and crippled.  <br />
<br />
And the best part is, my shaman partner is a friend of a friend, and will probably be grouping with me more in the future.  Yay :-) Has anyone else besides me discovered the joy of having two shaman in a group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally not me.   maybe on lower level groups there might be some advantage to it but at higher lvls my groups are composed of me, cleric, tank, 3dps classes.   after I got torpor im always above 90m in all exp groups ive ever been in and have to keep throwing rains every pull if not twice a pull to keep my mana from being full :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 shaman in a group is inefficient.  I'd imagine it was easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">did my first successful trials group with me and another shaman as healers.  Inefficient? /shrug.  We had mana at the end and it went very smoothly. <br />
<br />
I've done two shaman groups with one shaman healing the other debuffing.  It works fine.  Shaman superior mana regen makes up for less superior healing powers.  And if you are lucky enough to have a shaman in the group with Quiescence, healing is ridiculously easy even in PoP.  The shamans can also keep pets working for an additional 35 DPS or so per shaman and both should have mana for a couple nukes or a DoT per mob.  So figure on another 3k-4k damage provided by the shaman team.  <br />
<br />
The only thing I would advise is to ask an out of group cleric to group aego your group before starting.  This is easier than it seems in places like PoV or PoS since you can often trade buffs with other groups.  <br />
<br />
But mostly, I haven't seen such a glut of shamans on my server that there is enough to have two shamans per group.  <br />
<br />
And besides, people just feel &quot;safer&quot; with a cleric around to rez their sorry asses when they screw up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its only inefficient when the people behind the toon don't know what the class is truely capable of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah sure now we know shaman heal better than cleric and trials are not hard at 65 (how it's possible ?  :D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah everyone in group had virtue or aegeo, and of course both of us shaman had C3 (though my partner shaman lost hers midway through).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as PoV/PoS goes, all you really need a sham/pally/monk/ranger/dps/dps and a constant stream of mobs.  Anything else is just eating your xp =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Having more than one shaman in a group is not inefficient in the least, at least not since our DoTs now stack with one anothers.<br />
<br />
A while back I had the opportunity to group with 5 other shaman for about 2 hours before it got broke up and people had to log.<br />
<br />
I realize this is super rare to be able to do, but one Shaman Malos, one slows then we all Used either Pox or Breath of Ultor and started chain casting JBB's. Whichever Shaman was tanking, he had 5 others to heal when needed.<br />
<br />
Do the math, if you had the chance to have a 6 Shaman group, all with Breath of Ultor.<br />
<br />
3354x6 = 20,124 dmg every 2min 24 sec or so.<br />
<br />
now add an easy 6 JBB casts per minute x 6 Shaman = 18,000 dmg by the time the DoTs wear off. <br />
<br />
So, 6 shaman could pretty readily dish out 38K dmg in a little over 2 minutes, not counting Pets.<br />
<br />
Also, they are all pretty much FM withing 30 secs after fight.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty efficient to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am not a fan of multi shaman groups myself.  I tend to like to do my shaman duties the way I do them.  With another shaman in the group it takes what I do and cuts it in half.  I like doing multiple things in groups including keeping buffs up, nuking, dotting, healing and debuffing.  I just feel like I sit around to much with another shaman in the group and I don't really like that.  I know the dots stack and such but I am so used to doing everything and I like to keep it that way :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ive tanked in BoT with a shaman healing and vise versa.<br />
<br />
2 shaman are a beautiful thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I actually have been hunting from lvl 20 - 47 with another shaman as my duo partner.  We've duo'd the entire way, with groupings together with 3-4 melee thrown in for fun when we are bored.  Its very efficient, we know each others roles, can switch up if needed, but one of us knows who's healing / slowing / we both dot / buff etc etc . .its fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ya know I hear the comment a lot from other shaman in the alliance that my guild is in.  They feel that there shouldn't be more than 1 shaman on a raid or in a group.  They seem to have the misconception that the only thing that shaman do is slow/debuff and occassionally buff the MA.  You have no idea how many times I WELCOME having another shaman around even if it's just for grouping!  To be able to split up the buffs, debuffs, and heals is a dream come true for me!  To me, it means that mobs get taken down faster with less downtime thus faster xp for everyone.  In a raid, it means that we are able to achieve our goal that much faster so we can all get back out there to xp!  That looks like a win-win situation to me.  If I see a shaman sitting back twiddling their thumbs if they aren't the primary slower, then I see someone who isn't utilizing the class to its fullest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hate having another shaman in my group.<br />
I have problems with other people trying to do the slows instead of me.<br />
If the other shaman is healing, I'd rather get a druid/cleric.<br />
If the other shaman is doing damage by dotting/nuking, I'd rather get any melee class or pet class or nuker for damage.<br />
If the other shaman is wanting to debuffs, let me go find another group where I can do my debuffs as I fell I should be doing.<br />
I find there's too much overlap for job duties with 2 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love 2 shaman.  Usually one of us will be puller, or we tag pull.  Things arrive slowed or mal*'d, and things die fast.  A pair of Banes chew things up right nicely.  Mana inefficiency is built into most of our spells; it's why we have such huge mana regen capability (or vice versa.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sure things overlap, but sometimes you dont have the choice or dont want to choose because the other shaman might be your good friend or something...<br />
<br />
In those situations i try settle with the other what to do, and then hopefully he/she agrees on letting me slow (because i punch malo/slow by reflex nowadays).<br />
<br />
If not the slower, just hang back on your horse, heal if youre healer, practice on pet positioning, slap a dot when it seems fun and last.... click your bracer until you puke.<br />
<br />
Exping isnt all about efficiency, you have to have fun also, and i find having another shaman around relaxing and fun, mostly because you have someone who understands you =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tried this for the first time at high levels recently.  It was with a guild shammie both times.  First we were trying to catch up to the guild to kill junk beast.  The two of us duo'ed all the way to junk beast to catch up to the guild right as theypulled him.  <br />
<br />
Second time was in outer in PoV.  We had a pally tank, a cleric, both of us shaman, and the other 2 slots rotated other people.  It was actually alot of fun.  I'm sure there are more optimal group make ups, but we didn't do to bad.  With the pally tank I was stacking up BoNs and Ebolts (along with epic occasionally out of habit, but mobs normally didn't make it past the poisons) and then JBB'ing, and he was doing the same.  When an add would show I'd go ahead and pull him with slow and we'd both start the dots on that one too, and whichever of us had agro just tanked it while the first one died.  Mobs died pretty quick.  The most important thing though was it was DIFFERENT, and alot of FUN.</div></div><hr />
