<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a HoH group the other day, in the camp that's called SE top. It was a nice little group, Warrior, Cleric, Magician, Bard, Rogue, Shaman. I hadn't been there long when a Windblade dropped.<br />
<br />
The warrior looted it, and didn't say anything much.<br />
<br />
The cleric then said, &quot;Could I have that please?&quot; (She'd been chatting to me in tells about how some nice warrior weapon dropped that she could use for her alt, and that's the only thing she wanted. She seemed to expect to just get handed it.)<br />
<br />
The warrior said he'd like it, NBG. Now, normally I go for NBG when possible, even with expensive items in pickup groups. However, this warrior had gear like most of us only dream about. He had been boasting how he had 9700hp raid buffed, and he had a Blade of Carnage, and another really nice weapon, some really nice droppable gear overall (someone said his boots alone were worth 100k). He linked his current 2hs to show us what he'd be replacing - it was a Primal Velium Battle Axe, 45/44.<br />
<br />
Now, a Windblade (50/44) is technically an upgrade over primal, at least in terms of damage, but he wasn't using primal at the time, and it wasn't an upgrade over what he *was* using. I understand that even the most uber of warriors won't be tanking all the time, and when they're not, a 2her is nice to avoid agro while still doing some damage.<br />
<br />
I found it hard to believe that a) he *needed* a Windblade, even if he would have used it situationally. b) that if he wanted a Windblade, he wouldn't have just bought one himself long before c) that with all his great gear, he didn't have some really nice 2her in there which he just wasn't mentioning.<br />
<br />
At any rate, what happened was that the cleric argued the point, and in the end everyone rolled, except one person who abstained. The cleric won the roll. The warrior gave the Windblade to the cleric.<br />
<br />
Then, we started pulling again (pulls were interrupted during this). The bard came back with a mob, and at that point the warrior disbanded without saying a word.<br />
<br />
During the argument about the Windblade, I pretty much stayed quiet. I honestly don't think he needed it, but I only made one or two comments. I thought the way the cleric seemed to expect it was a little odd, but the way the warrior left with a mob incoming was reprehensible.<br />
<br />
Well, anyway, that's the situation, I was wondering what you all thought about it, and if you'd do anything differently in such a case.<br />
<br />
How do you qualify NBG? Does it only count if it's an upgrade you'd use all the time, or would you consider an upgrade on an item you use situationally to count?<br />
<br />
Also, the warrior is an applicant to a guild that I have a few friends in - not close friends, but ex-guildies, people I like. Is it worth warning the guild about this guy? If you received such a warning, would you consider it, or just ignore it because the warrior would almost certainly be better equipped than any of their warriors to date. I don't want to stir things up with them if it'll do no good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well.. I think the warrior was just pissed and acting childish.  I handle PMs for my guild and would definately take issue with such behavior, but would not refuse the person membership on the basis of a 3rd hand story .<br />
<br />
As for pickup groups I do not do NBG, for the reasons your story exemplifies.  99% of the time my rule is &quot;roll random 1000 if you want it.&quot;  Nobody gets a second loot until everyone has one.<br />
<br />
Its hard to say that the /rand isnt fair.  The RNG may be streaky, but it doesnt play favorites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keroppi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">=/ Hmm thats a tough call. Honestly, I always say NBG to the players in the group.  And if none of them need for that current character that they are on, then I say roll for any alts interested.  If anything, after reading your story I have more of a problem with the cleric's idea that it should just go to her with no one else getting a chance to roll and upgrade their alts.  Also, I really dont think that the warrior was in the wrong in this situation (except for how he left)... somethings you just cant over analyze whether you think someone else truly &quot;needs&quot; something or not.  Whose to say he wouldnt of used that weapon more then the cleric on his/her alt.  Put yourself in that situation.. imagine if something dropped that was even a minor (yet still a noticable difference) upgrade to say your shield slot for example and say the bard in the group expected it to go to his alt shaman... wouldn't you be upset?<br />
<br />
Then again, seems Slur has it right.. save yourself the headache of it all and just random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">warn your friends about this guy cause that was very childish. It shouldnt stop his admittance, but at least they have a heads up on a potiental problem. In pick up groups it should be rolled on unless something different is agreed upon before hand. more than likely he would have sold it within 10 minutes of the group disbanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a tad confused and have some doubts.<br />
<br />
9700hp full buffed is pretty unreasonably high for a warrior exping in HoH wanting a windblade.   The only way for him to top out higher than 9200ish is being elemental.   I have serious doubts that he was.<br />
<br />
The thing is this:   That cleric was a greedy, no good slimeball.   That warrior has been playing in PoP, and has watched parchment after parchment after parchment after rune after rune after rune drop, and has patiently waited his turn.   He was to be getting a CLEAR upgrade (yes, windblade is an upgrade over Primal, by a LOT post-proc), and yet he has to suffer through the casters/priests of his group deciding to divvy it up because they have ALTS TO SUPPORT, or because it fetches a lot of cash at the bazaar?    <br />
<br />
That's the most insanely selfish, greedy garbage I've ever heard of.   Then to imply that his reaction of going &quot;I don't like this group's mindset and rather than making an issue out of it, now that I learned about it, I'm simply going to leave&quot; should disqualify him from membership in some guild that he's an app in is atrocious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have sorted loot arrangements out first and avoided the typical idiocy that accompany these kinds of deals. NBG with friends, rolls in pick ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Here's my take on it.<br />
<br />
The warrior was immature by disbanding in the manner he did.  He could have left after the loot was distributed when he lost by saying something simple.  &quot;I'm sorry guys, I wasn't expecting that to go to a cleric's alt.  I will abide by the group decision, but I'm no longer in the mood to play.  Take care.&quot;  That would have been acceptable, and even w/o waiting for a replacement wouldn't have earned him any enmity.  But disbanding with a mob incoming w/ no warning would put him on my &quot;do not group with&quot; list.  His decision to claim NBG for the Windblade was weak, but w/o set loot rules, his position for NBG was feasible if not very likable.<br />
<br />
The cleric was greedy by going after something for an alt.<br />
<br />
In most groups that are pickup, a high price item like that is usually randomed to all if it is tradable in my experience.  In groups with friends, guildmates, or even just acquaintances, NBG is the general rule.  When we can't agree, someone trustworthy sells the item at auction and splits the proceeds among those present when it dropped.  If someone in the group wants to buy it outright, they pay 5/6th of the auction price which is distributed to the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
I think you should warn your friends who the warrior is applying with.  This is a very specific case of misbehavior.  While it is heresay to your friends, they can specifically ASK him about his behavior on that occasion and see how he responds.  His response to questions about his character will often be more revealing than the behavior itself.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS set loot rules up in advance, and reiterate them whenever someone new comes into the group.  If you are camping where there is a possibility of getting a really nice piece, that should be specifically addressed BEFORE it drops.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the most astinishing thing of all is that a windblade actually dropped !<br />
<br />
I haven't seen one of those drop in ages!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a very high chance that the windblade would end up in the bazaar no matter who won it.  NBG for pickup groups is every cheat and liar's dream.  Equal risk, equal reward (i.e. random) is the only way to go for pickup groups.  It is selfish to think that a pickup group exists primarily to twink you.<br />
<br />
Friends or guild groups are, of course, completely different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a tad confused and have some doubts.<br />

<br />
I've seen his guild application - he's elemental flagged, with 200AAs. Members of the group were marvelling over his gear, one of them stated his boots were worth 100kpp.<br />
<br />
The thing is this:   That cleric was a greedy, no good slimeball.   That warrior has been playing in PoP, and has watched parchment after parchment after parchment after rune after rune after rune drop, and has patiently waited his turn.

<br />
Well, my problem with him asking for it was that he admitted it was a situational upgrade. Even in a NBG group, would a situational upgrade count? I have rolled on items that are upgrades, when they are situational upgrades (resist gear, situational effect etc).<br />
<br />
The fact that I have doubts he needed it at all anyway just makes me wonder if he would have sold it anyway, but that's one of the risks you take with NBG in pickup groups, and I've fallen foul of that one several times, letting someone have something, and seeing them sell it a few hours later (before the days of bazaar mules in particular).<br />
<br />
The cleric asking for it - well, yes, that was greedy too. Most of the rest of us didn't really have any major input into the discussion. However, I'm sure any single one of us would have liked the item to sell for spells, gear, etc. When she'd told me in tells beforehand that she wanted an item for her warrior alt, I assumed she meant the Defender's Lightblade, which isn't at all rare or valuable. I was kinda boggled when she just out and asked for the Windblade.<br />
<br />
That's the most insanely selfish, greedy garbage I've ever heard of.   Then to imply that his reaction of going &quot;I don't like this group's mindset and rather than making an issue out of it, now that I learned about it, I'm simply going to leave&quot; should disqualify him from membership in some guild that he's an app in is atrocious.<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't have a problem with someone disbanding from a group because they don't like a decision. I *do* have a problem with them waiting until a mob is incoming to do so. That was childish and deliberately put the group at risk.<br />
<br />
I would have sorted loot arrangements out first and avoided the typical idiocy that accompany these kinds of deals. NBG with friends, rolls in pick ups.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't know if any discussion had taken place about loot before I joined. I don't usually ask. I know it's best to ask beforehand, but for myself I don't really care as long as I at least get a roll on anything that I can use, and that's a given in any pickup group I've been in. I don't like to join a group and immediately ask the loot rules, it seems greedy. I imagine that since the rules weren't established, both parties made an assumption.<br />
<br />
After that, we made it clear that loot was random on everything until everyone got something. Seems to me to be the only way to avoid these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All pickup groups are money-grubbing greedy bastards.  If you join every pick-up group with that mentality (sad, I know), you will be much more likely to set loot rules ahead of time.  When I do pick-up groups, I always random, with no one getting second loot till all have one.  Leave NBG for your guild.  Those are the people that have your back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is exactly why I encouraged the pickup groups I was in to roll randomly for parchments - so the melee would have a shot at something sellable.<br />
<br />
But I say &quot;was&quot; because I rarely do pickup groups any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That is why I didnt group with people if it was NBG...  The only way to be fair in a pickup group is for a random.  Now people can not roll if they dont want to but with a tank that has a blade of carnage and Primal losing a windblade to a random is not that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not entirely on topic, but I can't imagine a warrior only using one weapon all the time, so every weapon is a situational upgrade.  Does that mean they should never get one?  ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, as was stated many times before, random is really the most fair in pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IMHO, the cleric was greedy.  The warrior, whether you believe him or not is not the issue, had a weapon that was an upgrade.  If it were my group, I'd ask, &quot;Warrior01, will you use this?&quot;  If he says &quot;yes&quot;, it's his.  You have to take him at his word whether you like it or not.  Otherwise, it is a FFA.<br />
<br />
I was in POI the other night and some Polished Tin mail boots dropped.  Nothing major, but two folks said they'd love them for an alt and were prepared to roll until I said they would be an upgrade for me.  I was handed the boots and I would do the same for them, too.  Then again, it was an all-guild group.  If it were a pickup, it may have been different.  If I can't be clearly given an uncontested upgrade for the toon that is playing, it's time to leave.  However, the way the warrior left would put in on my /ignore list.  He should have stated his case, abided by the groups decision and told them he was leaving if not satisfied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pick up groups = random roll<br />
<br />
I dont care if you say you need it or not, I just met you and I have no idea what your gear set up is like. Who your main is, how long you have been playing, what kind of gear your alts have. What you have stashed in the bank or on your trader in bazaar.<br />
<br />
No second loot until everyone has something.<br />
<br />
Friends/Guildees - NBG <br />
<br />
These are standard loot rules<br />
<br />
It still BOGGLES me that people don't get this.<br />
<br />
Everyone has equal rights to it and if you want it you roll on it like everyone else you greedy little bugger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO warn your friends, let them decide if they want him in the guild, but they should know. (is this the guy who will stop the taunt and let the god ae his guild for a little payback/laugh because he didn't get loot?)...<br />
<br />
Also, since I don't play alts and I can do what I want with my current gear (yeah it sucks if I compare, but I only compare to myself).. I let a chanter have a 70k item that dropped in ds AFTER I won the roll.. but if it's pickup, I ALWAYS roll.. ooh a rune dropped.. why shouldn't the warrior who tanked the mob I was unable to slow (happens sometimes) get a shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If their actions bothered you, don't group with them in the future. Both were at fault, by my standards, and would group with neither in the future because of their actions. The greedy of the cleric, asking for items for their alt like that, and the warrior for leaving without saying a word, while a mob was incoming.<br />
<br />
If the cleric was so interested in equiping their alt, they should be playing that alt.<br />
<br />
The warrior, for leaving a part at risk like that, should really have thought twice or atleast said something before disbanding.<br />
<br />
For me personally, if the item were an upgrade, then the person asking/needing it, it's theirs. If I find later they had a habit of crying NBG by way of padding their bank, I'll never group with them again. I've had group invites that I've turned down, after finding certain people in them already.<br />
<br />
And ya know, for some strange reason, I still find plenty of group invites, and people wanting to group with me, regardless of doing this...I just prefer to solo most the time *wink*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">NBG == BS (in my opinion).<br />
<br />
Every member of that group did the same amount of work to earn that windblade, every one of them should have rolled. The same would apply if it were a glyphed rune, a silk robe, or a plate breastplate.<br />
<br />
If they &quot;want&quot; to abstain then that's great, but they all earned it, and they should all have equal chance.<br />
<br />
A guild group, of course, is always a different story - I would never roll against a guildy for something that would upgrade them, not only because I care about them but also because I don't want to have to spent that extra time farming stuff in Vex Thal :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Having boots worth 100k isn't a big deal, Tormax boots are easily worth that and won't make a 9700hp warrior.  The most puzzling thing is why an EP warrior would be hunting in HoH and why he'd need a windblade.   Can you link his magelo profile or give servername/toon name please so I can verify this?  This is the most difficult part to believe of the whole post.<br />
<br />
To dispel some common myths:<br />
<br />
1. It would only be used situationally:<br />
<br />
Response: Everything in EQ is &quot;situational&quot;.   Hell, why would you need Quiescence or Torpor when it's just situational?  Just group with a cleric or druid and they can heal you.   Just because something is &quot;situational&quot; doesn't necessarily mean that it's less important.    <br />
<br />
When PoP was first out, the whole Parchment/Rune thing was new.  Not a single group I was in, not one, had melee rolling for spells when there were people in the group who needed the upgrades.   A lot of casters/priests used this generosity to make some cash off of duplicates which they were given limited protection on.   If I had pushed the issue I'm sure I could've made a big deal over it, but why?   <br />
<br />
2. It wasn't that big of an upgrade:<br />
<br />
If that were the case, why upgrade ANY of your spells... Quiescence isn't that big of an upgrade over Torpor, why bother?   The warrior in your group for instance has a twink who could use a level 65 spell, and it's only a meager upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
3.  He left at a bad time:<br />
<br />
Get over it... mobs in HoH aren't that hard to kill, I see people soloing in there all the time.  Had he LD'd, or something what's the big deal?  Hell, the cleric could've easily tanked a slowed HoH mob.  He left when he realized that he was getting screwed by greed-filled casters and had no responsibility to provide them safe passage after denying him an upgrade he needed or at least claimed he did.<br />
<br />
4. &quot;I never do NBG in pickup groups&quot;<br />
<br />
The only time I see this is when someone isn't the &quot;needy&quot; one, but the &quot;greedy&quot; one.  I saw some pretty passionate efenses of NBG at the beginning of PoP when it came to parchments, but now that a droppable melee piece which sells in the bazaar for a pretty penny drops, the whole concept goes to hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For someone in elemental armor with a BOC and other nice toys I am sure, there is no way he would use a windblade. I guarentee he would have had that in the bazaar 5 minutes after leaving the group. And of course the Cleric was being greedy asking for something fairly valuable for an &quot;alt&quot;. Most likely the &quot;alt&quot; is sitting in the bazaar, is level one, and sells lots of stuff. Do I sound cynical? <br />
And then the warrior went and compounded his greed by disbanding as you had a mob incoming? Make sure you never help that clod in the future. Random is really the only fair way to do pickup groups. If the item is droppable then you may as well just consider it cash and who can't use more cash?</div></div><hr />

Actually, once you've been screwed a few too many times, one way or the other, you start calling for a flat random, even on things you really need.  I lost a Dew Clover the other day, when if I had called NBG, I may have received it.  Better to be clear and straightforward ahead of time, than wait for the loot to drop and have a big dispute.</div></div><hr />

My thing is that if NO ONE in the current group can use the item as an upgrade, then everyone rolls on it. Since a cleric can't use the weapon, warrior gets it. But, the warrior couldn't roll on the next item that dropped until everyone has gotten a drop. <br />
Screw your alts, if you're lucky enough to win the roll on a drop that no one could use then give it to your alt, polish it, take a picture of it, sleep with it, who cares what you do with it, it's yours..period ! <br />
<br />
But to disband over loot is ridiculous.......that's one of the reason I left a long time ago (before returning). All the fun of EQ has been sucked out, now it seems like nothing but a treasure hunt, Player A has more/better loot than you or your alts, so he's not allowed to loot anything he may/may not use! <br />
That's just stupid !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was in a HoH group the other day, in the camp that's called SE top. It was a nice little group, Warrior, Cleric, Magician, Bard, Rogue, Shaman. I hadn't been there long when a Windblade dropped.<br />
<br />
The warrior looted it, and didn't say anything much.<br />
<br />
The cleric then said, &quot;Could I have that please?&quot; (She'd been chatting to me in tells about how some nice warrior weapon dropped that she could use for her alt, and that's the only thing she wanted. She seemed to expect to just get handed it.)<br />

The warrior said he'd like it, NBG. Now, normally I go for NBG when possible, even with expensive items in pickup groups. However, this warrior had gear like most of us only dream about. He had been boasting how he had 9700hp raid buffed, and he had a Blade of Carnage, and another really nice weapon, some really nice droppable gear overall (someone said his boots alone were worth 100k). He linked his current 2hs to show us what he'd be replacing - it was a Primal Velium Battle Axe, 45/44.<br />
<br />
Word to the wise..next time before you kill a single thing, you decide what you're doing with loot.  That way this situation NEVER happens, and if it did you would clearly know who was wrong.<br />
<br />
And people like to boast and make up stuff, maybe he was just saying he had all this stuff so you guys would group with him, just a thought.</div></div><hr />

That's ridiculous of course, but there you go.  I swore off NBG during the Kunark days when warriors got upgrade after upgrade defaulted to them that I would shortly see being sold in EC - while I'm running around with crap gear and missing most of my spells.  <br />
<br />
It was nuts for the warrior to expect to be handed the Windblade and it was nuts for the cleric to expect it to go to her alt.  <br />
<br />
In pick up groups, if you want it, roll for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well because the warrior might have nice armor or nice procing dw weapons doesnt mean he neccassarily had a nice 2hander to use. IF he spent the time and or money (not sure what was raid gear) than its possible he never went after a good 2h'er cuz those go to the knights and maybe rangers so its possible he didnt have anything and going to hoh to get in a group for a possible windlblade is feasable. I dont buy stuff if i can camp it instead. <br />
<br />
  However who knows and thats why its good to set loot rules ahead. I know warriors in alot of places sit and watch the parchments get looted so i'm more likely to just let him loot it if he says he is going to use it. Just loot heck if i am ever gonna get worked up over it. Sometimes easier said than done heh. <br />
<br />
  I wouldnt say anything to the guild he is apllying too. Didnt seem to have a problem with his playing? i might be wrong but seemed ok til the end when he bolted. Dont know its worth it might be better to write it off as a bad experience and let it go unless you see more stuff from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Melees want NBG when they see stuff they need, otherwise it's all roll (yeah they just hand me runes). I hate to generalize, but this has been my experience in the vast majority of cases. The only way to avoid arguments is to get the ground rules set before joining a group. Personally, I won't join anything that's not all roll -- I don't expect people to abstain when it's something I need, so I'm forced to roll when it's something that they need (otherwise you'll basically end up with nothing).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...That warrior has been playing in PoP, and has watched parchment after parchment after parchment after rune after rune after rune drop, and has patiently waited his turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
People actually did NBG on parchments/runes? Well, you can actually find NBG on ethereals now, cause the spells sell for about 50pp.... The last rune I saw went to a monk, and I have never seen a parchment drop (ethereal when they were valuable, specs now) that was NBG'd to a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">When its my group, its open rolls on everything.  When its someone else's, I ask, if I care.  Most times I just dont expect any loot unless I solo, and little then :D<br />
Anyone contributing should have an equal shot at the spoils, and if they happen to mule it over to an alt, theres not much you can do about it.  The cleric could have just not mentioned the alt, and you would likely feel a (little) bit better about it.  Face it, armor for a warrior costs a great deal of plat.  But by the same token, there are few pieces of droppable armor that cost as much as torpor.  EVERYONE needs the plat, gear costs money, spells cost money, kei cost money, sow potions cost money, etc etc etc.....<br />
Usually, when someone cries NBG, its always about greed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">IMO there were a lot of things that went wrong in that scenario. The Warrior didn't need it. Neither did the cleric. Both wanted to convince everyone else that they DID need it, so that they could have it. In reality, since neither of them needed it, it should have been a full random between all party members and if I'm not mistaken from reading your post that's exactly what you did.<br />
<br />
So yeah the warrior and the cleric were both selfish morons, but in the end you did a full group random which is what should have happened. Wrong process but correct result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What it boils down too is there isnt alot of trust in eq. Though can say people give alot of reasons to not trust. <br />
<br />
   Why i prefer straight open roll on loot regardless. I dont want to play who needs what games when i group. If people were honest all the time id let whoever needed the windblade and was going to use it loot it in a hearbeat. But never seems to go that smoothly. This is pickup groups mind ya. <br />
   I group with a set group of friends and dont need to play the loot game. If one of us needs than they get it. If not we sell and split on who was around that night. Alts dont get anything but what you buy from your split of selling. I have 3 accounts i could try and weasel stuff for alt forever. If only pickup groups were always that smooth. <br />
<br />
   But just a few days ago we had a rogue come creep up on us wanting a spot. Wasnt shouting or ooc for group at all. We were actually full group so he went to the shop in veks. We were killing golems and warklock undead. Like 15 minutes later guess who is getting yelled at in shout? The rogue who was all friendly with us bolted with haste belt right past us , right out the zone and ninja'ed it. Anyway i ramble.....i could see warrior needing even if he has good gear. I dunno if he did. If he did and the cleric weaseled way into a roll a shame but not alot of options to do otherwise. Situation like that if guildines werent set i go with majority rules on how to handle the loot and hope there isnt a tie heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Coming from a warrior stand point, the windblade is a good upgrade simply because they can do more damage with it. it is a perfect situation in a warrior's mind to use the primal until it procs then swap in the windblade. just like my paladin had a narandis lance (for the proc) and a windblade. And since no one else in the group was going to directly use it, i think the warrior should have gotten it, but wasn't right to just take it.<br />
<br />
btw, if any melee rolls on parchments i freak out. i don't roll on melee only gear (well, if it says SHM i do :)) so they shouldn't roll on a spellcaster only chance at a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Its pretty simple.<br />
<br />
Was a upgrade to him. Cleric told you themselve they wanted it for a alt. Id be pissed off and leave the group if a upgrade was given to a class that cant even equip it. Its obvious the cleric was greedy and wanted to sell it or give it a alt.<br />
<br />
Now if he was rolling on parch's then no he shouldnt get it, but if not... i would have left to. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt &quot;warn&quot; anyone about it, it was a bad situation in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">These are standard loot rules<br />
<br />
It still BOGGLES me that people don't get this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actualy no , thats YOUR loot rules. 95% of groups i am in are nbg, if no casters NEED a etheral or spec then we roll on them, melee included. When something drops thats a upgrade for someone it almost always goes to them. Franly if its not that way ill behappy to go solo cash ro quest or play a alt, but its VERY rare i have to do that, i cant even remember the last time i did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">unless you have ALL the spells that a parch can return, why wouldn't you need it? a slim chance at a spell is still a chance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My question would be, &quot;W+f does a warrior need 2hs for?&quot;  Warrior taunt abilities are already grossly inferior to the other tank classes, why compound the problem with a big, slow, non-proccing 2hs weapon?   It just reduces the amount of damage the rest of the group can do without drawing aggro.    <br />
<br />
Perhaps he is a ping pong fan.<br />
<br />
*Edit* yeah i spose they could do more dps with a 2 hander, but still, a situationally used backpack weapon being &quot;needed&quot; is a bit of a stretch.  Especially if he rolled against a pally/sk.  But to me looting for an alt is pretty much the same as selling it, so the cleric had zero claim to &quot;need.&quot;<br />
Everyone has alts that can use gear, or they can make them.  Everyone needs plat too.<br />
<br />
NBG is garbage unless you are playing with people you know and will play with again (friends,guildies,allies,etc).  Of course, my stand has long been that pick-up groups too are garbage ....  I get pissy when a guildie invites me to a group and I discover that neither he nor I know the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly why i was saying a warrior MIGHT NOT have a raid 2hander and be trying to get a windblade. People would gripe if  a warrior got a raid 2h with why would they need that. <br />
<br />
   Warriors arent MA or MT 24hrs of the day. Warrior number 2 and up in a  raid are going to get more damage usually from going 2h. Same if he happens to not be the tank in an exp group. Last with my retired warrior with group of friends who could manage aggro i could go 2h with my warrior and do more damage and still Main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The thing is this: That cleric was a greedy, no good slimeball. That warrior has been playing in PoP, and has watched parchment after parchment after parchment after rune after rune after rune drop, and has patiently waited his turn. He was to be getting a CLEAR upgrade (yes, windblade is an upgrade over Primal, by a LOT post-proc), and yet he has to suffer through the casters/priests of his group deciding to divvy it up because they have ALTS TO SUPPORT, or because it fetches a lot of cash at the bazaar? <br />
<br />
You sir are a moron, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
I finally got my first self earned spectral parchment in BoT the other day...   I had lost 14 previous rolls and over 1/2 the time some rogue or warrior got the spectral parchment which he quickly went and sold as a MQ for 5-7k.   If phats drop i'm rolling on them.  I'm sorry but verant ****ed up and made everything in PoP uber rare drop so when I finally get lucky and have something drop in the group it's getting rolled for.   A 100k item = lots of spells.<br />

In my opinion it was wrong for the warrior to assume he got it and his looting it and not saying anything about it shows he was trying to be a sneaky ****faced bastard... it's prolly how he got most of his other gear.   He topped off his noobness by just disbanding.   He's probably an ebay or some whiny bastard who sucks at real life.<br />
<br />
The cleric did nothing wrong.   He simpled asked if they could roll because something awesome dropped and the warrior was trying to keep it on the downlow.   I think it was kinda retarded the cleric thought he'd just get it for his alt but he suggested a /random so I don't really think he expected to just get it.<br />
<br />
Also the warrior got what he deserved... jack ****, no one cares about a warrior bragging about his gear and how many AA's he has and **** in the pickup group.   If he wanted it he shoulda kept his trap shut about how uber his gear was and maybe they woulda let him have a nbg.</div></div><hr />

I have never once been in a group where the melee even *hinted* at taking a spell turnin component, but what I find incredibly amusing is your, and others' sheer hypocracy in this discussion.<br />
<br />
I wish you'd be honest for one second, but you can't be because that smashes the delusion.   Say it, be honest....<br />
<br />
&quot;I want melee loot because it's so damn much more expensive that I can hit a goldmine with a single drop by going AFK in the bazaar and ripping off some melee for this drop and I don't give a rat's ass if the person hunting with me needs it or not, because I'm in this game for #1 and #1 only, me&quot;.<br />

<br />
If you were grouped ith me, you would definitely roll on them.  Why?  Because I already have better... if I didn't have better and you were grouped with me, I guarantee you two things.   The fact that you even HINTED at wanting to roll on an upgrade for me would've gotten your ass thrown out of the group for being a selfish prick, and second, you could roll all day and night if you wanted, you'd never get the item, ever.   You could send tells, talk to my guild, do whatever you want, you still would NEVER have an opportunity to deprive me of an upgrade which dropped in an experience group.   On the other hand, I'd never even HINT at rolling on either loot or parchments/runes that you needed, because I'm WAY above taking something that you need.   It's gay and selfish.<br />
<br />
In my opinion it was wrong for the warrior to assume he got it and his looting it and not saying anything about it shows he was trying to be a sneaky ****faced bastard... it's prolly how he got most of his other gear.

<br />
Or he was pissed cause he was grouped with a self-centered ass who didnt' say ANYTHING until after the thing dropped then wanted to take an upgrade for a group member to twink with.   I'd have left too, and if I hadn't had better already, I'd have taken the thing with me.<br />
<br />
The cleric did nothing wrong. He simpled asked if they could roll because something awesome dropped and the warrior was trying to keep it on the downlow. <br />

No, the cleric wanted what was a stated upgrade for someone in th party to equip a twink.   The cleric was selfish and lame.<br />

Actually, since that was a major part of this (although I have severe doubts as to the veracity of a 9700hp buffed warrior exping in HoH and have gotten exactly what I expected in terms of proof of this claim, I'll assume that was BS made up by the original poster to bolster his case that the warrior &quot;didn't need&quot; the drop).<br />
<br />
The fact is, a warrior needs multiple weapons types to be effective.   Sorry pal, it just happens that way, you're not a warrior aand wouldn't know.    A warrior who doesn't want aggro but who wants to do DPS would benefit from a windblade and HOW DARE you presume to know what he does or doesn't &quot;need&quot; in a pathetic attempt to justify forcing him to roll on a serious upgrade to him.  He showed what he was upgrading from... a 45/44 weapon to a 50/44 weapon.  It's a substantial upgrade.  If you're going to assume that he's taking advantage of the group then deal with that and don't group him any more IF you can prove that he does that, but h said he was going to use the damn thing, so let him have it.   You &quot;I'm looking out for #1&quot; people sit back and wonder why you are in a predicament where you're just now zoning into HoH/BoT because they removed the flag restrictions, it's because you have too self-centered and nasty of a personality to fit into any guild worth a rat's ass, and will never see the &quot;good stuff&quot; that results from being of good character and not self-centered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get over it... mobs in HoH aren't that hard to kill, I see people soloing in there all the time.  Had he LD'd, or something what's the big deal?  Hell, the cleric could've easily tanked a slowed HoH mob.  He left when he realized that he was getting screwed by greed-filled casters and had no responsibility to provide them safe passage after denying him an upgrade he needed or at least claimed he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frodlin7th,<br />
<br />
Although your entire perception on what is 'fair' seems a bit skewed to me from my point of view...this statement and your previous opinions on this part of the situation astound me...<br />
<br />
How is this behavior -not- childish and a red flag for any recruiting/raiding guild? He clearly -waited- until the moment in time he could inject some sort of immature, vigilante justice because he felt slighted by a loot decision....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Actually,<br />
<br />
While I'm totally sympathetic to the warrior because of the craphole that PoP is in terms of melee, and more specifically warrior upgrades, that's not clouding my judgment at all.<br />
<br />
I simply go by what was stated as to having happenned by the original poster:<br />
<br />
At any rate, what happened was that the cleric argued the point, and in the end everyone rolled, except one person who abstained. The cleric won the roll. The warrior gave the Windblade to the cleric.<br />
<br />
Then, we started pulling again (pulls were interrupted during this). The bard came back with a mob, and at that point the warrior disbanded without saying a word.<br />
<br />
Chronologically, he left when he was forced to give an upgrade to him to his cleric to put on a twink.   There's no indication whatsoever that &quot;he waited until a mob was incoming to scoot out&quot; those are all things you people are pulling out of your rear ends to think worse of him.    All it says is, the warrior handed the item to the cleric, the bard pulled, and the warrior left.   <br />
<br />
What it DOESN'T say is that the warrior told the bard that he was ready to pull, or that he stated he'd be there for the pull or anything.  The ONLY thing that was stated was that the bard started pulling again, and before the first mob got there, the warrior took off.   The warrior wanted to leave the group because he felt stolen from, and there is NO indication that he left maliciously, only that the timing was unfortunate for the rest of the group because the bard, who could have EASILY aborted the pull with total memblur, bards are better pullers than monks nowdays.   <br />
<br />
You guys are simply assuming many many unstated things and attribting them to the warrior that weren't stated.<br />
<br />
This is a classic example of a shaman who was friends with the cleric who wanted something (notice they were yappin it up in tells beforehand), who didn't even notice until after his buddy pointed it out... then tried to justify it to himself by pulling the &quot;It's only 5 more damage&quot; card, he even compromised his own principles (Normally, I'm all for NBG) but he tries to justify it, making up little excuses so that he can feel comfortable when he pulls a NBG on a rune/Parchment/loot piece without feeling as self-contradictory as he actually is.</div></div><hr />

I rarely coment on anyone's reading comprehension as it is extremely clich..but lets looks at what you are seeing and what you have stated...<br />
<br />
your quote:<br />
&quot;The ONLY thing that was stated was that the bard started pulling again, and before the first mob got there, the warrior took off. &quot;<br />
<br />
It doses? cause I read it as &quot;The bard came back with a mob, and at that point the warrior disbanded without saying a word.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bard came back with a mob&quot;&lt;---this part is the key here(pay attention)<br />
&quot;at that point&quot;&lt;---another key clue to the big picture<br />
&quot;the warrior disbanded without saying a word.&quot;&lt;---what I would defiantly call childish behavior<br />
<br />
Not sure how you can read anything differently then the warrior leaving at the point the bard had return w/mob..without saying a word....spite rears its ugly head??...for anyone with half of a sense of logic...Id say yes.<br />
<br />
Your quote:<br />
&quot;.....and before the first mob got there.....&quot; he took off.<br />
<br />
Where dose it state that???<br />
<br />
your quote:<br />
&quot;You guys are simply assuming many many unstated things and attribting them to the warrior that weren't stated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Id like to volley that statement right back at ya ;) in fact theres really -less- info to interpret -your- perception as there is mine...but I suppose thats just my opinion and moot here.<br />
<br />
your quote:<br />
&quot;and there is NO indication that he left maliciously, &quot;<br />
<br />
come on...give me a break...this situation isn't -that- hard to read between the lines....I think it is you who is wanting to read into this differently to justify your own perspective on how 'melee has been screwed loot wise in PoP' (paraphrasing of course)<br />
<br />
Did the melee ask how the item was going to be distributed in the first place when he decided to loot it? From indication by the poster it was he who was just going to pocket it without a word in the beginning...its that action alone that would have made me raise the issue about rolling on it even if I had felt like he deserved it...lets be fair and honest....if were gonna be fair and honest...ya know??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Sure are lot of facts being thrown around for only one person having been there heh. This debate could go on for ever. All i know is warrior needing it is plausable. I cant decided if he did or not but even if he only uses it 25% its 25% more than the cleric could of. <br />
<br />
  However not every group is NDG or full roll. If you forget to set the rules before hand your gonna have people get sore about it. Reporting it to a guild or possible guild just didnt sound right ot me. IF THe warrior could actually use it and feels you guys screwed him out of something that would be an upgrade maybe he should report all the group member to their guilds. Sound silly? Deal with the situation best you can and move on. <br />
<br />
  Beyond that if you want to hang this nameless faceless bad warrior go for it , want to paint the cleric as greedy go for it but dont kid yourself you have the facts. THink the real question anyway wasnt who we thought was at fault but what would you have done. I would of realized we effed up by not setting loot rules. If people want to push the matter and not let the warrior loot than majority rules on to roll or not. <br />
<br />
   Sounded like alot of people were real quiet about this and didnt want to get into a disagreement. Seems like warrior being painted with the bad guy brush....but why did everyone let him loot it and not say anything? Anyway he may be at fault but sounds like he wasnt the only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the warrior - I mentioned to a friend in that guild that I'd had a minor problem with an applicant, and my friend named the warrior without any further prompting, and said they thought he was ebayed. His name has been changed too, and that character used to be in the no.1 guild on the server when he had the original name.<br />

I can't give any proof about his gear, what do you expect? I've read his guild application and it said, &quot;my Gear well i am sure most of you have inspected me so i wont even bother listing a magelo...but..7287 hitpoints unbuffed 1722 ac unbuffed...&quot;. I didn't even inspect him, but I saw his weapons, I saw how easily he held agro, and I saw how long it took for his HP to go down. (Also I seem to recall the cleric mentioning that she got off a 7500 heal on him).<br />
<br />
I still feel that the cleric was nice, naive and greedy. The warrior was unpleasant, boast-ful and greedy.<br />
<br />
I won't name the warrior or the cleric (who is 65 and unguilded), because I didn't post this to be a witchhunt.<br />
<br />
The reason I brought it up here at all is because I still don't know what I *should* have done - should I have spoken up for NBG for the warrior, when I had serious doubts about his genuine need for the item? I'm still unclear as to whether NBG covers situational stuff, I've always assumed it doesn't, which is why I let that roll take place at all.<br />
<br />
I've let people roll on things that I could and would use, when they were situational - weapons that were about the same as my current weapon, but different skill, or different procs, or situational focus effect, or things that I'd use for resist gear, *and* I've rolled (and lost) on 2hers when playing my ranger which would have been improvements on my current 2her but not as good as my 1h combinations.<br />
<br />
I applied my own standards to the group, so I came here to ask if that was wrong to do. I guess you guys are about as divided as my own feelings on the matter are. Big grey area. At the time, I wasn't sure, so I didn't speak out one way or the other. I'm still not sure. *shrug*.<br />

I try and give people benefit of the doubt, i try and remember to talk about loot rules before hand and i try to hope we as a group would do the fairest thing when rules are forgotten about. Would you do it differently? Sometimes roll is all you can do and someone will be unhappy most of the time if it comes to a roll. But what can you do? This stuff going to happen. Eq is nice sometimes can meet alot of nice people , Eq isnt nice as sometimes you meet some not so nice people. The fact your trying to figure out whats the best to do here shows you care and as one of my friends says Its all good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">If you were grouped ith me, you would definitely roll on them. Why? Because I already have better... if I didn't have better and you were grouped with me, I guarantee you two things. The fact that you even HINTED at wanting to roll on an upgrade for me would've gotten your ass thrown out of the group for being a selfish prick, and second, you could roll all day and night if you wanted, you'd never get the item, ever. You could send tells, talk to my guild, do whatever you want, you still would NEVER have an opportunity to deprive me of an upgrade which dropped in an experience group. On the other hand, I'd never even HINT at rolling on either loot or parchments/runes that you needed, because I'm WAY above taking something that you need. It's gay and selfish.<br />
<br />
Jesus, who made you God?<br />
<br />
Seriously, lots of items have hp that are great for melee and shaman.  Yet, if it's an upgrade for you, you kept it.  <br />
<br />
And you call others selfish.  A remarkable display of sophistry.  <br />
<br />
Melee loots sell for more?  Where do you get off with that idea?  No more no less than anything else for anyone else - and casters need spells in addition to gear.  <br />
<br />
You are flat out wrong.  Obviously you can be right in your own mind, and you sincerely believe that you are, but I think you sound like a nut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Frodlin7th,<br />
<br />
I will attribute your ignorance to the anger you feel about the subject.<br />
<br />
You are all pissed because all you see is a warrior not getting a weapon he may or may not have needed and since you play a warrior you are gonna whine.    You've pointed out a few good things but this is what stands.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1  The warrior cannot decide at the point something drops the looting rights of the entire group.    That's like if a spec dropped he could just call... ok we are rolling, but if a l33t warrior weapon dropped it's NBG... you have to set that **** up before the group starts and for me and every group that I've EVER been in if loot rules are not stated, THE DEFAULT IS /RANDOM.   Why because it's the only fair way.<br />
<br />
#2  It should be noted that there are 6 people in a group.   So the cleric brought up the point of rolling.   If this was such a drastic idea then the other 4 people in the group could have disagreed and said, &quot;no the warrior deserves it&quot;  but they didn't because as I've mentioned in #1, if sh1t isn't stated, then the group rolls.   Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
#3  That's all fine and nice that you never rolled on a spec Frodlin7th , but most of your other melee cohorts DO roll on them.   9 out of 10 groups i'm in are /random not NBG.    You want NBG go join a guild.<br />
<br />
#4  I have no sympathy for the warrior because he was being cocky and bragging about how uber his gear was and how much it cost.   I am not as kind to cocky people as I am to characters who I know are wearing sh1t armor and really could use an upgrade or an item to sell to get them those upgrades and I have often rolled on something, won it, and deferred it to someone I thought needed it more.<br />
<br />
#5  Your comments about how you run your groups and loot and how you kick people out if they want to roll would last for about 5seconds on my server.   You would be labeled a noob and most would have you on /ignore or simply snicker at your /ooc lvl 65 war lfg...PLEASE@##!!@!@   Don't believe me ask others what happened to a certain bard named Amplyfyre on Ayonae Ro.   He reminds me a lot of yourself.<br />
<br />
#6  The fact the warrior said nothing after he looted the weapon is grounds enough for us to assume he was just snatchin it.   Again remember there are 6 other memebers in the group and if he really wanted it to be NBG he shoulda said something when he looted it or while it was still on the corpse.   Then after ALL members of the group had agreed on nbg, he should have gotten it.   He did it wrong and he paid the price.   With his attitude I'm surprised he actually handed the cleric the sword and didn't pull the old:<br />
<br />
&quot;omg laaaag laaaagggg!!!!!&quot;  /Q<br />
<br />
#7  I don't care how much a group pisses me off by either playing like crap, pulling horribly, doing stupid stuff with loot.   You never leave like he did.   If you are truely pissed tell the group, &quot;hey I don't really agree with what you guys are doing so i'm gonna take off take care&quot;  or even a pissed off &quot;**** you all i'm outta here&quot;, is better than just leaving like a whiny ass bitch who didn't get his UBER l33t sw0rd so he could go brag to the next group how he has even more l33t st4tz.   Warriors are only as good as their supporting army aka Group/Guild.    Obvious you and this warrior haven't learned that yet.    Without a solid group or guild you are nothing but a mob snack with cool looking plate armor and if you piss off enough people you will spend your time soloing lt blues or running around norrath being laughed at.<br />
<br />
p.s. just so you know I have a 63 warrior and a 65monk as well as my 65 shammy so believe me I know full well &quot;HOW IT IS&quot;, bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">#1 The warrior cannot decide at the point something drops the looting rights of the entire group.

Why because it's the only fair way.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in knowing something:   Did Specs/Runes drop in the group and did the warrior ask to random on them?   Did the priest belt drop in the group and did the warrior ask to roll on it?    That would open a lot more information.    This is information which doesn't show up in this discussion.     Fact is, the cleric had no right to dictate the looting policies after the fact any more than the warrior did, the only difference is the warrior was the only one who could wield the piece of gear and he claimed it was an upgrade.  Anyone with ANY character whasoever who isn't playing 'Me First&quot; EQ would simply let him have it.    <br />
<br />
<br />
#2 It should be noted that there are 6 people in a group. So the cleric brought up the point of rolling. If this was such a drastic idea then the other 4 people in the group could have disagreed and said, &quot;no the warrior deserves it&quot; but they didn't because as I've mentioned in #1, if sh1t isn't stated, then the group rolls. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Nothing is &quot;plain and simple&quot;, nor is your version of &quot;if it's not stated, then it's random&quot; any more than your idea of the ideal, which is simply wrong anyhow.  At least one person abstained from rolling in the group, the cleric and her buddy buddy shaman decided that they had some inside info about the warrior and his needs that went against what he said, although they have no clue what it means. <br />
<br />
#3 That's all fine and nice that you never rolled on a spec Frodlin7th , but most of your other melee cohorts DO roll on them. 9 out of 10 groups i'm in are /random not NBG. You want NBG go join a guild.<br />
<br />
Note:  I said not just me but no melee in ANY group I've EVER been in has rolled on a parchment/rune when there was someone there who needed it.<br />
<br />
#4 I have no sympathy for the warrior because he was being cocky and bragging about how uber his gear was and how much it cost. I am not as kind to cocky people as I am to characters who I know are wearing sh1t armor and really could use an upgrade or an item to sell to get them those upgrades and I have often rolled on something, won it, and deferred it to someone I thought needed it more.<br />
<br />
So it's better for you to fix a roll by rolling twice for a person who you think wants it (their roll + your roll) than it is to ask someone if they need it and give it to them?   Odd values.<br />
<br />
#5 Your comments about how you run your groups and loot and how you kick people out if they want to roll would last for about 5seconds on my server.

<br />
The difference is, I don't do the pickup group thing.   There's not too many in PoFire/Earth/Water.    I'm happy as a clam when someone I'm grouped with gets an upgrade, and don't feel the need to control the outcome or steal upgrades from groupmates so I can make a quick buck in the bazaar.   If someone wants something, they aren't afraid to ask for it, they'll almost always get it, unless it's some gay &quot;I want this so I can sell it in the bazaar even though it's an upgrade for someone else in group&quot;, then they're out on their ass.   The LAST thing I want is some piece of crap sitting in my inventory waiting for me to sell it for more worthless plat.<br />
<br />
#6 The fact the warrior said nothing after he looted the weapon is grounds enough for us to assume he was just snatchin it. Again remember there are 6 other memebers in the group and if he really wanted it to be NBG he shoulda said something when he looted it or while it was still on the corpse.

<br />
&quot;omg laaaag laaaagggg!!!!!&quot; /Q<br />
<br />
The fact that he argued his case and abided by the group's decision is the reason I'm defending him, evn though he should've never had to be subject to it in the first place.<br />
<br />
#7 I don't care how much a group pisses me off by either playing like crap, pulling horribly, doing stupid stuff with loot. You never leave like he did. If you are truely pissed tell the group, &quot;hey I don't really agree with what you guys are doing so i'm gonna take off take care&quot; or even a pissed off &quot;**** you all i'm outta here&quot;, is better than just leaving like a whiny ass bitch who didn't get his UBER l33t sw0rd so he could go brag to the next group how he has even more l33t st4tz.

<br />
That's such a pile of crap it's not even funny, yes there's class interdependence, no you should NEVER use that to use a toon so you can divvy up gear that you can't even use on the character you're playing.<br />
<br />
p.s. just so you know I have a 63 warrior and a 65monk as well as my 65 shammy so believe me I know full well &quot;HOW IT IS&quot;, bitch.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Well, here is my thought. Lets say your hunting (in a group) and topor or malo drops. Even if you (the Shammy) dont have it, do you automatically get it?<br />
The warrior may really need a better weapon or piece of armor that he/she could get IF they sold the spell for 30k.  If you think of it that way, the NBG idea gets all screwy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">NBG in a pickup group is just mislabeled greed.  If it can be sold or traded for another item then everyone needs it equaly.<br />

<br />
I assure you that this would not be the case.  Refusing to abide by the decision of the majority of the group members is considered a violation by the GMs.  There have been cases of just such a thing on my server, and the GMs have intervened and removed the item from the person and delivered it to the person who won the roll.  Dont bet you could hide behind crappy CS, either; they may be slow to respond... but a /report of the rolls and an email to the server gm referencing the /report file does get a response -at least on my server.<br />
<br />
It sounds like several people were being dinks here and assuming that the item would go to them, but a roll was done and the results were followed.  Leaving the group as it was described sounds punative and childish, and the results are that the persons reputation was tarnished.  Sometimes that matters, most of the time it doesnt.  oh well.</div></div><hr />

Loot has worked the same everywhere and always, it's just that the way it seems to work is the most greedy, self-centered people tend to advance far less than those who value the contributions of others, so it ends up filtering downward.<br />

<br />
Actually, he isn't stated ANYWHERE to have said &quot;nbg&quot;, he simply assumed it was, based on his looting of the item and not saying anything, knowing full well that the rest of the group had seen the loot message.   It was only after being cornered by the cleric/shaman combo that he said anything, and he appears to have argued his case at the time.   God with all your &quot;reading between the lines&quot; you're sure making a lot of crap up.<br />

It's HIS perogative on what he does with that equipment after he wins it, whether he gives it to someone in the group that he feels needs it or sells it or just straight up destroys it because it's worthless, in his opinion.  That's his choice and you can't take it away from him by arguing that he's cheating others out.<br />
<br />
Frodlin, you need to drop out of this argument completely because you come from a different world.  You have already stated(multiple times I think) that you only group with guildmates.  You don't do pick-up groups and you obviously, from the way you so stringently defend NBG in any situation, don't understand the dynamics of them very well.  We understand and all agree that it should be NBG for friends and guildies but it should not be NBG for pick-ups.  There's too many factors and items can be used in so many ways to make money, even if the winner can't use them directly.  A straight random, with no collusion or duo-box rolls is fair to all involved, regardless of how the equipment is distributed after it's been rolled on.<br />
<br />
Everyone who argues with Frodlin, is arguing about a different subject than he is and it's all getting confused into one huge mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Up until recently I have always done the NBG thing to the point that I was being run over constantly , I did not have most of my spells, and definitly did not consider pp 'worthless'.  <br />
<br />
I started a discussion similar to this and took the overwhelming advice of :<br />
<br />
- ALL GROUPS THAT ARE NOT GUILDIES ARE /ran ON A SEED.  If you win an item then you are out until everyone recieves something near the same value.  <br />
<br />
Due to this policy I have lost 2 or 3 spectrals to melees...<br />
I have won a couple of melee items and traded them for spectrals... <br />
See how this works?  <br />
If you use NBG the nice person will always loose unless they are in a guild group or grouped with nothing but friends.  If you win the item that you thought someone else should get then be a paladin and give the person the item. <br />
<br />
It sucks to start groups and play the 'Loot macro' but since I have done that I have been able to get my spells for lvl 65 and actually enjoy playing my shaman again.  Everyone gets a fair chance this way and the only way anyonje gets screwed out of anything is if your an ass and decide to leave the group as soon as you win something. (Do that enough and you will be lfg for a long long time I am sure)<br />
<br />
PS: Most of the smaller items are never rolled on and the little greedy bastards that loot everything as soon as it dies still get more than everyone else in the group, so this rule even keeps them happy.  Because people like me will not complain about the 15pp items as long as we get a fair chance at things we actually need to support our characters.<br />

Going off on wierd tangents like giving an item away after winning a random is somehow dishonestly randoming doesn't help you in your attempt to sound reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In many cases people will pass on their roll if someone else in the group will use an item as an upgrade and that's great.  I do it myself quite often.  But unless it's stated outright at the beginning that everything is going NBG or at least unanymously agreed upon at some later point, NBG is up to each person in the group (i.e. you  can pass on your roll to bring some NBG to the group)</div></div><hr />

This is my last post on this thread because I've come to the conclusion you are someone who likes to argue about things they don't understand and are too pigheaded to finally just shut your trap when you are wrong and everyone agrees you are wrong.<br />
<br />
You obviously come from a server we've never played on.   Your comment about:  <br />
<br />
It pains me to know that people who feel nothing toward stealing upgrades from someone because the item happens to sell for a lot of PP think I'm a fu(ktard. I'll remember that when Malo/Torpor drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really has me shaking in my boots.  Why don't you go to the bazaar someday and look up a few lvl 63+ shaman spells, realize you are retarded, and zip it.   Or perhaps you would like to start a new thread saying we are all stupid and loot whores and that our spells really don't cost so much because PP is worthless...<br />
<br />
Malo and Torpor are running around 30-80k on every server, get a clue man.</div></div><hr />

That's his choice and you can't take it away from him by arguing that he's cheating others out.<br />

If somebody doesn't want the loot, they shouldn't roll.  It doesn't get much more basic than that.<br />

Now, to get back to rest of this conversation, I've played 2 characters (65/140 warrior, 65/60 shaman) since early Kunark.  It might just be the server that I'm on, but I'd estimate that over 75% of the pickup-groups that I've been in have been NBG.  It started years ago back in Kunark and it still continues today in PoP.  There are just some things that MOST groups take for granted:  Gems go to clerics, Spells go to priests/casters, Swords go to Melee...  If it wasn't specifically stated when the group formed that it was an all/all random loot group, I think there are MANY people that would have assumed it was a NBG group (myself included!).<br />
<br />
I'd also like to emphasize a question that Frodlin asked that everyone seems to be ignorning...<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in knowing something: Did Specs/Runes drop in the group and did the warrior ask to random on them?<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to bet that there was at least one parchment/rune drop before the Windblade dropped.  What happened to it?  Assuming that the warrior wasn't included in the loot discussions, this would confirm that it was a NBG group.<br />

To address the first part of your reply:<br />
<br />
With all due respect your Bush analogy doesn't make much sense...<br />
<br />
Who's to say he -didn't- want it? And what he felt like doing with it was -giving it away- to who he felt deserved it? I think allot of people rely on opinions to much......without recognizing just that.....their opinions.<br />
<br />
As to the second part of your reply:<br />
<br />
Are these groups people you are familiar with? Like people who you've come to have a certain amount of respect...even without really knowing them directly? Such as guild members of respected guilds, players that pop up in groups commonly, ect.. That would be a big factor in your point and if so I would agree with you in NBG. However in purely stranger type groups I fail to see how anyone can believe that /ran is unfair in any way, shape or form. BUT....thats just my opinion ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
Correct, they are opinions.  My opinion is that you need to have a certain amount of respect for the other people in your group.  Sure, GroupMember_03 might be your close friend and both of you would prefer to get the loot over a total stranger.  There's nothing wrong with thinking that way, afterall we're all allowed to be greedy sometimes.  The problem is when you actually decide to act on those thoughts by rolling on pieces with the intention of passing to your friend when you win.  As soon as you pull this type of stunt, you are taking a loot system that was designed to be fair and you are skewing the odds in favor of your friend thus making the loot system unfair to everyone else.  <br />

<br />
I was speaking of groups with all different types of people (strangers, friends, guildies).  The &quot;norm&quot; on my server is that even in a pick-up group full of strangers, NBG is used unless they all decide otherwise when forming the group.  <br />
<br />
Also, please note that I have never said that /ran is unfair, I said that /ran wasn't the norm for most of the groups that I've been in.  Using the RNG to decide loot is &quot;technically&quot; one of the fairest methods that we have available in-game (assuming that you are only rolling for yourself).  The problem is that the concept of &quot;fairness&quot; is based on people's opinions.  I think that most people would consider a warrior walking away with a Rune over a caster would be unfair.  That type of &quot;unfair&quot; loot decision is much  more likely to happen using /ran than by using NBG to reward loot.<br />

<br />
That's why I was asking... ;)  <br />
<br />
Before I finished off my elemental flags, HoH was my regular zone for doing XP (mainly because I was looking for a Windblade for my warrior ;) ).  Having been in dozens of HoH groups and spending hundreds of hours in that zone, I have yet to see a Windblade drop.  That being said, parchments drop on a fairly regular basis and if this group had been there for more than an hour or two, I'd be VERY surprised if they hadn't had one drop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">A lot of the difference seems to be not as much where you fought, but when you fought there.  Frodlin, you've had good experiences at the leading edge of eq, with low populations.  Most of us are arriving into high level zones at a much later time, with ever changing groups.  When the number of people who are capable of a given zone might number in the dozens, you're going to know each other, and have some idea of their capabilities, equip, etc.  For the 99% of the eq population that aren't in uber guilds, this is simply not the case.  There is absolutely no way that anyone else in that group could have made a real decision about whether or not the warrior 'needed' the windblade.  Unless this was a real upgrade, then his attitude is PURELY one of greed.<br />
Even calling nbg before the group starts hunting will not solve this, it just narrows down the number of people screaming out their 'need'.  What if there were two warriors?  In such a situation, the two normally roll for the item, but is this any more fair?  Not really, what if one legitimately does need this more than the other.  Still gonna be an open roll between the two, with the other 4 members being left out.  Most need may not get the item.  What if there was a knight?  Would not a knight automatically 'need' this more than a warrior?  Rangers?<br />
There is absolutely no way to distribute loot that wont leave hard feelings, even if the upset person is COMPLETELY in the wrong.  Seems the only way around it is to be uber and group with equally uber people, that way you just let it all rot (like thats gonna happen).  Or, perhaps, group only with people who have good attitudes towards this game and wont get mad over loot.  Of course, that means you cant do pickup groups which is the whole point of this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">This shows the problem with opening the planes by level, a lot of &quot;new&quot; folks around.  I found that in most tier 3 groups nbg was implied.  The number of people in the planes was limited, most belonged to a relatively small number of known guilds, and everyone knew their turn was coming.  Loosing your spec today didn't matter, you'll get one tomorrow.<br />
Now you have people in totemic armor running around in BoT, for whom the idea of a 20 k item is unimaginable.  Suddenly greed becomes much more prevalent.  I guess it comes down to your reputation, and whether you plan to join a upper level guild at some point.  If you're known as greedy you will probably not go very far.<br />
On the other hand, there are not too many warriors for whom the above description fits on Xev, and if my guess is correct I have grouped with him in one of the best killing teams ever (what for me means AA in less then an hour). He's good, he didn't seem greedy, and it might be that he was just disgusted enough with the situation to call it quits.  Even presuming he's ebayed, it might very well be that the character was stripped of any &quot;droppable better the primal&quot; 2HS, and he actually thought it a reasonable upgrade. <br />

In the Windblade situation, its pretty safe to assume that only one is gonna drop in any pick-up groups time there. Why should only one person benefit from the drop (NBG/random or whatever)?<br />
<br />
Did any of your group have a trader bot on a second account? Any of you sit regularly on an auction channel?<br />
<br />
If i were there, id turn to my trader bot, do a quick search on the price of windblades, pick a slightly lower price (to make the sale fast) and /OOC or /auction WTS Windblade XXp. Come to HoH to pick it up. Sell Windblade, split the plat.<br />
<br />
OR, if someone in the group really needs it for an upgrade, they can offer to buy it from the group, and the other 5 split the plat.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.</div></div><hr />

That's what I typically try to do in pickup groups.  Sometimes it's not possible, and when it's not, we roll.<br />
<br />
But just my 2cp, I would feel incredibly guilty rolling on a ornate plate/leather/silk mold/pattern, maybe it's just me.

I am perfectly happy with NBG for the most part. If not for the cleric, I would probably have been happy to let the warrior keep the Windblade for the sake of a quiet life. I've since been in another group where a Windblade dropped and it was given to the warrior NBG.<br />

<br />
Well, he wasn't a bad warrior, he had a ton of HP and kept agro reasonably well. I liked him, even though he was boasting about his gear. I wasn't grouped with him very long though. And yes, I agree he must have been disgusted enough to call it quits. But, that's the main problem I had with him - waiting until we had a mob incoming before doing that. Childish. But judging from his gear, he had no right to claim NBG in the first place, either.<br />
 <br />
Hey, I don't even have a 1 HB, so I might ask for something NBG that you might not consider &quot;an upgrade&quot; at my level of equipment.  But then, I usually pass on specs if someone claims NBG.<br />
<br />
If it was you, Shamu, I'd trust you. I too personally would not claim NBG on an item that I wouldn't use. In some cases, if say it was a 1hb, I might explain that it's a situational upgrade and leave it to the group to decide. I would *expect* to have to roll on it - as has happened in the past.<br />
<br />
And yes, most people *assume* NBG. That's part of the problem - most people assume it, but it doesn't get sorted out before something good drops. But, even if we had agreed NBG, the same issue would have arisen in this case, because of the question of whether it would apply in this case. Looking at his gear, I don't think he can rightly claim he needed it.<br />
<br />
I hope this doesn't make me look greedy. All I was trying to do is establish what would have been the right thing to do in that case. I didn't know how to handle it at the time. I'd love to believe everyone was honest, but things like this don't help. NBG is all very well, but in a pickup group, if someone lies about needing an item, then the group gets screwed and there's no recourse.</div></div><hr />
