<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My DMotE is alright and all, but its quickly becoming one of my crappier pieces of gear. Anything out there thats droppable that provides more than 35 hp, and more than 12ac? Only thing I can think of off the top of my head would be the mask of the dragon slayer ( I think thats what its called) I believe its 50hp with ID III on it and numerous other stats. <br />
<br />
How about some reasonably easier to accuire no drop stuff? It will be a while before I get back into NToV - sky watchers monocle, or *gulp* Lady N's Mask of Terror? is that what its called? The priest mask she drops. Either way im seriously not looking forward to fighting that ho again, especially with no rods.<br />
<br />
How about some of the lower Snake bosses? They drop any decent face items?<br />
<br />
Input needed! Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Really, for the face I would think that most upgrades from your current mask are either going to materialize out of PoP, drop off a raid mob, or be the result of a fairly time consuming quest.  Not sure if some of the newer player made armor might fit the bill, but I have seen little in tradeable face items that are better than DMotE. <br />
<br />
Not to derail your looking for a new face item, but I would really go after your back slot 1st.  Get an Iksar Hide cloak or Shadowy Assassin's cape instead.  You may be taking a reduction in AC, but overall you will be better off.  Heiro is ok too, but I have a psychological problem with no resist items in slots where resist items are easily found. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shadowy assassins cape? Unfamiliar with that. I was holding out on my back slot until I could get a cloak of destruction/net of the deep sea :)</div></div><hr />

Edit: because I suggested an item from the new warders in ST but then I remembered that Xev still has a sleeper. <br />
<br />
There do seem to be some nice face items coming out of PoP, could be some tricky encounters tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally use a Golem's Jawbone and think its worth the 20k I paid for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
HP is a little low (25) but it has 8wis and 50mana ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ooooo...the elusive Dreadfang mask!!  Have had a hard time getting CT groups together since PoP came out :/<br />
<br />
Krak, the Ass cape drops in UP and is AC12 +8agi/dex +7MR/CR/FR while the Iksar Cloak is AC10 +15PR/DR +75hp/mana.  You could even do the super easy Velium Studded Cloak quest (AC12 +5FR/CR +25hp) if on Kael faction or buy one for fairly cheap.</div></div><hr />
