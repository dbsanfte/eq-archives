<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We've been messing around in tipt for a few weeks now, and due to some calamity or other, end up dying before getting to the top.  Not that it hasn't been worth it, we're all decked out with ft2/regen2, 30hp/mana, 30hp/end, aob augs now from that cragbeast =)  Most of our problems come because we 2 or 3 box a lot (warrior runs the cleric, enchanter the druid, if the wizard isn't around the warrior/cleric runs him too), so hasted pet breaks sometimes get bad if someone isn't watching to stun, or happens on one of the rare 2 pulls.<br />
<br />
So finally we get up to the top today, and the boss is the only thing left alive.  From reading around various spots, everything indicates he's a pretty buff fight.  And after a couple hours of clearing stuff to get to him, we weren't gonna risk losing again and having to reclear all that crap.  So we camp the cleric in a corner, and decide we'll do a test run with druid and me healing, no cleric at all.  Pull him, hit furious, wizard manaburns, hasted pet engages ... mob dead in a minute.  No cleric necessary.  Rampaged twice, unfortunately that was enough to kill me with him at 15% health.  Cong me on Bracer of Exploration =)<br />
<br />
Group makeup is warrior, cle (boxed), enc, druid (boxed), wizard, myself.  Enchanter is in an EP guild, so he's got some decent gear.  Rest of us hate raiding, so we've just got what we can get ourselves or buy.  I'm up to about 3720 hp unbuffed (after the bracer), warrior runs about 9100 with our buffs (fos, kazad/9).  So if you're not in a raiding guild (or in a lower end one), GoD trials are definitely finishable, just takes some time (and an enchanter w/ pet).  I don't think we'd have much chance of finishing without an enc.<br />
<br />
And for anyone interested, Cleave I does give shaman the ability to crit:<br />

<br />
Does the bracer effect work on Winterstorm?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When he says crit he mean melee crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, no luck on the winterstorm effect, 180 dmg with or without the bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats! While I agree that getting to the boss mob is harder than fighting the boss mob, he still puts out quite a bit of dps, so any shamans there who will be assist healer, be prepared to spam heal as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have a charmed pet the last boss goes down before he can do much damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail, like I said about 50 times before, you don't need any uber group to finish these.. however I'm sure even with your post we're going to see someone say tomorrow that GoD is too hard and they can't finish vxed/tipt because so.  Like I've also said.. all you need really is a chanter/cleric and you can do both of them with just the two of you.<br />
<br />
edit:  Sorry, forgot to send my congratz to you.  I personally don't think that anything in kod'taz is charmable, but there is some very good gear that can drop from even the trash mobs there, so this will be a nice place to get some augments/gear.  Oh, and I think but not totally sure but most of the named can be mezzed, and at least some can be rooted (not root rotted, just rooted before you dmg them if you want to debuff before you engage.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tipt boss is much easier with a charm pet.<br />
<br />
Tipt boss is not a wimp though, I'd disagree with that statement hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He is definitely not a wimp. His DPS is more than Vindi's (which isn't all that amazing these days, but still can be quite challenging for a single group), and if you take too long to kill him he starts AEing crazy things (4 at once).<br />
His HPs are gimp, yes, but this is in line with most GoD mobs.<br />
<br />
They key is taking care of your chanter, and having a competent puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DPS more than vindi's? Lol... Vindi's DPS is anemic. He's probably closer to AoW when you consider the proc. Much less HP though :P<br />
<br />
I got ramped and took 2100x3 and two 600 procs, with 1500ac :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hasted pet engages ... <br />
<br />
And then you wonder why he goes down so fast?<br />
Just because a class can get a tottaly overpowered pet does not mean that the boss is a wimp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Kinda highlights a lot of whats broken about eq, dont it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Done this guy a couple times. Actually rampage tanked him the last time I did him, That was rather interesting i must say. Charmed pet for dps definitely helps alot. Mana burn didn't hurt either i'm sure. Probably could have tanked him with a ranger as long as the named lived to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He's probably closer to AoW  <br />
<br />
Duuur  :o   that's what I meant hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A duel wielding charmed hasted pooka will kill the named before weaponshield drops.<br />
Pooka has around 3000 dps when he's outfitted right.<br />
Ideal group I've generally found for Tipt is:<br />
Enchanter to charm Pooka<br />
Shaman/Mage to Malo Pooka<br />
Cleric for heals<br />
Warrior for tanking<br />
Ranger for Snaring<br />
Any 6th class for utility (rogue for pulling corpses, necro for feign/res, druid for more heals, 2nd enchanter for more pet power, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congratulations on your win.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be so ready to call the Tipt boss a wimp just yet.  I think you've seen the power of charm...  I've done him like 12 times now, have yet to lose but it's always a roll of the dice.  We've only used charm once, an enchanter happened to be with us, we did not plan the group around charm.  We've never used manaburn.  If you depend on charm and unique abilities like HT discs/manaburn/lifeburn to kill him then it would make it very difficult to succeed in a trial with your friends who don't have those abilities.<br />
<br />
My standard group for tipt is Bard, Shaman, Warrior, Cleric + 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Alright I keep seeing everyone say pookas are awesome pets ... but why?  We've spent a lot of hours in vxed/tipt, Hynid pets seem far and away better.  They (from our observations) have more dps, seem to have a higher attack value, and proc a lot.  Cragbeats seem 2nd best, they have a little lower attack than hynids, but a bit more hp/defensive abilities, and also proc a stun.  And if you really wanna go for some dps, those noc spraybloods can destroy some stuff if they proc a couple times, though they only spawn in 2-3 places.  We've never noticed a pooka doing anything more than the others, and they don't have any special abilities.<br />
<br />
And yeah, &quot;wimp&quot; was probably a little over the top, I was a bit over-excited at finally winning that damn thing (probably 10 odd times previous messing around and dying in between), and he went down with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have been told the Pookas tend to behave better, but I wouldn't know cuz we always use Nocs :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not sure. Never actually tried charming anything else. I know the pooka's are snarable which if you do things right makes them alot safer. I'm pretty sure the dogs are immune to snare. I had assumed that others might have been flagged as immune. Pookas might have the lowest mr making them easier to keep charmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Alright I keep seeing everyone say pookas are awesome pets ... but why?

<br />
As far as I know, Pookas are the choice because they have low MR and seem to be the slowest running creatures in the GoD expansion.  If snare drops, you can still outrun them easily with run3.  However, I'm not an enchanter and I've only been involved in one tipt (or vxed for that matter) where someone was using charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Afaik everything is snarable that we've tried to charm.  Only one's we haven't are stonemites (they're immune elsewhere, so maybe here), and the big stone guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Artebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Alright I keep seeing everyone say pookas are awesome pets ... but why?<br />
<br />
<br />
As others have said, Pookas are easily controlled compared to other mobs. They are not the highest DPS pets in the zone, but the difference is not that large and is not worth the extra difficulty of controlling another pet. They move slow, aren't very high MR, and don't have flurry, rampage, or procs that can kill your enchanter (and then your group) very quickly when charm breaks. They also aren't huge like cragbeasts, which is a plus.<br />
<br />
Noc pets, eh? Very brave, especially if you use them in Vxed where the Nocs seem to chain proc Chaos Claws. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The real title of this post should be <br />
&quot;Chanter pets ridiculously overpowered&quot;<br />
I have done all the trials without a chanter, and they were not trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah. Grats your chanter on charming a mob with the dps of multiple time geared rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No you mean this actually:<br />
<br />
&quot;Grats on passing a stupid POS trial designed for 6 man groups when this expansion was suppose to be more in the lines of a high end raid guild expansion&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry but coming from POP which most encounters were designed for 60+ (elementals + through Time&quot;) and make people form lame ass 6 man groups. <br />
<br />
Now we are down to 54 max raid content..when you can find it but mostly 6 man trials. Such a waste. Use what ever it takes to beat em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tipt boss is in NO way easy.  I have done him a NUMBER of times with both losses and wins.  The reason you *think* it is an easy mob is because of the insane dps you got from your chanter's charmed mob, which will reduce the length of the fight enormously.  Lose that pet and still leave the cleric camped and your group loses the fight guaranteed.</div></div><hr />
