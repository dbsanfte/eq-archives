<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics13/crimson_ring_desinence.jpg <br />
<br />
The question of the rechargable FD ring comes up in shaman chat about once a day so I figure I'll post this info here.<br />
<br />
Plane of Sky keys are no longer no rent.  You can clear to Isle 9 once, and keep all your keys forevermore.<br />
<br />
On your next trip to Sky you do not have to kill a single mob.  You can simply click from isle to isle using invis as necessary.<br />
<br />
This makes the Sister of Spires for the rare piece of the FD ring, or any other mob in Sky, farmable.  Clear sky once to get keys, then return every 4? hours and kill whatever mob you want just by heading straight to that isle.<br />
<br />
Also you don't need a large force - our typical group is 5 people for DT mobs - ranger ranger shaman cleric warrior.  Ranger eats 1st DT on pull and 2nd ranger trueshots, I lay on thick dot aggro and eat 2nd DT.  Mob always dies before the 3rd one.<br />
<br />
By far the most informative PoSky information I've found is this site:<br />
http://www.aotg.net/eq/plane_of_sky_guide_by.htm <br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe that ring would rock, just would take forever and then some.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you recharge it? make a trip to sky and hand it to someone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How do you recharge it? make a trip to sky and hand it to someone?<br />
<br />
Either take a stroll thru VP and avoid the cost of the stone, or get ported up to buy a Box of the Void to recharge, and another box to hold so you don't have to waste another 100+pp for a stone.<br />
<br />
Put the ring and a Class 5 Mana Battery in the Box to recharge.<br />
<br />
I have the newer version of the ring (basically just a different name) and it definitly comes in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Newer version?   Any easier to obtain (as in, a non DT mob, or not needing a wizzie and a couple keyed people)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The new ring is identical in every way except it has slightly different stats.<br />
<br />
Same click, same number of charges, same quest to get it. Old rings (and old Sky quest items in general) were not affected when they upgraded the quest rewards.<br />
<br />
Carrying 8 or whatever keys is not my idea of a good time...if they are going to make them survive leaving the plane, why not /keyring them so you don't need to carry them at all?</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah I'd just love to see 9 more lines on my keyring spam!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont care if they keyring them or not. I wont need to carry them unless I'm going up there. I'm just glad they changed them back again (there was a bug once for a couple days where they didnt poof) so we can keep them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very intresting, this could indeed be my next adventure.<br />
<br />
I mean technicaly, this sounds like you could port up, do a island then leave for something else, then come back next week and move up again. Once oyu finaly get to the island you can come back and farm when no raids are happeneing.<br />
<br />
veyr cool, this is one of those things like VT i thought i would not ever see, looks like that also might be changing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, Litgruv, that is how it works. My guild had a Sky raid planned today coincidentally, and the keys do not poof when you leave the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you got the ring yet by chance? It you need to drop the bee chic right ?I havent read about it in the while, but i know oyu need a ring to drop, im wondering if you cna go into farm status onit, how rareitll actualy be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Its very very rare, although that was compounded by the fact that it was just a nightmare to truely farm the bits.  The quest is on the verge of being reasonable with this change really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">8 keys = 8 bank slots taken up...that's a pretty sizeable chunk. Keyring spam is better than permenantly occupied storage space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hmmm, i wonder if they can be added to the keyring (doubt it )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmmm, i wonder if they can be added to the keyring (doubt it )<br />
<br />
Tested this, the isle 1 keys didn't keyring =(<br />
<br />
Still, its a huge leap in the right direction as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nope, I dont have the ring yet, but I'm going to sure work on getting one. I got one of the pieces for it on a raid we did about a month ago. Our raid yesterday got screwed up because one of the imps on the second island was lost someplace in the zone and we couldnt get the boss mob to spawn without that last imp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Our raid yesterday got screwed up because one of the imps on the second island was lost someplace in the zone and we couldnt get the boss mob to spawn without that last imp. <br />
<br />
We've been having the same problem.<br />
<br />
Incidentally how sure are we that this isn't yet another bug ? Making then stay when you leave the plane is great but is it intentional or temporary?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nope, I dont have the ring yet, but I'm going to sure work on getting one.

Best of luck to you, it took me 3.5 real years to get the ring completed. PoSky was a real PITA and people hated going there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye, Aruman, I know the horror of the rarity of that one drop. But if this key thing is indeed a 'feature' this time and not a bug, then that makes it a much friendlier zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Our raid yesterday got screwed up because one of the imps on the second island was lost someplace in the zone and we couldnt get the boss mob to spawn without that last imp.<br />
<br />
This happens alot.  Usually it gets stuck under the island.  Petition it, gm-admins always get us the mob on target and then we can nuke it for aggro.  Alternatively use an eye of zomm/holgresh beads (which work in 3 dimensions in sky it's whacky) and scout under the island for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, we tried all that. I was using vision to creep all through the zone trying to get a visual under the island. Had 3 or 4 eyeballs trying to find it. Had the bard running all over the island singing AE songs. We tracked it. Used pet triangulation. Had a petition in for over an hour while we tried to find it, but never got an answer. I finally just called the raid because people were getting antsy, and I had to go to work in an hour or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Once we had an imp spawn INSIDE an island. (managed to get it targetted and Bind Sight on it and F9 looked around yielded nothing but brown space. That says Inside the Island to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Skynex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Could someone that has keys checked to see if they still have them after the 08/06/03 patch?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'll check when I log in today. As of yesterday, I still had mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Still have keys post-patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm assuming the ring is the rarest piece?  If only because I have the bixie bit, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the spiroc feather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This (&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=11695&quot;) is a better link for it shows the cast time its instant cast which is what i was curious about any longer and it would be pretty useless (too much a chance to fail) its must equip too so u cant keep it in your invetory for quick escapes doh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As of today, I still have all the keys as well as the broken mirror from imps on second island. We went back on Friday to get more keys, and still had the same problem with 2nd island imps. This time GM killed the lost imp and spawned protector, but soon as I cast malo on him he poofed. GM then summoned us to gorg island, but we still havent managed to get the stupid keys from imps. I'm starting to wonder if the keys not poofing is just a bug again, considering how buggy the azaracks are.<br />
<br />
Spiroc feather probably isnt too rare, Laughingwoman. That's the one piece I got a while ago - either from pegasus island or spirocs (yes, sphinx/pegasus drop spiroc feathers sometimes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If I remember correctly, the emerald spiroc feather is also droppable.  I have one in the bank on Emarr I'd be happy to sell, I've given up, it's only been in the bank for over 2 years :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes, it is tradable. Most of the quest pieces that drop off regular mobs are tradable. I think mainly the items from island bosses are the no drop stuff - like that silly stein of flowing ichor we keep getting from the thunder princess.  :p</div></div><hr />
