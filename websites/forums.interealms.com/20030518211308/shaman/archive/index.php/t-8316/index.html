<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm gonna sell my Mace of the Blood Skull. I figure I can get 1-1.5k for it. I need to replace it with a piercing weapon. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I currently have a crystal grinder.<br />
<br />
I'm considering buying a Goranga Spear for its awesome damage output (especially at my level: 24).<br />
<br />
Advice appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm. Where's all the excellent advice I've come to depend on? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd give ya advice .. but with all the crap floating around now it's hard to provide good info.  Back in the days when I was your level, a jade chokidai prod was UBAH and I upgraded to that from an Ebon War Spear.   Thunder Runed War spears aren't bad, nor are Ice wurm shards (i think that's what it is ...).  Hell, I dunno.  I used to follow the good lewts on Alla's ... but I don't have the time to check in on what's what every day anymore.   So, with what limited knowledge I have, those are my suggestions (thuder runed, and Runed Icewurm Fang).  Correct me, PLEASE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is mebbe a little out of left field, and since I don't know what gear you are currently wearing, it is difficulat to gauge where you are at, but I would suggest buying a howling harpoon. <br />
<br />
My reasoning is as follows: It has good damage, and ok ratio (well, its ratio is passable), but it is range slot equippable, and it has lots of wisdom and mana on it, which is a good bonus. It also procs stun, which with a little bit of dex buffing can actually make a difference when you are tanking.<br />
<br />
I have seen Howling harpoons for sale for as little as 150-200plat in the bazaar, so you can buy one, and have plenty of plat left over to upgrade other slots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fair enough. What I'm trying to do is ballance the two. I need to skill-up, but I want to be able to finish mobs solo. I guess I should get are real fast weapon and skill up as much as i can then switch to the slow one once my skill looks good.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey while we are at this can anyone tell my how much my Mootogo focus staff goes for, I need to find a piercing weapon, but i have one that i am looking at already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howling harpoon is nice since you can throw it in the range slot if you find something better. A nice primary piercer that also shouldnt cost too much is the owlbear spear. It has roughly the same stats as howler (some wis and other stats) plus some ac. There's no proc on the owlbear though, so I'd go for howling harpoon. Ebon war spear is also really cheap if you need a range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spetsnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a soft spot for the Spear of Mortification  (6/23, procs Stun at level 20).  Shouldn't cost more than 200pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Njaal, its a Runed Etched Icewurm Fang, which from memory is 12/19 +5 wis + 10 mana +80 DD ice proc.<br />
<br />
IF you chuck haste on, its great, i routinely hit for 50s with it, and the proc is nice.<br />
<br />
It should cost about 3 - 4k, but you might find one cheaper.<br />
<br />
REally, your best best is to search for shaman useable piercers and sort by price. There have been so many new piercers added lately, that it is difficult to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye. I did Jade Chokadi Prod then jumped to Icewurm fang. But the fang costs 5k on Rodcet, so it's out of your league right now. <br />
<br />
Just do a bazaar search, really.</div></div><hr />
