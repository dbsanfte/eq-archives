<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>n0id</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently 53, and i know i get canni 3 next level, but i still want canni 2. (full book, etc..)<br />
<br />
So my journey started with buying the ochre clay in baz for 450p<br />
Then running to KC when a group at ent had just killed the warlord and let me loot the bones (took 5 min.../luck off)<br />
Now the only part i need is the yun shamans powder...cause the diamonds can be looted from the ground and im done.<br />
<br />
2 seperate nights, 5 hours each with a druid tracking around the lake and the entire area between lake and EJ zone....never saw that first yun shaman.<br />
<br />
We started to check from the lake to seb zone in, but there where never any frogs on track in that area.<br />
<br />
So my question is...are the tal/tsu shamans PH's....do i need to mass kill the frogs?  Do i need to do the hunter/forager cycle to get a yun to spawn?<br />
<br />
Is there a certain area it spawns in?, maybe a certain time of day/night....<br />
<br />
Just getting really frustrated that i did the entire quest in basically 15 min....and i get stuck but a frog.<br />
<br />
Any advice from anyone who has done this is appreciated...i need to put this one to sleep heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow, just wanna say thats a rip for the clay, iv'e seen canni 2 spell for 100pp in sale on AB, didn't have cash to buy it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what other people have said about the quest you should kill ALL the mobs you find because Yun Shaman is KoS to everything so they don't last long, also try see invis(you never know)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>n0id</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">figured i got ripped but 450p to finish my canni line of spells isnt to bad ( got 3 and 4 in bank, working on AA to get 5)<br />
<br />
And i didnt know about the kos thing...will get a few ppl with me to kill em all next time.  That should help.<br />
<br />
All i need now is an area....does he spawn in the area with the frogs just before the lake where the river meets it?  Thats where all the rest of the froggies tend to be, so i figure that he spawns there? heh.<br />
<br />
Also is he on a timed spawn, like once every 3 hours, and lasts 10 min? heh :(<br />
<br />
Anymore help is appreciated...gunna try for him again tonight :\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No idea sorry but it's not a named char, theres a couple Yun Shamans i think so not a very long spawn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*warning newb question* can you still trade for canni2 or is it nodrop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">tradable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Canni 2 spell isn t no drop<br />
Made the quest twice and gave one to a guildmate<br />
Have a tracker near the Swamp of no hope zone in TT, you should find a lot of Yun shaman there<br />
But just remember that druid's track isn t as good as ranger's :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From Swamp of no hope zone..  follow the river to the lake.  From there.. circle the lake to the right.. go about quarter way around the lake.. then head away from the lake at a 90degree angle.   A guide I read once says yun shamans wander in that area.  For sure bring a tracker to spot them.   And yes, when they do pop, they are kos to all, so any mobs near it try to kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I haven't started this yet, and at first I was going to forgo it, but I've been reading it's worth the time.  So, I have a few questions on it as well.<br />
<br />
A) Is the Shaman Powder from TT tradable?<br />
<br />
B) Is there a way to tell it apart from the powder that drops in FV? (In case I find someone selling it, I don't want to buy the wrong one.)<br />
<br />
C) Are the bone chips from KC tradable?<br />
<br />
D) What's the official name of the spell, if I should see it in the Bazaar?<br />
<br />
Think that's it.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zone in from EJ. Follow left wall like your going to Sebilis. When you reach the begining of the Seb ruins where you go under the arch's, stop there and look for your frog. Have killed many there over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Knock off a few other mobs, if a Yun is not up, and see what happens.  I run into them mostly by the graveyard and near the wall of Sebilis.<br />
<br />
Tunzell, all the items for the quest are tradeable EXCEPT the bone chips from KC.  The powder is called Powder of Yun if I remember right, the spell is Cannibalize II, and I have only seen it once since the bazaar went live for 5K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Naagruz.  I figured it'd be more advantageous for me to do the quest myself, but wanted to make sure.  Taht and I wondered what I could hunt with an alt and then give to my shm afterword.<br />
<br />
I swear you guys are FAR more helpful then any other board (save for MAYBE monks) I've been on.  Kudos to the Shaman. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tried this on Drinal yesterday, and with a level 55 druid tracker at river for a while, then at ruins for a while, wasted 5 hours looking for yun shaman. What a waste of time. No luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I found that the best place was at the outside wall of Sebilis in the right corner area. I found two there when i was doing my Cann II quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've got a feeling that the Yun Shammy part of this quest has been fractured for a while now. I've been in TT for the last month and never seen one ( I got a druid friend) - but finally today, my dru friend was there on the way to Seb and he saw 10 of them all up at once.<br />
<br />
I dunno if they changed anything to do with this in the last patch....it seems that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The spell is actually called &quot;McMerin's Feast&quot;. When you scribe it it becomes cannibalise II.<br />
<br />
The only NODROP component for the quest is the bone chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are 2 types of the shaman powder.  The ones over by the swamp zone can drop a no drop black shaman powder (but usually drop the white one for enc quest).  Yun shaman over by the sebilis wall drop a no drop version of the item.  Both are suitable for this quest. <br />
<br />
The best spot, as mentioned, is by the sebilis wall / ruins entrance area.  I spent a few hours looking around near swamp and they always dropped white ones.  The first one I killed by sebilis (took 10 minutes) dropped a black one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">remember if ya gonna buy get the black one, not white.</div></div><hr />
