City of Mist is too low. Mobs are blue to my 46 rogue. The two of you could have a good time in Old Sebilis, Chardok, Howling Stones amoungst the Kunark dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you want an outdoor zone you can play around in Maidens Eye. <br />
<br />
Shaman and Necro work very well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do CoM solo myself lol. If you hunt the bowling alleys/gazebos the majority of it is DB. Exp modifier in CoM so sweet. But i get bored easy so i go to Dulak to pick up cash from time to time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have often duo'd with people in my guild when there weren't many of us on.  Ranger/Shaman works well, epecially fear kitting (kills even faster) and Chanter/Shaman works well also.  My favorite combo by far is the Necro/Shaman.  They complement each other well since both turn HP into mana and can in some form or another give each other hp/mana they almost share one large hp/mana pool.  Whether fear kitting with the 2 pets, or necro pet tanking or shaman tanking it can all work well.  As for places to hunt together...  I'd try Nadox.  The steps of the shrine near the Torg zone would be good although easy.  I was able to solo the mobs on the steps to the shrine at 56 pretty easily so it might almost be too easy for you.  But then you might also be able to pull some mobs from inside the shrine (I tried once and even tho I got a single, it wasn't the mob I'd inteded).  Another option is the lava bridge.  The mobs around here are a bit tougher than the ones on the shrine steps so it might be a better duo fit.<br />
<br />
You could also try one of the harder boats in Dulak (tho don't try the hardest one) or go to Seb or Chardok as was posted before.  Maiden's Eye is doable (i used to solo the goranga's at that level) but I have always felt that Luclin mobs sometimes have too many HP for the XP reward out of it.  Dulak, Nadox, Seb, and Chardok would probably all bring more xp over time than ME.  Of course I've never been that far in so maybe I just don't know a good spot in ME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For my try and opinion Shaman/Necro and Shaman/mage are the Best comes for Duo.<br />
<br />
At your lvl you could try the grey if your tired of doing Dulak. I didnt tryed it myself but my necro friend liked it with  one fo our shaman friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman / Necro Combo ... Hummm sounds like you two would do quite nicly in PoN.  There is a large open area free of roamers that is just big enough to allow a snared/feared mob to run the full distance fear with take it and not come near any of its friends.  With 2 Pets and 2 Dot casting casters you should be able to bring the 4 static birds near there and any the roamer you could find down in one pass.  I've done quite well there with my necro friends.</div></div><hr />
