<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today we went to COM for our shammies and hopefully some jade reavers also.  We found the reavers camped (at least they claimed to be), with some tool not allowing us to go past his camp, even tho 5 reavers were up.  We, being the honorable people we are, did not force the issue and left.<br />
<br />
I asked for a help with the human skeleton, and was joined by recruits Finglefin and Meiyo.  I was very impressed with both of them, both for their skill in this quest and for volunteering first (and for a short while, the only people there with me).  Later I was joined by Cubugh, and then Willowwing and Tempin.  We made a little AE party out of it since we weren't having a lot of luck with the spawn, and were getting several phs.  We eventually got him.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank Fingelfin, Meiyo (recruits), Cubugh, Willowwing, and Tempin for their aid today in helping me to finally finish this quest.  Also, renewed thanks to Nindalf, Sinfutura and Daelen for previous attempts and explorations for this quest mob (I do see to have terrible luck, going through MANY phs before finally getting him to pop).  Not to mention Koranna and Rowandil for rezzing me when I attempted to clear the ph's solo before asking for chanter aid, and got killed, losing level 60.<br />
<br />
On another note, it was very fortunate that we stayed in the zone, as not 30 minutes after the KoE raid force left, the (imho complete moron) who refused to allow us to pass, left the zone.  Hence, the zone was free, our raid force was called back, and we kicked around some reavers and got an epic completed.  Well done and congratulations to all!</div></div><hr />
