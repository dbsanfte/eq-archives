<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 61 shaman and still using the spine chill spear.  Yes, I know this is sad but I've been so close to my epic since about 52 I haven't bothered to upgrade.  I keep telling myself I'll have my epic any week now and it just doesn't happen.  I've been to fear 7-8 times and no golems have ever been up.  I'm sure it is just bad luck but its time to start looking for upgrades till I get my spear.<br />
<br />
I've been checking the bazaar for the last month or so and have never seen anything that would be a big upgrade.  Does anyone have any suggestions on some no drop weapons?  I'm not very concerned about damage/delay but I just don't like the idea of a shaman without a weapon so I don't want a book or something.  I'd like something with wisdom, stamina, hps, mana etc.  All four would be great obviously but hell I'm 61 and have a spine chill spear, I'll take most anything.  I need suggestions that can be done with 2-3 groups, mostly around level 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd agree the REIF is probably one of the best non-epic piercers that you are likely to find in the bazaar for purchase.<br />
<br />
It also isn't that hard to camp yourself with some friends.<br />
<br />
There are some other awesome piercers out there, but none that readily come to mind as being attainable with 2-3 groups.  But my experience is limited and I stopped weapon shopping once I obtained the Spear of Fate.<br />
<br />
You might want to look at some 1hb weapons.  There are some pretty nice ones out there that you can get with your 3 group force or even buy in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
I picked up a Pebblecrusher (10dmg/20dly procs stun, some bonus stats) from either Radir or Tawro.  Your little raid force should be able to take them out easily, and your friends will want to help in order to roll on those nice stat bracers.<br />
<br />
I'm still working up my 1hb skills.  Hopefully you aren't in the same boat as me (200 piercing, embarassed to mention the others) and can look at 1hb as a viable option for you.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />

I'll see if I can get the stats off it, last time I saw it we gave it to a new shammie who then deguilded not long later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your suggestions.  I've known about the REIF for quite a while but like I said I'm not really looking at damage/delay.  Damage/delay aside I would only be gaining about 30 mana upgrading to the REIF and that isn't worth spending the time to camp it or the 5-6k to buy it.  It has a great ratio and proc is nice as well but I just don't melee much.  I'll definitely look into the diseased war mace and the spear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Thlayli, I'll see if I can go kill Junkbeast soon.  I went to UP tonite with 8 people to kill Tawro and that went well.  We killed Swarm Caller on the way in.  After killing Tawro the Swarm Lord was on track.  We rebuffed, got ready to go after him and he disappeared from track.  Does he despawn or wander around and maybe someone grabbed him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">go on eqtraders.com in the pottery section and get the recipe for a white ceramic gavel<br />
<br />
Get the pieces from PoJ and have a guildie make you one.  Not only are the stats pretty nice, but it comes with affliction efficiency 4, which is a huge upgrade for anyone who doesn't have any affliction efficiency yet.  I don't have time to research now, to post all the info, but that should get you started</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">killing the swarmcaller if i am not mistaken spawns the swarmlord and he does only stay up for a limitted amount of time.  As I recall (its been a while since i've played with tawro) you kill swarmcaller and he spawns swarmlord in the same spot caller spawns , along with several other mobs, making it an unfortuante surprise for people that dont know.  Swarmlord drops several weapons all seem to have poison damage attached to them.  Anyway if you are after swarlord specifically you might want to do him before moving onto tawro / spirit of tawro.<br />
And as far as weapons, perhaps get that warmaul thing that drops in UP dont feel like looking it up but its like 70/90 or there abouts with 100 hp, 2hb tho but pretty choice for swinging inbetween JBB blasts.<br />

You can get it by doing the caller quests, which are pretty fun to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Killing the swarmcaller then calls up &quot;swarms&quot; of mobs. There is a server message of &quot;The ground begins to rumble under your feet&quot; - something like that anyway. :)<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you killed him, then just carried on going and he spawned behind you. The spawn isn't instant, it can take a couple of minutes. :( <br />
<br />
What happens is waves of mobs will spawn, like the Caller Quests - its actually pretty rare for the swarmlord to be on the first wave if I remember right. I'm pretty sure the Swarmlord depops in &lt;30 minutes if not killed.<br />
<br />
You just need to keep killing the waves - also I believe Swarmlord may be &quot;Slow Immune&quot;<br />

With 3 groups level 60-ish you shouldn't have much trouble doing the golems in Fear. Why bother going for something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Because I've been to fear almost 10 times and they have never been up.  I am in a family type of guild and though we are quite capable when we get everyone together it just doesn't happen a lot because most aren't hard core players.  We have 1-2 raids a week and understandably no one wants to do fear 1-2 times a week.  Lately we have been going 2-3 times a month but still have had no luck.  So I'm really looking for something 2-3 groups can do and more than likely will be up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">regarding the golems in fear - jsut make a habit to do a /who all cleric 60 and check for guilds in fear.  Once you know who's there check for their shaman and ask if the golems are up, and if they are killing them. Usually your fellow shaman will even give you the time they killed them if they did, and they are on a 72 h spawn time.  Get your guild ready to do fear 3 days later, and voila, one tear.<br />
Rak is by now down to a single group kill, so it shouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />
