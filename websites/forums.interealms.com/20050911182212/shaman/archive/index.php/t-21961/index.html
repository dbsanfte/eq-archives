<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>frolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I've finally managed to get my GF hooked on EQ.  She picked out a Pally as her first class to play and seems to be really enjoying herself.  I had quit for about a year, so my memory on the good spots is rusty, especially at the lower levels. (when I had a lvl 10 character, Crushbone was THE place to be) My question is, are there any really good spots that stand out for a Shammy/Pally (Barb/High Elf respectivly) duo?  Right now we are both around lvl 11 and hunting  on the Shadeweavers side of Palaual, mainly cause there aren't many folks that use that side, it's good xp, and she can learn the basics of EQ and how Dungeons work all at the same time. :)  Soooo...once we get out of the hell that is Paladual...what are some places to try out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your collective input<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice is simple. Don't stay in one spot for too long just because it's great exp. I know that goes against the grain, but I honestly suggest going around and exploring places you haven't been to. Check out old world spots like Befallen, Najena, Blackburrow, Crushbone, Unrest...all those places are very cool, and have themes to them that a lot of folks never get to see because of places like &quot;PC&quot;.<br />
<br />
So it'll take a little longer to get from level N to N+1....you will be far richer for moving around and living up to the name &quot;adventurer&quot;. Don't wait to top out at PC...go now!</div></div><hr />

Thanks Kaloog, I'll make sure to check out those zones.  When I was a newbie I didn't wander around to much so I know I missed out a bit and I know my girlfriend will probably grow tired of the same scenery faster than I will (since I'm a bit more accustomed to &quot;xp grinding&quot;.  So new places is definatly what I'm looking for. :)</div></div><hr />

I echo the sentiments of those who suggest moving around and exploring. Check out some of the places that people list as &quot;forgotten zones&quot; in the forums here in EQ Shaman. You might also consider having your girlfriend read the article &quot;The Considered Paladin&quot; (http://board.wizzerd.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=165&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0) written by Fingen Mithlondin and which is currently posted on the Vainglory of Stromm Guild website (http://board.wizzerd.net/index.php). Some of it may be a little beyond her at her current level of experience in EQ overall, but it may help if you read it with her as well because it can help you understand the mindset of a Paladin who works with Shaman  regularly. Fingen is the Paladin I grouped with for my formative seasons in EQ (aka, since last September) and whom I have grouped with every week since even at my current level.<br />
<br />
Good luck to the both of you.<br />

Thanks a bundle! That was a great Pally write up, I'm definatly printing that out for my girlfriend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I detest Paludal.  Paladins rule undead places like Kurn's Tower until the mid 20s and then the Estate of Unrest into the mid 30s, both of which have good experience modifiers and lots of action.  The Paladin/Shaman duo should be fast and furious fun.</div></div><hr />

We went to Unrest last night and had a great time and it seemed that the xp was way better than what we had been getting in PC, maybe it was because we were having a better time.</div></div><hr />

Grats, my wife made a cleric and hen a monk and then a ranger and now cleric is lvl 65 but thats how I got her hooked I made sure she was leveled as quickly as possible where she had good skills.  But grats on the GF liking a game makes it much easier to enjoy playing it.<br />

I think you've hit the nail on the head. When you're having fun, you don't notice the time and experience flying by. Thus, at the end of a session playing, it is doubly sweet. :)<br />
<br />
As for hunting suggestions: play up to the strengths of the group. Paladins have a sweet spot for undead, so try to accomodate that. The shaman can layer on nicely so it provides less restriction to where you hunt. And you can get extra points with your girlfriend for choosing places that make her feel especially useful too! :)</div></div><hr />
