WineX 2.2 - WineX 2.2 is primarily a maintenance release that incorporates many of the sound and multimedia improvements that Transgaming has made in recent weeks.<br />
<br />
WineX 2.2 also includes preliminary support for Sony Online Entertainment's incredibly popular massive multiplayer on-line game, EverQuest. The complete list of changes is as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many improvements have been made to the sound system in WineX. Several new combinations of hardware and device drivers should now work better than previously.<br />
<br />
Hardware sound buffering is supported when explicitly activated. It can be configured in the ~/.transgaming/config file, along with support for Full Duplex mode. See the WineX Beginners Guide v. 2.2 for more information.<br />
<br />
DirectShow support has been significantly improved, both in performance, as well as with support for additional media types. DirectShow performance is best when hardware sound buffering is enabled.<br />
<br />
Several improvements have been made to DirectInput, including support for Unicode APIs and multi-button mice.<br />
<br />
A number of fixes have been made to Direct3D 8, including support switching rendering between threads, as well as various Transformation and Lighting fixes.<br />
<br />
Preliminary support for EverQuest . The Game is now fully playable using the default 'new' EverQuest user interface mode, however the auto-updater may not always work properly. The standard UI mode is not fully functional, and performance improvements will be made in future releases. For more information, see the WineX 2.2 Release Notes.<br />
<br />
Fixes for Mandrake 9.0 and RedHat 8.0 CD device auto-detection. Note that Mandrake 9.0 appears to have a bug with SuperMount which can cause problems reading files from a CD-ROM in some circumstances. To work around the problem, disable the SuperMount feature in the OS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the day i got starcraft to run under wine's early stages, i figured EQ would one day work w/ a lot of work on their part.  glad to see that the day might have just been reached and look forward to giving it a shot when i have time.<br />
<br />
thanks for the post as i don't follow the wine project really at all anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very cool. I remember when Wine did soletaire and clock, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
I thought Wine was dead a long time ago, it's cool to hear it's alive and kicking.<br />
<br />
Doubt I'll switch off of XP, but it's cool to know.</div></div><hr />
