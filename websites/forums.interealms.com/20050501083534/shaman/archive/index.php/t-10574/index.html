<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">February 4, 2003 3:00 am <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Note: Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to work properly. In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file. You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game. <br />
<br />
ALSO NOTE: We have changed a lot of UI Files. Here's the list: <br />
<br />
** UI File Changes ** <br />
<br />
EQUI.xml <br />
EQUI_Animations.xml <br />
EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml <br />
EQUI_FacePick.xml <br />
EQUI_NoteWindow.xml <br />
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br />
window_pieces04.tga <br />
EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br />
EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br />
EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br />
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface and Gameplay ** <br />
<br />
- The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking. <br />
- Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI. <br />
- /viewport fixed. <br />
- Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded using /loadskin. It now reloads the names too. <br />
- Fixed a bug that could cause a client crash if too many full containers were open and the ALT key was pressed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Lowered the mana cost of Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III, and Yaulp IV to increase the value of these spells <br />
- Theft of Thought works properly now, it was draining all of the caster's mana, no matter who the target was. <br />
- Damage over Time type Area of Effect spells will no longer do damage when player character resists the spell. <br />
- All pet spells will now get focused from any pet focusing spell/item. This means, for example, that summoning haste will work on Beastlord and Necromancer pets. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying to charm when a pet already exists. <br />
- Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead of as regeneration. <br />
- Removed the erroneous message &quot;Returning to your own perspective&quot; that occurred when a character was changed into something using an illusion. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed. <br />
- Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana. <br />
- Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest (shadeling silk instead of shade silk). <br />
- Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book. <br />
- Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or want. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon. <br />
- Removed the &quot;secondary&quot; tag from the Flametongue, as this item is for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their secondary slot. <br />
- The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory icon. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. <br />
- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. <br />
- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; to use a &quot;feather&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;. <br />
- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions. <br />
- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past. <br />
- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. <br />
- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. <br />
- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <br />
- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group songs. <br />
<br />
<br />
** PvP ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target player character from being affected until they zoned. <br />
- Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal means. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed some text and grammar errors in Skyshrine. <br />
- Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his enemies. <br />
- Repaired some &quot;safe spots&quot; in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and Grieg's End. <br />
- Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to disappear. <br />
- The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem. <br />
- The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted (as long as he had it to begin with). <br />
- The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four groups. Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have been removed. <br />
- Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges. Also, the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to prevent drafts. <br />
- Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling. <br />
- Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they should no longer be killing it in retaliation. <br />
- Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air. <br />
- Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order to deal with his enemies... <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Changed &quot;wode&quot; to &quot;woad&quot; in the face picker. <br />
- Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability (affect to effect). <br />
- PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair. Fixed a few other bugs with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes. <br />
- Vah Shir will now see &quot;punches&quot; when punching instead of &quot;hits&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they upped it with PoP, The cap was only 180 because lvl cap was 60.</div></div><hr />

Not old, ANCIENT. Like 3 years and more.<br />
<br />
trolls Essence is a 3hp regen + slight str buff. <br />
soul of the incorporeal is see invis<br />
<br />
Both insta click like all old old alchemy.<br />
<br />
Wonder if they fixed the price on reucoat's herb to make that uba insta click disease cure cost less than 120+pp. <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, wonder if they fixed the prices on all the damn herbs. Nah, they couldn't be that smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">HEY COOL! A GM alchemist trophy we won't be able to make until they figure out we can't get to 250 skill and fix it!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ha ha ha ha. <br />

Good guess Wulf, but not quite, it was a white T-shirt, but it says &quot;I'm with Stupid&quot; and has an arrow that points up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One thing that hasn't changed about alchemy is prices.  Checked Shar Vahl and Shadow Haven, prices on reagents for gate potions, Luclin potions, and some of the &quot;ancient&quot; alchemy potions are still ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what the Shadeweaver's gate potion ingredients are.  Alchemist Hikal in Shar Vahl sells sandalwood for 115pp, which is use in other gate potions.  Will report back if I find out more.</div></div><hr />

lol either way I guess it will give me something to do with my cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just a note, the potion fixes that went in today are all bug fixes, except the Shar Vahl potion that really should have been in with Luclin anyway.  This is basic housekeeping, cleaning up the stuff that should have been done long ago, rather than changes intended to make alchemy more viable.  A while ago I'd given a list of bugs in alchemy and inconsistencies between alchemy and the other tradeskills to Niami at EQ Traders to be sent to the developers for fixing.  Every one of the things addressed today was on that list.  The only thing I'm thinking of offhand that wasn't fixed today is a readily available skill mod item, like a geerlok.  I'd be surprised if that doesn't come soon, as well.  They were given that list with a request to clean up the mess a little, and they've done it for us.  I'm taking it as a sign of larger improvements to come.<br />
<br />
Well, except the trophy, that freakin rocks all its own :D</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but I have been playing way to long for me believe something resonable like that.<br />
<br />
Not when they have had fools employed that said something like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;lets not look at this as those that came later as unlucky but rather as those that came early as lucky&quot;<br />

Considering that every other GM trophy has +50 cha, this would be a major slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm hoping our trophy is not like any other. Ours is a unique skill, it deserves a unique trophy. I've already made my suggestion on the EQTraders forum (a couple months ago), hopefully Yakatizima agreed with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A unique tradeskill trophy would rock.  Something to actually make working on alchemy sorta kinda almost worthwhile!  :)   Oh well, at least they fixed some stuff.  I was surprised by the patch message; I figured all alchemy was permanently broken and VI just didn't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm not inventing the wheel here - but TS trophies are + 10 to INT / WIS / STR and + 50 to Charisma. You can get two, albeit they are named differently.  In addition, showing one of them to the Gnome in the Bazaar results in a 10 slot 100% WR bag. (Or something very close).<br />
<br />
As one who has invested TONS of time in TS's I see no reason why a 200 Alchemist is not equivalent to a 250 in another skill.</div></div><hr />

Any rube can spend about 2kpp at level 1 to get to pottery 250, with another 2k for the trophy.<br />
<br />
But we gotta spend around 200k to get to 200 Alchemy at level 65, then who knows how much more to get a +% alchemy mod with stats that we don't really chare about? No AC, kinda dinky wisdom considering tou have to be 65 to attempt it... No HP / Resists, just a modifier to alchemy... But the only potions we really use that will need a boost past 200 will be the stupid trophy?<br />
