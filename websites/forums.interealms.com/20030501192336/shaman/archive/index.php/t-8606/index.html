<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not new - just revamped:<br />
<br />
Here is a post i made to my guild:<br />
<br />
&quot;Great news on test:<br />
<br />
Shaman potions had their negative effects removed. This means that we now can make potions that might actually be useful at raids and even in groups.<br />
<br />
Listing a few combos:<br />
<br />
1) 25 sta, 25 CR<br />
2) 25 str, 25 PR<br />
3) 25 cha, 25 DR<br />
4) 25 dex, 25 MR<br />
5) 25 agi, 25 FR<br />
6) 25 sta, 15 agi<br />
7) 25 dex, 15 sta<br />
<br />
Exept for the 25 to all resists, 25 sta will give our MTs approx 150 - 163 more max hp if they arent already maxed (maybe a reason to increase max stats to 305? )<br />
<br />
All potions lasts for 30 mins, approx cost per combine is 18pp.<br />
<br />
Many more (with str, cha agi etc) but i only listed the ones i found most useful.<br />
<br />
Note: Shaman potions are stackable with everything (or should be) but not with eachother, so you cant stack potion nr 1 and potion nr 6 (both have sta), but you CAN stack potion nr 1 and potion nr 2 (no component the same).<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that this hasnt gone live yet, but it was just changed on test - among with lots of other spells - so expect a patch soon. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At one time I tried to use a sta potion but it didn't stack.<br />
<br />
Not tested it since, are you sure they stack with stat buffs (like Talisman of the Brute)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never tried the sta potion - but I have tried the dex potion and know that it stacks.<br />
<br />
(before when i did alchemy i used the 25dex potions to get extra dex for skillups - even though some say it do not help - i felt that it did - so i tried to keep it as high as possible.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">do the Mana Regen potions stack with enchanter clarity line of spells?<br />
<br />
 zern</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mana regen potions do, indeed, stack.  Unfortunately the failures make this potion extremely cost prohibitive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only things Aura of Eternity does not stack with is Lunar Whisper and Koadic's Heightened Focus both effects from items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This looks like fun, I'm gonna have to try these. Anyone have some confirmed stacking info?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you know that? Did you get it from lucy or did you make the potion? If so - share the recipie please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Druids Circle of Seasons overwrites Potions of Heat (cold resist) but not Potion of Cold (fire resist).  <br />
Both potions DO stack with normal FR and CR buffs though.<br />
<br />
I verified this last night.</div></div><hr />
