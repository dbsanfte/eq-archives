<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a thread earlier about the possible increase in agro generated by the shaman slow spell line; I just camped the Verix room today and even the aqua skeletons have increased their agro to slow....  Its easy to test it, cast slow and see if 2 tanks can pull it back off of you before its nearly dead.<br />
 <br />
Now for the new stuff...  I burned alt exp points in evoc crits so I could see extra JBB nukes, those appear to no longer happen.  In addtion I have a channeling skill of 10% via alt exp points and another 15% from items..  prior to the last patch I rarely if ever got the your spell has been interrupted message, even with 4 or 5 mobs hitting on me.  It now appears to be back to what it was prior to my getting 25% channeling skill.<br />
<br />
  So to recap:<br />
(1) Slow agro has increased<br />
(2) Evocation crits no longer working off right click items<br />
(3) Channeling skill seem to no longer effect spellcasting (that is the extra % channeling items and skill)<br />
  <br />
  Anyone else notice 2 and 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I mentioned in a thread on our old Crucible, I think they dickered around with channeling prior to SoL.  I can only imagine that they did that in order to make the channeling AA skill more attractive and viable.  I used to have very few problems getting spells off while being pounded on (well, except epic dot, that always seemed to get interrupted) and now I am interrupted if a mob so much as sneezes on me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Comments on that...<br />
<br />
1.  Slow seems to have more agro now with the added counters.  From all the fighting I have done since patch I have different getting slapped around more from each landing of Turgurs.  Heh wait till you get 1 resist then land 2nd...ouch.  Still it is managable so I would not say game ending for any of us.  Just means like the tanks build agro a bit more then slow.  Slight change for those that cast immediately.<br />
<br />
2.  My understanding was crits were removed on right clicking items.  So that essential neuters JBB.   Also neuters rend robes and related gear for other casters.    <br />
<br />
3.  No idea on channeling changes though.</div></div><hr />

- Was not announced, so it's either awesome coding prowess by the monkey coding crew at VI or stealth nerf. Nothing to be suprised off. We are going to pay 3 bucks more per month for more crap like this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In all honesty, I expected item crits to be nerfed - it was just a matter of time.  Makes sense, in a way, too...  The item is channelling the magic, not you; so why should your increased prowess at crits effect the item?  It shouldn't.  I don't think level matters on the JBB either, probably for the same reason.<br />
<br />
As for the increased aggro on slows, a thought - how much aggro does &quot;adding poison counters&quot; do?  Seems like poisons are a pretty high taunt spell, so if they added poison counters to slows, two results - it can be cured (poison), and it also taunts like poison, on top of normal slow aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was stealth because there wasn't a line in a patch message that said: &quot;Gallenite's Bracelets no longer affect right-click DD effects on items.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also a stealth nerf that non Right click items now crit.<br />
<br />
Yes aggro has been increased.  When I cast slow on a mob in ToV I now preceed it with a shout &quot;Dead Shaman Walking&quot;.  More often then not that proves to be  true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tell the epic rangers to slow in ToV now...just not worth all the deaths. I can't get around to slowing untill mobs are half dead or I will pull agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this statement to a point.  However, if the item is channeling the magic, should it not be interrupted if I am hit by a mob?  Them mob is not hitting the JBB.<br />
<br />
<br />
just my 2pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is starting to bug me almost as much as the slow agro issue is the change in channeling.   When you burn alt exp points to max it and then get a Grieg's item drop that adds +10% channeling you should notice a difference.   I don't see how its overpowering, the shaman has a resistant mob beating him yet manages to cast 4 slows before one takes .... to me this is what I put the points into channeling for!<br />
<br />
    I did notice a difference up until the last patch now I'm back to the original interrupts if not worse.  How is this nerf making the channeling skill a useful one?  Not only did I waste guild points to get the item but I wasted alt exp points.  LOL, I want a refund !<br />
<br />
   Whats sad about this is how many shaman have maxed alt exp in channeling and have items?   Its going to be a tough sell with Verant........<br />

- Maybe I am blind or something, I didn't see anything in the area of: &quot;Right click items no longer benefit from AA skill Casting Fury.&quot;. The side effect leads back to two sources: incompetence or stealth nerf.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, regarding slow agro.  I also noticed a bit of an increase myself.   I have refrained from commenting on this, as I have been fighting mostly in CT and we all know that agro is just well, screwed in there.<br />
<br />
So, my group went back to ToV to do HoT again, for the first time since the introduction of the changes to Slow spells.  I have a bit of data on this that I can share...not real scientific, but slightly better than my usual ravings.<br />
<br />
A little background.   <br />
 <br />
I depend on the warrior or the bard in my group to proc tash for me, we have no enchanter.  The warrior dual wields jsticks until tash procs, then switches to a Frostbringer and some 12/18 or 11/17 weapon combo.<br />
<br />
So, Warrior tags and starts positioning.  I jump in fast and lead with Malo.  Bard plays occlusion, with just epic, I chain cast Malosini, which usually doesn't stick until after tash.  When Malosini sticks, then I immediately turgurs.  The rest of the melee folks come in when the first CHeal is cast, which is generally right before/same time as slow.   So like 20-30 seconds into the fight... Note this stuff takes us 4-6 minutes to kill, generally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Session 1. (March 13/14 - pre patch)<br />
60 shaman, 60 monk, 60 bard, 59 rogue (2boxed by me), 58 cleric, 57 warrior.<br />
<br />
During Session 1, I landed slows as fast as 19, 22 and 23 seconds after I started casting Malo and gained no agro.<br />
<br />
One mob I had 3 resists in 60 seconds of the beginning of the fight and I did not gain agro.  <br />
<br />
On 3 mobs I had resists on Turgurs less than, or exactly 30 seconds from the start of the fight and took no agro.<br />
<br />
We fought 17 mobs total this session.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Session 2.   (March 23 - post patch)<br />
60 shaman, 60 bard, 60 monk, 60 ranger, 59 warrior (2 levels higher now), 58 cleric.<br />
<br />
Fastest slow was 22 seconds, which resulted in me gaining 3 rounds of agro. <br />
<br />
I gained 1 round of agro on a 26 second slow.<br />
<br />
No agro from 28 second slow...<br />
<br />
I gained 3 rounds of agro on a resist at 31 seconds.<br />
<br />
1 round of agro on a resist at 48 seconds.<br />
<br />
Fought 12 mobs this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, it is still anecdotal evidence... however, it is pretty clear to me that I was getting more agro on my last trip.   With our warrior being 2 levels higher I was anticipating having less problems.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell.<br />
<br />
Trip 1 - slows at 19-23 seconds = no agro<br />
Trip 2 - slows at 23, 26 seconds = 3, 1 rounds of agro<br />
<br />
Trip 1 - 1 resist at ~30 seconds = no agro<br />
Trip 2 - 1 resist at 31, 48 seconds = 3, 1 rounds of agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
But then, if we want to prove things.. I could also use these same logs to show that Turgurs is easier to land now, than pre-patch.   So take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Trip 1 = 12 Turgurs Resists, 17 mobs.<br />
Trip 2 = 2 Turgurs Resists, 12 mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proof of absolutely nothing... but something to think about it.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hey Henora,<br />
<br />
Since you have such a nice parser set up, would you mind looking at interrupts any week prior to SoL and compare them to the interrupts the week after the &quot;aggro nerf&quot; patch?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm crazy, but it feels like they messed around with channelling, I get interrupted like crazy.  I feel like my level 28 cleric, constantly looking for walls to put at my back.<br />
<br />
Specifically how often you were interrupted for:<br />
<br />
Chloro<br />
Torpor<br />
Slow<br />
Epic Dot<br />
<br />
I would be very interested (and would love to take this data with me to the Seattle fan faire) if there is a change in the percentage of successful channels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'll PM you Glori.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The interupts have definatly gone up since the patch. Pre patch it had been so long since the last time I was interupted it was always a suprise when it happened, I've been so used to being able to channel through 4 or even 5 mobs beeting on me I took it for granted the spell WOULD go through; since the patch interupts have become common. That was one of the main advantages to being an Ogre and I'm kinda disapointed to loose it at this point. I've been buried for the last three weeks down in the Thurgadin mines so the mobs haven't changed, just the ability to channel. /shrug, what can ya do? <br />
As a side note the mobs down there are kinda wierd, can't get poison or disease dot's to land on em for anything regardless of the debuff I hit 'em with, but before the patch I could get slow to land 99.99% of the time, and the cold based nukes to hit for full more often than not, now I usualy have to hit em with slow at least twice and the nukes seem to be resisted a lot more, I figurd they had tweaked just those mobs, but now I'm not so shure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well, I just PM'd this to Glori but I will post it here too.   Parsing Channelling seems really complicated to me.  Am I making this harder than it needs to be?   Here is the data I feel like you would need to make any meaningful comparisons.<br />
<br />
Ducking interrupts are not noted in the logs in any special way are they?  I often interrupt epic to do something else.   I almost never channel through summons, so we want to take those types of interrupts out right?<br />
<br />
Total Spells Cast where I was hit after casting<br />
Total Interrupts <br />
Total Times Interrupted After Summoning <br />
Total Channeling Recoveries <br />
<br />
Average dmg Hits on Interrupts <br />
Max dmg Hits on Interrupts <br />
Min dmg Hits on Interrupts <br />
<br />
Average # Hits on Interrupts <br />
Max # Hits on Interrupts <br />
Min # Hits on Interrupts <br />
<br />
Average dmg Hits on Channels <br />
Max dmg Hits on Channels <br />
Min dmg Hits on Channels <br />
<br />
Average # Hits on Channels <br />
Max # Hits on Channels <br />
Min # Hits on Channels <br />
<br />
THEN, you have to do that for the subsets. <br />
Pre-Patch, Post-Patch and then using just the spells you specified, both pre and post patch.<br />
<br />
In addition, I don't know that I would be able to provide that data.  It would probably best come from someone who was fighting the same mobs both pre and post patch. <br />
<br />
Immediately pre-patch I was fighting in Sebilis.  Post patch I have been fighting almost exclusively in Cazic Thule, with that one trip to HoT.<br />
<br />
This makes for a poor comparison as CT = 100x &gt; Sebilis.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?  Am I making it more difficult than need be?  I could simply parse for number of interrupts vs spells cast since before the patch and look at the percentage... but it would not address the issues I mentioned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Natysha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My problem with the nerf on the crits on items is that many of us put some points into crits because of this.  So in essance, we wasted points on something we won't use.  F Verant on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've noticed slow aggro being way out of proportion now to what it was before. Doing shadel bandits in fungus, if I slow them during the fight AT ANY TIME, I will have aggro for sure for the next 30 seconds or so, and cannot sit down at all, or it will come over and immediately start beating on me, regardless of distance.<br />
<br />
As for interrupts, I have no points in channeling AA, nor any channeling increasing items. I've *always* had problems with being interrupted. The concept of channeling through 4 mobs of any level (I've had decaying skeletons in paineel reliably interrupt me, even with 220 channeling) is a very strange one to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We did the ROF in Acrylia tonight along with a few other mobs.. one thing I was seeing a lot of was:  You spell was interrupted  <br />
This was after I had been sitting and just stood up to cast (on a flat floor and not levitating).   I didn't recover from a single one of these.  <br />
<br />
   Now whats interesting is that when I had a &quot;working&quot; +25% channeling skill I would see those every once in a while but I would actually recover from them..  I even recovered once from being Gfluxed high into the air by a mob.  As experience with more mobs occurs since the patch I can really feel the difference in missing the channeling skill.<br />
<br />
  I wonder if Verant when adjusting the mage focus item effects inadvertently messed up the channeling modifiers? (alt exp modifiers and items).  If this is intentional then I really think they owe us a refund in alt exp points.  It might be harder to argue the JBB crit issue but this is a core piece of our alt skills... the ability to slow a mob thru its hits.<br />
<br />
  I'm sure we can all adjust our tactics and such to get around these silent &quot;nerfs&quot; but it is very disheartening to work so hard for all those alt exp points to see them suddenly wasted.  The only useful things left in the shaman alt exp skill set is Mass Group Buff and Cann5,  heh and we share the MGB skill with others.. :mad:</div></div><hr />
