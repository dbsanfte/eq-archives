<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after much work and a few deaths, I was able to obtain the magical mystical level of 45.  This is when the bracer of death otherwise known as the JBB came to life.  Needless to say while duoing with my monk on the seafury cyclops it cut kill time down quite a bit.  I have waited long for this moment, but I have to say that it is worth it.  In the 2 hours I played after dinging 45, I was able to get a little over 2 yellows of XP and some pretty decent cash.  No point to this really, but to point out that the JBB rules.</div></div><hr />
