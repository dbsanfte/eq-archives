<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I for one don't like being thought of as complainers especially with our versatility.  I appreciate any upgrades and the thoughts people put forth on shaman changes.  <br />
<br />
I just wanted to question if people think the only way changes are made are through the complaint process.  It seems lately that with the recent complaints made here change has occured.  <br />
<br />
Maybe we don't complain enough, but if this is what it takes for some minor changes is it worth it?  <br />
<br />
The community seems to be divided on this matter.  Just wondering if it was just me, or it it is worth going to these extremes for some minor changes. If people need to complain this much for something to change it seems there is something wrong with the system.  <br />
<br />
I don't like the stipulations people associate with whining, but I do think that the validity of certain changes should be addressed.  <br />
<br />
Am I the only one out there on this boat???<br />

Hello and welcome to the year 2000.<br />
The problem is that most people don't know how to give constructive criticism. There are definite problems that need to be addressed but it too often comes off like a temper tantrum.</div></div><hr />
