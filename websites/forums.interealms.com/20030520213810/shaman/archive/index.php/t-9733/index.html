<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what resist gear works aganist Rak. I had a 170 MR and 170 CR 100+ everything else and his AoE took me down fast (or does his AoE pretty much disregard your resists?)  <br />
<br />
Also, he landed 2 dots on me. Guessing one was the AoE effect, but wasn't sure about the other, and died faster than I could even see what these spell icons said. Any idea what they were and what kind of resists you need to avoid them?<br />
<br />
Not the richest shaman, so don't laugh when you see my gear. Here's my magelo link. Any suggestions for gear improvements are much appreciated. <br />
