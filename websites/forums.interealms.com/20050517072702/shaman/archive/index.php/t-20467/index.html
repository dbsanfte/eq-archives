<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just reading in the Rez thread about shaman getting a rez and druids and so on and so forth when i realized something. some how we have gotten brain washed into thinking we are less of a healer/clerical class then a druid. <br />
<br />
Why is this ?<br />
<br />
Think about what a druid and a cleric and shaman is.<br />
<br />
Cleric : They are always in every game and story, the main healing class. It is their role in life, they knew they were going to do nothing but heal the day they made their toon and if they didnt, they were delusional.<br />
<br />
Druid : Woodland protectors, they always have healing abilties and are VERY strong in the way of nature. They are more known for their interaction with nature then they are for their priest healing abilties.<br />
<br />
Shaman : Shaman are the medicine man. they are the healers of the tribe, they are the spiritual leaders. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What really grabbed me what how one person said druids and shaman should get a rez. It wasnt that we should get one, but that he said &quot;I guess in a way it makes logical sense for druids to get say a 70% rez and shamans a 50% rez.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like a lil light in my head went on and suddenly all the healing upgrade requests and things that simply have been implemented and are trying to be implemented, took on a very surreal feel to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some how we really have been brain washed. I mean a 50% rez compared to a 70% for druid?  60% to 47% for healing ?<br />
<br />
What the **** is going on around here ? I think we need to all stop for just a second and think about that before you shoot down a request for a bigger quick heal or simply accepting any upgrade they give us cause they did nothing more then pay attention to our starving arses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought i felt i should share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cleric. Druid. Shaman.<br />
<br />
We can find sources in literature and history (and sometimes who knows which is which - especially when history is written by the victors?) to liken an EQ Cleric to an officiant of the widespread, centrally managed (mainstream) religion of the conquerors, whereas an EQ Druid or Shaman would be likened to an parcticioner of a locally managed, more independant spiritual tradition, which is demonized by the incoming secular 'authority'.<br />
<br />
There is some undercurrent in fantasy gaming, probably due to the upbringing of the game creators, to only grant 'real legitimacy' to the spiritual facilitators of the religion of the prevailing establishment (Tunare, Marr, etc.), and make the less 'refined', more 'primitive' practicioners have a glass ceiling, so to speak, as to how well they can perform common abilities.<br />
<br />
I'll leave you with a story which was told by a friend of a friend, and so you know that it must be true:<br />
<br />
The Physician and the Shaman met for dinner. As the conversation came around to what each one actually did, the Physician said &quot;When a boy is sick, and has a tumor in his head, I open up his head, and reach inside, and I remove the tumor, and I return that boy to health, and he goes on to live a full life. Can you do that?&quot; Looking impressed, the Shaman said, &quot;No, I cannot. But when a boy dies, and his Spirit goes to the other World, I journey to that place, and I retrieve his Spirit, and I bring it back, and I make it whole, so that the boy may resume his life. Can you do that?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Strong case Litgruv.  I can see clerics having rez, as they have been portraid in many a fantasy genre.  Even paladins, I can see having rez capability (I remember Arthur praying for Lancelot in Excalibur at the bridge, calling upon his divine benefactor, the Lady of the Lake).  Necromancers can even have rez, as they play with the boundaries between life and death.  <br />
<br />
I see a much stronger case for Shamans over Druids to even get rez.  Shamans deal with the spirit world (the place where the souls of the dead dwell).  Druids would have to stretch their philosophy a bit.  The cycle of life ends in death which in turn leads to rebirth?  Maybe.  But Shamans have a much stronger case.  Weather we are talking about the Druids of England, who practiced herbology and astronomy, or the Druids of fantasy, who are in tune with the flora and fauna of the natural world, there is no justification for druids to get rez, except they are a healer class. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, my point is if anyone gets a rez, give the druids and shaman equal one. This leaning towards the druids deserving more on all areas then a shaman is just plain absurd.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what shaman specific abilities would those be?  <br />
<br />
Slows...<br />
Heals...<br />
Buffs...<br />
debuffs...<br />
pet...<br />
DoTs..<br />

<br />
WAIT@!  I got it, canni..  We should focus on canni since it is really our only shaman specific ability.<br />

Heh, nice analogy.  I've often thought that shamans would be the next logical choice for receiving a rez spell.  After all, we are (as stated before) physical and spiritual healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We will be the laughing stock of all classes if we continue any more debate on rez.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lol, shamans asking for a Rez now... rotfl&quot; <br />
I can see that being said on all messageboards... <br />
<br />
The whole, &quot;give an inch and they take a mile&quot; argument. <br />
<br />
IMO, asking for a rez is just absurd...<br />
<br />
What exactly do you recommend we focus on..I'm curious.<br />
<br />
More DPS would be nice... (better nukes, faster DoT's, either way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Y'know, personally I feel that Shaman, as an entire class, should be overhauled. Expecially reading the stuff from WoW, they come much closer to the essence of &quot;shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
It would be a grossly huge, messy patch to do so, of course... Or they could simply add a &quot;/serverbuff newshaman&quot; command for only shaman to use, turn their characters into the &quot;new&quot; shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Monjay, I'm sure many class changes/upgrades that we take for granted now were once thought of as absurd.<br />

&quot;Mages having the ability to warp players right to where the raid is happening?  Yeah right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks are going to be able to attack three times per round?  Get real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll never let hybrids get critical hits like warriors do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet these things happened, and now seem perfectly acceptable.  Never say never in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree and all Rodahn, however, rez is just one of those things.<br />
<br />
One of those things i just dont see happening for shamans. And honestly, how exactly does a Rez ability help the shaman in any way? Most of the posters here have their own ideas on where the shaman is lacking (whether that be healing, dps, mana regen, etc.), I have yet to see someone say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Shamans would be balanced if we could rez our fallen comarades in battle, since we couldent keep them alive with our heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh the irony of them giving us a rez...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, a shamans primary role in a group is to debuff, via slowing etc. A druids primary role in a group is to heal. With slow and heal over time spells, shamans don't really need to be on par with druids in healing. Since shaman can lfg as a slower or healer, I think it would be more logical for them to have a lesser rez as balance. A druid and cleric lfg more specifically as a healer and not really under any other category. <br />
Just my thinking anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think we really should consider the likelihood that druids would simply not get groups if we could heal as well as them, all other things being equal. That was the real reason behind their relative increase in healing power in the first place.<br />
<br />
The issue as I see it should be giving Clerics some utility other than healing in order for Druid and then Shaman healing to be upgraded. <br />
Although secondary healer is not my preferred role, lets face it, the other skills we bring to a group in GoD have become increasingly insignificant.<br />
<br />
The current situation whereby clerics are the required healer for every group in GoD is simply wrong. No other class in the game dominates its main role more.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the nett result of all our combined efforts to deal with shaman issues has been a minor upgrade to a hot spell. I say this because we should have gotten the other upgrades anyway, as conceded by the devs, when they &quot;overlooked&quot; the normal % progression automatically given to the other healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You guys are all missing the point of the thread.  Its not about the rez, its about how we have been brainwashed into accepting and even expecting abilities that are less then our fellow priests. I hate to keep looking at druids and comparing, but they are our closest priest. <br />
<br />
Its not class envy, i have never in my life wanted to be a druid and i dont want 1 single thing to be taken from a druid. Its the reality of our sad state and a huge reason why we are in it. There is no reason at this stage of the game for our blast heal to be so vastly smaller then the druid. I dont know what its going to take to get SoE to look at this and really think about it, but they seriously need to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Whats funny is that druids are more versatile than just being a healer in a group. They get a better hp buff than us, and lets face it, all anyone wants out of buffs is one of 3 things, more hps, more attack and more mana/hp regen. Sure we get FA, but I'd rather have PoT9 than focus, and they get as good of a regen spell as us (even though we get regen first) a better sow spell (we get this first also), DS almost as good as a mages and can even wolf form people which narrows the gap on attack a small amount.<br />
Lets not forget that when things get nasty a druid can evac, or nuke an add down since they have alot more dps and better mana effeciency from their nukes than we do. To say all a druid does is heal is shortsighted, and throw in a  dc pet in certain zones its perfectly reasonable to have a druid as main healer, ds/snare duty, evac and buffs as well as providing the most dps in the group. This entire we should heal for x% of what a druid can heal is complete bs, as well as saying they won't get groups if we can heal better. <br />
Even thier dots are less agro and as much dps or close at a lower mana cost. And lets not forget, when was the last time ya saw a shaman quad kiting? Druids can solo old content mobs as well as we can due to thier better mana efficiency and faster damage so they certainly don't need our pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The Druids ability to heal better certainly compensates for the fact that Shamans can slow which reduces Mob damage out put (as well as being able to haste, which allows for quicker damage output).

I’m sure mana efficiency improves as you level up, but nonetheless why do you want to heal on top of having to buff, slow, DOT and haste? <br />
<br />
Even when I play my Druid I don’t like taking on the role as Main healer, there can be too much expectation placed on you to compensate for the lack of a cleric. My Druid is more equipped to be a damage dealer than a healer.</div></div><hr />

Considering that you are only 40 your kind of not understanding the point of view of a 60+ shaman on this subject. Its not that we want to be healers per se, but that druids have more than enough to offer to counter our haste and slows, so why should our heals be any less than your 65 druids?</div></div><hr />

There was a time when Shaman and Druid had the exact same heals. Since then, Shaman have fallen further and further (or is it farther and farther) behind Druidical healing ability, while there has been no compensatory upgrade in Shaman DPS. (Or any other Shaman ability with the exception of the recent healing upgrades. Thanks to the &quot;whiners.&quot; )<br />
<br />
Aggravating this situation has been slow mitigation which marginalizes a Shaman's main ability.   <br />
<br />
Litgruv is right on the money when he makes the statement that the institutional mindset around here is to automatically assume 3rd rate status behind Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As I see it the original game designers didn't have a clue were the shaman was going to stand in thew future of EQ. By pure chance, Shamans were well balanced in the beggining. Even then, Druids were more healing oriented class. It seemed to me that Shaman with the higher weapon cap, and the need to have Hitpoints to power the canni button have always been the &quot;Battle Priest&quot;.  That is one of the reasons I started a Shaman (This being my intro to EQ). Since then, with the battles over class balancing and expansions bringing mobs with more and more power, this is not even close to what it was. It seem that the whole aspect of melee for the shaman went out long ago.<br />
<br />
I would like to see this portion of the Shaman revisited. I would not expect to fight as well as a true melee, but there is much room for improvement in this area and was part of the original &quot;Vision&quot; for Shamans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How many times do we have to go over this till people get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just cause a shaman slows doesnt mean that he can heal better at 65. I ask you to ask yourself how many groups you have been in in PoP or higher that DID NOT have a slower. Why in the hell is our slow such a factor in our healing but not in any other healers? Its flawed logic on SoE's part.  Period.  <br />
<br />
There is ALWAYS a slower in the group and as such our healing ability should not be hit unless druids and clerics are equaly hit. They have the same benifiet of slow in every EXP group they heal in as we do. Its truly absurd when you really think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what, after reading that a second time, thats pretty much on the money i think.<br />
<br />
Lets sit back and think a sec. When exactly did this difference in healing come about?  When im think about it, it was when we all were looking at the druids going completely nuts on their forum about not having this that and the other thing and about not getting groups and bla bla.<br />
<br />
Right about that time the differenc in healing came about, so what other logical conclusion is there. To make druids more desirable, they nerfed us. Thats kinda ****ed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the key here. I have no problem being Number 3 on the healing list. I enjoy the fact that MOST XP groups can grab a Druid and I can do my other stuff while playing, I prefer NOT to be a primary healer, honestly. <br />
<br />
However, that being said, we havent been compensated. SOE said &quot;Lets make druids viable healers for groups&quot; and didnt take Shaman into consideration one bit. Slow mitigation and the new &quot;Kill everything in 5 seconds&quot; has hurt us. <br />
<br />
I dont think putting us on par with druids for healing is the solution. I would rather see our OTHER abilities upgraded. A bigger HP buff, a bigger haste, a bigger debuff with a HUGE resist modifier (honestly, I would LOVE to be able to drop a Cripple like spell on somehting that would mitigate its DPS similar to slow), a bigger Nuke, and/or a big, fast DOT. These are not unbalancing things. They just make us back into what we are, Shaman. Thats what I want to be, not a psuedo-cleric, like Druids have basically become.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been posting for over a year that shamans were being marginalized, long before GoD was implemented.  The Proposal  (http://69.93.210.2:8080/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19207)  was generated two months ago.  The mind set Litgurv is talking about applies to many more things than just healing.<br />
<br />
The mindset, plain and simple, is this: Shamans can slow and regenerate mana better than any other class, therefore they should be underpowered in everything else they do.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that was justifiable after Kunark, when The Mindset was born.  A shaman with slow + mana regen + mana free damage  was a dragon killer.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The mindset, plain and simple, is this: Shamans can slow and regenerate mana better than any other class, therefore they should be underpowered in everything else they do.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that was justifiable after Kunark, when The Mindset was born. A shaman with slow + mana regen + mana free damage was a dragon killer. Game design since then has closed the gap between shaman slowing and other classes, reduced shaman mana free damage to insignificancy, closed the gap in mana regeneration, and reduced the over all impact of slowing on most encounters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Sigh.<br />
<br />
Druid's got better heals than me... We used to be equal healers.<br />
First of all, lets cut the crap.  Shamans/Druids havent been &quot;equal&quot; healers since before Kunark.  Original game here.  That's so so out of date a comparison it is silly as **** to make.<br />
<br />
Look at the 50-60 heals here.<br />
55 Chloroblast<br />
60 Shaman = Torpor, Druid = Natures Touch<br />
<br />
ages and ages ago, the determination was made to give druids bigger direct heal, and shamans a super efficient Heal over Time.<br />
<br />
the ICHs, the POP spells, the GOD spells, just continued the trend.<br />
Now why does the trend exist?<br />
<br />
1) Better Mana Regen.   if shaman/druids were equal, shaman would be clearly superior healers by virtue of casting more.<br />
2) Slow.  Shaman bring another major aspect to the game that groups want and mitigate/prevent much much more healing. <br />
3) HOTs.  Heal over Times especially with AAs become very very powerful.  Quiessence has a better Mana to HP ratio than anything a druid has even the ICH.   Plus with AAs at 3 seconds, a shaman can keep a group healed vs AEs much better than a druid can.   <br />
<br />
Even in GoD trials, I don't see groups doing even Vexx/Tipt without a slower.<br />
<br />
Now that Said.<br />
It's pretty fair to look at the gap, and see if it should be maintained as large.  Shaman have lost a lot of power in thier &quot;slowing&quot; aspect.<br />
in a vareity of ways.  (1) Slow is no longer enough CC to easily off tank.<br />
(2) mitigation reduces difference in bst/chanters.   <br />
<br />
Chanters have always been #1 CC class, but the gap has just become huge.  <br />
<br />
What I do wonder, is why everyone is so fixated on healing side of the shaman, when its the Debuffing Side that is suffering.  Shaman need some better debuffs that close the gap with Chanters and put a gap with Bsts.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see such &quot;fixes&quot; like:<br />
100% Slow with a 1 Point Rune Component.<br />
Slows that ignore mitigation or reduce it by one level.  Mostly = no mitigation.  Partially = mostly.  so on.  You can make these slows more mana, longer/cast etc.  <br />
<br />
As for the rez and mythology.<br />
Shaman would be best choice given the spirit side for a Rez Spell as we are the masters of spirit.<br />
Druids would be good choice maybe for a reincarnation spell (rez + unclickable illusion) as whole life-death-rebirth cycle.</div></div><hr />

With short duration fights, and mobs that Sony wants to be immune or mitigate slow, I don't see any area they'll allow an improvement in debuffs.<br />

Although I see your point in this thread (and I generally agree) I just think you are about 2 months too late.  You should have started this flurry of posting back when everyone was up in arms about our healing (i.e. when GoD was first released) instead of now.  As it is, you look like a one-man-army spamming the front page with threads (5 atm, 4 about healing).<br />

Good luck.<br />

<br />
The only problem with that logic is that Shaman can still get groups as slowers.  Granted everyone would prefer a Chanter and vs trivial content perhaps a Bst.  But we can still Slow &amp; Heal.<br />
<br />
If you balanced Shm healing vs Slowed Mobs, whats to stop a good shaman from doing both the healing and slowing.  Instead of needing a 2 Class Combo (Dru--maybe--/Clr + Shm/Cht/Bst--maybe--) you could make it with just one class.  Not sure that wll happen honestly.<br />
<br />
Not unless Sony started developing &quot;Limited Memmed Spells&quot; IE spells that prevented you from meming specific spells.  Like give us healing say Druid level or BETTER really, at the cost of not being able to mem slow at the same time.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
As for Litgruvs comment about Healing is where the community &amp; Sony are focused, I'm not sure I agree about that.  Didn't the developers say<br />
that they would reexamine the slow immune/mitigation of God Mobs.<br />
As well as one of our new three spells being a debuff.  Makes me pretty confident that Debuffing is still considered and examined as part of the balance equation for shaman.<br />
<br />
My problem with Sony is that they totally missed the mark in balancing Shm debuffs in God compared to Bst/Cht.</div></div><hr />

We're becoming/have become the least desireable class among the slowers because that's the only purpose we serve, all other slow casting classes provide additional function.  <br />

I want to serve two roles Slower/Backup Healer.  Druid serves two roles (Backup Healer/DPS), Chanter serves two roles (CC/Slow), BST serves two roles(Slow/DPS).  Why are we pigeonholed into just one?  <br />

Slow isn't a function in a group that is needed to kill a mob. Healing and Damage is. Slow reduces the amount of healing that is needed, but if a healer can keep the tank up just fine without slow, there's no point in including a slower.<br />

I gotta agree with giac here, low hp mobs or a group with a ton of dps doesn't need a mob slowed, when i do ldon's and have good dps in the group I usually don't slow if it bounces, simply because by the time the mob is slowed its so close to dying it doesn't matter. <br />
Its also why chanters and beastlords are more desireable in alot of groups, their added dps makes up for their lesser slows.</div></div><hr />

1) 100% Slow<br />
I said 100% Slow with a 1 point rune.  Basically if you thnk about it, this would be a ghetto mez like spell since a single point of damage would free the mob to start beating on people.  It wouldn't be as good as mez because you couldnt slow the mezzed mob pre breaking slow.  Nor would it effect casting.  But this would work wonders for doing exactly what Shaman used to be able to do CC effectively.<br />
<br />
2) Groups without a Slower vs Druids/Clerics less groups.<br />
<br />
Sorry Giac, but outside LDON Easy, or totally trivial content.  Slow still is required for efficient XPing.  People don't grab just a cleric or just a druid and no slower and go xping in the elemental planes.   You can triviliaze slow, but healing itself becomes trivial.  Do Ldon Normal<br />
with War, Bst, Ranger, Rogue Rogue Rogue for example.<br />
<br />
3) Dbullneck is correct.<br />
In God Level as early as Vexx/tipt, even in ldon hard honestly.  Druid level healing is insufficient solo.<br />
<br />
4) Backup Healer<br />
<br />
Your right Shm in Ikky are not sufficient for backup healers.  But thats related to the slow immunity + insane dps of bosses.  We do make good back up healers in tipt/vexx and below.  again this goes with the insanity of the way slow immunity is developed.</div></div><hr />

Do I think Shaman should have a greater ability to heal yes.  Are the new heals / modifications adiquate, as stands currently no. However if the rest of the class was further balanced then probabily IMO.<br />
<br />
IE I am refering to issues regarding slows that need addressed as well as maybe, cast times, DPS issues, heck maybe even our pet (though personally I think pets prob fine......as long as they'd fix it so the darn thing dual weilded on it's own), buffs, and I'm sure a few other issues folks have posted about before that are quite relivent as well.<br />
<br />
As for this whole Rez idea, at this point in time it does not balance anything that is current wrong with the shaman class and is so far off track it's not even funny in regards to blance IMO.<br />
<br />
Heals are not the only issue on the table and folks should think about the broader picture a little more is all I say.  IMO we've been brainwashed in a number of different and devious ways =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Corlathist, why are you talking about efficient exping now?<br />
<br />
When you run low on mana, you med up. killing 8 instead of 10 mobs in 10 mins doesn't kill your group. Slow isn't required to keep your tank up and it's less and less effective the more the mobs mitigate it(obviously!).<br />
<br />
I'll repeat it. Slow is not a vital function. A Shaman slowing and healing will spend just as much mana(if not more) and heal less effective than a single Druid or Cleric without any slower in most environments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">&quot;&quot;The Druids ability to heal better certainly compensates for the fact that Shamans can slow which reduces Mob damage out put (as well as being able to haste, which allows for quicker damage output). As a 40 Shaman I can’t imagine wanting to be a healer I’m constantly struggling for mana. I’m sure mana efficiency improves as you level up, but nonetheless why do you want to heal on top of having to buff, slow, DOT and haste? <br />
<br />
Even when I play my Druid I don’t like taking on the role as Main healer, there can be too much expectation placed on you to compensate for the lack of a cleric. My Druid is more equipped to be a damage dealer than a healer.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
I sure am sick of hearing this argument about our Slows. I have yet to find a valid argument that because we can reduce the damage to a tank / reduce mana use by the cleric, to be a good reason to give us pitiful increases in the rest of our abilities. Or to give us fluff spells (talisman of the serpent?). Hell never seen a valid reason for the very poor drop rate of spells or dificulty in obtaining our 50-60 spells either. It comes down to in my opinion that we were very good at what we did and as other classes (druids) discovered that they would have to get groups to reach end game the whining and crying began, hence preferential treatment for that class in particular. As far as I know they got just about everything they ever asked for, within reason, and will in time probably get their rez spell, after all what more could they want?<br />

Gonna take exception to the words &quot;most environments&quot; here. There are MANY MANY MANY environments where I can use Quies instead of spamming Tnargs after a slow.

If they want the Shaman to be a &quot;jack of all&quot; utility type class, then we need a upgrade to buffs, debuffs, and fast DPS as well. Those are our functions in groups. <br />
<br />
How about a debuff that automatically mitigates 10-15% of a mobs DPS? A cripple type thing. 800 hitting mobs now hit for 700 max. 1K mobs hit 850 instead. The value of slow has been lowered and lowered with the new speedy environment, so lets replace it with a debuff that actually MATTERS.</div></div><hr />

That I would like to see. An unslowed mob has four times the damage output of a turgurs slowed mob. There is no way in hell that a druid can heal damage four times faster than us.

I posted a few numbers about a week or two ago comparing a Druid healer to a Shaman healer in a non-trivial, realistic environment. <br />
The mobs were not mitigating Slow, dishing out 600 dps and die in 30 seconds in my analysis. <br />
Both the Druid and the Shaman were the sole healers for the group. Both were using their fast heal(Shaman was using Tnarg's instead of DM for obvious reasons).<br />
The Druid's tank would be finishing the the fights with a net loss of around 450 HPs while the Shaman's tank was constantly missing 1500+ HPs after each fight.<br />
Both were chain casting their spells.<br />
Both were using PoP elemental quality focus items(20% detrimental haste for the Shaman and 25% heal focus(30% heal focus would favor the Druid even more) and 30% beneficial haste for both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giac you hit the nail right on the head.  Slow costs mana AND time.  That's time and mana taken away from healing or dealing damage.  If fights last a long time, the mana savings from slowing may be significant, but since PoP fights don't last that long mana savings from slowed mobs is miniscule.<br />

Oh the irony of them giving us a rez...<br />
<br />
<br />
That is oh so funny.<br />
<br />
I can see it happening despite the irony. It would be a nice '**** shut up now' and would be envied by other classes no matter how crappy it was. Definetly an easy way out. They had no idea how to balance us as a class or against other classes with this new expansion. We were getting by before, but there is no reason we should not heal on par or better than a druid (in GoD) with what they did to our debuffs lines (yes it would make us overpowered in old content - every expansion has done that to nearly every class). There was also no excuse for debalancing the priest classes who were nearly even in all but raid encounters. I hate to be a doomsayer but GoD has done nothing useful for EQ and broke several aspects. I can't even say the raids are fun (but maybe I'm playing the wrong class now). Discord indeed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I posted a few numbers about a week or two ago comparing a Druid healer to a Shaman healer in a non-trivial, realistic environment. <br />
The mobs were not mitigating Slow, dishing out 600 dps and die in 30 seconds in my analysis. <br />
Both the Druid and the Shaman were the sole healers for the group. Both were using their fast heal(Shaman was using Tnarg's instead of DM for obvious reasons).<br />
The Druid's tank would be finishing the the fights with a net loss of around 450 HPs while the Shaman's tank was constantly missing 1500+ HPs after each fight.<br />
Both were chain casting their spells.<br />
Both were using PoP elemental quality focus items(20% detrimental haste for the Shaman and 25% heal focus(30% heal focus would favor the Druid even more) and 30% beneficial haste for both.<br />
<br />
600 x 30 = 18000 (healing required from druid)<br />
600 x ~5 (time taken to slow typically) = 3000<br />
150 x 25 = 3750<br />
3750 + 3000 = 6750 (healing required from shaman)<br />
<br />
18000 &gt; 6750. It's not even vaguely comparable. Why on earth would the shaman be chain casting Tnargs after it was slowed? In that scenario a shaman wouldn't need to heal the tank at all during the fight.<br />
<br />
Fully slowed with 700-800 dmg hitters (yellow cons in PoV), my shaman can pretty much keep my warrior up with Q and the odd tnargs thrown in, and usually end the fight at 40-60% mana. A druid would most probably go oom before the end of the fight if the mob wasn't slowed. In your example of a 600 dps mob lasting 30 seconds, if it was fully slowed as you say, I'm shocked that you weren't healing with Q!!</div></div><hr />

then you dont need slow.  Oh that equates to don't need what shaman <br />

Your numbers are very optimistic. Under realistic circumstances, you won't have every mob slowed after 5 seconds, but more like 9. The overall damage the Shaman's tank will take is still less than the Druid's, but you aren't accounting for the most important thing which is Time. <br />
<br />
While the Druid's tank will take more damage overall, the Shaman will only land his first heal a little over 14 seconds into the fight.<br />
At this point his tank will have taken 6150 damage that the Shaman won't be able to heal up by the end of the fight chain casting Tnarg's let alone Quiescence. The Shaman's tank will find himself dead sooner or later due to a &quot;good melee round&quot; whereas the Druid's tank will never be in danger due to constant healing. <br />
<br />
The Druid is the more effective healer, period.<br />
<br />
This doesn't even adress Slow resists after Malos. Obviously the Shaman will find himself at a bigger disadvantage the more the mobs mitigate Slow or the less the fights last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Sorry Giac, but outside LDON Easy, or totally trivial content.  Slow still is required for efficient XPing.  People don't grab just a cleric or just a druid and no slower and go xping in the elemental planes.<br />
Yes they do. I have seen people do it lots of times. Not that this is bad - I do not mind not being required for a group. What you do not seem to understand though is that a cleric will outheal a slowing shaman. On low HP MOBs he will outheal two shaman.<br />
<br />
Your right Shm in Ikky are not sufficient for backup healers.  But thats related to the slow immunity + insane dps of bosses.  We do make good back up healers in tipt/vexx and below.  again this goes with the insanity of the way slow immunity is developed.<br />
I feel a lot more useful in Ikkinz then in Tipt - at least I can contribute on the trash.<br />
<br />
That I would like to see. An unslowed mob has four times the damage output of a turgurs slowed mob. There is no way in hell that a druid can heal damage four times faster than us. Any mob that a druid could heal against under those circumstances would be trivial for a shaman healer as well.<br />
Where are you playing that MOBs do not mitigate slow, do not resist slow and arrive in camp slowed at no mana or time cost to you?<br />

So healing should be balanced around your 2 boxing ? I have to fully disagree and say that healing should be balanced around what this game is supposed to be. That is a online RPG that promtes grouping and interaction with others. This issue needs to be balanced around a normal group enviroment, which a normal group enviroment from tier 1 PoP and above has a slower almost everytime. The only time a slower is not present is if one cant be found and as soon as one is available, slow will be added to the group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">How about a debuff that automatically mitigates 10-15% of a mobs DPS? A cripple type thing. 800 hitting mobs now hit for 700 max. 1K mobs hit 850 instead. The value of slow has been lowered and lowered with the new speedy environment, so lets replace it with a debuff that actually MATTERS.<br />
Sorry, Blazz, I can't resist- do you mean Bulwark of Vie? Can you guess which class already receives such a spell- and it's a buff (unresistable) not a debuff, so it's even better.  BoV makes a very noticeable difference on my sk tanking in LDoN hards, smoothing out spikes and greatly easing the sheer beatdown she endures in her bazaar rags.<br />

Apparently you didn't read my post in it's entirety. My Shaman has a 20% detrimental haste focus. So with the second best detrimental haste focus in game you'd have to constantly start casting Malos 4 seconds before the mob hits the camp to land Slow 5 seconds into the fight and never get resisted. That isn't exactly realiistic.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Unless the fights last more than 45 seconds, the Shaman does NOT win. The Shaman can become more efficient if he has the possibility to heal up his tank with Q after each fight which means 30 second downtime for the group between pulls in an exp setting.<br />
<br />
<br />

A Cleric will beat 2 Shamans easily in my analysis.<br />
<br />

You still have to heal up the damage your tank took before you slowed it. During a 30 second fight, the Shaman isn't able to heal up the damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying healing should be balanced around my 2-boxing, I'm pointing out that suggesting that a druid is more efficient healing on an unslowed mob than a shaman is healing on a fully slowed mob is absurd. You all know that perfectly well.<br />
<br />
And don't ask me to take a walk in the elemental and above environment, that is where I spend most of my time  :p . Shaman can and do act as main healers there, allthough obviously it is more difficult on certain mob types and not possible on others. Pretty much anything that is fully slowable is viable for shaman, as is much of the stuff that mitigates, provided that the mob's dps isn't horrendous. But, in that situation a druid has problems as well. Tactics is also important, showing some common sense when pulling and doing debuff order can make a huge difference in what can or can't be done.<br />
<br />
The real issue here is that shaman are a buffing/debuffing class that happens to be able to heal. People get too hung up on the &quot;priest&quot; label. All that means is that you can function as a healer. Warriors, monks and rogues all belong to the &quot;melee&quot; group, but no one suggests that they should be able to tank equally, or do dps equally, why should all priests be able to heal equally? They all bring different things to the table, have different roles in a group. Focussing on just one of those things is not a valid foundation for argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I have a question for you mister Shaman bot:<br />
<br />
Do you think a Paladin should take more damage than a Warrior against a mob that can be stunned?<br />
<br />
A Shaman becomes the more *efficient healer* the less the mobs mitigate and the longer a fight lasts. <br />
In a 30 second fight(welcome to EQ of today) the healing efficiency between Shamans and Druids is about equal using their fast heals against *fully* slowable mobs, since the Shaman has to spend his mana on Malos+Slow while the Druid is just healing for about the same mana, but the Druid is hands down the more effective healer as I have shown in my realistic analysis(wonder why you are ignoring that, though).<br />
<br />
Do you want me to run an analysis for Slow immune mobs?<br />
<br />
Where are you getting the idea from that a &quot;Shaman is a debuffer that happens to be able heal&quot;? The best Shaman debuff is Slow and Slow is no needed function in this game for the 100th time. <br />
<br />
For the longest time Shamans and Druids have had the same heal spells at their disposal.<br />
<br />
Who is asking for all priests to be able to heal equally? You are making this **** up.<br />
<br />
<br />
They all bring different things to the table, have different roles in a group. Focussing on just one of those things is not a valid foundation for argument.<br />
<br />
Focusing on just one of the things is not a valid foundation, but focusing on THE most important aspect of the game is very valid. The gap between healers is way too big.<br />
<br />
There's 4 classes that can slow in game(not counting necros), all of them work. A group doesn't require Slow to kill mobs, if they are willing to be less efficient. <br />
<br />
Every class can do damage. There's no requirement for any particular class to fulfill the damage dealer role if you are willing to give up some efficiency.<br />
<br />
There's 3 classes that can heal. One is incredibly more powerful than the other 2. The 2nd class is still highly preferable since the 3rd class relies on a resistable spell and the time required to land this in order to perform as a healer. You can NOT kill mobs without healing.<br />
<br />
Can you seriously argue that they bring other things to the table? Is the Shaman a viable solution because he can cast invisibility or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Considering that you are only 40 your kind of not understanding the point of view of a 60+ shaman on this subject. Its not that we want to be healers per se, but that druids have more than enough to offer to counter our haste and slows, so why should our heals be any less than your 65 druids? <br />
<br />
What more of an advantage would we have exactly; Wizards and Mages are going to out Nuke us. Mages are going to have better Dmg Shield, we can give the group 9’s and SoE but they can get that in PoK. <br />

Wizards can Evac just as easily as we can and they do far more DPS with their nukes. Druids have a little bit of everything but nothing that really out shines another class.</div></div><hr />

Just cause a shaman slows doesnt mean that he can heal better at 65. I ask you to ask yourself how many groups you have been in in PoP or higher that DID NOT have a slower. Why in the hell is our slow such a factor in our healing but not in any other healers? Its flawed logic on SoE's part. Period. <br />
<br />
There is ALWAYS a slower in the group and as such our healing ability should not be hit unless druids and clerics are equaly hit. They have the same benifiet of slow in every EXP group they heal in as we do. Its truly absurd when you really think about it.  <br />
<br />
With the exception of Enchanters and to a lesser degree Beast Lords, most groups would like a Shaman as main slower. I’ve been in plenty groups that would ask if a Shaman was available in our guild(s).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">The argument that a group needs a slower is false. I have shown that Druids can outheal Shamans even on mobs that don't mitigate slow at all.<br />
<br />
Slow isn't a function in a group that is needed to kill a mob. Healing and Damage is. Slow reduces the amount of healing that is needed, but if a healer can keep the tank up just fine without slow, there's no point in including a slower.<br />
<br />
Some of you have been indeed brainwashed to believe that slow is a vital function in a group even when it isn't needed.<br />
<br />
A Shaman as only healer and slower doesn't take 2 group slots, if he can be replaced by a single Druid or Cleric. That getting through your skulls yet? <br />
<br />
Who’s going to argue that a group “has” to have a slower, a group doesn’t “have” to have a tank either. Ensnare, evac, buffs, haste aren’t needed either but they certainly help. The question remains, why would a heal increase your chances of grouping?<br />
<br />
Why doesn’t your ability to play well or your reputation as a good Shaman not play a factor, by giving Shamans a better heal all you’re doing is trivializing the role of Clerics and creating more competition.</div></div><hr />

When I first started playing this game, back around Kunark, druids and shamans could heal exactly the same.  EXACTLY THE SAME.  This went on for years.  Why is it that all of a sudden did Sony decided that druids should be able to heal better?<br />
<br />
I created a shaman for all its abilities, including healing, and at that time and through my shaman becoming level 60, I could heal as well as a druid.  Then, Sony made the druids better.  And what did our class get in return?<br />

I don't wnat to be a cleric.  I don't want to be a druid.  i want to have equal heals to a druid, just as shamans did for years and years with no significant damage to this game.

<br />
Not only is that not entirely true (and gimme a break whining about druids, talk about a class that's overpowered and always has been!  What exactly has been nerfed about druids?  Other than not being able to charge a ton for ports anymore), that misses the point here.  Shamans were equal to druids in healing until almost PoP.  Why were we nerfed?<br />
<br />
And you cannot be playing the same game I am if people prefer shamans over other slowers.  With my alts, when I am in a group that needs a slower, I'll ask for a shaman - they always get a chanter or a beastlord, because of the added abilities.  <br />
<br />
Two of the things a shaman could do for years was slow well and heal as well as a druid.  Now, mitigating mobs and completely unslowable boss mobs, plus two more &quot;valuable&quot; classes with good slowing capability, have devalued us as slowers.  We can no longer heal as well as druids.  You don't think it's bad?  I have always loved playing my shaman so much I hardly ever play my numerous alts (I have 4 accounts), yet I tell people NOT to start shamans now and I am thinking of making my beastlord my main.  When someone who has loved a character for four years feels this way, when many other shamans are complaining, and when all you have is some low level shaman, maybe you should think about how truly messed up my class is instead of whining about druids.  I would never play a druid because they are too EASY, for crying out loud!</div></div><hr />

well i know how we all feel about buffs - its warm tingly feeling time - .. the Agil line of buffs is a waste...everyone clicks it off when i cast it (agil does next to nothing for AC *shrugs*) we have a zing line thats worthless, a cha line that does nothing for us and AC line that...well is only ever cast when i'm soloing... and even then its whe i can be bothered to remember to mem it. <br />
That leaves us with the Sta and the focus line... (haste, well chanters beat us on that.. and im hardly ever asked for it TBH) And lets not start with the Talisman of the diaku.. yes it stacks but but the time Focus hits, well theyre maxxed for dex and str. <br />
That leaves us with the avatar line - starts at lvl 60 ends at lvl 65 lats for 6 mins.... well atleast we can buff every 6 mins or keep it on 4 toons at anyone time, i hate the spell to be honest too much hastle for to little gain, as most toons dont get much from it, bar a little more attack.<br />
The dots, well, lets see... we get one line thats worth anything, and another that is only useful in PvP (stop that evil chanter/necro), but then even with malo, im finding that alot of mobs will resist it. <br />
so what if i can potentially deal 1.2k damage per tick. By the time i have my thrid dot off, the mobs dead, meaning ive wasted alot of mana trying to add dps (nukes now yu are taking the piss, Rain damage? HAH lvl 63 spell and its resisted more by mobs in Splitpaw than it is by me!!)<br />
Ok they've introduced a Curse line, i havent got bane yet, but im looking forward to it, shame the next step down from it is lvl 54.. sorry dun got nuff space in my spell gems for it.(im hoping that its very hard to resist)<br />
The slowing... well ever since i reached 51 Turgers has never left my no.7 spell slot, and i doubt it will i have only ever memmed my aoe slow, for LDoN's the disease lines? yea right, 50 slow, and disease isnt covered by malo? na thanx i'll stick to malo/Turgurs. <br />
but why should i slow its either mitigated, resisted, resisted then mitigated, theres a beastlord proccing his slow, or theres a chanter in the group with their less resisted slow... but hey, its what were GOOD for!<br />
<br />
the only thing i see that we should do as a shaman community, is strike, dont log yur shaman on at all leave the poor bugger mothballed for a week. And lets see if they notice the lack of shaman in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Maybe I can add a bit of perspective to some of this. I took a break from EQ shortly after Luclin came out and just returned 6 months ago. On returning I find:<br />
<br />
That the Shaman has gone from the master of buffs to oh yeah shaman buffs too please. <br />
<br />
There was a raging arguement about who had the best dots in game the Shaman or the Necro. Now, there is not a word on this topic.<br />
<br />
I had the healing power to make the difference between a wipe or survival when things went bad. Now my fast heal can't cover the damage inflicted by a mob on one hit, and the mobs are Quading!<br />
<br />
What made the Shaman the class they were at their height during the Kunark era, were:<br />
<br />
The best stat buffs in game, except Wis and Int which were saved for the chanters.<br />
<br />
The powerful dots that allowed us to solo almost as well as a necro. About the only inequality in this area was our lack of a snare type spell. Sow was a good compensation for this in outdoor zones, but indoor we had to root or be trained.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shaman both had superior healing and cloroplast for those fast spot heals. These healed enough that they would cover about 2 hits from a mob. Which is not necessarily alot, but it did fill the gab so the cleric could get that 10 second C-heal off. <br />
<br />
When it comes to healing I don't want C-heal. What I want is a heal that is strong enough to keep a tank from going down in an emergency. Used to be that the mobs would double for about 200 - 300 a hit, and we could heal about 500 with our quick heal. Now the average mob in POP is hitting for 800 - 900 a hit with quads being very common. Our fast heal is doing 1300 which is about a cloroplast short of where it should be. <br />
<br />
The &quot;C-Heal&quot; they gave us is a joke! 1925 hp or 75% of max, that is enough healing power to save a pure caster. Oh wait no its not, that pure caster won't last the 10 seconds it takes to cast the spell! For healing melees this spell is a waste of code. The average tank is running 6 to 8k hp, so it takes us 10 seconds to heal 25 to 30% of the tanks hp. The Fabled King Tranix hit me for more in a single hit than this spell will heal. <br />
<br />
While still on the topic of heals, let's not forget that Pallies and Necros both get group heal spells. For a pally to be able to heal all members of the party for 900 hp with one spell, what good is our 1300 fast heal? That Pally will do more to save the group than the shaman can.<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon for mobs to require two and three casts of malosinia before it will stick. Don't even consider landing a slow without landing a resist debuff. Having to cast slow more than once to get it to stick is all too common as well. <br />
<br />
I would be willing to live with the current healing ratio, IF SoE applied that same ratio to slows for Shaman/Chanter/ Beastlord. Most groups don't consider buffs or debuffs a Shaman can bring to a group, they think about slow and nothing else. The Beastlord is a tempting choice because of the high dps they bring along with a fair slow. The Chanter 70% slow and Crack, enough said.<br />
<br />
We have gone from a well rounded Jack of all trades class, to Tim &quot;the Toolman&quot; Taylor with a set of home improvement books.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wish I could tell you bane is perfect, it isnt. The refresh timer is long (24 secs i believe). The resist rate can be brutal (even with malo/s).<br />
<br />
There are times I load Bane and Anathema, so If i get a resist, I can at least toss a dot on the mob before it dies, or if there are more than 2 mobs being fought at the same moment.<br />
<br />
Then there are times because of the resist rate and refresh rate, I let Blood of Saryrn + Spear of Torment do my dps in groups. I usually end up with BoS &amp; Torment after getting disgusted with the silly resists and refreshs on the curse line. Just depends on the camp/mob.</div></div><hr />

Regards,<br />
<br />
Actually, something very similar, yes, except it doesnt take up a buff slot and doesnt require a cleric and doesnt need to be recast on everyone every fight, but yes. A BoV that we cast on the mob. Seems reasonable, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">You still have to heal up the damage your tank took before you slowed it. During a 30 second fight, the Shaman isn't able to heal up the damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
See, here is another flaw in your analysis. I have been in LOTS of XP groups in places where the mobs hit 500-800 and I have RARELY seen the MA take 6K in damage before I get Slow off. Just doesnt happen. He mitigates too, you know, he has LR5 too, you know. <br />
<br />
Also, in your analysis, you have NO room for a Druid getting summoned and waxxed. Tell you what, if a Druid drops 2 heals in the first 10 seconds of a fight, he is probably dead. I, however, am not. <br />
<br />
Giac I appriciate your analysis here. You have actually opened my eyes to some very legitimate points that you have been making. Your numbers are fairly accurate, but they DO NOT reflect MOST situations. Sorry. MOST shaman can gain at LEAST 3 seconds on your &quot;9 seconds to first heal&quot; by starting to cast Malos before the mob arrives and swings at the MA. Also, in MOST situations, the MA is not the puller, so the PULLER is taking the first round, and is easily healed back up by an odd Q or 2, and the MA is COMPLETELY ignored the first round of combat. Therefore, he is only taking 3K, not 6500. And thats if he doesnt dodge, LR, or mitigte any of the hits. <br />
<br />
Seriously Giac, I honestly think that LOTS of people agree with you here, but man, Litgruv is right, you are so abrasive that it turns people off to your message. Your numbers are a BIT off, they are a low-end scenario (ie couldnt get Malos off fast enough, mob hits MA before anyone, etc etc). Not worst case, but a low end case. Minor adjustments to your time-schedule bring us back some. Maybe not ALL the way, but some. But I know this much for SURE, if a druid heals 6750 hps in the first 9 seconds of a fiight vs an 800 hitter, he is almost certainly DEAD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">What more of an advantage would we have exactly; Wizards and Mages are going to out Nuke us. Mages are going to have better Dmg Shield, we can give the group 9’s and SoE but they can get that in PoK. <br />
<br />
Wizards can Evac just as easily as we can and they do far more DPS with their nukes. Druids have a little bit of everything but nothing that really out shines another class.<br />
<br />
A arguement stating that you dont bring anythign to the group cause someone can get 9's in PoK is the most absurd thing i ever heard. Thats like saying a enchanter is worthless cause you get get KEI in PoK  http://www.quake3world.com/ubb/icons/icon27.gif <br />

Im sorry, you druids have had your time in the spot light, you got tremendous attention and are more desirable and better off for it. Im glad you got what you needed, but your time for bitching is over, let a class that actualy needs it get some attention :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact is this, druids are very sought after, they are a highly used replacement for a main healer and when they are sought after for this role its not just cause theyc an heal, its cause of ALL the tools they bring to the table. When i cant find a cleric i tellt he group to look for a druid and everyone either agree's quickly or comes up with reasons why a druid is perfect for a healing role in the group. Evac, DS, Heal Snare, significant DPS contribution, mana regen, there is ALOT you have to offer. <br />
<br />
I know you understand the game as a 65 druid, but please oh please, dont take this the wrong way, but there is no way you can know what a 65 shaman has a deal, especialy in the elemental+ setting. Even if you play a class for a few days, you cant fully understand till you play one as your main every day for hours at a time.<br />
<br />
No, maybe your right, druids cant do anything better then any other class, but being the second best at multiple things with small gaps to the leading class doesnt hurt much.</div></div><hr />

Checkout the first entry. Nature's Touch and Chloroblast are Luclin era spells.<br />
<br />
So according to you &quot;03-14 19:28 Initial Entry&quot; means its a luclin spell, well I wonder what other &quot;luclin era spells&quot; we can find on lucy. <br />
<br />
How about Summon Food (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=50&amp;source=Test), Burst of Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=93&amp;source=Test) or perhaps Torpor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=1576&amp;source=Test) (first smartass who does the &quot;well I didnt get torpor until luclin&quot; gets a cookie).<br />
<br />
So some years back on march the 14th they redid the spell database and that is what lucy is reporting (note that its month/day not year/something-else afaik)<br />
<br />
Now where could we find some more or less conclusive proof of when the spell originated? Perhaps at castersrealm's (http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1540&amp;Page=11). Hey look they are bitching about how the spell is too good for druids and they are doing it back in march 2001, you know what this means?

This isn't entirely true though Lit.  I 2 Box both Druid and Shaman<br />
both have 400+ AAs, both have tons of time played.  I do on occassion 1 box one or the other for need.  I have beat Tipt/Vexx many times<br />
and barely played around with Ikky.  Guild Level is just starting to farm Quarm.<br />
<br />
Background said: These are my observations from Lots of Play Time with both cases.<br />
1) Groups are either Looking for Cleric or Looking for Healer or Looking for Anyone who can heal.  They also are <br />
1a) over half the groups are LF Cleric.  This includes LDON hards.<br />
This includes Vexx/Tipt/Ikky/Kod groups.  Druids totally have no role here.<br />
1b) In elemental planes, a druid is plenty.   They want either Druid or<br />
Cleric whoever comes up LFG first will get it.<br />
1c) They are looking for anyone who can heal.  Groups farming LDON Normal for wins will take a shaman in heart beat.  Groups lookng for backup for trial will take either.<br />
<br />
Groups also look for slower still.   <br />
Every elemental group will take a slower.  Honestly with a Cleric and with a very high AC/hp tank (IE one with decent time gear) You don't need slow.  But each group still says in group chat &quot;Group looking for Slower.&quot;<br />
<br />
At higher levels, like Ldon Hard, Vexx, Tipt people require a slower.<br />
They don't do these groups without a slower.  However, the preference is always Chanter to Shaman to Bst.<br />
<br />
Druid's aren't looked at for DPS slots, outside maybe Charming in Vexx/Tipt.  Short of that at every other facet of the game, druid DPS is just not as high as the sustained DPS of our other classes.<br />
<br />
So far my personal score is:<br />
Random Group invites to Vexx/Tipt<br />
Druid 1  Shaman 5<br />
Guild Group asking me (Or officer assigning me on Trial Day) to play only my Shaman or Druid in Vexx/Tipt<br />
Druid 0 Shaman 6<br />
Ratio of seeing Druid LFG vs Shaman LFG in Guild Chat<br />
Druid 66 Shaman 33<br />
# of Druids on our Raid Compared to Shaman on a Raid<br />
Druid 6-9 Shaman 5-8<br />
<br />
Incidently the Druid is better Geared 5k HP Unbuffed vs 4500 Unbuffed<br />
6300 Mana vs 5600 Mana.  <br />
<br />
Take from this what you will.  But druid's &quot;flexibility&quot; per say isn't getting them groups much of it is no longer sought after.   Slow still gets groups in Guild Chat ranging from Elementals through LDON Hard through Trials.  <br />
<br />
Do Shaman need fixing.  Absolutely.<br />
Do Druids need fixing.  Absolutely.<br />
<br />
It there too much emphasis on the Holy trinity Cleric &amp; Chanters.<br />
Absolutely.  Is this bad for the game: absolutely.<br />
<br />
My solution:<br />
Priests need rebalancing.  100/64/47 Ratio is insane.<br />
100/80/60 would be much better for the game.  Ratio needs to apply to <br />
both spot heals and to ICHs.  So yes shaman need thier 64 ICH back<br />
and druid's need thiers fixed.  <br />
<br />
Debuffers need rebalancing.  In the days of slow mitigation 75/70/65<br />
gets narrowed to a trivial amount.  The 5% slow is not enough to compensate for lack of mez.  The 10% slow is not enough to compensate for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I dont think this was any kind of a nerf, I just think that, at some point, SOE decided that they needed a &quot;2nd viable Main Healer class&quot; due to the increased DPS of both mobs and players (increased mob DPS = more healing, increased player DPS = shorter fights).<br />
<br />
I don't feel nerfed so much, more like neglected. If they dont want Shaman to be viable group Main Healers, then they NEED to adjust our other abilities. Faster DPS, better buffs, better debuffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difference was pre-luclin.  Druids got edge in Direct Healing via Natures Touch and Shaman got Torpor.  ((at the time Torpor was much better<br />
than NT.))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Not only is that not entirely true (and gimme a break whining about druids, talk about a class that's overpowered and always has been! What exactly has been nerfed about druids? Other than not being able to charge a ton for ports anymore), that misses the point here. Shamans were equal to druids in healing until almost PoP. Why were we nerfed?<br />
<br />
And you cannot be playing the same game I am if people prefer shamans over other slowers. With my alts, when I am in a group that needs a slower, I'll ask for a shaman - they always get a chanter or a beastlord, because of the added abilities. <br />
<br />
Two of the things a shaman could do for years was slow well and heal as well as a druid. Now, mitigating mobs and completely unslowable boss mobs, plus two more &quot;valuable&quot; classes with good slowing capability, have devalued us as slowers. We can no longer heal as well as druids. You don't think it's bad? I have always loved playing my shaman so much I hardly ever play my numerous alts (I have 4 accounts), yet I tell people NOT to start shamans now and I am thinking of making my beastlord my main. When someone who has loved a character for four years feels this way, when many other shamans are complaining, and when all you have is some low level shaman, maybe you should think about how truly messed up my class is instead of whining about druids. I would never play a druid because they are too EASY, for crying out loud!  <br />
<br />
Its not entirely true in your opinion. Where am I whining exactly? This thread is about a potential conspiracy against shamans and them being brainwashed. Why should Shamans be equal to other classes in healing?<br />
<br />
I know what game I’m playing and I know what is being said in-group because I’m there, so unless you are watching me play then you’ll have to continue to speculate. Again, who is whining about Druids in this thread?<br />
<br />
Druids are too easy yet you are complaining about the challenges that Shaman are supposedly having to deal with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Why don't you just accept the fact that we're talking about Time+ Shaman not hunting in Nedaria or Elemental Planes. NO a group does not need a slower, YES they do need a tank, YES they do need a cleric, and YES a big backup heal would increase our chances of grouping. We are not a desirable class for half of the GoD zones, reputation IS the only factor in getting a group, we're dead weight like several broken classes once were, regardless of ability. If we got a bigger heal than druids we'd still not trivialize clerics in GoD. Oh my bad, I guess you think everyone in GoD is suddenly going to start farming SolRo tower named? <br />

Your right, increasing our healing wont be the end all of the classes issues. But as stated many times before to many people that ask this question.... BRenlo asked us to unify under 1 idea that we would like corrected, to take each thing 1 step at a time instead of all askign for everything and nothing getting done.<br />
<br />
So we are. This 1 issue of many that need to be corrected and that is the driving force behind this movement.<br />
<br />
You say that we are feeling sorry for ourselves on multiple occasions so far, you imply that we are not up to the  &quot;challange&quot; of our class inablities. I challange you to read back in time on this forum and read back in time on spell upgrade from literaly expansion after expeansion after expansion. <br />

There was a point we started getting left behind, not through design of game mechanics, but neglect, we adjusted. Another expansion left us behind and increased the healing gap betweens us, we survived and adjusted. But now the gap has become too great. This class the shaman that once was looked at as a equal replacement for a cleric as a druid if you couldnt find one, is now not as equal. We have sat by time and time again and told each other to remain calm, to not complain, but it did nothing but get us more neglected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buzz i ask you this, when is the time you do something about your issues? How long do you sit by and say &quot;its ok ill just adjust to being weaker&quot;. How long do we need OTHER CLASSES to tell SoE and everyone else we need help before we ourselves finaly go... ok *** is going on here. <br />
<br />
This isnt class envy, this isnt feeling sorry for oursleves, this is simply the time to act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Litgruv has finally come around to a point that every old time Shaman reached not too far in to the release of Kunark. Before then, as written above, we we're very well balanced. One of the best classes in the game to play, and we were a Battle Priest, also as written above.<br />
<br />
Kunark destroyed any and all balance, which has never been fully regained with the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
The main factor for VI was our ability to regain mana faster then any other priest. Not slows and other debuffs. Not buffs. Our mana recovery. This is the central issue to the Shaman class. That is our only key point, and is all we have had.<br />
<br />
If you are constantly running out of mana in todays game you are either buffing when you should not be, or you just haven't completely figured out how to use your Torpor and others in this line. Sit down and write out the mana per use to health regained ratio. Do the same for what ever version of canni you are using. Now apply it properly. This game is all about numbers, and you should be doing the math for everything.<br />
<br />
As for buffs, YOU decide who gets what buff and when they get it. The tanks job is to **** and tank, the damage dealers job is to **** and deal damage. You know how long your buffs last, and you should know when they have faded. <br />
<br />
If you can't do this instictively then set a clock next to your monitor and time it.<br />
<br />
The people around these parts hate me because I can't stand guilds. Well, have a good look at what guilds produce. <br />
<br />
Very high level Shaman that do not understand their own class nor how to play it in many situations. They just show up for a raid, perhaps get tagged as the main debuffer or perhaps get assigned as assist healer to keep the clerics and casters alive. Well there's a hell of a lot more to this class, and if you had been playing it for several years of your life both inside and outside of the guild process you would know this.<br />
<br />
We're not healers. We're not debuffers. We're not buffers. We're not damage dealers. These are just our tools.<br />
<br />
We are mana batteries first. And everything else second. The developer in charge of balancing spells knows this, and it is the very first issue of comparison used when balancing Shaman spells with the other two priest classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman are likened to glue, we're what holds things together when the situation starts to fall apart by filling in the missing gaps with our wide variety of spells.<br />
<br />
As for where SOE is taking this class, no one knows. SOE has been clueless from day one, and just cares about increasing revenue through attracting new accounts. Their programmers seem to look to other games soley for inspiration.<br />
<br />
And another thing, before complaining about another class, grab a pair and play it up to a relatively high level. <br />
<br />
People who only play one class to a high level irk me with their limited scope. If you're class is all you know, then talk about your class and leave everyone else out of it.<br />
<br />
If all you think about are guilds in the end game, then you don't represent the majority of players. Most people quit before reaching level 65. Most people do not want to put in the time it takes to level, get flagged to hell and back, and raid non-stop for the rest of their life constantly replacing gear. The average player just wants to have fun. That is why the average level of the whole game is still only in the mid-50s. The high end is not fun to play in for the vast majority of players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you ****ing limp biscuit. It means all your pathetic arguments are directed at EP or lesser zones while the majority are talking about Time+. Shaman were relatively balanced pre-GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>frroooaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Damn this threads gone right off topic.<br />
Its not about do we or do we not heal better than/get group easier than a druid.<br />
What its all about is the fact SHAMAN THEMSELVES are settling for being behind druids in healing and why ?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saramin<br />
<br />
Yes that was off-topic but I'm in good company  :D<br />
<br />
I have never settled for being behind druids but there are several reasons others would:<br />
<br />
a) They are limited by their spells<br />
b) They can not change their spells<br />
c) They do not like whining or writing essays (this includes /feedback, /bug, etc)<br />
d) Druids, Devs, or other classes sent them on an ego guilt trip<br />
e) They don't care; for any combination of the above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">The harder GoD zones get, the more mobs mitigate slow, or oughtright can not be slowed. With increasing GoD progression mobs hit harder as well. One of the things that made our Tnarg heal useful is that it was going on the assumtion that a mob would be slowed almost 75% as opposed to a druid who would CH or what have you since they don't slow. Basically they aren't going to go through GoD and make **** slowable, or rape less hard. We are merely asking for a heal that is more powerful because frankly a 1300 heal, or the new heal which isnt much more, don't really do much when a mob can outdamage the heal in one or two hits. Something that heals 1750 - 1800 IMO would be nice because its an extra 500 HP for the casual shaman, or a 2500-5000 heal for a more experienced (AA, focused) shaman. Basically we want a heal that makes a difference in GoD, and of course it will affect pre-GoD as well, so they have to consider that. I just hope they realize that the what 1550? heal they put in isn't really that much better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly I think there is no reason we should not have gotten an outright 1.2-1.3k nuke or outright 2k heal or new spell line in GoD with how they debalanced us with mitigation and immunities. With new balancing like that, they should obviously come from the harder areas, and put a spell that doesn't affect our balancing [Canni] as the easiest. I am not concerned one bit about people using them for old content, why should we? Every other expansion has done that for every class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">If shaman didn't have Malos/Malosinia I don't think we'd get many GoD groups. I agree that we need something to up our DPS or HPS. Something significant.</div></div><hr />

I looked very hard at GoD as all the information was being released during the testing, and since its release. What stood out to me the most were:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Our AAs were to expensive for questionable usefulness<br />
 In the spell list I saw every other caster class got some form of Canni. <br />
 Content aimed at about the Elemental level and up.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I have enough work trying to bring my shaman back to a decent level of gear without throwing away money on an expansion that does nothing but give Shaman the shaft yet again. <br />
<br />
Back on topic.<br />
Another aspect of the healing issue to look at is the fact that no matter how fast we regain mana, Our HoT is over written by a Clerics HoT. Is the SoE vision for Shaman to be Uber at regening wasted mana?</div></div><hr />
