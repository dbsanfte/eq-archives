Totally wiped a 6-8 month lead we had on many others thus turning  zones into quasi- dreadlands of our server with 200 + people in them fighting over 3 pieces of loot. Yeah, sure, they will run into walls in PoP and stagnate and we will move on but damn frustrating to say the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  If anything PoP has given guilds more breathing room because the encounters take so long to get to/run the script for.<br />
<br />
  Whereas in Luclin, a guild could hit emp/cursed/al/hp/aow in one night, now if a guild can do hoh trials + mm, thats a 6-7 hour raid in itself, nevermind 5 nameds + solro, or the bertox ring, or dream+saryn, or rz/tz/vz.<br />
<br />
  There's tons of room until you get to the elemental planes.  I'm not sure if that's what you're complaining about, but even in a guild that has the elem planes to themselves, we rarely can clear one, nevermind all 4 in one night.<br />
<br />
  I honestly don't see what you mean by trivializing things, fights in PoP are still difficult, maybe old world encounters are a joke, but if you're farming old world stuff yourself, you really can't complain that you now have competition there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The challenge in EQ is not the difficulty of the encounters. It's getting shots at the encounter. Guilds who have always been a step ahead and had gotten uncontested attempts to learn mobs and farm loot may be frustrated if they find competition. <br />
<br />
Welcome to our world.<br />
<br />
You must remember that what you just complained about has been daily life for many of us for years. This kind of competition is the way the game is. If you had a lead before and had a zone like VT that was all yours and yours alone then you were fortunate. Good for you.<br />
<br />
Many of us deal with high competition, we have for a long time. An entire night's raiding that nets 1 to 3 pieces of loot is nothing new.</div></div><hr />

Level 65 has made level more important than gear, so the less uber guilds can catch up and do most of the encounters that only uber guilds who had spent months farming ST and NTOV could do before, simply by leveling. <br />
<br />
Is that pretty much it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tromor</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you guys are slightly misunderstanding the original poster.<br />
<br />
What he's trying to say is that his guild used to be able to use  the blocking of bottle necks to keep other guilds down, and the innate time intensiveness of things like key quests kept otherwise capable and worthy guilds in their shadow.<br />
<br />
Now, with PoP making the 'upper' tiers available to anyone who can demonstrate skill by passing a trial, they no longer have a viable method of keeping the little people down.<br />
<br />
Sure, there will always be able to mock the casual player, who never competes with them, but what fun is it to keep something from someone who doesn't want it in the first place?<br />
<br />
He's saying that for some reason, it's too difficult for his guild to jump ahead of these other guild by using skill and tactics, so now, he's fearful of those lesser guilds actually doing stuff his guild can't do, and that would really mess up the Proper Order of Things (TM).<br />
<br />
I tend to agree, I mean, what kind of game actually awards people for skill and cunning, and neglects the really important skills of encounter blocking, and key camping?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Before POP expansion guilds had to work their way up, put their time in, learn tactics, learn encounters and ways to beat mobs, gear up their players, etc.<br />
   <br />
Guild A spends 6 months working their guilds gear up and tactics until finally they can take on Avatar of War, for example, and kill.   Now after POP, Guild B which couldn't do TOV North or Tormax before POP now can all the sudden take out avatar of war without working their way up or even knowing/working on tactics.. The mobs are just so gimped from the expansion that anyone can do without the time/effort/tactics/gear that prior to POP was required to even do it.   <br />
<br />
He was not refering to POP encounters at all but to how SOL/Velious high end content is gimped so bad with POP and made so easy creating 8-9 guilds going after same high end mobs instead of the very few that earned the ability before pop and the new guilds that were just handed it all with POP without having to work for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyrthor</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh...my take on what he meant is a bit different.<br />
<br />
In Luclin, if someone wanted to take 120 folks to VT, they had to get 120 folks keyed for emp, beat him, and get 1,320 other pieces for their VT keys.<br />
<br />
In PoP, if folks wanna take 120 against something, its a lot quicker to do.  It does get disheartening taking down something big with 60 folks and just a little while later watching someone else bring 120 to do the same thing and get all those folks through to the next stage.<br />
<br />
With the 'streamlining' they are doing with communications, they are only making it easier for folks to decide to bring 150 of their closest friends to everything, which is just dumb in my view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worse thing I saw was Guild A killing AOW, gimp guild trains them with AOW right as Guild A kills idol and trains them 3 more times with giants during the fight.  Guild A finally wipes out to the trains (4 total) when AOW is at 1% health.  Gimp Guild moves in and finishes it off.  This was all right in front of a Guide that was visible and the person training was the guild leader of gimp guild and knew the guide was there.  <br />

He got to keep the loot and was suspended for 3 days only.. Got to love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wadin</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I still do not get it. Are some of you saying that a person needs a college degree to play and win something big in Everquest? You all talk about this thing called &quot;skill and tactics&quot; which some few people in the past had but now others do not have? Did you receive this &quot;skill and tactics&quot; thing with your college degree? Is there a limited number of total amount of &quot;skill and tactics&quot; that is ever possible? I mean, it is something like only 80 &quot;skill and tactics&quot; exist in all of the 40+ some servers. Once someone owns this &quot;skill and tactics&quot; then no one else can ever get it or learn it? <br />
<br />
This all makes me sick some times. This belief that only a few people could ever gain the &quot;skill and tactics&quot; that someone else gained. This belief that they alone could are the only people who could ever figure out how a GAME is played. That it is impossible for others to figure it out to. So what if it took you 6 months to learn it. Seems to me, they may have done better since it is not taking THEM 6 months to do it. What was your problem?<br />

PS&gt; Why is it that over the last year or two, many people in Everquest has become what would be called &quot;elitist&quot; in any other community? And that we allow this &quot;elitism&quot; attitude to be acceptable in our community? When has it changed that a person so says &quot;I am better then you could ever think of being&quot; a decent and exceptable statement in our community?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One possible solution to that is to stop calling them &quot;gimps.&quot;  I know that's almost totally unlikely to happen (you stopping, or them forgiving, either way), but you look like a jackass when you say it.<br />
<br />
In Luclin, if someone wanted to take 120 folks to VT, they had to get 120 folks keyed for emp, beat him, and get 1,320 other pieces for their VT keys.<br />

<br />

<br />
If you're so 00b4r 1337, why are you still killing AoW?  If levels 61-65 gave the &quot;gimps&quot; the power to jump from Gozzrem or lower, to AoW and NToV (as you put it), why didn't you jump from AoW to Agnarr and Rallos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuglooc</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my two coppers worth:<br />
<br />
I agree with Dangoon in that the main impact is on the top level pre-PoP areas.  Experience in the first tier PoP zones (accessible by anyone with the PoP expansion who's at least level 46) is far easier to get than in pre-PoP zones such as Sebilis, ToV, and Ssra.  This allows the second tier guilds to catch up to the top guild.  By going 100% AA once they get a good buffer into level 60, they build themselves up for the pre-PoP encounters that were once solely for the top two or three guilds on the server.  Whether they decide to pursue higher tier PoP zones isn't an issue.  It's now common knowledge that many pre-PoP encounters become sub-optimal at level 61; thus many are building up the AA at the rate of several points a week.  Granted, they may use 60 people for an encounter the top guild did with 24 (due to lack of tactics).....<br />
<br />
Heck, one can get AA without ever having to fight (running the shopper's quest in the Plane of Knowledge about 50 times is good for a full AA and 1500+ pp).<br />
<br />
I have not ventured beyond the first tier PoP zones, so I won't comment on any comparison between encounters in tier 2 (or higher) PoP zones and those in Vex Thal or NToV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is in HoT now, we've been doing Dozekar sized targets lately. The last 3 or 4 Doze spawns, however, the local Euro Uber Guild has been sending a team (a single group) to farm Dozekar. Please note before you reply that &quot;a single group has as much right.....blah blah blah&quot; that i'm not complaining about their accelerated ability. I would expect an all 65 team with solid aaxp and emperor loot to be able to do exactly what they have done.<br />
Last night, however, they used all this to a really unfortunate advantage: when we engaged Doze first, they decided to come try to KS us. Fine, they wouldn't have been able to, as their single group included support classes and we have plenty of Sagely Archanists too (not to mention the ranger contingency). Unfortunately they realized it wasn't going to work also and pressed the hard reset button: had their tank run all about HoT and get a huge ass train which wiped us both out. Then while our group of 25 rebuffed (in record time for us), their group of 6 went in and engaged. Because my guild is a nice guy guild (i have tried to get them to toughen up but they seem disinterested in my 'tactics') and depends on gm support (which yielded nothing, as usual), them 1 us 0.<br />
<br />
Is that all PoP's fault? Not necessarily. But I doubt that same group of level 60s could have pulled Doze off in the same manner. I can tell you that at level 65 I am AMAZED at the huge difference in what kind of damage I can just stand up to. But no, it really isn't PoP's fault, this is the way things have always been and always will be.<br />
<br />
That said, all you people scratching your armpits beating the &quot;competition good&quot; drum, I do disagree. Competiton would be good if there was a level playing field. If people were bound to the rules. Without that level of accountability, competition is the dirtiest team wins and I fail to personally see what's so good about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the comments here read (to me) like folks frothing at the mouth, which is always a fun show.<br />
<br />
Just because the original poster was bemoaning the loss of his guild's &quot;lead&quot; does not (in and of itself) mean they c@ckblocked anyone to get there.  Sure, it's possible to use cheesy tactics to hold folks back temporarily (which I loathe) but realistically, every server has guilds at all kinds of levels.  In general you are competing with the other folks in your tier (for lack of a better word).  You push, you work hard, you learn to do bigger and better things, you move up.  It's all on you.  You can't stay locked out of everything forever.<br />
<br />
On the point that I raised, the zerg.....I guess I would accept folks callin me an elitist on that one, since I really disagree with that as a way to get the monster dead.  Sure, some groups need more than others to do the same thing, but it is a sad state of the world if you need 100+ to kill a mob.<br />
<br />
So, if your plan to conquer the game includes the mass wave attack like that?  Yeah, I guess I would look down my nose at you.  There isn't just one 'right' way to do things in this game, but I would certainly stand by there being a couple 'wrong' ones.</div></div><hr />

 1)uber guilds----- 95% are in day to day guilds or unguilded, guess what we dont feel sorry for you.<br />
 2) some of our guilds will never see a guild god killing (example at 55 i am the ranking guildy lol) guess what we dont feel sorry for ya.<br />
 3) Those of us in either situation would love to do some of this stuff and not too may opportunities, if any, present themselves, guess what, again we dont feel sorry for ya.<br />
<br />
 Best piece of advice I can give ya, quit your worrying and whining that your guild is no longer the king of the hil, cause those of us not on the aforementioned hill dont give a ****.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many if not most zerg set of fights are often set that way because the people doing it felt it was not fair excluding people. Some of what you are saying tells me you believe it is fair and justifable to exclude people (many who are your friends in some way) from doing an encounter. If a fight only needs 25 people to complete but you have 100 people interested in doing it, why is it reasonable to set up a clique to exclude some 75 people?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">01-30-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point that many of you missed is that before POP and level 65, many of these encounters could not be zerged at all. You could not get enough people into the zone fast enough given how fast the mob killed them,<br />
<br />
But now, with level 65, many pre-POP encounters no longer require skill, tactics, or imagination. Just throw 100 bodies at it, and click stick rez them when they die to do it again. It is just barely enough to make that strategy work. However, it takes away from every player who had to learn to manage that encounter using smarts.<br />
<br />
One of the fun things for me in EQ has always been learning the tactics, and tricks of the trade to let me take on a given mob at a given level range, both in groups and in raids. That is one reason I frequent The Glade, for the wealth of knowledge here about how to do more with fewer players.<br />
<br />
Zerging, while a valid strategy, is not imaginative at all (in my opinion). I suppose if you want the phat lewts bad enough you can just zerg it til you get them but for many of us, the fun is in learning the encounter, figuring out the strategies needed for it, and winning with a smaller force than just an army of monkeys pressing attack.<br />
<br />
Until POP, certain encounters simply required a certain minimum of skill, planning, and strategy to do. This allowed players who were interested in strategy to associate with guilds that were willing to work on strategies and those that were not could join guilds that used more zergish tactics. But the highest encounters required at least some strategic thinking and this separated the tactical players from the zergish players. This was not &quot;****blocking&quot; as someone referred to it. It was a natural artifact of the game mechanics and the willingness of some players to learn the strategies needed to defeat those mechanics while others were unwilling and simply stagnated.<br />
<br />
These same guilds that can zerg these pre-POP encounters now will ultimately find themselves blocked by POP level content at some point  in the future because those encounters are designed for L65s and those encounters will likely require more than just pure manpower to win.<br />
<br />
Aaladil is frustrated that the tactical advantage his guild had worked hard to achieve was wiped out in short order by an increase in the level cap.<br />
<br />
I understand his frustration but the right answer is, as some here have pointed out, to finish moving through the POP zones and get to Rallos Zek (and beyond). Encounters like Bertox, Rallos, and Sol Ro will all serve to radically slow down or even stop the zerg mentality. This has been true in every expansion - zergists have been stopped cold until a subsequent expansion raised some ability to let them continue their lemming march forward.<br />
<br />
And once Aaladil's guild moves through those encounters to Sol Ro Tower and beyond, they won't have to deal with the guilds that simply gather 100 bodies to throw at the emperor. His post here was simply an expression of frustration which I can understand.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cheap shots I see here seem more indicative of vindictiveness than open mindedness. Once upon a time comments like Aaladil's would have elicited a lengthy discussion about how the new level cap has changed various raid encounter mechanics. But now that rangers are an &quot;uber&quot; class, we have an influx of newer members who seem to have brought their Safehouse attitudes with them.</div></div><hr />

Well, back in the day, people made posts in the appropriate forums - the initial post seems more like a rant to me and should be files as such.  Mostly just bitching, rather than a seed for constructive conversation.</div></div><hr />

Right now, my guild sort of employs a tactic, commonly known as ZERGING to take down some mobs we can't.  It seems the implications of PoP were that the designers encouraged that.  And quite frankly, I hate zerging.  The attentiveness and skill of the guild is no longer stressed and diminishes; it's embarassing.  And for those of you who say there's no way to be more 'skilled' at everquest, well, that same demograph is why the 'holy 3' group demograph still exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ is supposed to be a progression, and it used to be. As it used to be, you could ask most people in the high end game what the order of progression was for fights and gear, and the responses would be pretty much the same. There were two routes depending on which Velious faction your guild picked, but the progressions were similar. You needed the gear you got in West ToV to beat NToV, and you needed NToV gear to have any chance in Ssra, and you needed Ssra gear to have any shot at Emp and subsequently VT. <br />
<br />
Enter PoP with it's increased abilities and spells, and people are skipping the progression. That's broken. But it's not unprecedented. Thorny Vine armor used to be part of a ranger's progression; how many guilds even bother with PoF anymore? A week after Kunark hit the shelves, all pieces of TV armor except the Bp and legs were already obsolete, and every weapon in the game, including all god loot, was made obsolete by a pair of little trinkets you could pick up with a group of 6 just a hop and a skip from the Sebilis zone in. VI often trivializes a lot of past content with new content; it's what they think we want. <br />
<br />
It's still fun, and it's not a total loss; those who followed the progression will still have an easier time as they progress than those who skip content. I don't forsee a lot of guilds having success into the elemental plane level of play without having finished all other expansions. A lot of VT gear is still the best in game, and no one is killing Emp without having cleared the other stuff in Ssra, if for no other reason then the fact that in the time it takes to get a full guild keyed for him, you'll see the nameds pop over and over and you'll kill them as a break from key camping.<br />
<br />
Just try to state your points without calling people gimps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a question for you.  <br />
<br />
Why should the higher level encounters be limited to only the top 2 or 3 guilds on a server?<br />
<br />
Not all of us are in or even want to be in the most Uber Guild on our server.  I am currently in a guild that focuses on friendship first, Raiding second(although we are shaping up nicely as a raiding guild after almost 2 years).  Is there something wrong with that?  Yet, I too would like to see some Uber equipment on my character or be able to visit the Uber zones in the game.  I have played for 2 years and my best equipment is what I can buy.<br />
<br />
Your Guild has worked hard and you yourself will probably always have better equipment than I can ever hope even with PoP in the game.  Your guild is probably held in High regard just as all the Uber guilds on my Server are (although if your attitude about us Ghimps is the attitude of your guild, maybe not).  I don't see your gripe.  The little guys actually gets to take part in the full game and your still Uber and will still be able to handle all the encounters better than us little peeps.  You will still manage to have as a guild better equipment than I do because what you can do with 20 peeps it will take me 60.  Alot better odds of winning the roll there I think.<br />
<br />
And Dangoon in response to the smaller guilds KSing a Raid.  It works both ways with the Advantage going to the Uber guild.  I was over at a friends house visiting while he was doing a raid of some type.  I heard him start to cuss and asked Why.  Apparently one of the top 10 guilds on my server came in, ran directly across the raid he was in and killed the boss mob.  The only response he got was &quot;You can't claim him and we got there first so tough luck.&quot;  Is this kinda what you said the little guilds were doing.   Maybe they also suffered from the same Justice as was given my friends raid and decided to do a little pay back in the only way they could being a smaller (Gimp) guild.<br />
<br />
Enjoy what you have accomplished knowing that it was alot harder for you.  That is something you can take pride in.  Enjoy what your guild can accomplish even now compared to what the smaller guilds can.  Enjoy the game and quit putting the little peeps out there down.  Your still Uber and most of us are still not and that is probably the way it will always be.  I expect it will be a long time if ever I will ever see Tier 3 and those in Uber guilds are already there.  Can't see to much competition at the top from where I am standing.<br />

Plus the fact that your guild is like maybe number 3 on server, not close to being first.  Sounds like your just upset you have to share VT now.   Sorry to bring server-guild stuff to ranger board heh, just wanted to clear some things up :P<br />

and btw, i dunno what your smoking wih PoP gimping content, when you guys killed emp for the first time like 2 or 3weeks ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manr</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well another thing that happens is gimp guilds have gimp players too that train existing raids on purpose then move in to finish the mob off and other crap. People that could never get into a good guild cause of the kind of person they are. <br />
<br />
Worse thing I saw was Guild A killing AOW, gimp guild trains them with AOW right as Guild A kills idol and trains them 3 more times with giants during the fight. Guild A finally wipes out to the trains (4 total) when AOW is at 1% health. Gimp Guild moves in and finishes it off. This was all right in front of a Guide that was visible and the person training was the guild leader of gimp guild and knew the guide was there. <br />
<br />
He got to keep the loot and was suspended for 3 days only.. Got to love it.<br />
<br />
What Dangoon forgets is that their great guild had gone in to Kael to kill AoW while it was not their turn in the rotation.  A rotation that is long standing between the two guilds and other two guilds.  And who's turn it was was not even in question.<br />
<br />
Here is a guild with twice the numbers of our guild, breaking an agreement and then crying when the gimp guild is upset.<br />
<br />
To me it's a matter of having access to spawns.  If I don't have access to spawns, say because another guild monopolizes them, then there is no reason to play.  In which case suspentions or bans don't matter.  Even if I was banned, at least I stood up for my guild instead of letting the other guild bully us.<br />
<br />
Dangoon is also in the guild that repeatedly refused and still refuses to rotate any spawns in Ssra, including Emperor.  We finally had to join with another guild to beat their huge numbers early enough in the day to kill the Emperor.<br />

<br />
Total BS and you know it. The *only* reason we havent been able to attempt and kill Emp before now is because your zerg guild (with probably twice the active members than ours, and certainly the largest guild on the server) doesn't want to play nice and let others have a chance. Which is your perogative.<br />
<br />
Our 'gimp' guild in concert with another guild (first time we've ever tried that) managed to kill Emp first time, with *less* numbers than you're zerg guild, which i'm 99% sure did not kill him on your first attempt. It even seems you wont even engage Emp without 70 online (else you would have engaged him before we got there that same day).<br />
<br />
We only lack the manpower if (as it seems you do) you consider Zerging every mob to be the route to victory.  Competition is harsh isn't it.<br />
<br />
Apologies again to all here totally uninterested in this. And yes J'horra the incident with AoW was exactly that. They just decided to break the rotation one week. Just so happens that it was our turn and we're the smallest guild capable of killing AoW on Povar (currently).</div></div><hr />

Not to mention all the crap you pull daily.  You are untrustworthy...noone wants to enter into a rotation with you.  BoL only joined up with you cuz they are desperate...and the alliance you two made makes you seem even more desperate.<br />

It's an important and needed divider which gives us the different guild &quot;tiers&quot;. I doubt the guilds that are doing AoW want the higher end guilds to start killing it again &amp; those guilds going into VT want the guild who has progressed out of it to go back in. Having higher end content available to the majority of guilds, including those who can't really complete the encounters, only causes more bottlenecks by not dividing raiding guilds into different zones. While there's nothing wrong with competition amongst guilds, i doubt anyone is pleased to log in &amp; find nothing up to kill at their raid level. This progression fundamentally trickles down all the way to unguilded players &amp; it can be a really bad thing for everyone when it's reversed. It behooves everyone to have guilds doing things they should be -vs- going backwards or even not raiding which then fills xp zones, quest mobs, etc.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, doing encounters &amp; quests the hard way is it's own reward &amp; it's a good thing when SoE tones them down after an expansion (as they always have) to allow more casual players to get into them. When SoE develops new content it's almost always far more difficult initially &amp; that's the fun part where you can excecise your expertise in defeating encounters.<br />

I couldn't agree more with you on this, but the FACT is that there are 4 guilds on the SAME level as the original poster's guild. They can sugar coat things and make it seem like they are the high and mighty of Povar, but they are not. <br />
<br />
The other guilds that are at the emp level don't want to fight and race to him every single time. We have tried to agree and rotate the mobs just like we do on AoW and Tunare, but since THEY feel we aren't capable they will not. For them to assume that us and the other &quot;gimp&quot; guild, as they put it, can't kill emp alone is rediculous. Their leader has clearly said to one of our officers that they don't want competition in VT. <br />

<br />
This entire thread comes down to one thing: why do you care how other people pull off encounters?  How about you just shut up and do the encounters your way, and let other people play the game the way they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kivorn I take solace in knowing that one day a GM will witness exactly what happened since your guildmates pull exactly this kind of stunt constantly. Not that you were there or anything, so just drive through. What's sad is that an emperor equipped guild would not only try to block but go as far as to train and gimp kill a small Velius oriented guild working on dozekar. Talking about bottomfeeding.</div></div><hr />

You all on Povar should learn to share a little more. There's plenty of content to go around.

<br />
Uv- Do you realize that your guildleader made it a habit to threaten our people? (As in, I will come beat you up in real life crap) Not to mention, the repeated training on our raids. (The AoW thing was not an isolated incident, in fact the rotation was broken cause of other delibrate trains) Not to mention your delibrate sabotage of certain spawns like cursed, which has screwed over more then just our guild. Would you want to enter friendly agreements on rotations with someone who calls you the foulest names, trains you, then asks to be friends? And this is before any previous agreements had been broken like at the infamous AoW incident. I<br />
<br />
Lal- Funny thing was, there was an agreement just reached between our guildleaders to let your own guild have a try at Emp without having to race us. Your guild broke it. I dunno why, cause you could have had all the loot for yourself. (and not next month either but like next week) <br />
<br />
I guess in an attempt to make this spat fest have some relavance to non Povar people, this thread goes to show what happens when common decency breaks down on a server. Our server used to be pretty civilized, but constant threats, trash talking, delibrate trains, have encourgaged a cut throat atmosphere which is not fun to play on. Delibrate training, spawn blowing, and flaming have replaced any sort of cooperation or mutual respect. On one hand I want the play to be civilized, on the other hand, I don't want to enter deals solely to cease harassement of my guild in the forms of trains and tells which shouldn't occur in the first place. I suppose it can continue till more people get suspended. That will be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corean</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the game itself has progressed.   People no longer have to go through the rite of passage the old-timers did.  Someone mentioned something 'bout not having to farm PoF for Thorny Vine armor anymore.  With all these expansions, a lot of people are skipping the old natural progression.  No longer do you have to go through the same zones in order to advance the way older guilds did.  It not only has happened with PoP, but also with every other expansions.  There are many empty zones in older expansions because of that.  Are you going to tell people to go back and experience them first?<br />
<br />
No one has any right to tell any other guild to do it the way they did just like how nobody has any right to tell anyone to go exp in certain zones.  We can be reminiscent of the good 'ol days, but it does not mean we can force others to play the way we want them to.  Unless, of course, if you can block their progression by not giving them a chance to go through a bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

That your leadership refused any new rotations before any of the more recent nastiness with training and spawn disruptions?    That your guild leadership out of SPITE broke an established rotation?  <br />
<br />
The cooperation and mutual respect you're looking for has to start somewhere.      <br />
<br />
What is completely mentally handicapped about all of this is that ROTATIONS WORK.    They have worked wonderfully well for all the guilds involved with them on povar as far as tunare/AOW/NTOV goes.   So ask your leadership why they won't rotate,  I know my guild will rotate amenably on cursed and emp.  We,  unlike others, have never broken an established rotation.<br />
<br />
It's sad when you have a small &quot;gimp&quot; guild spend SIX WEEKS STRAIGHT of their lives farming emp keys and ore,  only to be told by a larger guild &quot;No,  you can't do emp,  you have to EARN that right and we're not going to share&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's no point playing if you can't do the content you're ready for and capable of doing.  <br />
<br />
There is also zero reason to not work with other guilds who are ready for said content as far as rotations go.   The only reason not to is pure unadulterated greed.<br />
<br />
Oh,  and Aladil,  the guild I'm currently in was slightly ahead of the guild you are in not so very long ago...  You should know I know better than the bs you started this post with...  The only reason the situations are somewhat reversed right now (mainly due to sheer numbers/playerbase) is your guild had a merger while my current guild had a couple of splits with large numbers of people leaving to start different guilds...<br />

Every single new expansion in EQs history has caused prior expansions to be 'gimped' as people's toons get new and amazing powers.  The very thing you're complaining about, people now being in competition with you, is true for yourself and other guilds up the chain.  There's new places ready for you to excel at and lead ahed of others (elemental planes for example), the baseline has just moved and as yet you obviously haven't clued in you're meant to move ahead with it.<br />
<br />
On CT its FFA except for a few contested top-end encounters.  NToV rotation? I don't think so.  AoW? It's a 20 person encounter now, a far cry from the 50-100 needed in Velious days; 20 people is less than 1/2 top tier guilds regular raid size so they're done purely in an opportunistic manner, heck pick-up group AoW slayings occur now too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerDave</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, is this kind of garbage typical of high end guild relations in general, or is it just these two groups on Povar? I just can't believe people actually monopolize spawns like that in order to shut others out so they can claim to be the &quot;most advanced&quot; guild on the server. <br />
<br />
If you're looking for a sense of personal satisfaction from being &quot;the best&quot;, but you have to cheat to win, the victory is meaningless anyway. Secondly, if the respect and admiration of other players is your goal, then it seems to me that being a jerk is somewhat counter-productive. No one is going to care how &quot;uber&quot; your guild is if they all think you're greedy, self-serving shmucks.<br />
<br />
Lastly, and most importantly, does anyone actually believe that this stuff really matters? It's just a game. People who don't realize that remind me of the &quot;star athletes&quot; in some backwater high school, who imagine that their ability to throw a baseball better than anyone in the &quot;tri-county area&quot; actually makes them something special. Don't get me wrong - I have my share of high school sports stories, and I understand and share the sense of accomplishment that comes from succeeding at some challenging aspect of a game, whether it's EQ or baseball, but I don't derive my sense of self-worth from it, and I don't delude myself into thinking that it matters even the tiniest bit in the real world. <br />
<br />
Look, I know this is going to sound preachy, but I'll give you an example: I was really looking forward to playing EQ last Thursday. I was *this* close to levelling up and getting all the new spells I'd been waiting for, but my 10 year-old niece wanted me to come see her basketball game. I went to the game and watched her beam with pride when she scored a couple of baskets. She ran up and gave me a hug after the game and talked about it for a good ten minutes. Sure, I would have enjoyed playing EQ more than watching a bunch of ten-year-olds chasing a basketball all over the court, but guess which one gave me a greater sense of happiness and satisfaction, and which memory will matter more in ten or twenty years. <br />
<br />
Besides, I just played EQ when I got home later that night!  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind Dniwkwak</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's inevitable that encounters from previous expansions will become easier as more expansions are released - The best weapons from classic EQ was what, Spined Dragon Claws (10/21) or Short Sword of the Ykesha (8/24) or something. Then Kunark came along and then there were weapons that were 10/25, 10/22, etc. Encounters like Vox and Nagafen became easier - this happens with all expanions, it's not something you really prevent.<br />
<br />
Tactics are still important, though. Look at the pick-up Naggy raids. Even with these 10/17 weapons coming out they STILL fail because people don't listen and/or use the right tactics. If you think that because people are able to kill things an expansion or two old with less people (because better items/abilities are coming out, i.e. Luclin and POP) yet it took you some time to master then no offense but you're a retard. Spoilers are all over the place, there are new abilities, and new equipment which will greatly enhance any raid force. <br />
<br />
This thread is nothing but a jealousy post. &quot;Oh no, the gimp crappy guilds are killing stuff WE mastered...but it's not the new items/abilities fault, it's THEIRS, damn suxx0r n00bz!&quot;<br />

<br />
In any case, give me a tell in game and we can work on something perhaps. We shouldn't have this discussion on a EQ ranger board. But we don't take kindly to threats, trains, and trash talk that was always common from your guild. That is the main reason we haven't wanted to rotate.  In any case give me a tell and perhaps we can start a peace process.<br />
<br />
From our point of  view, the attitude from your guild lead to the break down in rotations, from yours, its the break down in rotations that lead to the attitude, in either case its something that needs to change. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, no matter what server politics are, intentional trains and harassment are not justified. Period.  If you think your guild is justified using harassment tactics simply cause you lost so many people thats its hard for you to raid now, you are wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khross</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, while the original post may not be in the best of tones, the poster does have a point.  Planes of Power seriously altered the level of player skill needed to progress through the game.  Encounters in Luclin and Velious have become beyond trivial, and approaching the point of ludicrously easy.  Five more levels, new spells, and easier to gain experience, has seriously altered the competency level needed to accomplish several things in the game, and thus, changes the dynamic.<br />
<br />
Dealing with competition is one thing, but when 2 weeks of experience grinds allows a guild to progress from barely able to kill Vindi to dropping everything in NToV except for Vulak, taking our faction bosses, and clearing Sleeper's Tomb, Itraer Vius, most anything in Ssra, there is an issue to be had with the balance aspect of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you're smart, you're farming 1 groupable kills with loot superior to any of those encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khross did a better job of summing up what my example was supposed to show than i did:<br />
The original post complains that PoP allows guilds the chance to hit bigger targets than previously possible. My addition was that the matter seemed to work both ways, that it was also allowing smaller groups of better equipped people to easily nail targets that take other guilds a raid party.<br />
As I said in my original post, I don't think this situation is unique to PoP, both scenarios seem to occur with every release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, the game is essentially over at this point. PoP just blows the lid off of everything that went before. We have been given everything we said we wanted...ease of play, ease of exp, ease of CR, ease of travel, ridiculous mana regen, outrageous weapons and armor, insane spells like CoD, and more levels. Of course it trivializes 90% of the game, thats the whole point.<br />
<br />
 Then the trials took all the people who were already pretty powerful and gave them priviledged access to even more incredible exp gain, items, and spells, thus allowing them to jump even FURTHER ahead of the regular folks, who were spending their time shouting LFG! in tier 1 and becoming frustrated and angry at the trials.<br />
<br />
Yknow, we are a smaller guild just gearing up in HoT. We are talking about hitting Velious content. It's going to take us a lot of work, and a large raid force, and practice, to drop mobs that can now be single grouped by 65's. Will we lose spawns to top end tier2/3/4 guilds who slice through Velious content like hot knives through butter just to gear their alts? You bet. Will it suck? Yep. But we are going to persevere anyways, because it's still an accomplishment for us to do stuff like that.<br />
<br />
The Vision is dead. The game is pretty much over. They know it, and don't really give a crap. PoP is like a huge party thrown at the end of world. It's too much, its too wild, it breaks the rules, its not balanced...and it doesn't matter. And yes, its fun. But its not sustainable. I could be 65 now if I wanted to. But I dont want to...because there is no place to go after that, really.<br />
<br />
The game will go on for quite a while. We plan on going ahead and doing what we want to, and having fun at it. There will be newbies, there will be achievements, there will raids and trains, sniping and comradeship, emnity and frendship, there will be new zones...it will all go on. But, I think that when we look back at the lifespan of the game, it will be seen that the game started it's downward arc to retirement with PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">undeniabletruth</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khross, youre right in some respects, unfortunatly the initial poster didnt quite fill you in on some of the details for this specific case.  The Initial post is really very funny on many levels - there is certainly raw humor if you dont know the details, but if you do, I think it makes it much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Here are just some of the details:<br />
1) The initial posters guild never killed the emp until long after pop was out (in fact their 1st successful attempt was 3 weeks ago)...ironic, isnt it that he is complaining about pop trivializing content when his guild needed it to progress to the end of sol ?<br />
2) His guild was regularly wiping to AL with 60+ people not 3-4 months ago.<br />
3) Of the &quot;tier 2&quot; guilds on povar (i.e. guilds who arent named triton or rising ascension), his guild enjoys 1 advantage - early numbers.<br />
4) This whole incident was caused by the fact that the initial posters guild refused to share any spawns in ssra with the other guilds on their level - they felt it was in their advantage to just kill everything before anyone else got home from work &amp; then call them &quot;gimps&quot; &amp; &quot;lesser guilds&quot; in /ooc in ssra.  For most people, its not that hard to share, but for some reason they are incapable - a guild made up of 120 people who grew up without brothers or sisters ? I dunno.<br />
5) Are on exactly the same level as the other 2 guilds involved in PoP.<br />
6) His guild raids with approximatly twice the number of people as the other 2 guilds involved...combined!  <br />
7) Trained the 2 guilds that teamed up while they preped in the corner of the emp room in an attempt to force them into a coffin recovery so they could then take the emp - maturity at its finest.<br />
8) Already had 70+ people in ssra at the time the 2 guilds went up to kill emp, but they were too busy killing the HP at the time (they had also just killed cursed), because they enjoy monopolizing content.<br />
9) Post here &amp; lead people to believe that the emp was &quot;zerged&quot; by the 2 guilds.  If killing emp on 1st attempt ever with 70ish people (from 2 guilds that never worked together before...hell, frankly, they dont even like eachother lol), while keeping 1 mt alive the entire fight &amp; going through 3 rampage tanks is &quot;zerg&quot;, well I guess uhm whatever.<br />
<br />
All in all, I give this thread 2 thumbs up for reading enjoyment.  It has it everything you could hope for - irony, comedy, drama &amp; suspense!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll send you a tell in game,  although it's likely not much will come of it.  From what I can tell talking to your GL and another officer there isn't any interest in smoothing things out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly BoL seemed quite content to do the HP that afternoon. They were ready for FU to try the Emperor again later that night. The so called victim guild, FU, decided to steam roll BoL at the HP. BoL immediately got on the horn to other guilds (the guild I am in first but we rejected them preferring to remain detached from the events) in order to teach FU a lesson. They found a taker in Stoic. They joined forces and killed them Emperor both for the first time. <br />
<br />
And as noted, once FU realized that by steam rolling BoL to the HP they had ****ed up and left the door open, FU had the class and dignity to train BoL/Stoic in the Emperor room. Bravo. Nice show.<br />
<br />
And now the bitching commences. Dudes, get a grip. Yes, the level increase is a cause for other guilds to make great strides way faster than they would have normally to advance. But then again, Im curious as to why this originated from a guild that also benefited tremendously from this?<br />
<br />
Pardon my bluntness but the guild(s) in question here are not on the cutting edge of EQ by doing the Emperor 9+ months after he first dropped on our server. The guild in question who is crying about the levels lessening the gap but yet they did not accomplish the feat of killing the Emperor until 2 weeks ago. One would assume they profited from the extra 9 months to aa, the extra 5 levels, the ability to slow the Emperor 40%, and the fact that the Emperor now has about 3 times less hps. So it doesnt seem right them crying foul.<br />
<br />
Come down off the mountain Moses. <br />
<br />
Please, face it, the original poster was in a guild that thought they could have their cake and eat it as well, and now that others teamed up and got fed up with their crap, they bit back and he cant handle it. Boo Hoo Hoo.<br />
<br />
Either go back to killing Vindi happily and contently with not much competition, or just ****, play the game, and suck it up<br />

  To the people from forces that think you are all so much greater than us for being able to kill the emp without all the upgrades from PoP let me ask you this. When was your first emp kill. Wait a sec it was a few weeks ago. That seems to be after PoP was released and everyone was 65. <br />

I would also like to thank you for the lovely train that you hit us with when we were about to start. Shows your true character. <br />

<br />
-  When I said Gimp Guild, I was refered to guilds that has to train other guilds already doing a mob,  delay spawns by killing a task master, or doing other gimp things cause they dont have enough people online to do a mob and some other guild is about to do.  I in no way meant small guilds or anything else.. just people that act like a gimp and do things they should be banned for.   <br />
<br />
It takes a gimp guild to have their own guild leader suspended for training another guild in front of a game master over and over until he wipes the other guild then kill the mob a 1% health and loot.  And finally to brag about how well he trained afterwards.<br />
<br />
- You are not being steam rolled if you have very few people in a zone and are just messing around waiting for more to log in.  If you had enough to begin with you would be doing the mob instead of waiting around.  Sending in a few groups to an area near a boss mob doesn't count as doing it either.  Reminds me of one guild that has one group in srra killing 1 taskmaster every 30 minutes to prevent any guild from killing cursed in hopes that they will have more than 20 log in that day (their normal average online).</div></div><hr />

So, how about this, rangers et al from the guilds involved on Povar - take it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoL was there to try Cursed, and FU come in with force, so BoL yeilded and moved to farm the mines while we waited for some other ssra mobs to pop.<br />
<br />
While they FAILED on Cursed, we saw HP pop, so we evac (about 45 members by now) to zone, and as we are killing up to HP, FU decides to leave Cursed and steamroll us again.<br />
<br />
BoL just doesnt want to argue over spawns we just go for the mob that had been up... Emperor.  We call in another guild (cause well, we aint tried it before).<br />
<br />
While this is happening, FU gets down to it and kills HP and Cursed, and then hurries up to Emperor and trains the raid (joint raid BoL + Stoic).<br />
<br />
We defeat the train, defeat Emp (both guilds first attempt) and listen to threats from FU.<br />
<br />
And while we are doing raid, we find out FU had &quot;allowed&quot; us into the rotation... by assigning us the same week as Stoic.  (and prolly IL too)<br />
<br />
Thanks FU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did NOT train you...you trained yourselves when you pulled.  Its not our fault you dont understand the encounter.  <br />
<br />
You did NOT defeat the train...you wiped out and rezed.<br />
<br />
Once you FINALLY had 100 people there you managed to kill emp.  <br />
<br />
And your leaders/officers were offered the attempt at Emp before you tried...they knew this and did not tell you.  <br />
<br />
All this crap about you &quot;wanting rotations on emp&quot; is bullcrap becuz you were offered and you basically threw it in our face.<br />
<br />
No, Stoic was not offered...cuz they have proven time and time again they cannot be trusted in rotations in a world of civilized people.<br />
<br />
And you should be embaressed that you would join forces with such types of people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this week while we were trying to do the other named in Ssra, you guys kept steamrolling us?   All the while leaving Emperor up.  True? yes definately.<br />
<br />
If you guys wanna go and comb the world for mobs, thats fine.  If you wanna steamroll us whereever we are massing, thats fine. But dont be so surprised when we leave you to those other mobs and take Emperor.<br />
<br />
Trained us?  Stoic?  Doesnt really matter.  You should be congratulating us on a fine raid that you guys refused to undertake.  And now figure out  rotation for next week +.   And we need to work out a VT schedule imo.<br />

Cause  one more Emp kill, and we are there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">undeniabletruth</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">point 1 - I never realized that part of the emporer encounter was having felrom &amp; guanna &amp; another fu monk &amp; necro zone into emp prep room while being followed by imperial guards &amp; run right up to blood &amp; agro him + the other 8 mobs in the room.<br />
<br />
I wonder what guilds on other servers do to combat that.<br />
<br />
Stoic+bol did not train themselves when they pulled because they didnt pull when that train happened.  FU trained them - period.<br />
<br />
point 2 - stoic+bol killed emp with 70ish people, not 80, certainly not 90.  There were never more than 90 stoic+bol in the zone combined &amp; many did not have completed emp keys.<br />
<br />
point 3 - When you steamroll people on every mob in any zone, you can hardly expect to have much cooperation from anyone.  People have different RL commitments, some live in time zones more conducive to racing to mobs than others, some have careers that prevent them from being online 10 minutes after patches are over.  Calling them &quot;gimps&quot; &amp; &quot;lesser guilds&quot;  in /ooc &amp; msg boards, claiming superiority solely due to having numbers early in the day, spamming /ooc while people fail to mobs, etc does not exactly paint you guys in very high regards.  People play this game to be challenged, the guilds you are dealing with have reach the point where the next mob for them is the emp/vt &amp; others mobs like cursed.  Preventing them from ever taking a shot at those mobs because you enjoy early time advantage causes hard feelings &amp; creates situtations where unlikely alliances can &amp; will happen.  Sharing is not hard, you should try it some time, it makes the game much more enjoyable for everyone involved.<br />
<br />
In any event, the initial posters claims about pop giving stoic+bol any advantage over fu on the emp is laughable since you guys didnt kill him till long after pop as well &amp; everyone who has read this thead knows it, including you.</div></div><hr />

Its called Attrition.  It always wins.  And laos you misunderstand what zerging is.  Its an online army...not some stupid mass of people.  Play DAoC for a bit and you will udnerstand...the word zerging gets thrown around a lot in that game....its massive 100-200+ battles.  Zerging is simply an online army, it seems a lot more chaotic than it is most of the time simply because the artificial world quite frankly sucks...that and every person doesn't want to be in an army.  Attrition is a valid tactic...just because you don't like it doesn't make it any less valid or useful.  Attirtion wins every war in history...who ever can last the longest in the war by throwing more people and more technology will win.</div></div><hr />

So for you smart asses making comments **** about what you &quot;think&quot; you know and maybe ASK what he meant rather then judge him you retards), but we worked damn hard and kept the progression moving to become better. With POP abilities it's absolutely ridiculous how easily guilds who couldn't do NTov are now capable of AoW... Now if that still doesn't make sense to you, I can recommend a good elementary school for you and maybe in 6 years... it'll make sense.<br />
<br />
Edit:  After reading the rest it's funny Manr posted. I have about 150 screen shots of this ass training me and other people. I remember when they ran into AL right after us cause they couldn't defeat the crypt guards themselves and trained us. The guide made them get out.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until PoP that these other guilds that were 3-6 months behind us in progression caught up per say. They say we were even... we'll pre-pop who had killed hp, cursed, al, etc? We were geared up for emp with keys way before PoP and only waited to attempt him because people were more insterested in making levels/exp/etc which is understandable.<br />
<br />
And I was at one point in The gimp master's guild (Manr)... this guy boots people for no reason, openly admits to training, ks'ing, steamrolling in guildchat, and is pretty much the most hated person still playing on Povar. Sorta funny how he tries to be a saint... /hug Manr ya ****ing fag!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcwolf</div><div class="date">01-31-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with you about PoP screwing over guilds that have worked hard.  If you guys really pushed, you could do alot more things than you are currently doing.  Mithaniel Marr, Saryrn, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek are all encounters that I think FU could come out of victorious if that is where your efforts were focused.<br />
<br />
The emperor is easy now with PoP out, no doubt.  Correct me if I am wrong though, but I don't believe that FU killed him before PoP either?  There is no question in my mind that FU can kill more mobs than any guilds on Povar except Triton and RA.  Getting pissy over an encounter that has been as trivialized as the emperor isn't going to do anything to help keep you ahead of these other guilds.<br />
<br />
PoP as been great for us in Triton.  If anything, it has increased the gap between us and the rest of the server, pretty dramatically too as I see it.  I think there are opportunities for FU to do the same and get more of a leg up on some other guilds.  I would think your efforts would be better spent on VT and some of the Pop encounters than on the emperor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are seeing more people in the top end zone, good, it means the game is finally starting to cater to the majority rather than the minority. Outside of legends we all pay the same subscription fee and are therefore each of us untitled to be catered in the same respect.<br />
<br />
Those that feel they deserve special zones set asside for them because of the manner in which they play the game pay no more money than anybody else, and have simply lost sight of the fact that their status in game isn't real and carries no weight with real world considerations such as subscriptions.<br />
<br />
You're in an uber guild and feel you deserve special recognition? Walk into your nearest bar, walk up to an attractive man or woman (depending on your gender/persuation), and for your openning chat-up line tell them &quot;hey, I'm in an uber guild and am one of the best equipped Rangers on my server&quot;... it'll give you some perspective as to how significant your achievement is and the respect it's earned you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FU has indeed has a rep as a zerg guild, they did even back when i was in it, almost 2 years ago or whenever it was.<br />
<br />
they did indeed kill emp for the first time not more than a couple/few weeks ago (forgive me for not having the exact date) and i can recall 2 failed attempts from conversations with a friend from it.<br />
<br />
i know, from being an officer in stoic, it has never, not once, ever, broken a rotation its been involved in..aow, ntov(which FU has since moved on from), and tunare being the only mobs FU has agreed to rotate on.<br />
<br />
and lastly, it was stoics turn in the agreed upon rotation when FU decided they didnt want to honor it, and thats when the training happened.<br />
<br />
my statement about eqvault was just that, i miss the old days of eqvault, this thread reminded me of them ;p<br />
<br />
nowhere did i ever claim &quot;i have spoke, argument done&quot;, nor did i try to end anything, merely pointed out 4 things that caused me great ammusement, and then mentioned how i missed eqvault</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your own guild has blown spawns in it's time and jumped in on mobs that you knew you couldn't handle.<br />
<br />
Why you think it's so &quot;leet&quot; to use zerg as an insult, is beyond me, because if the mob is dead at the end of the day, guess what? The mob is dead. If YOU are dead because you tried to beat the Emp with 2 bards and a druid for fear of &quot;zerging&quot; then You are still the loser at the end.<br />
<br />
Stoic is exceptionally far from being the most noble and honorable of guilds out there.<br />

The moderators really should lock this mockery of a thread because it's mostly petty squabbling.<br />

Sounds like it sucks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm totally neutral in this little argument, but I have to say.. I agree. Zerging is a tactic. It may not be the most creative, challenging, or smiled upon, but it still gets stuff killed. Killing stuff is the whole point of this game, so I really couldn't give half a rat's ass how somebody does it. That said, I prefer doing stuff with less people because it shows a greater degree of skill, but I really don't see how zerging can be used as an insult. How somebody else plays the game is their business. It's not my call to insult how they do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
never said stoic hasnt messed with spawns, or done underhanded things, no guild is pristine in the high end. what i said, was that stoic has actively pursued rotations, and has *never* messed with any established rotation we've been a part in...(i.e., killing a rotation mob outside of our agreed upon rotation) dont see why its so hard to grasp that.<br />
<br />
capable is in the eye of the beholder btw, id put my money on stoic over FU in any given encounter...its all about getting the chance to engage the mobs, and larger guilds have an advantage in that they can engage mobs earlier. (not a complaint, just a fact ;p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynebow</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi, i'm not a ranger.. i'm a Stoic. i'm not here to flame but to say one thing...ok maybe a few things.<br />
<br />
Emp is taking a dirt nap...to noone BUT Stoic, we cant do it on our own? think again, we just did.<br />
<br />
Manr may not be the most angelic, or the nicest guy on the server, but he's ours so back off him plz.<br />
<br />
i know most of the povar players who have been slinging some dirt on here, shame shame guys.  really not the place for it, but heck since u started it here may as well end it here right? and quickly please. <br />
<br />
Forces Unknown has finally agreed to a rotation, this was our turn at rotation, and we have done what we set out to do... i hope the next guild in rotation has as easy of a job of emp as we did, good luck you guys.<br />
<br />
personally i am pretty darned proud to have done Emp with BoL, no we (Stoic, BoL) arent the tops on the server, Triton and RA handle the extreme high end of Povar... but considering neither guild had ever done anything with each other before it was alot of fun to do something together for the common goal. a nice break from always raiding with the same people and knowing exactly what to expect when the S*** hits the fan.  imo everyone should try it at least once...talk about learning a new respect for people ;) <br />
<br />
as for the original poster, i havent met you...wish i had, maybe then i could understand what your trying to say.  your upset because of competition for spawns? you think guilds with less numbers than yours dont deserve to be doing what you are doing? what?   anyway, it was my intention to try to bring a little peace out of the chaos...<br />
<br />
so, thank you forces, i know it must have been difficult to resist the temptation of the emp for the sake of rotation ;) <br />
<br />
perhaps if you would commit to rotations on other spawns with us and the other guilds of our (and i mean FU, Stoic, BoL, UL, IL....) stature you will find that competition to be much less. after all why kill aow every spawn..gets boring, so kill him one week, tunare the next, ntov the next emp the next, keep it changing up with zero competition and there is harmony ;) (i use these mobs/zones as examples only, unfortunately i am still a total n00b in higher end content those were just the first to come to mind.)<br />
<br />
<br />
ok im long winded but i think i said all i had intended to and more.<br />

<br />
You are also oblivious if you think your guild hasn't trained us on occasion, cause it happens, in fact at that emporer some training was attempted.<br />
<br />
Stop the whining, learn to share, and for the love of god let this thread die.  There are plenty of spawns for all of us.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think it is screwing &quot;hard working&quot; guilds over? are you that upset that a casual game can now experince what you have done for along time probably now? I think you might be just upset and forgot you were a n00b too.<br />
<br />
don't forget everyone was a n00b... they all get better (sometimes) and everything respawns so share</div></div><hr />
