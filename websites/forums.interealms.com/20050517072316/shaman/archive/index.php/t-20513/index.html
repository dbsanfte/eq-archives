I personally recommend ati 9600's Pro's or XT's for most people who dont want to go all out on video cards when I build their PC's. For you Nivida types, i've seen 5600's as low as 117.00 on both newegg and zipzoomfly.com. I would expect a ati 9200 to work fine for EQ as well and they clock in around 72.00.<br />
<br />
I'm an ati fan myself, never had any problems playing EQ with my 8500, my 9700 pro or my 9800 pro AiW. Although most of my friends who play EQ say they get decent frame rates with there nvidia 5200's with just minor lag on raids.</div></div><hr />

Well before you go out and go ape crazy buying stuff couple things to note.  Your Mobo is gonna be a 440bx at best which is agp 1x which restricts you from installing the 8x vid cards avaiable now (not that 8x makes a lick of difference now its just 8x cards wont work in 1x slots).  Your system is a bit to slow to really take advantage of 150 bucks of vid card right now.  Thats ok if you were using a riva going to a g3 even a g2 will be a sizable improvement.  Something you can find probably easily still is a g4mx440 just make sure its a 4x one.  <br />
<br />
If all you have is a pci slot and no agp just look for the g4mx or g2 line cards and you'll be fine.  Normally I'd rec  the 150 dollar range myself for most modern gaming but that would send your particular system into a chain reaction of upgrades.<br />
<br />
PS also the ati suggestions are good however i've found at times going from an nvidia to an ati or vice versa card can make older installs of windows break particularly the 9x series and involves some tinkering.  In your case the least hassle would def be going with an nvidia in the sub 100 range.  However your gonna want to think about upgrading that computer in the near (year or so just due to age and upgrades of games we play like now)  future, even the cheapest computer nowadays with a decent vidcard tossed in will floor your old machine.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I was saying..the 440bx boards will actually work with up to agp4x they themselves only support 1x but the card will actually work, as opposed to an 8x card which is sloted differently and for voltage reasons would not even post in a 1x board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, um, how do I tell if I have a pci slot or agp slot?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Right now the best bang for you buck is a ATI radeon 9600 or higher.<br />
<br />
ATI's implimentation of Direct x9 application is significantly superior then Nvidia right now and this is coming from a die hard Nvidia fan. Im seriously considering getting one cause all these new games, including EQ now, make use of the directx 9 architecture. You can get some nice cheap cards off www.pricewatch.com <br />
<br />
Though i would say the next round of Nvidia chips coming out will focus on getting back in the saddle with DX9 and they are only a few months away if i remember right, so maybe you just wanna buy a cheapo ATI for now then move up to a big one in a few months.<br />
<br />
Though from how old your last card is, im assuming you dont wanna get too crazy in price, so many you should grab like a 9700 pro from ATI or something. That should last you for quite a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
BTW, i recommend against the Nvidia MX serious. Basicly its the name of a big card with so many limitations on it that you dont even wanna waste your money. I mean you CAN pick up a GF2MX for around 40-50 bucks and still have a nice card, but you can do much better for just a lil more money.<br />
<br />
Here, check this out<br />
<br />
On pricewatch for http://www.pricewatch.com/1/37/5591-1.htm<br />
<br />
100ish bucks for a hell of a card.<br />
<br />
I encourage yout o read the feedback sections and select a company that has minimal or trivial negitive feedback.<br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
look at the slot that your video card is in. If color of the slot is brown then you have agp - if it is white then you have a pci slot.<br />
<br />
btw what chmodux said is good advice. The prices on those cards are dirt cheap if you get them from a local computer shop (not a retalier). You don't want to drop a ton into it as a computer upgrade is going to be inevitable for you.</div></div><hr />

he doesnt have a agp slot that can take it. Although I agree with you- I recently installed a 9600 in a budget gaming computer for a family member. Use a 9700p myself.</div></div><hr />

The slot is brown so I have agp. Curious, all the<br />
other slots are white. I'll take your advice and stick<br />
with an NVidia to simplify the upgrade. The only <br />
other upgrading I've done has been adding more<br />
memory, a split (ergo) keyboard, and flatscreen LCD<br />
monitor. None of these required anything more then<br />
plug and play. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to buy a new one for a while now, it's<br />
just not in the budget. I just want to be able to<br />
play EQ again. <br />

agp 1x not an 8x. How do I determine this?<br />

that?</div></div><hr />

For the rest of you, the new generation of graphics cards will be coming out in the middle of april.   They will be, suposedly, over 20% faster then what is out right now (9800xt/5950ultra).  I cant wait !   :eek:  :D <br />

So, I got rid of my old 16 mb NVidia card and got this 64mb Radeon. <br />
According to the manual, you swap the cards first, then boot up and<br />
install the driver software. After swapping the cards, the CD drive wouldn't<br />
open and the graphics were on the lowest resolution setting. Brought up<br />
the Display window, went to Settings, but the slider won't budge. <br />
<br />
So, back to my original card, rebooted, the display is normal again. I<br />
was able to load the driver cd up, and installed Dx9. It wouldn't linstall<br />
the Radeon driver, complaining it can't find the hardware. Ok, fine. I shut<br />
down, swap back to the Radeon card, and try again. While booting up<br />
my CD drive kept opening. <br />
<br />
I've rebooted several times on each card since then, the CD drive just<br />
will not stay closed. I've tried another CD, no CD, nothing helps. <br />
<br />
What should I do now?</div></div><hr />

What should I do now?<br />
<br />
This is why I recommended to sticking to same brand.  A lowly lvl 65 shaman by night...a 3 year computer tech for a small computer shop with gobs of big gaudy experience otherwise thats not terribly important now by day.  Point is you've a) likely got an old install of windows b) your old vid driver is conflicting with your new one now...this can particularly true of the radeon driver install routine in a 9x OS. c) this can be tough contrary to our good friend litgruv says so dont get down on yourself (not bagging on you at all litgruv cause your right it can and should be always easy, its just when it messes up video card installs get tricky. I speak from voluminous experience in butting my head into this same area. I only volunteer the information to help.)<br />
<br />
The video behaviour is normal..this is windows operating with no video card drivers<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo now the vid card install wont work what are your options.<br />
1) Format and reload likely the least time consuming and difficult solution, if you've done it before you can do it again.<br />
2) remove all old video drivers in safe mode, if this is a windows 95,98,me machine you'll have to right click on &quot;My Computer&quot; icon select properties, the select device manager, then remove all video cards listed.  Also try and remove drivers from add/remove program list if its there I doubt it is on old riva drivers.<br />
3) Take your machine to a local shop and if the labor is reasonable enough (say below 40 bucks for the whole job, or whatever you define as reasonable) have them do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cd problem is an odd one and not easily diagnosed over forums . Only thing that makes any sense to me would be power supply is being strained i dunno to be honest.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head its all I can think of.  <br />
<br />
PS I hope I didnt ruffle any feathers in the tone of my posting its just I've done this for a long time gotten in these same discussions for a long time and often i'm told I'm wrong because someone knows someone who is a computer &quot;Genius&quot; and is infallible and they've told them different. My advice is free and I'm not correct all the time, but I've had alot (think 1000's of machines) of experience with specifically computer hardware upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually bios flash unless there is specifically an issue with that card and that board specifically is unlikely, possible but unlikely.    Support for agp  standards is also conviently limited phyiscally.  So if say his card is the wrong agp for his machine..it would not even fit in the slot and if it did it would not post because the voltage is wrong.

That wasnt directed at you mate. The reply i quoted was concerning wether he had a agp slot or not. I was just pointing out that he had to have a agp slot cause a riva TNT is a agp card. I know cause i have one floating around some where :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">...fact of the matter is an agp8x card physically and <br />
voltage wise wont work in an agp1x slot...here.  Very few cards are the <br />
universal type nowadays.  Most only work in 4x or 8x mobos only.<br />
...<br />
<br />
Well, since I can (somewhat) use the new card to at least surf the<br />
web (made my last post from it) I guess I have an agp8x slot. Woot!<br />
Learned something new! See? My 'puter isn't THAT ancient!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice guys! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, I went ahead and installed the driver from the<br />
web (address given previously). The good news is,<br />
I can now adjust my 'Display' settings to different<br />
resolutions. Bad news is, when I start Everquest I<br />
get &quot;no 3d devices found&quot;. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I downloaded another Radeon7000 (there are three<br />
parts to download) and now I can finally get into<br />
EQ. Visited the Bazaar, it's as laggy as it was <br />
before. PoK - no problems, same as before. Traveled<br />
to a few more zones, no problems (except I get<br />
hung up on things). <br />
<br />
STILL have the CD drive being stubborn though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well if i had said there wasnt a difference then yea, i would be wrong ;)<br />
<br />
However, i have not seen a Riva with PCI, though i wouldnt say it couldnt exist, but i personaly never seen one. So show me one and then your right ;D<br />
<br />
I don't feel like uploading more pix- just go google if you don't believe me.</div></div><hr />

actually you dont apg 8x wasnt invented yet by the time the last motherboard capable of using a 450 p3 was pulled.<br />
<br />
However you have an either a universal agp 3.0 card or more likely you have a via apollo 133 mobo with agp 4x and that still had the ability to use slot 1 procs (i sold one of those when i started, rather rare board but eh who knows). Neither here nor there just glad your comp is working better now.<br />
<br />
Btw litgruv I used to sell a pci riva tnt when I first started at this job.  Also neither here nor there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My opinion: buy an NVidia card.<br />
<br />
I have 3 machines. main comp using a GeForce FX 5600 ultra.<br />
<br />
Other 2 using cheap MX models. <br />
<br />
No probs with any of them. No falling through the world yet, nothing... Minus one issue where someone in PoK had no head... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">So I go to priceline.com and find different manufacturers. um<br />
didn't expect that, I thought the g4mx440 was a brand. LOL<br />
<br />
Any comments on any of these cards? I don't care about TV out. <br />

<br />
Geforce 4 mx XXX is the chip set being used by the card not the brand. Personally I would not waste my time with an Geforce MX card. MX is the low end, gimp, card. I would recommend going with a TI or FX series card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">cards Ive had are <br />
diamond viper v330 pci and agp  nvidia, never had any problems, till it was just too old.<br />
voodoo2, again no problems till it was just too old<br />
all in wonder radeon, replacing now cause no dx9 support.<br />
radeon 7500, just changed to it from viper v330 so lcd monitor could run at full resolution with 32bit colors, was restricted to 16bit with v330.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea nvidia has had the reputation in terms of friendly and stable drivers. However ATI has gotten their act together on drivers and their cards are much more stable now and reliable.</div></div><hr />
