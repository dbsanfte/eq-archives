<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which is better for a Shaman at level 56?<br />
Which is better for a Shaman at level 60?<br />
Which is better for a Shaman at 45?<br />
<br />
I would believe we can all agree that (play wise, NOT taking economic value of each into account) the Coldain Military Wristguard is better for a Shaman to use from levels 1-44.<br />
However, the JBB is 4 ac higher, so let me know if that is a factor.<br />

And there are mobs where you will dot AND JBB at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So extended affliction actually works now? I recall reading in a past thread that it was bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Of course this depends if we are talking group exp, solo exp, or raid. When soloing for exp, the correct answer is both.<br />
When raiding I use neither.<br />
 <br />
The extended affliction time does work and works well. <br />
At 60 with canni5, there is no reason to not be using DoT's every kill, and lots of them. Things that use to just not quite die with a couple dot's on them now fall over.<br />
<br />
Saying that the &quot;jbb is a free dot&quot; or is &quot;manaless damage&quot; is an incorrect statement. Everytime you click your not cannibalizing. If your not cannibalizing, your NOT making mana, which is the same as if you were spending it if you want to assume a constant pulling no downtime situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am asking in the context of a person who can use one or the other.<br />
<br />
At level 56 if you could only have one which would be better?<br />
At level 60?<br />
<br />
If it depends on the play situation (solo, group, raid) please indicate.<br />
<br />
I figure level 45-low 50's the answer would most ofthen be JBB.<br />
I figure level 1-44 the answer would be CMR.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm just in the process of switching to giant faction now, mainly because I want the Coldain Military Wristguard. It's the easiest obtainable extended affliction 3 item, and at level 60 I would much rather have EA 3 than my JBB. I use my JBB a lot while solo'ing, but coldain wristguard just adds that much more power to me. I solo in fungus grove a lot, using a combination of epic / Dot's / JBB. I plan on dumping my skyshrine bracer for the coldain wristguard once i finish my factioning and complete the quest. As someone mentioned before however, I switch my equipment in and out depending on the situation. I usually swap out my JBB for blue diamond bracer for raids / fights with mobs who are immune to cold.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The damage output is not even comparable.  <br />
<br />
The CMW is nice and all, but you are not squeezing out anywhere near the 263 per blast that the JBB offers even with multiple DoTs rolling.  Don't get me wrong, the CMW is definitely worth getting but, you might as well compare the damage output between a rusty mace and a REIF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jukax, you dont need to change faction to do this quest. Just MQ it with a level 1 Ogre of Rallos Zek. Works like a charm. Or get some non kos friends to help you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 60 with torpor and canni5 I would take the military wristguard.  The reason being that your mana regenerating abilities are obscene and will allow you to throw lots and lots of dots without going oom.  By this level, dot's are the best way to kill mobs.  JBB was very powerful at level 45, but by level 59 (what i am now) it just takes too damn long to kill something with JBB.  It takes me about 4-5 minutes to kill a small mushroom in FG, depending on how much the damn thing stuns me.  If I didn't have epic, tack another 2-3 minutes on to that fight.  This is just too slow to be good exp (actually, it's still decent exp.  I shudder to think how fast I am going to get AA points here once I can get my hands on torpor :O)<br />
<br />
BTW, don't listen to what the iksar's have to say.  JBB is a very powerful tool and there is no reason not to use it if you have access to it.  If you have access to it at 45, use it, and you will powerlevel yourself up to 54 very quickly (took me about a week).  After that, its usefulness just starts to wane a little bit =\</div></div><hr />

It's like having a high damage melee weapon with an 80 delay.<br />
<br />
Just don't be clicking it while you're full health or I'm gonna come and smack ya.<br />
<br />
For interest's sake...<br />
Pox + 20% duration is 333 extra damage.<br />
BoN + 20% duration is 214 extra damage.<br />
<br />
Neither are that far from a single JBB click.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER! At best JBB is 32DPS while BoN is 214 and Pox is 111.<br />
<br />
Considering you'll probably never FIND BoN or Pox (!!!), here's some other numbers.<br />
<br />
EBolt - 146DPS with 20% giving 146 extra<br />
Plague - 55DPS with 20% giving 220 extra</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
I thought Pox was around 150 damage per tick?  4 extra ticks would be 600pts of free damage, ... assuming the mob lives for 2 1/2 minutes. :)  BoN sounds about right at 214, and that extra damage comes quick. <br />
<br />
Stacking Pox and BoN, you can probably up your damage per minute by over 500. And it really is free damage, unlike a JBB. It doesn't any time clicking your bracer. <br />
<br />
Given an either/or, I'd still pick the JBB but since one is quested for and the other is usually bought, I'd just get both. If I had something better, I might bag one or the other when I don't plan to be dishing out a lot of damage but that isn't a problem for me right now. :) ... and it would have to be a good bit better to make me go through that hassle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you have torpor and can use it, coldain wristguard.  If not, probably jbb.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i use jbb and wouldnt switch for coldain wristguard at 60. i kill small mushrooms in FG in about 2.5-3 min, using bane,plague,and pet along with jbb i have a constant flow of exp all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd try to find a way to get both. Barring that, JBB. As it's a source of 'free' damage and that's always nice. Sure some mobs have so many hp that you wouldn't want to just JBB them to death, but *heh* that's why we have those spell slots. If you stack a dot or two and then JBB it, most likely the mob is gonna go down fast, and you can probably prevent having to refresh a dot, thus saving some mana while still putting out a lot of damage. Just because someone has a JBB doesn't mean it's the only weapon at their disposal, but it sure is a nice one to have.</div></div><hr />
