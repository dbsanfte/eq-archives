<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All these threads I have been reading is starting to worry me about whats going to happen to Shamans. BeastLords and enchanters getting a much better slow. ?????<br />
<br />
Think about it, at high levels groups dont want shamans because they can heal, they want them because they can slow. <br />
<br />
Now, <br />
<br />
You give Beastlords that same ability and if i had a choice between shaman and beastlord, i would choose beastlord because of the added DPS. Sure you dont get the shaman buffs, but who cares these days people are uber and can live without it.<br />
<br />
Enchanters: well what can i say, they are GODS in the world of everquest, not only can they slow but Mezz mobs, which makes them # 1. Plus they have the best haste buff and the much demanded CRACK that everyone wants.<br />
<br />
I dont know, I hope I am wrong but as a shaman , things to me are looking grim! <br />
<br />
Can anyone cheer me up ?? hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a shaman can bring soo much more to a group than slow, i wouldnt really worry about it.<br />
and imo the slow upgrades all 3 slowing classes get (dunno if bards get one, too, but i dont consider them slowing class as they can do everything anyway :)) are very reasonable and due for all classes. and we still have the best slow, buffs, depending on the tank good dps (and panther in whatever form it will stay :))<br />
<br />
and nope, the sky certainly isn't falling down :)<br />
<br />
p.s. i highly doubt enchanters will share your view of their class, as well as the beasties, each class (ours included) had their kickass  time, but those are gone and all classes have their issues and are no more gods in any way imo.</div></div><hr />

Do you only load malos and slow and leave 7 spell slots empty or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If Beastlords and Chanters suddenly got improved ability to act as primary slower in harder content and nothing else was changed .. I would agree it would be very bad for Shamans .<br />
However it is my understanding that these new slows are part of the upcomming class chamges . So shaman's should be getting some improved method of &quot;Filling the main healer role&quot; . This should maintain balance fairly well .</div></div><hr />

<br />
My feelings exactly.<br />
<br />
You have to be a real ****ty Shaman if all you bring to a group is slows and if that's the case I'm glad you don't get groups. That leaves more for me, so I can set a positive example and show people why they want a Shaman in their group over the Beastlord or Enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe you not understanding what im saying ?  and No im not crap shaman, I run groups without a Cleric or enchanter, Hell sometimes even without a Main Tank.....<br />

Sorry, this attitude just pisses me off to no end. Shamans DO NOT suck at this point. We arent the most powerful class in the game, but we certainly are not the weakest, and in the overall scheme of the GAME ITSELF, we are fairly well off, especially compared to a couple other classes I can think of, like SKs.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

Aren't we a bit touchy. But any way. Shaman are about at the lowest end of the totem pole on desireablity in groups and once we hit that mass group button we are pretty much buff sluts on raids - yes I am in a high end raiding guild. <br />
<br />
The Panther line radically changed that. We still were not as powerful (is anyone) as an enchanter, versitile as a druid, or as necessary as a cleric - but damn close. My shaman was actually searched out not for one one pump chump slow - but to be a DPS machine with my pet. <br />
<br />
I am glad that you don't think we suck, but it is that attitude that has led us to this point. I have been playing my shaman for 6 years and seen his desireability go up with Kunark then drop like a rock since. Hell I think my cleic can do more DPS with his damn summoned hammer. <br />
<br />
We are the Al Bundy of classes, remembering when we scored six touchdowns back in high school. We get a chance to do more than sell shoes and say selling shoes is OK. <br />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Substituted Al for Ted Bundy.<br />

If the next expansion features slightly faster fights, slightly more resistant MOBs and slightly higher MOB DPS shamans will be at the bottom of the barrel as far as group usefulness is concerned. Of course it will take about 3 expansions for that fact to become recognized by the masses, but still, I would rather play a balanced class then have my usefulness to a group depend entirely on SOE's ability to squeeze MOB HPs and DPS in the small area where shaman do ok.</div></div><hr />

But I am so special....  ;)   All should bow to my opinion (what a nightmare that would be)  :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depending on the size, orientation, and intended use of the stick, sometimes the short end is preferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't compare myself to enchanters or BSTs as far as slowing ability. we all can slow, so what?<br />
<br />
I can currently work very well with enchanters and BSTs in my groups, BSTs enjoy my buffs and DPS increases I provide, enchanters enjoy that I can Malos on top of their Tash, and keep aggro off of them with my own debuffs (I can really take hits much better than they do). Melees also love me because I can heal in a pinch.<br />
<br />
one of my better memories in EQ is when I was venturing into Barindu for the first time. someone trained the sewer entrance thinking it was a normal exit....5 mobs in the small area GY/Camp where we had just gathered to go on my first sewer expedition. the mobs chewed through the cleric and the enchanter very fast, but I was able to pick up heals, debuff every single one of the mobs and CC the entire situation. was a PITA, but I did it, and saved the other 3 members of my group.<br />
<br />
honestly, lets see another single class do all of that.</div></div><hr />

Hey, can I have your gear before you go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont think we suck, i think we need improvment though.<br />
<br />
I tend to shine most in those omg the **** hit the fan situations.  And before leopard I use to sit on a ton of mana till that situation happened.    My dots last longer then a mob takes to die(I dont have bane atm so that'll change) , so I tend to stick to my crappy nukes, after the usual debuffing.  <br />
<br />
I dont want to fill the main healer role, I just want a small upgrade to my healing.  And something done to help with shorterm dps.  If leo stays close to orginal and its still worth casting i'd consider that the upgrade to my short term dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We could use a few tweaks, sure...but as a whole I think we are doing fine. I just hope SoE isnt trying to fix things that arent broken with the re-envisioning. As far as getting groups goes, in my experience it has more to do with the player than the class they play...the better you are at what you do, the more folks will seek you out.</div></div><hr />

All right we all know you are a fanboy. Me so uber everyone bow to me. <br />
<br />
Please I don't believe he is saying Shaman suck, no class really sucks but as has been talked about so many times on this board Shaman have been left behind and we seem to be going right back to that again. Palis will now be able to heal jast as well as Shaman. Chanter and Beastloards will now be so close to us in slowing it is scary. We got Panther its about to be nurfed, how bad we dont know yet but has SOE ever done a good job when nurfing something? <br />
<br />
I hope Shaman dont get screwed again but I wont be holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how fanboy has anything to do with Nazis :confused:  To me it just means someone who thinks SOE can do no wrong :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There is a tradition in many Usenet newsgroups that once such a comparison is made, the thread is over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever argument was in progress.<br />

Some folks think too much.<br />

That aside, substitute &quot;Fanboy&quot; for &quot;Nazi&quot; and you may understand what is being said.<br />

I'm still chuckling over here. What can I say, I'm easily amused.</div></div><hr />

Grizlor is not who I called a &quot;fanboi&quot; and I already gave you my description of the term. By the way it was meant how it sounded a whole lot of people believe that SOE can do no wrong. I happen to disagree, and used the term &quot;fanboi&quot; to make my point.</div></div><hr />
