<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Word on the test server is that with the new PvP revamp that is INC, shaman dots will be made less resistable.<br />
<br />
  This combined with the Pet zoning patch could make shamans more dangerous at the high end.<br />
<br />
  Anyone know anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To quote a famous german soldier..<br />
I know nothing... nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wish they would be less resistable on NPC's care less about PC's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any final word on PoK/PoT/Nexus going PvP?  I personally can't wait for these changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you look at the spell data in Lucy, you can see that they have added PvP spell resist mods to most spells, so it wouldnt surprise me if DoTs were included, its not just us that get a increase in power from this, mages, necros and beastlord pets are far more powerful than ours straight out of the box or buffed by their owners, some minor (or not so minor) spell changes arent going to change PvP that much, EQ simply isnt designed for it.<br />
<br />
Edit: here is the history for Breath of Ultor for clarity sake:<br />

Now as to what the mods mean, /shrug who the heck knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Then they need to code it that DoTs no longer cause exp death in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The accident a few weeks back when the PVP servers happened to experience beta pvp for a few hours before SoE emergency patched, i had a shaman in my guild who killed lots of people with his DoTs. And PvP in the safe zones was also a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frogy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dots have not caused exp loss on deaths on Vallon for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You lose exp if you go in the arena and get a DoT, then run outside of there and die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that doesn't happen on rallos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exp loss from dots is a non-zek arena only problem.<br />
<br />
As for the comment that dots should be made less resistable pve, try landing one in pvp and you will have a new definition of hard to land. Landing dots pve is a cakewalk in comparison.</div></div><hr />
