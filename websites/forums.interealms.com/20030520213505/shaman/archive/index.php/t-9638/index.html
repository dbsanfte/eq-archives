<br />
It seems like most of the posts here are for the soloing shamans.  Does anyone have any suggestions where I should go to find pick up groups in the low 50s?  I just dinged 51 and I am sick of soloing.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about Seb (still need the key) or maybe Velks (cant find a map of the dungeon).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions where a 51 Shammy LFG would do well?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Sorry...but the best exp your going to get is solo in COM or HHK.  I suggest you go to either of those places.  You'll get 55 in less time then it will take you to get 52/53 anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got my Seb key tonight so I can go in there for groups or make the short run to CoM to solo.  I have never been in either zone so I am looking forward to checking them out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just keep alternating between Seb and CoM and you'll zoom to 54 in no time flat. Sometimes pickup groups in seb pay off really well and other times they make tear your hair out. I'd go to seb first and if you can't find a group then head to CoM.</div></div><hr />
