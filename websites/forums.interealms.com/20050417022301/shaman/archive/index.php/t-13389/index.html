<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odrigeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I am going to list below the placing I am bouncing between at 52. Looking for advice in new exciting places to go.<br />
<br />
1. Task Master camp in Echo Caverns: Just can not seem to let this camp die. Great spot for 49-51 but getting a lot of light blues at 52. Even at that still getting a percent every 3rd kill about. No drops to speak of and having to deal with the Thought Horror &lt;shiver&gt;. Good spot if I can't find anywhere else to go.<br />
<br />
2. Jaggedpine Gnolls: The upper tunnels suck, lots of wanders and pathing leaves a lot to be desired. What I call the &quot;pit&quot; (where you fall through the floor) is a good spot but I feel a little low to be down there. I am using dog dog as a dot down here and tanking the gnolls myself. I get about a percent a kill in the pit which rocks but I don't feel like I can justify holding this spot for myself, because I can not utilize all the spawns.<br />
<br />
3. Ice Giants in Everfrost: WAY over camped and we are again getting a little low on the xp front. Good money but hardly worth the run out there to find out that it is camped, so let’s move on.<br />
<br />
4. Any POP camp: I just think (and this may be a problem) that I am to low to be soloing any of the planes. If any of you know differently please let me know.<br />
<br />
5. The Grey: This was supposed to be some great camp. I took me a half an hour to get out there just to find that the Shissar take forever to kill because they resist the crap out of Ebolt. The dark blue golems are easy enough to kill but give crap xp. No drops, this place just blows all the way around.<br />
<br />
6. Maiden's Eye: I haven't tried this zone in a long time. Might be time I go for a visit. Defiantly a consideration.<br />
<br />
7. Going to POT and trying to get a group: This works pretty well being the best slower class in the game. But I am looking for consistent spot that will be good for xp.<br />
<br />
I think this is the extent of what I have found to be useful. I know there are a lot of other camps that we can solo but I am looking for a good spot to get a percent a kill, and the kills can't take 5 minutes each. Please feel free to comment on the camps I have posted above I am always open to hearing new ideas and tactics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. PoJ rats can be done at zone out if you are careful and root before they run.<br />
<br />
2. any lvl 40 mob will be dark blue to you till 54. They don't give much xp but if you kill lots of them they add up.<br />
<br />
3. Scarlet desert is decent. I like picking off Scarlet hoppers.<br />
<br />
4. The Grey sucks for shamans but rocks for clerics. They nerfed The Grey though because it was too easy for Necro Druid Wiz.<br />
<br />
5. There are a lot of new stuff in LoY that you can camp for xp too.<br />
<br />
6. Stonegrabbers and Rockhopper cave in DSP will be mostly dark blue to you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know exactly how you feel, I spent what seemed like forever trying to find a place to solo at 52. What I did find was City of Mist. You know all those people that push it as a great XP spot? Well believe it or not they are right. ^_^ Baring a hard break this camp is as easy as it can be challenging and it's always rewarding. Some pointers and superstition from my time leveling from 52 to 54 in two days though...<br />
<br />
The best place for XP without getting XP without help is the back area would the gazebos. The 6 mobs that spawn there are the same mobs that spawn up along the top edges of the city. This is both a blessing in the xp they give and a curse as the mobs that you'll find to break can be some what tough to do deal with in close quarters. I would greatly suggest coming to CoM with C3 and Virtue. <br />
<br />
The attachment is a map of CoM, marked X is my pull spot. When I first get there I kill the spawns at place marked 'E' then cast levitate on myself at point 'Y' and run to point 'Z'. I'll prep here and bind, when I go AFK for any reason I always go to the opposite side of 'Z', but so long as you don't get trained, I've never seen a mob path even close enough to 'Z' to agro on you. When I am ready, I pull to point 'X'.<br />
<br />
I've marked out the mob spawn points in red. The purple spot (marked 'D') is a place where you'll probably find two mobs swimming against the corner. I pull in order A to E. When you pull and to avoid adds I suggest the following... Pull the highest level on first, though the mobs seem to have a  mingling level range they go as follows from lowest to highest: <br />
<br />
Spectre/Ghosts - A Shadow, An Apparition, A Phantom, A Wraith (&lt;-- nasty)<br />
<br />
Skeletons - Spurbone Skeleton, Plaguebone Skeleton, A Greater Spurbone, A Great Plague Skeleton, Greater Plaguebone, Greater War Boned Skeleton (&lt;-- nasty)<br />
<br />
Golems - A Vapor Golem, A Fog Golem, A Haze Golem, A Mist Golem, An Army Behemoth<br />
<br />
At level 52 with using slow to pull I seemed to be able to pull most everything but the top two of each category by themselves. By level 53 I could usually pull all but the top one by themselves. With  the Specters you have to be careful as they cast a lifetap. This will agro your pet and you'll end up with 3 or more mobs to play with. Nothing you can't handle most often, but we're trying to keep this sane. ^_^ Just keep Poochie on a short leash and you'll do fine. ^_^ Also the pathing can be a bit off when you're pulling to X. The mobs will sometimes fall into the water, the best advice is to just let them path back to you, so long as there aren't some high level pops in the corners (and there usually aren't) you won't get any adds, though if there is a mob at point 'D' it can agro and you should be ready for it with root. If the pet falls into the water though, you have two choices, kill it or let it path back to you. If something is agro on him (i.e. it's in the middle of a fight) he will train everything from southern side (spot 'C') and sometimes the ones in water on northern side (spot 'D') as well. When you get to spot 'D' (usually a goo or golem) I suggest pulling it back to spot 'C' unless you like fighting underwater.<br />
<br />
With C3, my lizard, my JBB and my mage equipped super pooch (Haste Mask, HP Belt and two fists) I was able to easily clear all the spawn spots. As a warning I had one of the mobs from point 'D' spawning on the roof of the gazebo at spot 'B'. I pulled him first and dealt with adds. Also when you're fighting and cleared point 'D' you'll sometimes get mobs that will path from the water to point 'X'. Just keep an eye out and never go AFK at point 'X' and you should be fine. ^_^<br />
<br />
Well there's my off the cuff guide to hunting my little piece of heaven in CoM. I got lucky as I was leveling last night someone killed Lord G and didn't need the books. ^_^ I am now one step closer to my epic ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found CoM to be slowing down as far as XP went by 51 or 52.  I moved to Dulak Harbor in LoY and thought it was great.  Some easy places to pull to and most mobs seem to have a very small agro range.  At 54, I'm getting about 1% per 2.5 kills.  I think I was getting around 1% per kill at 52.  The loot is good too -- occasional gem drops and 3-6pp for most kills.<br />
<br />
I also like the Hole entrance, but it is *always* camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried soloing KC recently (51 now). the xp is great, you can set up camp right at the zone. If its empty (on my server im usually the only one in there), its not much nof a problem, but you would definitely need kei and temp/virtue/aego, as its pretty darn hard to solo pull, so you're taking on 2-3 at once. Buff the hell out of yourself and dog, make sure to alpha dog (I use shivs-imo by far get the most damage out of using them, except maybe velium stuff, but velium is 10p, shivs you can get for 8 gp). It's all about parking mobs in the right spot, away from dog so he aint taking a lot of damage. Two things that suck about this zone, pathing has got to be the worst I ever seen, and if there are more people in there, everyone likes to camp by zone, so for example you get a group of jerks like the other day, when they pulled 4 mobs right through me where I was fighting, and of course got trained and had to zone. I got the usual sorry about that tell, but come on, I'm here first, *** you doing setting up shop right next to me, trying to pull mobs through my camp? /mini rant off<br />
<br />
By the way, I hear a lot of griping about this place, and how easy it is and such, how you don't learn your class, blah blah blah. Well let me tell you, it's definitely not easy at all, least not at 51. Maybe because you camp right at the zone (jeez I don't know anyone who camps by zoneline....) they think that. I hate running, so maybe I'm different than most, who zone at the first brief sign of trouble, I stick it out, as long as their slowed and rooted, they are going down eventually. Even with virtue, if I get a nasty pull with 4 mobs, it's a hell of a fight, im almost dead and lom at the end, but it's sure exciting and a lot of fun!</div></div><hr />
