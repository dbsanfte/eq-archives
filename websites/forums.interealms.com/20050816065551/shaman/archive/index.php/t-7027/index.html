<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what i did was i put the ui in the folder where the ui files go and also in skins folder it works for me hope it works for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You didn't tell us what UI you were using...but this is the one that i suggest<br />
<br />
Icey Bllue UI (http://www.starpixel.com/eq.asp) <br />
<br />
Add these 3 things and you have the perfect (and purty) Shaman Interface...<br />
<br />
Timer (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp) <br />
<br />
(i replaced the help window with the timer)<br />
<br />
Location Compass (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?op=showfiles&amp;catid=26) <br />
<br />
(4th one down..Location_Compass.zip)<br />
<br />
Hot Button Window (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1107&amp;highlight=icey+blue) <br />
<br />
(now this is a full custom UI don't use the whole thing..just DL it and use his Hot Button Window..copy from his...paste to the Original Icey Blue UI)<br />
<br />
http://soverby.freewebspace.com/anosui.jpg <br />
<br />
In case he nerfs my pic..here is the link also Anos' UI (http://soverby.freewebspace.com/anosui.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This combination is awesome...small...all the right window and funtionality for a shaman IMO....<br />
<br />
HAVE FUN !!!<br />
<br />
PS <br />
It does work perfect as of 10/22...........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What you will probably find is that you are missing 2 new Ui2DAnimation sections from your UI Animations xml file, they are &quot;A_CheckBoxNormal&quot; and &quot;A_CheckBoxPressed&quot;.  They came in as part of the new Alarm feature.  Go into you default UI Animations file and copy the 2 complete sections into your custom one.  This worked for me.<br />
<br />
Failing that look in the UIErrors.txt file in your EQ directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also what i discovered after working on my ui for two hours yesterday.... you cannot load a ui from the loadskin button in the option menu, you have to type /loadskin......</div></div><hr />
