<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which one of these is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are always lom then the ODS.  On stats alone the DWS is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used ODS until I got an affliction efficiency item.  I only ever run out of many when buffing or chain CHing, so I don't miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is worth sacrificing stats to have a Mana Preservation or (better yet) Affliction Efficiency item. It is not about whether you are LOM. If your spells cost you less mana, you can do more.<br />
<br />
However, once you level past 60 and start getting your PoP spells, you will really want to look into getting a IV item. Then you can be silly like me and replace your spear with a clay hammer ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went for the ODS.  Then again, alot of my gear choices were focus effect over stats.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a crystalline torque and use the DWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think that in almost any cituation the ODS would be better off then the DWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">post 60 with torpor and post 60 buffs go with the DWS. 60 and below use the ODS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />

I wore an ODS for a long time.  I really enjoyed the mana savings.<br />
After I dinged 60, picked up Torpor, and eventually Canni5, AC+HP become much more important to me.<br />
<br />
I picked up a DWS and have been wearing it since.  ODS went to my spouse, an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I have 7th Prayer Shawl banked for similar reasons.  FT1 isn't worth the AC+HP loss.  Once I get the 8th (damn geonids), I'll reevaluate.  The fact that Zephyr of Brell works on all spells will probably mean I'll be switching to the shawl instead of the shroud.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I won my ODS at 57 and plan on keeping till 61 because most of what I cast is Turgurs, Celerity, Malosini, Regrowth of Dah'Khura, Bane of Nife and Talisman group buffs spells. So I'll miss out on FoS but that's about it since Torpor and Malo is in no line of sight yet :) The mana savings from an ODS really adds up if you are killing lots of things at a good pace. In a typical situation working with an enchanter with multiple pulls I'm malosini + Turgurs most mobs. 10% of those two combined = 45mana saved per mob. <br />
<br />
Combine an ODS with horse and you have almost unlimited mana fighting outdoors while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Gart said.<br />
<br />
The shoulder slot is a pretty valuable slot for shammies and moreso than the neck IMO.  Sure there are great neck items out there, but they are not nearly as common or easy to get as good shoulder pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless I happen to run across a crystaline torque or a focus 4 item, I don't see me getting rid fo my ODS anytime soon. Until I hit 65, odds are that I'll still be spending most of my mana on torpor, turgur and malo. ODS works with all of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wear an ODS at the moment, but am getting to the point where I am looking to swap it out.  These days I only really cast 3 spells that take advantage of it, Malo, Turgurs and Torpor.  Whilst I do admit that I use these one hell of a lot, the stats on the ODS are seriously lacking (read as no hp).  It is strange, but ever since going above 60 the 3 items I never thought I would sell are most likely gonna end up on my trader, my ODS, JBB and JBBP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Affliction Efficiency is really nice to have.  The item I wear is the shield from Grummus.  It's roughly 25 AC, 85 hps/mana +7 wis int stam, +8 resists.  The AC is a bit low for a shield, but the hps are very decent and the effect of AEIV simply can't be exaggerated.  Especially on raids where I do a LOT of Malo/Malosini/Turgurs all the freaking time.  Saving 33% mana per spell helps more than you would expect.  Stacking that with my SCM3 ability and specialization in alteration means I'm saving around 58% mana per spell if it's a debuff, 44% mana per spell if it's a DoT.  <br />
<br />
I'll deal with the lowish AC, always another slot I can make up for that in.  One 50 AC ranged item will do the trick nicely.  I want the Torch of Judgement in that slot.  But in the mean time, there are still lots of items to upgrade, and I'm sure someone with truly uber gear would make the same choice as I have.  Btw, check my magelo if you wanna know what shield I am referring to.  <br />
<br />
Moral of the story: AC/hps are nice, but saving mana is even nicer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wear the Talisman of Evasion from Ssra Temple, drops from one of the Rhags (good lord I have no idea now which one...sigh) I won it before it had any focus effects and I was plesently surprised a week later when I logged on and there it was AEIII on my neck....<br />
I have to agree with Landragoran, dont underestimate the power of a good focus effect. BUT ODS isnt that great for us, maybe when buffing a raid, or when you have a particulary demanding group for rebuffs due to dispells, being healing/buffer/debuffer all in one, etc....just grab a AEIII item (or IV if you can) and wear it out.....the ODS is lacking in Ac and saves while the DWS has some OK saves and good solid Ac. Just look at what your other gearage is, if you can take the Ac hit or hit point hit then snag the ODS, if not get the Crystaline Torque and the DWS.<br />
Just my 2cp, YMMV</div></div><hr />
