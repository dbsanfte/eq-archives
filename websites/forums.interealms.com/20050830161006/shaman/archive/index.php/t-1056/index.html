<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed this as well, since the spell drop increase patch, all the spells that previously only dropped from level 60 mobs (torpor, sunstrike etch) now can drop from juggernaughts as well, my flat-mate looted a copy of sunstrike from a juggernaught for a good friend, the chance of them dropping a level 60 spells appears to be fairly low though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sebilite Juggs are 99% level 57, meaning that they can't drop malo or torpor, or any other spell that is part of, what we consider the &quot;level 60 drop table&quot;  <br />
<br />
However, once in a blue moon a level 58 jugg will spawn, and this jugg can drop spells from the level 60 drop table.  This isn't anything new, it has always been like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reminds me of the legendary pink tail in FF2(4). If you wandered this certain room, there was a 1:64 chance of encountering this monster that had a 1:64 chance of dropping the pink tail.<br />
<br />
Difference is that in FF2 you didn't NEED the pink tail (i.e. the adamant armor that it was used to get) to beat the game.<br />
<br />
I also don't recall ever hearing a lotto winner on TV saying how all poor people are stupid and should just win the lottery like me to get money.<br />
<br />
EQ is a strange, strange game.</div></div><hr />

What does the server he plays on have to do with whether or not Protector was the one who dropped Torpor?</div></div><hr />

If you own all Juggs then you naturally have a better shot at getting that off chance of a 58 jugg that has torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I can agree with you on that point.  But me asking Kylt if it was Prot that dropped Torpor has nothing to do with mass Juggicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It has nothing to do with it, Jilariz. I wasn't addressing you when speaking about servers and owning juggs.</div></div><hr />

There are 2 other guilds on Tallon Zek that are almost to where pande is but since a guild woke the sleeper(not pande)there chances decrease but, they arnt the only guild. Though pande owns seb is what I think you mean...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I got my copy of Torpor off a jugg from Trak's lair area.  I'm positive it wasn't the protector, since he's pulled before Trak is killed, and this jugg was killed after Trak went down.  Also the prot is pretty hard to miss, he's a lot bigger than normal juggs.  <br />
<br />
Increase of spell drop rates should affect the drop rates of 60 shaman spells from lvl 58 juggs.  It won't increase the 58 jugg spawn rate, but it will increase their chances of dropping spells, which increases the chances that they will drop a rare spell.  <br />
<br />
Juggicide . . . I think that's when women get their boobs cut off . . . very sad :(</div></div><hr />

At least it's something, true. Still sucks to be wandering that one room waiting for the 1:64 chance to have a 1:64 chance to get it.<br />

Hmmm. So the Amazons were juggicidal androphobes? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My point is that because you looted torpor from a juggernaut, you cannot claim that the spell is not overly rare.<br />
<br />
Because you have access to every Juggernaut that spawns your likelyhood of obtaining the rarest of drops is significantly greater than players on any other server, or in other guilds on your own.<br />
<br />
Also, I ask, how many Juggs have you killed?  How many dropped Torpor or Malo?<br />
<br />
While you're likely being sarcastic when you use this example, you still berate those who believe that Malo &amp; Torpor should be more available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont have topor, so I cant solo yeldema. And I am being squished in with the other whining iksar here about the JBB issue... I'm sure I can solo that wuss just fine once I get topor. We killed her with a 60 druid/monk/and me.  Using a JBB might cause sony to cancel your account...i'd never do that.</div></div><hr />

What petition?  It's not even qualify for a draft yet.  More like personal opinion.<br />
<br />
I'd rather obtain them with quests involving triggered spawn rather than depending on some dumb luck though.</div></div><hr />
