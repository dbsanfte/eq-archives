<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about to ding 38 and for the most part I've wasted my time for 14 levels on alchemy thanks to bazaar prices so I'm thinking about switching to pottery. (I'm not saying we should price fix i'm saying I can't afford to make them if people sell them for less than my cost to make them and I won't support another shaman selling them for less than their value just so I can turn around and sell them for a better price).<br />
<br />
what I need to know is what is the best way to increase my pottery skill and how high does it have to be for me to make a spirirtstone. Also what ingredients go into making a spiritstone once I get my skill up high enough.<br />
<br />
Pottery sounds like an interesting skill and an easy one to get better at, the Spiritstone makes it even better, any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, an excellent site. <br />
spiritstones are very hard (and expensive) to make however, i have heard from a 220+ skill potter that succeeded on 2 out of 7 tries<br />
=/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are looking for a skill that is cheap to raise... pottery is one.<br />
<br />
You could probably get to 199 skill now for under 500pp.  With the new recipe that is out from Jagged Pine.  <br />
<br />
Spiritstone can be attempted at that skill, but you will fail a whole lot.  I have 213 skill (each attempt/combine to raise skill after 199 is about 23pp each) and I am only 3 out of 50 attempts at spiritstones.   Each attempt at a spiritstone requires 2 sapphires (106pp each) and a level 49+ enchanter to make mana for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow! thanks for the quick replies, very helpful info, i won't be making spiritstones for a while but i'm definitely getting into pottery.<br />
<br />
One of my best friends in game has a 54 chanter so now I can get something other than C2 from him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Henora - what recipe from Jagged Pine are you referring to?  I am interested in learning the process for getting pottery to 199 skill for about 500pp.  What should i be making and are all the items needed vendor bought or harvested?<br />
<br />
Tried Eqtraders but wasn't too clear on what to do from looking at it.  Thanks for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look under recipes for the new casserole baking dish. I'm wondering if Iksars are KOS there... My skill has been at 181 for a long time, and I'd love to bump to 199 before trying the expensive stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes, the casserole dish.<br />
<br />
look around on eqtraders some more, there are lots of posts on what people make to skill up.  you can go to 199 now on vendor bought items.<br />
<br />
don't start pottery to make money for yourself.  the market is saturated by the PoTC quest and there is tons of competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes, iksars are KoS there...but after 2 nights of killing gnolls you should be at least non-KoS...and remember to save the fangs! they will help you faction up further, not sure what faction you need for the turn in tho. <br />
and just for fun, kill the huge named gnoll in the back...it'll start the war and make all the softskins run for cover =)<br />
just be sure to warn people first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I ran to JP for the first time last night. I was apprehensive to the Brell Gnolls, but they still would let me bank/sell as an iksar. I was disappointed to find that the sketches for the casserole dish don't stack, and I couldn't find a pottery wheel nearby. =(<br />
<br />
I had room to carry 30 sketches and gated my way back to Cab. The dishes are also a pain because they require ceramic linings, so it's definitely not the quickest way to skill up. It's by far the cheapest once you're approaching 200, though. <br />
<br />
On 14 sealed poison vials and 30 casserole dishes I raised pottery from 181 to 186. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Took me a week of all of my (substantial) playing time to gather everything needed to make a spiritstone.  In the process, I trained my pottery up to the mid 100s.  BUT after all of that time, I only had enough components for 5 attempts.  Not worth pissing them away due to low skill, imo.<br />
<br />
So, do all of the work you can.  Hire a druid to do your foraging.  The biggest hang up of all is the iron oxide, but, if you do some research at eqtraders, you can find some ground spawns (2 of my 5 were ground spawns).  It seemed to me that the best drop rate was in Steamfont and I spent plent of time in Najena and The Hole for comparison.<br />
<br />
Anyway, gather everything up.  Have every piece combined that you can so that all the potter needs to do is the very last combine.<br />
<br />
Try to get a potter that is 240+ skill and has a geerlock.  That matches trhe potter I found and she went 2 for 5.  I sold the extra one for 5k and have since made somewhere in the neighborhood of 30k off of Stinging Wort potions now that I can gate to EF anytime to buy toes.<br />
<br />
This, of course, allowed me to buy Malo for 32k. =)  What I am telling you is that they are really handy.<br />
<br />
Another example...get your hands on a manastone.  Go to a dungeon, Sebillis, for example.  Bind there (can you bind in sebillis?).  Fight until oom.  Gate home.  Manastone up, sow, gate back.  Very handy as a cleric.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes hehe, but where/how/wha??  I wasnt aware that ice giant toes were sold in ef, or do you mean farm them / buy them from people killing ice giants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yep, arm them from he hunters or vendors the vendors sell to.</div></div><hr />
