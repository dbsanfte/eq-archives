While I can see them doing this I can also &quot;hear&quot; screams from some about the &quot;integrity&quot; of the game and also from those who have &quot;worked&quot; to get their items.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gawd.....don't give SOE the idea. It would generate a HUGE cashflow. In fact, it would probably mutiply SOEs profit margin by 50-100x for EQ. Selling virtual items for real cash to addicts, its all american capitalism at its best, lol. <br />
<br />
They already have players willing to play 18+ hrs a day, run multiple accounts, spend huge sums on systems and broadband to play. Imagine how much cash the playerbase would drain from their credit cards if items only cost $$$$ and could be automatically charged to your CC from an ingame vendor!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then lower it by the same amount 6 months later because everyone got bored and quit.  Something to consider when they see a pretty big hit in the online population though, and they know it's going out of style.</div></div><hr />

3 Levels $50<br />
100 AA's $75<br />
Plane of Time Flag $100<br />
<br />
I can see this along the same vein as equip for cash</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure on the game items for real money though; haven't they done this already?  Who got LDoN + the in game bag?  I rest my case :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A bag and a wide selection of gear are two different things.. I'll echo Grotte's sentiment - don't give them the idea, SOE has shown beyond the shadow of a doubt that they'll turn the game upside down for the most miniscule profit - the potential of a profit even... and I could see this being quite a cash cow, in the short term at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it wont happen.  selling items for real cash is a long way from allowing server transfers with gear.  Personally i think this is a long time in coming.  I really dont know why this hadnt been offered before.  The idea kind of appeals to me, being someone who started playing when living in the usa and now back home in europe i have to play really weird hours to raid with my guild, and their is a lack of good euro guilds on my server.  But then i dont think I could leave all the friendships i have made behind, but its nice to have the option.  <br />
<br />
I have heard some people bemoan that whole guilds on highly compedative servers may transfer to have better access to spawns.  I really cant see this happening, i just cant see an entire guild or atleast the majority of it willing to shell out 75usd for a transfer.  I dont think there are enough people willing to spend the money.<br />
<br />
The way i see it this will appeal mostly to the jerks and losers who have worn out their welcome on their own servers and cant get guilded in any decent guild because no one will have them.</div></div><hr />

Not one whole guild, but 3 guilds moved over to VS when they offered the full gear transfer for $50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why are people saying &quot;don't give them the idea&quot;  as if the thought has never crossed their minds?  UO offers pre-levelled characters for cash, and other games have items for cash schemes as pointed out.  So it's not exactly new and revolutionary, and if you don't think SoE keeps abreast of what their competition is up to, you're kidding yourself... look how many ideas were taken from DAoC.<br />

Few scream about the 3rd party sites/entities that are making cash farming and selling EQ data and/or raising and selling toons/accounts.  It might as well be SOE making money on their data rather than some 3rd party reseller.  At least if SOE did it (and ideally ran the 3rd party fools out of business) they could simply fabricate whatever data people wanted to sell and there'd be less 24/7 bot farmers for the plat sites and a few less people PLing for cash with no regard to anyone around them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think they started to notice a bad trend (for them atleast)<br />
- No one gives a crap about EQ2. It is going to be a massive failure like AC2, especially with an incompetent coding team from SOE and let's not forget the superior SOE customer support team!<br />
- SWG is not the be all end all MMOG. Infact it sucks and has received a lot of negative press. Hell even the official boards are off limits to non subscribers because of the sheer number of complaints. Despite being marketed as a game for casual gamers, it's nothing but an insane grind. This game is not for casual gamers.<br />
<br />
This of course leaves one thing: Salvage as much as they can from EQ, keep milking the cow. The recent dumbening of the game for low levels and the continuos changes towards making the game much easier for newcomers.<br />
- Continuous work on making the life easier for new players.<br />
- Instancing in LDoN (Time too). Next expansion, exptect to be fully instanced.<br />
- New giga expansion in march-april 2004, new class, new levels, etc ...<br />
- Rumored new graphics engine<br />
<br />
Full geared character transfer is the next logical step to extend the life of this aging product. Didn't suprise me a bit.<br />
<br />
Why all these changes? SWG sucks and they know it, EQ2 going to fail and the competition heats up majorly: Worlds of Warcraft. When one of the best EQ guilds (FoH) are beta testers for WoW and many other guilds just wait to jump ship, SOE for the first time has a serious issue to deal with.</div></div><hr />

God I hope they institute this. I'm too lazy to do 20 levels of play-like-a-warrior to be able to have a little fun on an alt anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Out of all the responses (thank you), the ones indicating it might be SOE THEMSELVES running the &quot;plat for $$&quot; sites made me /e boggle the most.<br />
I would * HOPE * If they were doing this that it was simply a data transfer from a fictional (SoE - run) toon, and not SoE themselves c0ck-blocking or otherwise ruining the gameplay for customers with in-game SoE run toons.<br />
<br />
FFXI apparently snagged a few in the Monk community. (Big shock). Horizons has supposedly a decent TS system and the ability to change and or branch your character if you so desire. (However I have read reports that the combat system is blech).<br />
<br />
I too am curious what WOW will bring to the table. (Or monitor / desktop)</div></div><hr />
