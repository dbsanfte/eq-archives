<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been cropping up on lots of threads lately about how underpowered he is etc.<br />
Basically just interested in what Shaman on these boards actually want from dogdog.<br />
<br />
The 1 thing i want above all others is<br />
<br />
Innate Dual Wield.<br />
<br />
More HP and bigger hitting  would be nice to have but if I could be saved the bother of carrying round a shedload of rustys id be extremely happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, I believe a lot of people would like to see this.  It has been brought to the devs attention by our class rep:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24518<br />
<br />
I guess now we just keep our paws crossed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree he needs innate DW.<br />
<br />
He also does need more hps, a 3k base would help.<br />
<br />
In concerns to damage I don't think raising his hit levels is the means to go about it...<br />
<br />
From melee sources once DW is activated puppy does 55 to 60% the dps of a mage pet from every parse I've run.  Mage/BL pets hitting for 92 while dogdog hitting for 70.<br />
<br />
The main difference isn't the baseline stats of the pet but the fact that Mage/BL's utilize foci and haste their pets to 85% with BL's adding a 5% damage mod, and necros haste their pet to 70%.<br />
<br />
Even in a group with a chanter for haste and arming pet with a muzzle nets dogdog 78% haste...a mage or bl in the same group is netting 95% haste and the necro 80%.  Sans chanter puppy drops to 70% haste.  On overage doggy loses 10 to 15% due to haste differential or lack of foci.<br />
<br />
If puppy needs a DPS upgrade I would like to see a 1hour duration 70% pet only haste...Rune of Spirit or such...and pet foci made available to us.  Pet AA that allows puppy to crit could also be an option.<br />
<br />
Not all shaman utilize their pets to the same degree, however for those that do it would allow a shaman to net appreciable gains in puppy powah while not stepping on the toes of other classes, and in a manner that any shaman can attain if they choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might be stupid here, but I thought Spirit quickening stacked with SLTW, that would be 60% + 20% haste on our pet.<br />
<br />
If someone knows whether it stacks please let me know.  If not, I have been freaking wasting my time for the past 20 levels:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kursan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The haste doesn't stack, just the stats, so you can have both up but you'll only get the best % haste. Would be very nice if they did stack would certainly improve dogdog's dps a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">correct me if i'm wrong, but isnt 60% the soft cap for haste, minus bard/ench stacking effects?  or did they change this in the last couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
== frynque</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Valkargen, I agree with you completely about the haste issue.  They gave us Spirit Quickening as our level 50 token spell, and from everything I can see about the spell...it is utterly useless.  If they would take that spell and make it comparable to the druid, necro, beastlord, shadowknight, or mage pet only buffs, I think we would be in much better shape.  Having the ability to add crits to our pet is another area that I feel we were neglected in.  We are a pet class, and we get all of the useless pet AA's...why not get the decent pet AA's as well?  <br />
<br />
Of course our pet needs dual wield as well, but at least we have an option for turning that ability on at the moment...as opposed to our utter lack of ability to do as much for our pets damage as all other pet/charm-pet classes can do with a single buff or AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its has to start Dw'ing. So silly pet is lvl 60 something and doesn't. I dont know if i really want more damage from it after it starts swinging the way it should. But some more ability to survive would be nice. I'd like to see it get alot more hps and help keep its master alive. <br />
<br />
I guess i just do alot of indoor or close mob stuff and i'm healer/CC for my friends and my group. I'd like pup to be able to live longer and keep a mob occupied while i get them all slowed/rooted and keep people healed without having him die that quick. Dont overread into that. I dont want a portable warrior/ranger/rogue pet. Just some more hps or the ability for me to give my pet something to help that. King of buffs but nothing special for my pet? Pet avoidance buff? I dont know just thinking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd be happy if they would just make Spiritual Quickening worth casting.<br />
<br />
Say a 1 hour or more duration, <br />
+1% haste per caster level (i.e. level 70 shaman gets 70% haste), <br />
+2/caster level to attack (i.e. level 70 shaman adds 140 attack), <br />
+500 hp (stacks with our normal +hp spells like HoS)<br />
Add a poison or cold proc of around 75dd.<br />
<br />
I'd spend 1k mana to cast that and think it fair.<br />
<br />
Innate Dual Wield would be nice but I can get around that with rusties.  I put that in the wish list category but I wouldn't consider it wasted time if SOE gave it to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i look at the shammy pet as 2 things...a rune and/or a dot.<br />
<br />
as a rune it absorbs the 2k+ dmg instead of me and doesn't require any reagents.<br />
<br />
as a dot it's the most mana efficient dot in our spell book.<br />
<br />
i'm content with our pet as is. if i was a mage i would see a need for change, but i'm not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think thats part of the problem with our pet. We've all become used to it being possible roadkill and boring. Has no personality and is jsut another thing shaman make due with. <br />
<br />
If they maybe made sure the upgrade worked instead of having to wait for it , give it DW and run like at wolf speed would go along way in just those 3 little things. Give it a little flare nothing over the top just something.</div></div><hr />
