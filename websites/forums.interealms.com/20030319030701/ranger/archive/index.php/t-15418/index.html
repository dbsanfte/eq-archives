<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious if these are doable at 56 fear-kiting.<br />
<br />
Realistically doable.<br />
<br />
Am I gonna spend 15 mins whacking on one from behind to kill it? If one resists fear am I insta-ranger chum?<br />
<br />
Wondering how these compare with, say, Ravens in PoN, or rats in PoD.<br />
<br />
I can bring along the pocket 56 cleric if it would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Oh, and is there a particular spot (how to get there), preferably somewhere I can sit the cleric down to run back for heals if necessary, nice place to kite where I'm not gonna have 10 adds :)<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lyntz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hi )<br />
i Believe that doable for you, i did at lvl 60, and snare fear and well.But resisted some times.<br />
The problem is they could hit for 250 max, and faster, so if you try, you must be very very varefull ! refresh fear each 5 or 10 sec.<br />
For helping well , make sure you have chlroro on you while fighting, and Kei help always.<br />
And also, pull only Disease Rats, if i remember well the name, Feeble Rats also if you want, but never the Others Rats ! they cant be fear, always resist at lvl 60.<br />
They have lot of hp, so if you have no haste etc, that could be a long fight...<br />
Be safe, be carefull if you try.<br />
May the Unicorn bless you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 56 I always and I mean always ended up with two on me somehow still haven't the foggiest why (always single pulled and didnt' use bow just snare on pull), where as my friend who started at 57 never had that prob.  I figure if anything since they if I recall are dub to start with level makes the diff for them.  If that's true then 57+ they'd be doable but 56 for myself it was to much of a pain in the arse with the random single add.<br />
If anyone else has any insites I'd be curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did fine at 56.  I am now 58 and still do rats in PoJ on occasion.  Its the fastest solo xp I can get for the minimum amount of danger and hassle.<br />
<br />
There is a spot you can pull the rats to that makes working on them highly easy due to fear pathing.  While they can resist, if you start out with Snare and simply back off when they resist repeatedly, you can avoid hits easily.  In fact, the only reason not to camp the rats in PoJ at 56 would be the loot.  They can drop one thing, a starter for a quest that begins in PoT, and that rarely.  No money, pelts, cash loot, etc, hence why I am in WW these days when I solo.<br />
<br />
As far as agro difficulties, anyone who has hunted PoJ guards and prisoners can attest to some seriously bizarre agro there.  I can be attacking a Sentry or rat and have one of its brethren run over me with no problem, but toss in a bard and suddenly we have 4 rats under mez and the cleric is rooting like crazy to keep clear of melee.  As near as I can tell its partly level based and partly based on what buffs you cast on other folks during the fight, although I won't pretend to understand it other than to say that its not hard get around.  I have never gotten additional agro from rats soloing there, using the standard method of snaring, fearing, beating down, and reapplying every 10 seconds or so, personally.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Lyntz, I believe you are thinking of the rats in PoD.  The ones in PoJ can hit for up to about 236ish, but I have never seen a feeble rat on track there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lyntz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">arf :) i am so confuse, yes i asked about PoD rats....<br />
Lol sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Rats in PoJ are the easiest animal to fear kite in PoP.  They have less HP and hit for less than stuff in other PoP zones.  The only problem really is the Scourge proc that they will land.  But if your disease resist is up around 80-90 at level 60 you'll resist most procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was able to do rats at level 54 really easy... did like 4 rats before I had to rest. I was pulling them to zone out. At the time other people were there killing the guards but after they left I couldnt kill rats anymore because the guards would agro me for attacking rats... So i tried going in a bit further to where i had pulled rats from and when I was kiting there, other rats would agro when i was killing one. I wasnt using any aoe spells. where is the safe place for these rats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ambcob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do these all the time. You really have to becareful at 56, but easily done once you get a hang of it. At 57, I have seen rangers do this without aggro. There is only certain areas that you will get aggro, but it's from the higher rats that pass by. I always go to the trials and get KEI for free. Most of the time you can find an enchanter that will cast it on you for free. If you get this, you will never have to sit down and med, heck I even throw a dot in and still don't have to med with KEI. I'm just tired of them though, but it's hard to find a group at times. This is the best thing for us to solo against though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, will have to give these a go then soon.<br />
<br />
As far as the KEI, I've never had a problem with fear kiting mana without it. I use one of those Fine Antique Rings, really helps for fear kiting mana (covers snare and fear) and is ridiculously easy to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In the first &quot;ring&quot; of cells, on the opposite side of the stairs from zone in is a door and a hall to the second ring of cells.  If you snare a rat either in the second ring (I seem to find more dark blues there, for some reason, probably random chance) or in the first ring and run to that door, and then panic as it gets close, you'll find soloing a LOT easier there.  All I can say is that when you find it, you will know it, its some seriously odd pathing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haroun Zehra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How is the solo exp. on these at level 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's good at 60. At 61 it kinda sucks. I actually went back to FG and found the still dark blue shrooms to be better exp down there ..dunno why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zacknaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pestilence rats are the best exp in my opinion. They are the opposite way of the trial area. Just stay away from the steps and the Gaolers won't add on ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aerwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i did rats in poj from 56-60..with c3 i had no downtime whatsoever and was almost always FM. make sure to not wolf form as it makes stuff aggro you. <br />
<br />
also at the door that leads past the first square of cells if you fear rats there they path into the wall there and wont move even when not snared. actually you can pretty much fear  a rat from anywhere in poj and it will run to that wall and stay there. if you cant figure out the spot from my explanation just fear unsnared rats and follow them till they go to that spot<br />
<br />
be careful about attacking things when gaolers of justice around as they'll assist the mob your attacking but as long as you arent attacking anything they'll con indiff. theres also a prisoner this iksar named sralm noramir whos in a cell near the zone out who will assist npc's but normally cons indiff.</div></div><hr />
