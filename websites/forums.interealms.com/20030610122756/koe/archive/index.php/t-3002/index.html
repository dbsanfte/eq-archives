<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Haven't been able to play for the last week+ now and won't be able to get on (even though i really really want to) till i get my stupid computer working....<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it's my computer, or just the server down here at school - trying to talk to the server administers but i don't think they want to help anybody<br />
<br />
just fyi - also, gray if you want those arms back (since i might not be able to use them for a bit), or thez if you want anything back for the same reason (might not be able to use it for a bit) - then PLZ let me know via board here and i can get on to hand it off<br />
<br />
but fyi, i will continue playing once i get this working, i just don't know how long it will be - hopefully join yall when i get it goin<br />
<br />
also, if any of you have any ideas on what the problem plz let me know - the problem is that i have a hard time connecting and when i DO finally get in, it either hangs on char select screen OR it lets me into eq but i'm stuck with 70 to 100 percent packet loss guarenteed (it takes me like 3 min for me to send a tell to someone, that's how bad it is, so it's unplayable basically) (it was working fine one morning and then it wasn't working later that day)<br />
<br />
Good luck yall and hope to see you soon<br />
