<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phirebrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am posting here asking for advice on being evil.  I have been out of EQ for about a year now and am going to come back to the game.  (insert snide addict joke here) After talking with some friends I have decided to roll up a Shammy.  I don't want to play a Barb, and am leaning toward an Ogre right now.  Seeing as how i have never played an evil race I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
1). How difficult is it to fix factions?  Will leveling in Blackburrow from Lvl 5 to Lvl 10 be enough to get the Qeynos guards not to kill me on sight, will it take mroe than this.<br />
<br />
2). Are some race / class combos more diffiuclt to fix facation with than others.  ie Is it easier to fix a troll warrior faction than an orge shamman?<br />
<br />
3). Should I even care about faction?  Is it really that important to be able to bank somewhere nearby.  (when I played I always found in convient to just walk up to the FP bank...)<br />
<br />
4). Is there any website out there with a faction fixing plan.  By that I mean to bank in Kaladim do this, than that... etc.<br />
<br />
5). Are the drawbacks to being evil large enough that I, an admitantly inexpierenced EQ player, should think about making a Barb, or just say screw it and roll that sexy Halfling Drood.<br />
<br />
6). Finally what are some good lower level hunting grounds in the South.  I have been through both ther Feerot and Inny Swamp and of Course Guk, is there anything else that might be fun for a young shaman down there?<br />
<br />
Thank you so very much for your help I appreicate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Faction isn't that big of an issue.  With the last 2 expansions, there are cities that are open to everyone (Bazaar and Thurgadin).    I personally use Rivervale for all my banking, since its close to a druid portal.<br />
<br />
To get non-KOS in RV, buy several backpacks full of bandages.  Then go to the SE corner of Misty Thicket and find a hafling named Jogglo Honeybugger (or something similar).  Get wolf form (brings you to dubious), and start handing him bandages, 4 stacks of 4 at a time (16 each turn in).  After about 800-900 bandages, you should be non-kos in town.<br />
<br />
To bank in freeport, just kill guards in east/west fp.  This will gain you faction with the north freeport pallys.<br />
<br />
To bank in Kelethin, you need to kill massive numbers of orcs in Crushbone.<br />
<br />
Qeynos factoin is gained by killing Gnolls in BB, and also bandits in the Karanas.  Save the bandit sashes and give them to one of the pallys outside the S Qeynos Pally guild for some pretty nice faction hits (again, get wolf form to get non-kos to start).<br />
<br />
Last but not least, hunt in Stonebrunt and Warrens to gain faction to bank in Paniel.<br />
<br />
Or, just bind at the Nexus and use the Bazaar for all your banking needs and don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on level, faction goes from not very important to totally unimportant.<br />
<br />
As a troll or an ogre, you can level to lvl 8 in Innothule Swamp, then 12 in South Ro, then 16 in Oasis. At that point you can run over to any number of hunting spots. From like 16-20 on you could hunt in Luclin, where your race doesn't matter, and from about 30 on you can be in Velious, where your race doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
For faction, two factors enter into it: race and religion (and possibly class). As an evil race shammy you can't be agnostic, so you have the (fairly big) double faction whammy of being an evil race and of worshipping either Innoruk or Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you've been gone a year, you're going to find that the early levels go insanely fast now. Between not having to open the book to meditate, to increased exp bonuses pre lvl 10... you can probably ding 10 in a few hours, long before you'd kill enough things to fix faction.<br />
<br />
Hunting down south: South Ro and Innothule are probably the best. Feerott is now a lvl 20-40 zone on the island leading to Cazic-Thule, but still newbie level stuff the rest of the place. Rathe Mountains are fun but a map is a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you have Velious and Luclin? If so, most of the &quot;evil&quot; faction issues are not relevant in these areas. After spending much time making my Troll non-KOS in much of Ak'Anon, so that I'd have a place to bank and buy/sell on Faydwer, now I never go there because the Greater Faydark spires will take me straight to merchants and a bank. I haven't played in any of the lower-level Luclin zones yet, but from what I hear some of them are fantastic (i.e., Paludal Caverns).<br />
<br />
If you have the expansions, being evil just isn't that big of a deal anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I say don't worry about gaining faction with the good races.  If it happens from what you're already killing, good....if not, don't worry about it.  The only faction I would really think hard about getting is with north freeport.  The only reason is because of the portion of the epic quest that will have you wandering around up there.  I got this faction without even knowing it by killing orcs in east commons.  If you're gonna play an ogre, be evil, you don't need or want to go to the &quot;good&quot; towns!<br />
<br />
About the hunting grounds.  I say skip the Feerrott altogether, go straight to Innothule swamp to hunt.  I hunted in the Feerrott when I started my shaman but it is not a very good low level zone.<br />
<br />
Faction is all about how you look at it.  Having evil faction has it's benefits as well.  The gate hammer from the evil outpost in overthere is something many of the good races would kill for.<br />
<br />
There is also something I have observed with evil races that doesn't seem to happen with the neutrals or goods.  They tend to help each other.  When I run through a lower level zone I find myself buffing the evil players without even thinking about it.  It's like a strange kinship.  ESPESCIALLY between trolls and ogres.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I have been playing the game for 3 years now and all I do is play evil characters hehe, let me see if I can help you here.<br />
<br />
1) I would say maybe 5-15, I never raised qeynos faction however, why would you want to?<br />
<br />
2) Yes, Trolls are more hated by Ogre's, then the diety you choose which makes a large difference.  Also depends where you are raising Faction.<br />
<br />
3) I never did care about faction personally, why be evil?  One of the biggest joys I get is when I can kill all the goodie guards, the only Faction I worry about are Grobb, Ogguk, Neriak and VS (overthere).  Everything else I really dont care.  Also I can actually bank in NFP now after killing Sgt Slate in EC so many times. <br />
<br />
I never found it difficult to bank or anything, I guess because like I said I always played Evil but it can take some time getting use to changing sides.  Now with Luclin it is so much more easier for us evils, it wont be as bad as you think.<br />
<br />
4) I think their is a website, I dont know it however, you can ask here if you like and I am sure some will know but again, KILL THE DWARFS ! :)  Bah to goodie faction.<br />
<br />
5) Its just alittle more difficult, I suggest you do try an evil character to see if you enjoy it, look at the other side of the coin you know?  As you get higher in level it becomes less of a pain.<br />
<br />
6) Not much really, maybe South Ro, south Karana, Rath mountains, Lake Rathe, all varies by level.  The land of Everquest is huge now, I suggest when you hit level 14 to do some traveling and get out in the world, I say 14 because you get a nice upgrade in spells, bind is one of them and can be big help<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and play an evil character, give it a whirl, who knows you might enjoy it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ack.  This is going to be a LONG post!  :p  That's a lot of questions, and no short answers for the most part.  Also, before you select an ogre, you might want to read in some of the other threads about plusses and minuses on the races.  To be honest, as tough as they are, I'm not sure the additional 15% experience penalty is worth the advantages Ogres get.  I'd probably recommend a troll, or, if you are willing to accept the fact that you can't use a JBB, an iksar.  The regeneration trolls and iksar get is a substantial benefit, even if they DO both get a 20% penalty for exp.  Try reading through:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1029<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's long, and a bit off topic, but some people made some great posts comparing advantages and disadvantages of the races.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the questions:<br />
<br />
1) Fixing factions can be a royal pain in the posterior.  No question.  Some factions are unfixable.  First remark . . . Qeynos . . . why?  There is NOTHING around qeynos worth doing.  The guards in the Karana's don't see invis, and if you're a shaman, you can outrun them anyway.  Forget Qeynos.  You'll probably never go there!<br />
<br />
2) I think iksar have the worst faction.  I don't know if you can fix their faction for most places.  I believe you can do it for neriak (not positive about that as a shaman--I know monks can).  Most of the rest of the cities are a royal pain to even try.  However, you can fix most of the stuff in velious, and luclin.  Trolls and ogres have similar problems, though not, in my opinion, quite as bad.  It's gotten a bit worse since VI has added a couple of KoS mobs to the troll and ogre cities that kill the opposite race.<br />
<br />
3)  Whether or not you care about faction is a question of convenience.  If you don't mind being reduced to a few banks, and plan accordingly, then more power to you.  That's a personal call.  I've gotten used to my faction issues.<br />
<br />
4)  Try allakhazam.com for faction questions.  I think they have a part of the site that is devoted to faction questions and issues.  They also list mobs that increase or decrease factions.  Unfortunately, you have to know the name of a faction, and it may not always be clear--ie, know that ring of scale is kunark dragons, or know that claws of veeshan is velious dragon faction, etc.  Given that there are usually several factions within a city, this can get confusing.<br />
<br />
5) There really aren't that many problems with being large--especially since you are talking about playing a shaman.  You do get the shrink spell after all!  :)<br />
<br />
6)  Go to allakhazam.com and look at the &quot;levels&quot; section of the site.  They have a great level range chart.  It will help.  Best newbie zone is probably for the leezards in the Field of Bone.  However, that is really only a good choice if you are an iksar.  With the changes on bodies and not losing your equipment until 10, you can bind rush red mobs and exp to 10 very quickly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Good luck to you.<br />

<br />
With Spirit of Wolf, Scale of Wolf, and Spirit of Cheetah, bind, and gate at our disposal and now the nexus we can move from place to place rather quickly (I always mem SoC when I know I am going to be doing some traveling.... the refresh timer on it isn't too bad when you aren't paying attention to it).  <br />
<br />
Before Kunark, faction was an important consideration.  Now just don't even worry about it.<br />
<br />
The OverThere gating hammer is also another wonderful tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faction fixing:<br />
<br />
Take a friend who can cast Invis and head down to Neriak Third gate library: Inside is a DE with a taste for red wine. Hopefully you've brought along several BP's full of wine, you give 4 winesX4 boxes to the NPC..this makes you visible but not killable for some reason.  BEFORE YOU HIT THE 'TRADE' button have your friend re-cast invis on you.    <br />
<br />
A few stacks made me non-KOS to the librarian.  A few hundred more bottles got me to indifferent with the guards, and ALLY to the merchants.  I still had to gate out of 3rd gate due to the Cleric and Necro guild people..but I can bank in Neriak and shop at the merchants in 1st and 2nd quarters.  If you run out of wine before you run out of work to do..the Maiden's fancy is just around the corner..:)<br />
<br />
For freeport I killed orcs and turned in orc belts..I hear Janam and Rebby quests are useful as well for further factioning..but I never needed them.  (I still whack orc pawns and wandering orcs whenever I can)<br />
<br />
For Qeynos I killed Gnolls...I've only banked in Qeynos once..but it was a stop on my way to a Vox raid..so it was useful.  If you wait until you get Doggie, you can literally just jump off the top and let the doggie run free through Blackburrow eating gnolls all along the way...fun!<br />
<br />
Had I started an Ogre (I'm a lizard shammy) I'd probably have done the Bone chip quest in FoB for Cabilis banking access..it's VERY difficult..but I believe worshipping Cazic makes it easier.<br />
<br />
Banking and binding in Shadowhaven or the Bazaar probably makes factioning obsolete..unless you have a real need to be near EC.  I can't kill Crushbone orcs 'cause I don't want to mess up my Neriak faction..but it's theoretically possible to kill enough in there to bank in Kelethin and Kaladim..I've just never had the patience to put in the time, and then have to go back and do Neriak over again!<br />
<br />
The hardest cities to get faction in? Ogguk and Grobb.  If anyone knows a good way to get entrance into these cities let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I'm pretty much a faction junkie. I liked to work on faction so I would be accepeted in Qeynos and other places. (most places in qeynos; I cant go around the wizards/enchanters/mages. Hehe)<br />
<br />
For the most part, I did TONS of faction work in Blackburrow and the Old splitpaw (before they made it higher level). I couldnt possibly guess how many gnolls I've killed.<br />
<br />
I was dubious with Rivervale guards after spending TONS of hours in the old runnyeye (once again, before they made it higher level). Being non-kos in RV was just a side effect of killing in runnyeye; I wasnt really &quot;working&quot; on faction; it just happened. Although, I totally destroyed my RV faction when I started killing halfling guards for cash (they drop (or used to) regular spears and shields that will net about 13-17 plat per kill).<br />
<br />
I think most players nowdays don't bother with &quot;working&quot; on faction so much. Before Kunark was released, basically all i did was work on faction and camp Rathe Mountains for rares. :D<br />

<br />
Killing Crushbone Orcs lowers Indigo Brotherhood faction, which only affects your standing with the NPCs within the Dark Elf Warrior guild building. My Troll has been KOS to them for a long time (I had to kill D'Vinn for the Gatorsmash Maul quest, and I killed a bunch of orcs while I was waiting for him to spawn) and it's never affected my ability to travel through the rest of Neriak, and to bank there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being a Cazic Troll (nice undead fear neck), only faction I *REALLY* cared about was NFP ... No place like NFP for markets... <br />
<br />
The rest of the factions only matter when ya want something....<br />
<br />
Giants/COV/Thurg for armour(currently Kael for me)<br />
Eur Nek town(paineel??) for shammy cazic neck<br />
Merchants for food/water/bandaging (heh .. canni/regen/bandaging = FAST mana)<br />
<br />
NOTE:  I was KOS to OT(killed in KC) and FV(like an elf ever likes a Troll) .... and this presented a problem until I made them stoopid elves like me ... WHERE do I get my 50+(vendor and trade) spells??  Heh ... Just something to remember....</div></div><hr />

If you want to bank in Nfp, just help kill luclin. You'll still be KoS to the clerics, and bards, but they're easily avoidable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Angelok Wolvenspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1) Faction fixing ?  Wasdat ?  Keeel dem all!  hehe .. I never bothered. <br />
I killed a kazillion guards in East Karana .. making me rather KOS in Qeynos and I think in Halas too .. muhaha .. silly Barbs .. dey taste gud .. Hummies too btw .. with my special sauce. /smecks lips.<br />
Also killed a kazillion of Sisters of Erolissi in the OOT .. great exp from 14 to 35 .. watch out for the Uber buffed Styria .. she isnt fun anymore .. I used to solo her .. making my Druid buddy scream about how Shammies rocked .. he couldnt kill her .. well .. with ALOT of difficulties .. but not very effectivly.  <br />
Needles to tell .. the wood-elves can drink my blood now .. for killing all their Sisters .. who cares .. punny lil creatures .. dey taste a lil less then Gnomes.   Also killed the guards at the gate in East Freeport, before they got Uber buffed .. got 50 there .. before the level raise to 60.   Some Sir Lucan kills made me Non-KOS in North Freeport .. a nice side-effect I must say. :)<br />
<br />
Drifting off a bit .. to answer your question.  It didnt bother ME alot to be KOS in all but 3 cities (when I started my Shaman, EQ was only 1 month old).   I would bind in Grobb or Oggok .. go hunt in East Karana .. and when my BP's were loaded with stuff to sell .. I would zip back with Gate .. unload .. refresh SOW .. and race thru Rathe Mountains and Lake .. SK .. jump of the bridge in NK .. swim away from guards .. get on land and run along the shore to EK .. rinse and repeat.   You get used to it .. trust me. :)<br />
Later I would use Neriak alot when I was hunting in OOT.<br />
<br />
2) Its not Race / Class .. but rather Race / Religion.<br />
I had an easier time raising factions in Cabilis, since I'm a CT Shammie (you start off with a lower faction rating).  <br />
Actually .. Cabilis was the only faction that I cared about .. since I got sick of not being able to hunt with friends in KC and HS, due to the OT faction crap .. blah.  Now I got a rather nice base of operations in Kunark when I'm playing there .. well worth my time spent factioning.<br />
<br />
3) Kinda answered that in 1) :)<br />
<br />
4) Dunno .. maybe .. try one of the many SK websites .. they have to do alot of faction stuff to be able to move anywhere it seems.<br />
<br />
5) Drawbacks .. hmmm .. cant bank everywhere .. but you get used to that, as i said in 1) .. when I think of it .. I dont see any drawbacks.  I like playing a big ugly mofo (with manners tho .. I like to play my Troll as a more educated person .. like .. he doesnt do the Troll-Speech thingy .. he learned to speak common from my Monk .. his traveling buddy.  But dont get me wrong .. he is still Evil .. a bit .. except when with friends. :))<br />
<br />
6) Some people already summed them up.  I started in the Swamp as a young Trollie .. worked my way up to 9 in Upper Guk Zoneline .. soloing and grouping a bit .. we were all n00bs those days .. the server was young .. but great fun. :)  After that I moved to Qeynos, to deliver very sweet Woven stuff to my Monk (who was on the same account at that time) .. a very exciting event .. I think that I was one of the first Trolls to ever set foot in the Qeynos Hills .. and pulled a nice train of Hummies, Halflings and other puny creatures after me .. all wanting to see and touch me .. YUCK!  I gated back real quick .. being SOO FAR away from home was very frightening those days. :) <br />
<br />
I moved to South Ro .. since I live in Europe and not many people were on during the weekdays .. soo I needed to solo.  Later I went to the Oasis and spent alot of time there.  Round 16 .. i think i moved to East Karana, to hunt the (Undead) Reavers and other stuff that crawls there.  Then it was onward to OOT .. to kill those Sisters.  At 35 .. the Age of Pets made a BIG DEAL .. I traveled all over the place, finding places to solo or hunt with a group.  Onward .. you got ALOT of places to choose from.<br />
<br />
I hope you can get some usefull info from my rambling here.    <br />
Most important part is .. have fun with the character that you play .. make of it what YOU want .. as I said .. my char doesnt care about laws and regulations .. he just follows his own heart .. if you attack me .. you die .. you be nice to me .. you get free buffs and even a chat (the last part is mostly for PC's tho :)).<br />
<br />
Be safe!</div></div><hr />

The only god they can follow is Rallos Zek. Faction hasn't bothered me a lot in the last 2 plus years I've been playing, and I've never said &quot;boy I wish I could go visit those elves and dwarves&quot;. For Freeport and Qeynos till ya get to 29 and invis just use the sewers, one of the coolest and most underused parts of the game anyway. :) Luclin has changed everything with the public teleport system. The swamp is indeed great to lvl 8 ( dem froggies be rich, barsh em on the head and steal their shinies) but be warned, Ogre shamen are KOS to the beastmaster trainer in Grobb who happens to stand right next to the soulbinder and right in front of the bank.  OOT is indeed one of my favorite places in the game, teens with the sisters on sister isle, then come back around 25 or so up to the low 30's killing the Dwarves on the north-eastern shore and the named sisters by the docks, just be carefull of the Elf trainer, she hits really, really hard. :) Bring a spit and cook up the Dwarf and Elf meat ya get, it's allways fun to hand out to the elves and dwarves ya group with later. :) That's all I can think of for now, have fun and welcome to the Dark Side. :)</div></div><hr />
