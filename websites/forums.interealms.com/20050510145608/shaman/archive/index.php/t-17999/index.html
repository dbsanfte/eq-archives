<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah good point, deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hm, almost sounds too good to be true.  *pinch*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If that is true, I'm pretty sure SOE would not be too happy with that person, unless the deaths were caused by bugs which it sounds like is not the case.  <br />
<br />
I'd just keep my lips sealed and enjoy the fact that you had a nice CSR help your group out whether it was against SOE's policies or not ;)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I guess you could be dreaming this all up as Poguk said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, sounds like you all got a nice favor. You should probably return the favor and not say anything about it. (too late) Just from your post, you have the time and day it happened and what server. Wouldn't be hard for SOE to narrow down the possibilities.<br />
<br />
edit: of course, they wouldn't do anything just because of your post...if they even saw it. However, it would raise suspicion and possibly cause a hard time for the person who did it for you and I'm sure they wouldn't repeat their generosity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep was all a dream....all a dream .......know nothing and like it heh ;) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I once saw a GM. He went AFK in West Temple of Veeshan and got killed by my guild's pulls' aoe's. I think I still have a screenshot of his corpse around somewhere. Good times.</div></div><hr />
