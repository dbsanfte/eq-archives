<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In all my boredom of sitting on the ocean floor forever to talk to the greater spirit, I managed to hit the attack key and kill it before I could ask him about the next path (I know, stupid).  Anyways, am i hosed?  Can I talk to Ooglyn again and trigger this part, or do i have to go all they way back to FP and restart from there, or what?  Feeling really sick right now after sitting on the ocean floor that long only to one-hit kill the poor puppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would recommend heading back to Freeport to repeat the part that triggers the Test of Patience.<br />
<br />
The first time I did the quest I couldn't find where Ooglyn went.<br />
<br />
The second time I just wasn't patient.<br />
<br />
The third time everything worked fine.<br />
<br />
Haven't killed any spirits along the way, but I've been in groups where companions have and they reported no faction hits.  In the Shaman epic faction &gt; all.  If you didn't experience a faction loss, no big deal.  Just head to FP, and prepare for another camp.<br />
<br />
And be sure to bring that shark repellant.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You do not have to be in the water. You can lev above the water at the spot or even sit on the shore. The whole thing is scripted and your presence is not required. You only have to be there when the spirit pops. That is the only required interaction in the test of patience. Just give Ogglyn the gem and wait about 25-30 mins then go to the spot where the test is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One other thought:  I am not sure about the faction hits for killing a spirit doggie (can't be too bad, cause I did it a few times before I knew it was part of my epic).  However, you may want to do the first step a couple of times to make up for any lost faction.  Each step of the epic quest checks faction, and if yours isn't high enough, it could mess up.  You're probably okay, but it can't hurt to make sure.  Maybe do the first gem quest a couple of times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didn't get any faction hits for skewering poor doggie.  In my frustration, I even tried talking to it's corpse, but alas, it had nothing to say.  Guess it's back to FP then again to get another gem, good thing I got great guildies or it'd be a long haul.<br />
<br />
As for the sharks, they were all green to me at 38, didn't see any higher ones, so not sure why they recommend a lvl 49 solo in the quest guide, unless there's some other stuff down there that dared not show it's face to an angry kitty.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the replies, I'm not too happy about doing it all again, but next time I check to make sure the text cursor is blinking, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Inqubus, the sharks are all green.  However, the Killer Sharks are a good bit tougher.  That's why they recommended the level 49.  Also, when the guide was written (if you are using Belgar's) the killer sharks saw through invis.  I believe that has now been changed so that they don't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Managed to get a guildie to port me to WC and another to port me to Toxx and managed to finish the most boring part of this quest. Got to take Glaron and Tabien also and get my Shield of Falsehood all at 38.  Thanks for the advice and reassurance i hadn't hosed meself.  /me shows off his new Atari shield.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they still see through invis. They ate me tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah some can see through invis, I saw some Killer sharks swim by and not bat an eye practicly swimming through me, then others jumpped me from behind with invis on.<br />
<br />
Was able to complete this last night though with only 1 death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tried the test of patience without any invis spells and had to leave because I was on my 3rd killer shark and oom.  I read somewhere that invis to animals worked so I made sure to keep that on me at all times.  It worked marvelously as sharks pathed right next to me several times.   Was able to complete test of patience with no aggro from the sharks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I brought my level 53 druid friend and he just kept me and him invis, and only 1 killer shark pathed by us, and we whooped it. He also helped me on black dire, &quot;solo&quot; (His 52 epic ranger, 53 druid, and 60 epic cleric).</div></div><hr />
