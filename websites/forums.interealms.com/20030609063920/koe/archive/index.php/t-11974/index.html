<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thrug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There comes a time in every person's life when RL must take priority for awhile. Well my time is coming here soon in a month, maybe more maybe less. I have attained every goal I have set so far to include reaching level 65. I have but one left unreached and I wish to ask for help. I want my epic. I need left is but 2 things. The stuff in the hole, the PoH drop, and the PoF drop. I am formally asking for the help of people to finish the steps in the hole. and for one good group to help me farm PoH for a decrepit hide. I want nothing more than my epic before having to take a 4-6 month break due to military stuff. I have no dates set as of yet. Only 3 parts of epic are event needed. PoF golems, the hole, and the final battle. I ask for your help my friends in reaching my final goal for now, I am not quiting eq...merely trying to accomplish all my immediate goals before i must leave for awhile. <br />
