<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who don't know: A few days ago someone, somewhere, somehow got ahold of an Alpha version of WoW. Apparently now the files are floating around out there on the net. As of the last update I read they can get into the character creation screen and check out the classes/descriptions/etc as you would with your EQ character creation screen. <br />
<br />
IMHO this is pretty ****ty :(. I know, they can't do anything without a source code (that's correct, isn't it?), but I'm sure some dipwad will crack it and set up a single player to run around or something. I'm not sure how far they can go with it...but it seems so damn wrong. Just let the game come, patience sometimes pays off. Maybe this will push Blizzard to crackdown on cheaters/hackers and what not, even though there was no real &quot;cheating&quot; involved here.<br />
<br />
There is a .zip of the WoW mp3's on a few sites if any of you are interested in sampling the music, although I don't know how many of you would consider it to be a bad thing to do.<br />
<br />
I don't plan on linking any sort of WoW material for download, don't ask.<br />
<br />
What do you all think of this whole thing? More importantly, do any of you care? ;) I wasn't tuned into the EQ Alpha/Beta, was there a concern back then that this would happen or was EQ so far ahead of it's generation that there were no real worries?<br />
<br />
Discuss :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back then not very many people knew about Everquest, or were in on the beta.  I only heard about it through a friend who was hard core into role playing games, and from another friend who had played Ultima.   Neither of them seemed too psyched about it but we all gave it a shot anyway (just after beta). <br />
<br />
There wasn't a huge concern for hackers, because the beta was pretty much open for anyone who was interested.   Before beta I don't think anyone cared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What a outrage, this is horrible. I cant believe the scum that are on this planet. Grrr, makes me wanna smack someone. Brb i need to get a drink and calm down.<br />

What ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dosent matter seeing how there is no server to connect to. Personly I think the so called &quot;Leaked Alpha&quot; is a bunch of BS. I have seen 20 billion threads about this in the last few days. But no links, no information, nothing substantal. Frankly I think someone thought it would funny (or is just a lier) and said that it had been &quot;Leaked&quot;. Then the good old romer mill took it from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard released some WoW mp3's a while back. You can find them at http://www.blizzard.com/wow/movies/#music</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't Aradune's PC get hacked a while back?  EQ has had it's share of catastrophies as well.  In the end the game designer can always modify and adapt.  There is at least one server to connect to ATM, but I imagine there has to be a logon server and with no account it's all pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is not a fake or a rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oops, wrong thread, disregard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Friend downloaded something that claims to be the WoW alpha.  Also claims to be in an irc channel somewhere where people claim they are &quot;playing&quot;.  Lot of claims, little proof I've seen of anyone getting it working.  I'd assume if they are it's just a single player run around type thing.<br />
<br />
I don't think much harm will come of it, but hopefully it will prompt blizzard to do some stuff about the rampant cheating and hacking that goes on in their games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for you non believers, http://home.no/lagra/   personally it pisses me off because I want to play the game, legally and as a finished product, and there is no way this is going to help push the release date foreward, only move it back..</div></div><hr />
