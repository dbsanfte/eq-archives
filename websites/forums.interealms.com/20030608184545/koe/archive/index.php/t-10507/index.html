Thug, if you don't want to spend 150+ dollars on a video card, I would recommend a GeForce 3 TI 200 64MB DDR. It's not as nice as the GeForce 4 that Jice recommends, I agree that's a bad ass card, but the GeForce 3 isn't something to complain about either. That's what I run and I run everything at full with full clipping plane and everthing and no lag, just have to drop my clipping plane in some places like the plane of lag (knowledge), the plane of KEI/Aego (nexus), the plane of ub3r lag (bazaar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Card Im sugggesting sells for $120 online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still kinda up there Jice. I agree it's a great card, but the card I recommend is half that. Either way Thrug wants to go, $$$ vs. perfomance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thrug if you want to keep it under $50 and on the cheap, go to Ebay and look for deals on a Geoforce 2 card. I got a Geoforce 2 mx200 for about $23 and it is running on my second pc. If you can afford a little over $100 then the Geoforce 4 4200 is the best bang for the bucks these days. Prices on them have fallen dramatically. Still a little high on the 4400s but they are dropping too.<br />
<br />
Does your pc have an AGP slot or do you need a pci card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The 4200 also will still be a good card a year from now, wherass the Ge Force 2s are laggy POSes by comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Jice<br />
<br />
I have a GeForce 4Ti 4600 on my main PC and I play EQ with all detail turned on.  On my secondary PC I have a GeForce 2MX with everything turned off.  I HIGHLY recommend staying as far away from anything that says MX as possible.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the Geforce 4 was upgraded from a 3 that did a decent job itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stay away from MX cards.  Far, far away.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Geo3 cards do fine, but as Jice said a year from now you will be looking to replace again.  Think about longevity before you roll your eyes at an extra $40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thrug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">40$ be alot of money when you're trying to buy smokes, pay off an engagement ring, the bitch! but i'm not gonna get into that. and you're only working partime and tryin pay bills not workin too well hehe. i like this geforce 3 idea. what kinda slot i have for a vid card? how the hell do i figure that one out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You need an AGP slot (the brownish looking slots) for any of the newer good video cards. There are PCI versions, but you are not going to get nearly the performace if you have AGP. They can run at  AGP 1x or 2x depending on the brand, but prefered AGP 4x. This is basically the speed/generation of the AGP slot on your motherboard. What is your motherboard/processor? Pentium II, Pentium 3, Pentium 4, AMD K6-2, AMD K6-3, Athalon, Athalon XP? What's the Mhz of the processor? How much ram do you have? Rrguardless of the video card you want 512MB of ram to reliably run the new models. I personally have a gig of PC133 SDRAM and an AMD Athalon 850 with the GeForce 3 TI 200.<br />
<br />
P.S. I completely AGREE, the MX series is CRAP. Don't fall into the marketing trap, the GeForce 3 TI 200's are better by FAR than the GeForce 4 MX series. GeForce 4 TI series rocks, but the MX is CRAP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Enmity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recommend you stay away from the GeForce 4 ti4200 series... I had one from Gainward.... no overclocking, lian li 5 fan aluminum case... awesome cooling, and I had the wierdest freezing/heat problem.  They're all having this problem as I've heard from serveral sources.... Look around and get a ti4600 mis-priced, cheap =P, and from PNY (lifetime warranty (sp?))</div></div><hr />
