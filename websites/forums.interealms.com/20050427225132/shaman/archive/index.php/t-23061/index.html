<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard recently that most of the trash mobs in GoD no longer summon.<br />
<br />
1) Is this correct?<br />
<br />
2) Which zones are best to root rot?<br />
<br />
Anyone tried it regularily?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only named last time I was there a few days ago.  Trash mobs still stand there while I cast spells on them and look angry :D<br />
<br />
Ado</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've soloed in Qinimi, Ferubi, Sewers, and Vxed. For all these zones, I solo at a zoneline. Not totally certain but that is the order also for least to most exp as well as least to most risk. Please correct me if someone has noticed something that I missed.<br />
<br />
Qinimi = trash mobs do not summon and go down in very little time with BoU, BoS, Bane, and Epic refresh as needed. If you have good gear and Defensive AAs you could even tank and have Dogdog do its thing. Not recommended though. I get 4% AA exp on average per kill.<br />
<br />
Ferubi = trash mobs do not summon only named summon. Do not recommend moving far from zoneline due to see invis mobs, respawn, and roamers. You will have to use a root/zone tech to split first two mobs at any zoneline. BEWARE THE ROAMING DEMENTED UKUN DOG LOOKING THING, moves fast, hits fast and hard, and roots! Usually BoU(x1), BoS(x3), Bane(X3), and Epic(X1/2) will do the trick (Add in Spirit Call or any other tricks that you may have to speed this along). Do not recommend tanking or letting em touch you at all unless High HPs and Full Def AAs, they can and will eat you alive. I get 6% AA on avg per kill. <br />
<br />
Sewers = Pools and Crematory are best to solo in. Steer clear of Plant. Ensure you get trial from Gamesh for soloing, mobs tend to hit for less. Ghosts, stonemites and golems(?) summon, golems are unslowable so just leave em alone. Have not tried a named in Sewers solo yet, but all summon. Trash takes same DoT lineup as Ferubi to kill maybe a little less. I get 6%-7% on avg per kill.<br />
<br />
Vxed = Good write up here http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21409  by Beawolf. All I can say is just don't get hit!!! If you get stonemites or craigs at entrance get a new trial, because both summon = you dead/in need of new change of shorts. I get 10-12% AA exp on avg per kill.<br />
<br />
By far my two fav solo spots are Ferubi and Vxed. Ferubi when I want some quiet, very little risk soloing. Vxed when I want a constant on edge challenge with great exp. Also in Ferubi, Sewers, and Vxed there is a chance (rare) of some really nice loot off the trash mobs. This may not answer all the questions, but hopefully it will clear some things up. Also depending on gear/AAs amount of time per kill may vary obviously. I'm by no means well geared and I make use of the tribute system for the foci I lack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flobedeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman tanking in Qinimi is not a problem even with just 5.1k hp, mobs dont summon mostly slowable, and at ZL and the hounds (keep pet on hounds) near ZL you have the chance of 3 nameds, One a named bloodbeast, and the other two from the wanderers that come down near ZL, They are a REAL challenge as they summon and one uslowable and other only partial (sorry for the lack of links and such, I aint got time to do them atm) off the furthest of the two noks at ZL there are a pair of ND haste gloves that drop as well 31% +agi dex str and some resists if memory serves correct.<br />
<br />
Riwwi WAS uber solo grounds till they nerfed it, but I have heard rumours that not all the nameds there summon but I'm not sure which if any :/<br />
<br />
But if its AA xp you're after, Vxed everytime</div></div><hr />
