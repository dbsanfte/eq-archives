<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alchemy has the potential to be an extremely beneficial tradeskill. Unfortunately, Verant obviously doesn't care enough to make it that way. I just want to get some ideas out of how to make it more useful to people, and more viable to make profit for the Shaman.<br />
<br />
+Stats Potions: These stack with everything. Could follow a &quot;Lesser/Greater&quot; sort of evolution. IE: Lesser Potion of Vitality is +25 HP, and the Greater Potion of Vitality is +75 HP. A gaurenteed hot spot in alchemy if they ever put it live. In addition, this should work with all other statistics. Not too much per potion to prevent overpowering... but really, what tank could resist carrying around a 10-dose potion that adds 20 to STA, or 100 to HP... which stacks with everything?<br />
<br />
Component-Free Utility Potions (Think the current ones require a component...): Levitate, Enduring Breath, Gate. Bind Affinity, and any others I forgot. IMHO, Bind Affinity could be one that requires a lot of extremely rare components and a maximized skill. Gaurenteed seller for tanks tired of running from cities. To sum it up, would revitalize the skill.<br />
<br />
Improved Port Potions: Port to a lot of places besides the ones granted. Put in an extremely difficult potion that ports someone to the Nexus from anywhere... and there you go, a hot seller. More locations would not hurt either, besides the 3 or 4 destinations potions are currently limited to. Heck, make potions that drop you at any spire in Norrath!<br />
<br />
Offensive Potions: Anyone remember UO? Throwing potions at people was always fun. And if that doesn't seem viable, there could be other offensive aid potions. The DS is good, but there should be more. There should be a potion for a combat proc of some sort, perhaps a potion that absorbs melee damage per-hit, a SpellShield style potion, etc. IE: &quot;Potion of Flickering Flame&quot; could give you a chance to proc a fire-based 50DD each hit.<br />
<br />
Raising the skill cap for some of the newer potions would be good too (the clarity ones come to mind.) I would personally not open it up to cap at 250 until level 50, though... I've always enjoyed that only the highest-level Shamans can max Alchemy. Should keep it that way.<br />
<br />
I would rather have a series of great potions that are difficult to make (a'la the new tradeskilling revamp), over the current selection of easy potions to make that simply don't do anything useful to anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like you have some good ideas. But i think alchemy should be in second for an upgrade. Posions need a long upgrade, i wouldn't say this, but the one you suggested(offensive ones) would be waaay better then posions. Cause a posion is like 5pp for one snare, only on your first hit agaisnt a mob, AND it can be resisited. <br />
But yah, i would like the see the stats buff potions and hp, but the gate type ones would be too much, and you can always find a porter, and if you can't just use gate. The componet free ones seem like a good idea, but enduring breath, i just go to a magician cause im too lazy to fish. They summon EB potions(no componet) and levi rings(i think no componet).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on how you look at it, it already is, or never will be.  After a certain point in skill, you can pretty much count on a 100% profit on SoW pots.  And 30-40% on the rest of the commonly bought potions (ITU/EB/Lev/Shrink/etc).  <br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin, until the pricing on components fall more in line with the actual utility of the potion, the high end stuff will never be overall profitable.  At 54, I surely would not pay 100+ pp for a breeze, or even clarity.<br />

<br />
<br />
Some of these already exist, a la old world alchemy.  And they are insta-click.  We also have 2 different mod-rod style potions, among others.<br />
<br />
In my mind, it is doubtful we will ever see either a bind or craftable gate potion.  Sure, bind is nice to make a few PP off of in CB or FP, but after a while, that tank is going to start to have to group.  And any caster in that group not willing to bind at the nearest available location isn't worth having.<br />
<br />

<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
If you are going to use the UO comparison, why not just make a rune book, that is rechargable via scroll.  And usable by anyone<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
As a 54 Barbarian Shaman, from the Nexus, I can - gate to bind, gate to Thurgadin, gate to Everfrost (spiritstone), Portal to NK, DL, GFay, GD and Toxx... pretty much within reach of anywhere I need to go in a matter of 15 minutes or less.<br />
<br />
For a small donation, can be ported to any wizard or druid spot, with little effort on my part.  What more do we want, or need?  The only gate potions worth persuing are FoB and Inny... for easier access to EJ/CoM/TT/Seb, etc, or CT.  How much more convenience do we want?  How far do you want the scales of imbalance to be pushed for that convenience?<br />
<br />
<br />
I would rather have a series of great potions that are difficult to make (a'la the new tradeskilling revamp), over the current selection of easy potions to make that simply don't do anything useful to anyone. <br />
<br />
Our potions are all usable.  Beyond the damage shields, none of the high skill ones are affordable, either to make in bulk, or to sell.  I would prefer they remove the negative stats from what we have, and bring the component prices more in line with the utility of the spell itself, to make it a buyable product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">minor upgrade potions for cheap.  easy to mass produce, easy to sell, convenient for buyers.  Make minor haste potions, lets say 10% haste for 10min, for 5pp.  small damage shield, like your level but capped at 5, lasts 3min, 2pp each.  Not potions that will do anything revolutionary but can be used in everyday playing to enhance a character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good points.<br />
<br />
I'll sum up what I'd like to see availiable from Alchemy:<br />
<br />
1.) +HP, +STA, and +AC Potions that stack with EVERYTHING, no alternative statistic penalties. Other stats would not hurt either.<br />
<br />
2.) Reasonable mind potions... higher success rates and longer durations.<br />
<br />
3.) Utility potions that many have to rely on other classes for... such as ports, binding, gating. Invisibility should be an alchemy-crafted potion, so non-invis classes come to us for their supply.<br />
<br />
These would really increase the value of Alchemy. Right now, all of the variations of these have no real value on the market... other class spells can accomplish a superior effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">right now alchemy is only good if you are in a guild and the guild needs potions(holy god those ds potions are nice).  The only reason I raised my skill was for the guild and the guild provided the funds for it.  Some of the potions are nice, but just to expensive to make mass quantities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These exist.  Try making Greater Concentration potion with maxed alchemy + Philosopher's Stone.  60% success rate.  The effect is like FT3, lasts 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, VI's solution to the 180 skill cap on alchemy is a real crock.  Someone had the idiotic notion to make one of the shaman class AA skills Alchemy Mastery.  Who in their right mind is going to waste 18 AA points on this stupid skill so they can make a stack of potions that cost 1800pp that no one will buy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would be nice to see a complete heal potion that's instant cast.  It would change the face of alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is one Ryse, it's called Stinging wort.<br />
 <br />
<br />
When stacked, it's a 3k heal over the time it takes to cast 10 instants -300hp over 6 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grezaer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After reading the posts I must say that I agree and that I have felt the same way for some time.<br />
Why not give potions better stats at higher skill levels to get <br />
more people active in Alchemy.<br />
Other reasons I think Alchemy isn't profitable is simple, why pay for potions when you can /ooc and find someone willing to cast the buff or spell on you? I know this isn't always possible, but I think people don't look at it that way. Also I feel sow potions should be able to work indoors.<br />
Other ideas, keeping in mind shaman powers seem to stem from <br />
animals:<br />
<br />
 Potion of Playing Possum ( Feign Death )<br />
<br />
 Potion of Chameleon ( invis to all, animal, dead. npc - except ones that see invis )<br />
<br />
 Potion of Ursa Major ( the celestial bear - teleport to luclin )<br />
<br />
 Potion of the Vampire Bat ( casts the SK spell Vampric Embrace - life tap proc ) etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe if we can get a uniformed list of 10-20 hgh skill level potions and start a petition maybe just MAYBE we can get them <br />
to add some new potions to the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, be glad we're not rogues.  Alchemy is a dream compared to a rogue's poison difficulties.  (In my opinion.)<br />
<br />
There's a couple general complaints I see about Alchemy.<br />
1.)  Too expensive for the effects.<br />
2.)  No demand for the effects.<br />
3.)  Much easier/cheaper to get the effects elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Ideally, it would be nice to have Alchemy be a tradeskill that is both profitable AND highly effective.  Unfortunately, both paths can be realized with precious few potions only (Blood of the Wolf, or Ant's Potion, for example).  Overall, though, most shamans pick one or the other (profit vs. effective potions) to pursue as an Alchemist.  One of my shaman friends absolutely LOVES alchemy as a profit machine.  His skill is only about 80 I think, but he's made a ton of money with the skill just selling the profitable/in demand potions.  (Personally I think it would be boring to make just sows, shrinks and ITU, but it's a viable option!)<br />
<br />
If Verant was going to make it both a profitable and effective skill though, a combination of some of these suggestions might work:<br />
a)  Make more potion effects be based on the level of the drinker<br />
b)  Make components cheaper (at least closer to the value of the effect)<br />
c)  Add more of the components to mob loot tables<br />
d)  Increase durations to many of the effects<br />
e)  Do away with so many of the negative effects of potions<br />
f)  Get rid of the potion vendors (i.e. I hate that people can buy heal/invis potions but we can't make them!)<br />
g)  Or at least allow us to make those potions too!<br />
h)  Add damage potions for range/ammo slot (throw a DoT or DD!)<br />
i)  I'd love to see a snare or root potion, too, but I suppose I'm dreaming.<br />
<br />
Or... just leave it the way it is.  All other tradeskills have a lot of useless (or certainly not cost-effective) items produced that no one will ever buy ~ that is certainly not unique to Alchemy.  The biggest difference is that there are high-level items in the other skills that have a market, whereas our high-level items no one will pay that much for (more than once anyway)!  i.e. 1k for 10-dose Breeze!?  Overall, the skill is a fun and useful skill once you figure it out.  It's just costly to skill up with no real quantifiable reward for having a max skill.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have worked my skill up to the point where I am trivial at shrink potions. I and am also still looking for the next economically viable potion to continue increasing my skill with, and would love to see more such potions introduced into the game, but here are several thoughts about potions in general from my limited experience, since this is my first, and main character in EQ<br />
<br />
First, with regard to cost of potions. I agree with Mitrian and others above. The cost to produce many potions at the high end of our skill level prices them right out of viability for the benefit of their effect, even though all our potions except ITA do stack with any spell giving the same benefit<br />
<br />
Smiths can make any armor sold by NPC vendors I think. Fletchers can make any product a NPC vendor sells. Why can Shaman not make any potion that a NPC sells?<br />
<br />
It seems VI has tiered spells into three levels, (1-22, 23-44, 44+) with regard to focus effects. I think that could be a natural breakdown for players getting additional benefits from potions we might make other than the Kilva's line.<br />
<br />
As much of an economic boon as snare, root, dd, dot, ect potions would be to us, they unfortunately are not logical effects that a person would gain from drinking a potion. Seems to me that the effect should be directed upon the person drinking the potion, and giving them the ability to cast it upon something else ruins the internal logic of alchemy <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You are quite right, Abividad, with regards to a potion that affected someone else (roots, snares, etc) - that really would go against what alchemy is all about.  The only reasonable logic there is if it's a thrown potion, but even then it's probably a stretch.<br />
<br />
Maybe we could hire a grandmaster fletcher to make us a bow that squirts?!  /snicker<br />
<br />
Well, like I said, I'm probably dreaming.  It would be great to see some of the other ideas actually incorporated though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stinging Wort potions are Balm Leaf (35-40p, gypsy vendors, and a vendor in SH) + Ice Giant Toes (off of--you guessed it--ice giants and Gornit).<br />
<br />
The effect is &quot;Calillimony&quot; and is +17 Str, +300hp.  It's instant-cast.  The 300 hp buff is a max-hp buff and 300hp heal (like Altuna, etc) but you start losing the extra hp capacity shortly.<br />
<br />
I've heard that it's a 300hp dot as well, but I've not looked that closely at it.  Usually I've got Regrowth on, which far outstrips the couple of hp per tick that you might lose.<br />
<br />
You can stack this on top of regen spells, but you cannot stack regen spells on top of this.<br />
<br />
I use it in 5-shots (when I can afford it) as a security blanket when I'm off soloing.  Nice having a 1500hp instant heal in your pocket.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK heres how calimony works.... I know because I carry a 10 charge on every twink I play as well as my 60 shaman. They are absolutely the GREATEST get out of a crappy situation free card EVER! They are insta cast ( IE while you run you can cast this)!<br />
<br />
One dose gives you 300 HPs on a DoT decline. This means that it raises your HP total 300 points (ex you have 2000 hps, you chug one you now have 2300 total Hps)  Immediatly you will begin to loose the added HPS at a rate of 10 HPs per tick for 5 min (at the end of the 5 min you would be back to your original 2000 HPs)<br />
<br />
The heal effect from Chugging a 5 dose comes in this way. You take the above 2000 HPs. You finish a fight at 500 HPs. You drink one dose this would raise your total Hps to 2300 and your actual health to 800. Taking another charge immediatly (before the dot decline takes effect) Will NOT raise your total HPs again but it WILL raise your health another 300 points bringing you to 2300 total but now you are at 1200 health (500 + 300 + 300). Now at this point the numbers would start to drop slightly because of the DoT decline but for the sake of the excersise we will freeze time. Chugging another potion would take you to 1500 health again with your total HPs staying at 2300. <br />
<br />
The heal comes into effect because the DoT decline ONLY effects the extra 300 hps on the total, regardless of your health.<br />
<br />
Chugging a 5 charge would give 1500 HPs (also adding 300 to your total available HPS that would be on a dot decline)<br />
<br />
SOOOoooooo your 2000 HP guy. Hes at 200 health chugs a 5 charge hes now at 1700 health with an added 300 HPs (2300 total) that will drop at 10 HPs a tick till he comes back to 2000 HPs and the effect drops. The healed HPs are NOT effected unless hes actually healed to the full 2300 then you will see hte total HPs drop slowly but hes not damaged, hes just loosing the total possible.<br />

<br />
But we will gladly pay 100 pp for KEI.  Verant gives enchanters a 40000 pp spell that pays for itself in a weekend, but gives shaman the dream of a useful potion, but at the exact same time destroys the market for them.  Gotta love Verant and their even handed treatment of classes.<br />
<br />
I have a suggestion however.  Give us a spell that when casts gives us a quantity of herbs off the alchemy table.  usable only outdoors of course. Different herbs found in different zones like with druids and foraging.  In effect this would be a casting based forage for items.  Its not like shamanic peoples dont go looking for their herbs.  Before Verant has a fit, remember that we dont get any real money selling the potions back as it is now so if we blow our mana for an herb off the table, we certainly wont be destroying the market with a flood of cheap potions.  The mana would be more profitably used to hunt but this has posibilities. <br />
This spell is more thematic but would give us a downtime way to help our hobby.<br />
<br />
If implemented, I would have a successful casting yield more of the herb based on the level of the caster.  Like you found a patch of wild ______).  At L60 you find 20, at L19 you find 1-5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">+Stats Potions: These stack with everything. Could follow a &quot;Lesser/Greater&quot; sort of evolution. IE: Lesser Potion of Vitality is +25 HP, and the Greater Potion of Vitality is +75 HP. A gaurenteed hot spot in alchemy if they ever put it live. In addition, this should work with all other statistics. Not too much per potion to prevent overpowering... but really, what tank could resist carrying around a 10-dose potion that adds 20 to STA, or 100 to HP... which stacks with everything? <br />
<br />
~18pp for some marginal stat effects currently. Too expensive. Too marginal effect. Buff slots are prime real estate. Cut the cost in half. Take away the negative effects. <br />
<br />
Component-Free Utility Potions (Think the current ones require a component...): Levitate, Enduring Breath, Gate. Bind Affinity, and any others I forgot. IMHO, Bind Affinity could be one that requires a lot of extremely rare components and a maximized skill. Gaurenteed seller for tanks tired of running from cities. To sum it up, would revitalize the skill. <br />
<br />
Component free lev and enduring breath are IN GAME. VI discussed bind potions for alchemy before and said no, they didn't want one class to monoplize it... hence sould binders. Gate would rock. But they put it in for pottery, kinda.<br />
<br />
Improved Port Potions: Port to a lot of places besides the ones granted. Put in an extremely difficult potion that ports someone to the Nexus from anywhere... and there you go, a hot seller. More locations would not hurt either, besides the 3 or 4 destinations potions are currently limited to. Heck, make potions that drop you at any spire in Norrath! <br />
As above.<br />
<br />
Offensive Potions: Anyone remember UO? Throwing potions at people was always fun. And if that doesn't seem viable, there could be other offensive aid potions. The DS is good, but there should be more. There should be a potion for a combat proc of some sort, perhaps a potion that absorbs melee damage per-hit, a SpellShield style potion, etc. IE: &quot;Potion of Flickering Flame&quot; could give you a chance to proc a fire-based 50DD each hit.  <br />
Doesn't sound like alchemy. Can make proccing weapons in high-end smithing now.<br />
<br />
Raising the skill cap for some of the newer potions would be good too (the clarity ones come to mind.) I would personally not open it up to cap at 250 until level 50, though... I've always enjoyed that only the highest-level Shamans can max Alchemy. Should keep it that way. <br />
No way do i want to spend another fortune getting skill to 250. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Alchemy could be fine if they just lowered the cost.<br />
The effects are great:<br />
hp regen<br />
haste<br />
buffs<br />
resists<br />
mana regen<br />
utility potions<br />
...and on and on<br />
<br />
The only reason they are not used is because they are too darn expensive. Cut the costs in half. Take away the negative effects on the buff potions.</div></div><hr />

Who really knows how to use alchemy?  The shaman that made potion.  Sure some potions should be made for sale...  the less powerful potions, but I also think there should be potions that only shaman can use on themselves or others.  IE. some of you have talked about CH potions. That would be fine and dandy, but I think it should be shaman usable only, and that we could cast it on another char.  Extra HP/AC buff potions could be used in the same maner.  The potions that we can make that are pretty good...  DS, Regen...  Make a version that is just as powerful, cheaper to make, and that can only be used by shaman.  I think this would make me feel much better about getting my alchemy skill up to 180.  I also think that if there were shaman use only potions, you would see a lot more shaman working on their alchemy skill and even possibly working toward that extra AA needed for mastery.<br />

HoS/FoS in a can!<br />
<br />
This one seems perfectly reasonable to me.  It's something we could cast.  HoS lands on all-level characters, and FoS could be made prohibitively expensive but possible, for those high levels in need/want a little something extra.<br />
<br />
I also think there absolutely, positively needs to be a Shar Vahl gate potion.  This one is probably coming, just slowly.<br />
<br />
The guy at the fan faire in Boston didn't seem too enthused with adding new potions (until Planes of Power, when he said MANY will be added) but seemed very open to decreasing component cost and increasing buyback price.  Maybe we'll catch a break soon...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is what I'd like to see, Illusion potions!<br />
Maybe something that does an illusion and an effect. Like a potion that gives you haste, atk and regen and turns you into a bear. Another potion that increases your run speed faster than sow (useful for traveling) but wears off like scale of wolf when you attack or cast, and turns you into a wolf. How about a potions that simulates the necro line of hp-&gt;mana convert spells, and turns you into a skeleton. Or a potion that adds a magic dd proc, lifetap or something to melee and turns you into an imp. Or how about a long lasting ultravision/see invis and dark elf form? Only problem with these is that once you zone, you'll lose the illusion and the buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now a lot of the above suggestions are good but a balance needs to be struck between the potions and balanicing the effects.</div></div><hr />

Or, for Great Divide, the 10pp I've spent on pottery to make a Thurg Gate Potion. :rolleyes:<br />

What I'd like to see (besides viable stat potions, an Invis potion, and overall cost reduction) is the ability (for any tradeskill really) to combine STACKS of ingredients.  Put 20 birthwort, 20 fenugreek, 20 wolves' blood in the Medicine Bag and combine, and get back (20-failures) Blood of the Wolf.  Damn would that be nice to my fingers.  They'll never do it, of course... lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As well as Stinging Wort potions, there is an old recipe, lighter heal per click, but pretty sure it is also insta cast (most old recipes were).<br />
<br />
  This one uses warbone chips (I think that was it) and if I can remember where I found them, I am certain they were more common than IG toes ever have proven to be.    The single herb with those may be in that same 30p area though :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Clawsor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I didnt really read all of the replys 5ppfor a snare would rock Alchemy costs lots and  About offensive potions that would be cool but we dont really need em We have spells we can have little ones like makes us proc stun or root or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Im surprised no one has mentioned one thing that I have noticed.  While the DS is a great potion, the haste ones suck.  The DS ones last longer and do more damage the higher level the character is.  The haste ones seem to be at a fixed haste...about the same as alacrity for the higher end one, and a fairly short fixed duration...about 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Something that would make the haste potions sell would be to make them like the DS potions.   Make the high end one have a level/2+x duration and a haste of level+x.  Considering the cost, why shouldnt a haste potion be almost as good as high-end chanter haste?</div></div><hr />

I have a suggestion however.  Give us a spell that when casts gives us a quantity of herbs off the alchemy table.  usable only outdoors of course. Different herbs found in different zones like with druids and foraging.  In effect this would be a casting based forage for items.  Its not like shamanic peoples dont go looking for their herbs.  Before Verant has a fit, remember that we dont get any real money selling the potions back as it is now so if we blow our mana for an herb off the table, we certainly wont be destroying the market with a flood of cheap potions.  The mana would be more profitably used to hunt but this has posibilities. <br />
This spell is more thematic but would give us a downtime way to help our hobby.<br />
<br />
If implemented, I would have a successful casting yield more of the herb based on the level of the caster.  Like you found a patch of wild ______).  At L60 you find 20, at L19 you find 1-5. <br />
<br />
Someone suggested something similar on the EQTraders Alchemy boards.  The person suggested alchemy herb forage abilities... as shaman, we should be able to recognize alchemy herbs when we see them.  I like the sound of it.  Do you think this would be better than casting a spell for the same purpose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">A Shaman forage herb ability? Sounds good, but they would have to be careful to limit it in some way - alchemy shouldn't be free of charge, it just shouldn't cost quite as much as it did. Could make a useful AA ability, by level 50 a shaman should know their herbs quite well! Perhaps it should increase with level, and more expensive herbs can be foraged as ability increases - either due to rarity, or the difficulty in harvesting them in a manner that preserves the herbs' usefull properties.</div></div><hr />
