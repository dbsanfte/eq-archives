<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did a few searches, couldn't find exactly what I needed to know...<br />
<br />
I just came back to the game after a 6-month retirement and bought DoN.  However, I'm having trouble understanding exactly the expansion is about.<br />
<br />
Can someone just give me a run-down of exactly what this expansion is about?  The point-system; where/how to get the right tasks/groups etc; faction; etc...<br />
<br />
I have a monk/shaman duo, and I'd like to get the spirit of the leopard ability for the shaman and the Dragon Claw ability for my monk, this much I've determined.  I just don't know exactly what I have to do to get them.  I understand they're purchased by points, but then I read that I need faction too...  and how do I get the points?<br />
<br />
Someone help!!!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
that should inform you of all your faction quest gem type questions..  8P  treat it like LDoN with more involvment on your part...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Factioning past indifferent without a group is a pain in the ass.  Take your duo and get friends to do missions with, far less painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">think about what LDON should have been....<br />
<br />
thats DoN.<br />
<br />
there are zones that are completely unique in design, however not only can you go to them &quot;as is&quot;, but when you get an instance (mission/raid event) you have them all to yourself.<br />
<br />
the EXP mods on the instances is VERY nice. probably some of the best zones for AA exp. ( say AA exp, because you're routinely rewarded with AA exp)<br />
<br />
you recieve crystals for doing missions or events, tasks (solo missions) take place in non-instanced zones, but don't yield anything but plat, faction, and exp.<br />
<br />
there are three camps. Wayfarer's, Dark Reign, and Norrath's Keepers.<br />
<br />
Wayfarer's offer tasks to get faction up for Dark Reign or Norrath's Keepers, but will stop offering tasks when faction gets sufficient for the faction you're working on. they will, however, still offer tasks for opposing factions.<br />
<br />
DR/NK will start giving quest tasks once your faction gets to indifferent. quest tasks are for progression, and can only be done once. there are several benefits for progression, stat cap increases, HP increases, buffslots, etc.<br />
<br />
the progression rewards for both sides are identical, so there really isn't any difference to choose one side over the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Plus, you can work your task goals while in a mission with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Which reminds me. I am stuck in Frisco with a non-EQ capable notebook atm, but one of these days I will get back to civilization and buy DON. Once that glorious moment arrives, what should I expect in terms of trash mob difficulty? I hear they hit for 200-300 with named ones hitting for 400-500? Fully/mostly slowable? Sounds like both my Shaman and my Monk should be able to tank them without too much trouble, but would be nice to have some idea ahead of time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Full scaling of mob difficulty, just choose your zone to suit your capability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, that's nice!<br />

Hold on, Orc Pawns, let me grab KEI and Virtue and I will be right over!</div></div><hr />
