<br />
Is there a &quot;Cap&quot; to Flowing thought? i know there was a cap once and it was 15. Im just wondering if this has been changed?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and does mental clarity AA point add to the FT cap if there is one<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The cap is still 15, and it isn't just for &quot;flowing thought.&quot;  It also takes in to account ANY worn mana regen effect.  The effect from the aten ha ra turn in neck is called Blessing of Vah Kerrath, and gives you 8 mana and health regen, as well as a DS.  That 8 mana regen counts towards the cap of 15, even though the effect is not &quot;flowing though VIII&quot;.  Buffs from items, like the effect &quot;Lunar Whispers&quot; from acrylia burrower talisman, do NOT count towards the cap, because it is a buff and not innate worn regen.  Mental Clarity, also, does NOT count towards this cap.</div></div><hr />
