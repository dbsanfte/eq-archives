yea no kidding , that was the ONE and only thing i still hold dear about DAoC. I mean how can this be considered more challanging in anyway , with a horse nothign stops you from switching .<br />

As a shaman i have all these spells at my disposal and i tend to not use them all just cause of this reason heh</div></div><hr />

im not trying to insult you bro , honestly, im just baffled is all . I dont understand how having  20+ spells that are 100% usable and needed on a raids ,and most of those are needed in XP groups to , how you can say that. dont tell me we dont have the mana . with C5 and can5 and SP from a BST and PoTN  from a druid , believe me , i can make good use of that arsenal.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not like it's hard to swap spells<br />
<br />
From your own post you state its a trival task. &quot; not hard&quot; So by that statement alone you back up what we all so far agree upon. Its just annoying. There is no skill involved in swaping out spell gems lol . Its a trival task that makes the game nothing but more tedious. There is one thing i need as a shaman more then new  spells , more then anything and thats to remove some of the tedious tasks like this. The repitition of a mind numbing skillless task.<br />
<br />
i just dont get ya bro , explain more please. maybe ill see differently.<br />

There's your problem, you're trying to keep duplicate spells up.  I keep malo loaded for mobs in BoT, but anywhere below that I don't even need that to slow things.  Even if you did want to use malo(s), malosinia is a giant waste.  Grummus and the disease slow are another silly one, I've yet to find a PoP mob I can't slow with magic, but if you're coming up on one, you know it ahead of time and can swap them.  You don't really need to have 2 nukes up either.  Mobs in an area are generally immune/resistant to the same things, so if poison lands on one, it likely will on all of them.  No need to keep both up &quot;just in case&quot;.  <br />
Haste sucks, and it's nice to keep up, but you can usually just re-mem it every 15-20 minutes and haste everyone, then drop it again.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see 2 more added, (alt 9 and alt 0 are unused!), they'd be great for keeping up things like haste and avatar.  Other than buffs though, I think 8 slots is enough for general use.</div></div><hr />

There is more to life then BoT bro. In bot i dont need malos/malosina up correct. how about in NToV where you HAVE to double debuff whem , then some mobs you have to disease , you cant magic slow them. then there are mobs there that ice lands on and others that it wont , so 2 nukes need to be up.<br />

Litgruv,  Your posts sound like you never want to mem a spell at any time. One of the (admittedly easy) challenges of the game is prioritizing available resources. You seem to be describing instant access to every spell all of the time - talk about meaningless. Why not just make every spell insta-cast with no mana use either. After all, mana regeneration is just an annoying feature of the game. ;)  <br />
<br />
One of the reasons DAOC is so easy in the &quot;spell mem&quot; department is the limited number of spell lines, not all the excess control pads (which you have to share with all your other commands and emotes).  Its really not much better an implementation than EQ - even though the program is three years' newer technology than EQ. <br />

THe only times i ever mem damage spells during raids is when the mob is already dying and its one of the those long fights.  or i already know before hand that we are going to be engaging a mob where i cant do alot of my debuffing therefore should/need to do damage.<br />

naa , just after so long playing this game it has become one of my pet peeves , i guess im spoiled cause of DAoC too , i know there is something better.<br />
<br />
I dont think it degrades the game at all making this easier. It only makes the game more enjoyable , which is what im all about my friend. i wanna play EQ and have it not be a chore , but something to enjoy.<br />
<br />
as far as you mana comment , thats just plain silly :p  obviously there is a line where it becomes TOO easy , but this is not a skilled tasked , this is not a make or break point of the game. I mean as a spell caster , having studied all my life these spells , seems kinda silly that i can only cast 8 of them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Do your pullers not call inc?  Anytime we're in ToV, and I see a disease only mob is coming up, I make room for the disease debuff and slow.  I take special care to make sure the pullers inform me as well, just in case.  If you're clearing ntov, from my experience no more than 5% (if that) of the mobs coming in are glimmers.  Reserving 2 spell gems for such a limited population of mobs just seems redundant.  Outside of ToV, I can't name anyplace I regularly need to use disease slow mixed with turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Litgruv, for raids you are a debuffing class not a damage class <br />
<br />
Bull. think outside the box.  I'm a debuffing class primary, healing secondary and damage as well. I'm a shaman I can do all things.<br />
<br />
What do you do the other 6 minutes between slowing?  mana inefficent healing that the clerics can more than handle more efficently?<br />
<br />
we generally have 5 shamans on a raid.  With proper timed dots and nukes we've each done over 30k of damage on some fights.  Granted I'm not a wizard or a mage, but I can do damage.<br />
<br />
Generally on raids, I mem always, tnargs, torpor, canni 4, (regen or kraggs depending on healing in group) malo, malosinia, nuke and turgurs.  That's for clearing trash<br />
<br />
For buff time, I mem tnargs torpor, canni 4, regen, wrulran, boar, shrink and sometimes tribunal if needed.<br />
<br />
For big bosses, I usually disease debuff, so I have malicious decay, malosini and insidiuous malady up, as well as never unmemming heals, I may have 2 or 3 heals up, and canni 4, I also never unmem turgurs<br />
<br />
If the mob is dr slowable only, I'll have md, im and grummus up on top of my never forgoten tnargs, torpor, canni 4 and turgurs.<br />
<br />
I swap out for dots or nukes on bosses (if I have a horse) or after it is safe to sit if I'm not too high on aggro list.<br />
<br />
I'd like to always keep ferine avatar up and sometimes if asked I'll keep it up instead of a nuke.<br />
<br />
Its a pain, I do nothing but switch spells for 3/4s of my time raiding. People die and need rebuffing, different mobs have different abilities, I might be main healer in the group etc.<br />
<br />
I'd even settle for 2 slots that could be buff only, so I wouldn't have to constantly mem and unmem buffs everytime some melee lags during enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">On da one hand, addin extra slots wud reduce da strategy involved.  On da udda, me also tires of da swappin needed wen playin buff ho'.<br />
<br />
Methinx da last four words of dat last sentence say it all - &quot;...wen playin buff ho'&quot;.  Me's okies wif havin ta swap spells in combat, but buffin juz tedious.  So, how about a separate bank of two or more buff slots (&quot;buff&quot; defined as a beneficial spell wif a duration of 10+mins)?  Hell, make us spend AAs ta get 'em, but dey'd be mucho nice and, IMO, not radically alter spell strategies.<br />
<br />
Thinkin about it, da only changes it wud make fer me wud be ta maybe mem Spirit of Cheetah fer da first time in over two years... hmm, mebbe start using Spirit Quickening again on top of Celerity... umm... Oh yah, perma-mem Celerity and mebbe regrowth.<br />

Litgruv, for raids you are a debuffing class not a damage class.<br />

 <br />
<br />
I fully disagree. I feel if things are that relaxed where you not worrying about anything but debuffing , or your having time to sit down and mem disease debuff and slow , then your not moving fast enough , your not pushing it which is what my guild does. There is always mobs in camp, once slowed ( lets face it cripple is pretty much usless) then im sitting around wasting mana. Not to mention im not the only shaman there , always atleast 3-6 shaman on my guildss raids. So yea , there is a diverse functionality that is left untaped cause i cant put up spells.  You cant sit and mem anything with acid jet  being spammed , or AoE's going off.  You can call this a challange , but its not i feel. Its not making the game harder , there is not skill involved in getting around it. Its just annoying , in this particular example i have given.<br />

Hey thnx for stoping by and taking the time to BITCH about my bitching.

Be smart, pick the right spells beforehand or swap them when you see the INC message and realize you'll need a DR slow or whatnot.  Or would you prefer that VI just gave us a &quot;Debuff&quot; button we could hit that would automatically choose, scribe, and cast the most ideal set of spells for any given mob?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">*lip quiver*<br />

I would like two more spell slots as well.  I'm comfortable with the fact it will never happen, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Fewer spell slots = more strategy?<br />
<br />
In that case give us options for different organisations of spell slots.<br />
<br />
For example option2: you get 3 groups of 4 gems. 1st group is as normal.  2nd group takes 10% longer to cast, and has 10% extra fizzle rate.  3rd group has 20% longer, 20% more fizzle.  Thats got more strategy to decide what to place where AND more gems, so less spell swapping.  You could think up a huge variety of different options for spell gem organisation.<br />
<br />
Personally I think its all BS.  We don't get more spell slots because anything useful like that is now added as part of an expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Reminds me of the 'duck' change where you used to couldnt duck out of a spell, once you started, you were at least locked in to casting the duration of the spell even if it didnt go off because you moved or whatever.<br />
<br />
Doesnt happen often, but Ive been in several situations where I couldnt swap spells because of agro and died several times because I needed something up that I chose not to mem that time (probably can count the number of times on one hand in three years).  I think it is a valid part of the game having to choose which spells you will memorize and does dumb it down a little or take away a little challenge to the game.<br />
<br />
It is however an annoyance to swap spells, especially as often as we need to because there are so few slots.<br />
<br />
Is the annoyance worth the few times that come up when I made a mistake?  Probably not.  It would be another thing for most that make the game more fun.  They have done a lot of things to improve the game for all (getting rid of tons of little annoyances) and make it more fun so I dont see why some sort of change wont eventually come.  If it never comes though, it wont bug me that much.</div></div><hr />

Obviously some spells are situational. And yes sometimes there isnt a enchanter , hence why all that is situational, plus the fact a 60% haste is hardly ****ty. But can you honestly tell me that you dont want more gems ? that at any given time inthe game there sint 1-3 spells you wish you could have up ,but other spells are more important ?<br />
<br />
If so , more power to you , but i still strongly disagree , cause i avatar , debuff , slow heal and nuke and DoT as much as possible. I personaly could use them.<br />

Hey Litgruv, what's you'r /played looking like now? 50 days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Heh, I'm trying hard not to come off as flaming, but honestly this is exactly the kind of pointless rant that causes people to label shaman as whiners IMO.  <br />
<br />
Would I like more spell gems?  Honestly, I don't really care.  I can see both sides and agree that it's a minor nuisance having to swap spells out at times.  At other times I like the fact that you have to be smart and have the right spells up or at least be quick about making a swap because it does separate the good player from the bad.  I like to think I play my shaman pretty well and part of that is that I do know my spellbook very well and can usually predict what spells I'll need in a given situation.<br />
<br />
As far as Raiding goes, if you have multiple shaman on a raid it's a simple matter of communication to split up the debuffing duties so everyone doesn't have to keep Malo, Turgurs, MD, Grummus, Malosinia, and Cripple memmed.  It's also a pretty smart thing to do for aggro reasons. ;)<br />
<br />
It's not that I don't want any other shaman to be as good as me, it's simply that I like that there's is at least some small challenge in choosing the right spell lineup.  I like challenges and I think there should be drawbacks to making the wrong choices.  In this case the drawback is that sometimes you may not have time or be able to swap a spell you wish you had memmed or possibly even you/r group will die (if you've loused up your spell choices that bad, you deserve it anyway imo :p).  Typically, the drawback is a minor nuisance though as the reward is fairly minor also.  I call that balanced.  Removing all those subtle things that make playing your shaman easier, IMO is dumbing it down...  That simple.  <br />
<br />
This isn't something that's NEEDED by any stretch of the imagination and nobody is even trying to claim that.  It's a matter of convenience to some.  Well, if it's all about convenience I want my &quot;debuff&quot; spell that automatically debuffs the proper resists, uses the correct slow, and casts cripple if necessary so that I don't have to take the time to decide which buffs I need to cast and which are stupid.  While we're at it can I get a &quot;HEAL&quot; spell that automatically decides for me whether it would be wiser to cast the 10 second KM, the faster Tnargs, or the low aggro Quiessence so that I don't have to think on my feet and decide whether aggro is an issue or speed of heal/cast time?  I mean it'd just be more convenient that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well, of course had I some more available gems would I use them, but one thing is that I learnt to switch my spells in a fight and this is one thing that amazes people. In fact, I've been said numerous time that people think I'm a good shaman as I know how to time my buffs and debuffs, control pet and heal, even in the middle of a battle. I don't pretend I'm the best ever shaman (this I will never be), but I think I know my job pretty good and I'm not the worst shaman existing on FV.  More gems would be cool but not necessary to me. Maybe put them as PoP AA skills so that people who want them would have to purchase them, the other could just go with something else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think that 8 slots is fine.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is swapping all the time for buffing.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we could add an adition 8 slots one by one as an aaxp ability that could only be used for buffing when not in combat.<br />
<br />
1) only mem buff spells<br />
2) must not be engaged in combat<br />
3) target must not be engaged in cambat<br />
4) target must be a player or player pet.<br />
<br />
The goal of the change would not be to add enhanced combat ability, but only to reduce the tedium of spell in swaping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">When the new UI came out there was some discussion that it would allow us to  mem whole pages of spells trough the hotbutton. That would be enough for me. (Not to say I wouldnt mind extra 2 slots either)<br />
 I could have one hotbutton for raid spells and one for solo. One for buffing and one for debuffs. With one hotbutton I could lose the set I currently had and mem another fast. <br />
 I think the commands for memming whole pages are still there, but there's no use for them at least of yet. <br />
<br />
BTW what's the matter with the threads in here nowadays? Not a single one thread can be started and finished here without seeing someone being called a stupid newbie or most likely something worse in between.</div></div><hr />

Callir Spiritwalker Litgruv, do you ever not make a bitchy post? Just curious.. <br />
Hey thnx for stoping by and taking the time to BITCH about my bitching. Next time take the time to do something useful and try to inspire insight and change instead of siting on the side line like the lil sheep you are and complain and throw stones from the distance about others that actualy try to inspire change and thought about the things around them.  <br />
<br />
Thnx for stopping by the thread and inspiring as much negitivity as you can.  great job *thumbs up*<br />

Or none of the above. I find your posts to be mostly irrelevant background noise, but luckily there are still a few good shamans around that salvage some of your pointless posts with meaningful info. <br />
<br />
Keep on posting though. Even a bad example serves as an example and your posts have given many new posters much needed confidence to post since they know they &quot;won't sound that dumb.&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I don't understand why so many of you are flaming him for this.  Yea, with 5 shaman on a raid each can handle 1 particular type of spell, but what about soloing?  malo(s) + slow + 1 DoT + root + 1 DD/rain + torpor/Q + can + heal = 8 slots.  I think that allowing players more spell slots would allow for much more strategy.  Why should he have to swap those out for a low level spell like flash of light?  Any level 65 wizard or shaman should know all of their low level spells inside and out.  Having to sit in the middle of a battle to swap out a spell is just plain ghey.  At least we have slow, w/o that it would be impossible to switch out spells.<br />
<br />
Yea, having 80 or so spell slots would be rediculous.  I would like to see something like this:<br />
<br />
6 slots to any casters with at least 75 in their prime req ( wis or int )<br />
+1 slot for every 30 more points of prime req. ( max 6 more )<br />
+1 slot for every 15 levels ( max 4 more )<br />
16 max slots.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't dumb the game down too much and would reward really smart wizards, shaman, etc.  It would also show a natural progression as characters gain more levels.  <br />
<br />
And you people that say we should know ahead of time what they need obviously spend too much time reading spoiler sites.  You are probably the same people who enjoy killing the exact same mobs over and over again.  What happened to the thrill of adventure?  Killing new mobs and trying new spells and combinations.  I would love to spend time trying new strategies and new spells, but I already have 8 staple spells that are just too neccessary.  <br />
<br />
Dread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I think the idea behind limited spell slots is that your character can only hold so much information in its mind at one time. Since memorizing spells requires a lot of concentration you can only hold 8 at any time in memory. This leaves open some room for improvement however, for instance the following changes would still allow for the original intent of the limitation but could also make room for more spells:<br />
<br />
1) Base the number of spells memorizable on your class primary stat. This would encourage people to use thier AA stat boosting abilities.<br />
<br />
2) Create a second row of spell gems but make them cost double the time to cast, simulating the notion that you can't completely memorize them but you can partially memorize them.<br />
<br />
3) make any spell castable from your spellbook but at significant time or mana cost increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Add 2 more please.  Right now, there's no room for anything but the bare necessities in just 8 slots. Have to swap out necessities just to buff. Too many of our spells go unused simply because there's no room to mem them.<br />
<br />
And the number is no longer limited by the GUI.<br />
<br />
However, the game dynamics would change with every spell gem added, and I think SOE is afraid.<br />
<br />
Be happy our AA abilities use hotkeys instead of spell gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Two more would be perfect.  More than that would be silly.<br />
<br />
These spells never come down:<br />
<br />
Torpor<br />
Turgur's<br />
Canni4<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Malo<br />
<br />
If I am going to have to debuff a mob with disease slow, I usually know more than 5 seconds in advance and can mem the necessary spells in place of turgur's and malo, so it is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
That leaves me 3 slots to play with.  My guild is seriously short of shamans, and it is not uncommon for me to be the only one there.  That leaves me as the sole buffer for 60 people.  Thus, I usually keep focus and stamina up.  I've found that any time i unmem them, someone usually asks me for them within 10 seconds so I do not bother.  This leaves me with one slot.  If there is a cleric or druid in my group, then I mem tears of saryn.  If there isn't, then I mem kraggs.<br />
<br />
In an exp group, what I mem depends on my role.  If there is a cleric and chanter in the group, then I use my remaining 3 slots for damage spells and primal avatar if anyone wants it.  If there is no chanter, I mem root and damage spells.  If there is no cleric, I mem kraggs, and it doesn't matter what I do with the other 2 because I will never have time to do anything but cast kraggs and canni.  If there is no cleric or chanter (my favorite kind of group) then I mem kraggs, root, and haste.<br />
<br />
So basically, knowing which spells to mem is part of the skill of being a shaman.  We can fill many roles, but not all at once.  I would say 8 gems is fine, but 10 would be nice to reduce the tedium of being a buffer on raids.</div></div><hr />
