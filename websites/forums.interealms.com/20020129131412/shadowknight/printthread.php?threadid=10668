<p><b> Shroud of undeath</b></p>

<p>Shroud of undeath is finally scribable and castable since patch<br />
<br />
it is an exact copy of shroud of death (mana 100 lvl 55, adds 50pt LT proc) plus it has skele form added to it.  <br />
<br />
Im so glad I didnt spend the platinum on a amulet of necropotence now.<br />
Im happy with this spell.<br />

<p>One really good group should be able to make it down there when the zone is simi-camped.  If the group is not balanced (or not 55+) then two would probably be needed.  I was down there with 3 last Friday but we were pulling several areas.  Killed Battlemaster once and he dropped that really nice pally sword.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Was there last night...  Battle master dropped the Nathsar Gloves or whatever.... (I was much pissed)<br />
<br />
its posible that any mob over a certain level might drop our spell.<br />
<br />
I was at graveyard and held it down with:<br />
<br />
59 SK (Me)<br />
48 War (hehe yah i know, but he was better than nothin)<br />
56 Monk<br />
56 Cleric<br />
54 Chanter<br />
53 Shammie<br />
<br />
BTW, the graveyard has some FUNKY pathing which will get you trained often..... you will need SOME method of Control....<br />
<br />
battlemaster is a skellie and odds are the skellies are his placeholder...<br />
<br />
also there are necromancer sarnaks in there.<br />
<br />
I made about 75% of a blue bub in 59 in a few hours down there.... (and Im a troll)<br />

<p>I am not trying to say I doubt anyone, its just strange that this spell being added just slipped through the cracks.  Has anyone else gotten a copy?  I have been researching on it all day and plan on going after a copy tonight.  Does the Battlemaster spawn in the Graveyard or near the waterfall?  Or are they both the same place?  The only parts of Chardok I really know are the Royals and the zone in.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Skellie form (white tho)<br />
humie vision (we shud ask to get this fixed, undead shud be able to see in the dark just fine)<br />
no SLAM (but that was expected)<br />

<p>the battle master spawn is just on the side of the path on the way to royals after waterfall. He's on the left. Just camp on the archway.. that's what I did with my party. He only popped once in about 2 hours, but dropped the spell and I got it. I have it on all the time now. No more buyin shrink reagents for me.</p>

<p>Hi.<br />
<br />
I was camping at a place between the waterfall and Grave Master spawn point for 5 hours. That area has around 6 skellies spawn points. Unfortunately, Battle Master did not pop. Could someone tell if I camped at the right place or not. Do I not need to get pass Grave Master spawn point? Thanks.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this camp i think is the location and the fast rate of respawns in chardok. What we did was break over to the bridge and then single pull stuff out till the first grave/crypt guard thingies on the bridge. We had a pretty good group with monk and myself pulling splitting and ench keeping mez on so we could break the spawns up nicely. Once everything was broken, it was constant pulls. <br />
<br />
We sat right on the small bridge. Right after the archway so that we wouldn't aggro backspawns. You would have the waterfall and archway to your back and 2 pillars with 2 mobs(the grave/crypt i forget what mob) in front of you. Having a mezzer is a must I think with the rate of respawns.</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Clown.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>I've been spending quite a bit of time here trying to get this, and finally have a good approach, although no spell yet <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Battle Master Ska'Tu spawns inbetween the waterfall and the Grave Master spawn point along the path - I have only seen him in one place, but I think it can be any of the skelly spawn points. My regular group can hold this area, but I would not recommend it without a sold 55+ group. We cleared the area and then set up at the Grave Master spawn point - there are no adds from beyond there, and you can time the pops if you need to. I also found the pathing is easier to deal with from there. The trick to pulling in here is babysitting the mobs - especially the skellies. I walk up pretty close to them, get agro (spell or smacking them or whatever), then babysit them back to the group - this overrides the nasty pathing in there, and by doing this I can single and double the whole area. If you let the two skellies by the Grave Master path on their own when initially breaking, they will bring 4 for sure so be careful if your group can't handle that (we did it for fun last night muahaha).<br />
<br />
They bad news is the only drop I've seen so far is the Pally sword <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="">. I will be trying more this weekend. The Grave Master drops a reasonable pal/sk/clr no drop hammer though as a bonus - 16/22 1hb <insert some small stats here> and Effect: Expel Undead - not bad anyway, and fun to play with in there on the skellies!<br />
<br />
Btw, the exp is pretty good there in my opinion - I got 2 blue in 59 last night in about 3 hours.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> same</b></p>

<p>Sounds like you are having about the same luck as I am Wildize.  We had better luck with pulls by sitting on the path in the middle where the single spawn cryptmaster is.  That is right in front of where he spawns.   He is not a random in all of the skelly spots.  He has a static spot right in the middle in the decline kinda right on the corner.  We got him to pop there a few times already, but like I said, still no spell.  I also agree, 55+ meaty group with a chanter is pretty much a must.</p>
<hr>
<i>Posted by Lucard on 10-27-2001 07:59 AM:</i>

<p><b> YES!!</b></p>

<p>FINALLY! He dropped the spell.  He also dropped the new Necro Ignite bones spell (The one without the skelly illusion).  Have to go back though, still need one more for my buddy.  EXP in there is awesome too.  It is confirmed again.  The spell is rare as hell, but it does drop.</p>

<p>One good group can take you down to the waterfall area (where the Battlemaster spawns)....best group that I have been in down there was...<br />
<br />
59 SK (me)<br />
57 Chanter<br />
57 Necro<br />
56 Cleric (I think)<br />
59 Druid<br />
49 Rogue (yes 49...was the Chanters GF and the only way he could come out and play is if she came along)<br />
<br />
You can also pull the Bridgekeeper and Capt (lil room next to bridgekeeper) from there.<br />
<br />
Alas....the darn spell has yet to drop for me...just keeps dropping that Nath crud and some spells.<br />

60-SK<br />
57-SK<br />
57-Clr<br />
56-Wiz<br />
60-Enc<br />
59-Nec<br />
<br />
This group has worked out rather well and we are going back again tonight.  We spent over 12hours in there Saturday, and all the BM ever dropped were Nath crap gloves, The Bobbing corpse item, and one copy of the necrospell again.  No Shroud of undeath drop since the one I have gotten.  The rareness Verant has put on this spell is just sickening.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I think I have finally found about where this is at from spending the last week in there, I found the waterfall and Im assuming the graveyard. There were two cryptmasters at the entrance so to speak and were several reanimated berserkers to the sides in the rear. My group was pretty small and eventually we had to evac, but I think it still could have been done with a real chanter. <br />
<br />
We actually made it to that point with me pulling, 52 monk, 55 bard as CC, 54 nero, 54 cleric and 56 druid. Pickup group was all it was , but once we got down to the alcove where the escaped slaves hangout , me and the monk pulled the capt room and then we all invised and went up past the waterfall. We killed just about all the spawns in the area eventually but on last two I the bard couldnt mez the skelli and we had to switch targets, by this time the cleric had taken a good beating and we got a respawn I think and she died thus we had to evac. All in all was a good learning experience and I feel it can be done now with a reasonable group and better CC. I did finally find some decent maps on the monk board if any one is interested.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if anyone on my server even has this spell yet on my server. Seems like the zone is camped pretty regular now but groups seem to be content with just fighting at the zo. /shrug. Everytime Ive led a group that way its always full spawn all the way, and Ive had zero luck auctioning for the spell.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Kinda sad they put our spell as a rare drop off a spawn this rare... *sigh*<br />

The halfling mask Overseer is in the mines. If you go to Niblik and just keep following the wall to the right, you will get to a room with a building in it. There is a tunnel to the right there, so keep following the right wall. The next spawns include the Foreman (I think always, but not sure), and after that there is a 'T' in the hallway - this is where the Overseer or his PH spawns. Best I can do from memory and I hope it helps, but if this doesn' t I'll look at a map and describe it better if you want <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> How rare..</b></p>

<p>Just to give you an example of how rare this spell is...<br />
I have been taking this same group down since the patch that fixed the spell.  We have gone every day for about 5-6 hours a night and on the past weekend, we pulled a 13 hour marathon in there.  We have only gotten one spell.  Until someone here posted that they got more than one copy, I beginning to think that Verant had coded the thing to only drop once on every server.  Going back again tonight.</p>

<p>If the drop rate of this spell is that low it is stupid... reminds me of when they first added summon corpse into the game and it was only dropped by the ishva who at the time was like a 12 hour spawn (been a LONG time since I have been in paw... might be different now)... it isn't even like this is a "powerful" spell... worries me that the spell guy said he liked having spells drop by certain MOBs...  although it *might* be possible that other MOBs can drop the spell... anything else known to drop that new necro spell?  This weekend we killed Vindi twice back to back (cause of weird spawning this weekend had two vindis spawned at the same time)... the 2nd one dropped that necro spell... so it *may* be a rare drop on some other things... or it may have been a special drop because of the gm stuff this weekend... but putting the spell as a rare drop on one MOB is just about as stupid as having a lower level spell droping off of things like Vindi<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I know my posting on this is getting monotonous, but I will keep updating this here.  Again last night 4 hours, 4 Battlemasters, 3 pairs of gloves and 1 necro bauble.  Oh and FYI, there is a rarer spawn in the same place as the BM called "A Wraith of a Di'Zok Hero"  We have seen him about 3 times, but he never drops anything.  We are going to have the enchanter try and charm him next time we see him and see if he says anything...<br />

<p>Spent another 6 hours here yesterday, went through a few Battlemaster spawns and only saw gloves... blarg. Why do they make a 'fun' spell so hard to get? For most of us, this is just a neat trick. Granted, trolls and ogres might like it to shrink, but the value it adds is pretty marginal. There's few enough high level SKs, that I don't think there's any need for them to fear an army of SK skeletons. Bah.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen people try to sell this spell? What have they been asking for it?<br />

A spell that makes us look like a skelli, that drops off of a skelli Battlemaster. Sounds like a reasonable MOB for it to drop off of to me... A MOB in a Graveyard area no less. Hmm, Shadow Knights are known for having something to do with Dead stuff, but I just cannot put my finger on it...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

I like being the only Sol Ro SK who could go skelly whenever...(without an AoN)<br />

Works well for hiding my Custom Malevolent Helm graphic when im sick of looking at it, and imo there seems to be a lowered aggro range for pulling when you are in skelly form, anyone else notice this?<br />

Nathsar Gaunts for the first and second time, Blue Diamond the next and the spell which I got. Seems totally random. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Got this spell tonight, on only the 2nd time I went JUST for it. Spent about 3 hours there last night, and while the spell didnt drop a lot of other stuff did. We got a SBS, Nathsar gloves, BD, diamond, nice INT caster shoulders, and the bauble(which I am now wearing). Only saw two Ska'tus pop in that time, and we were keeping the area from the waterfall almost to the palace clear.<br />
<br />
Tonight the second Ska'tu dropped it, and we also got a chanter spell, some INT 10 range thing and another SBS.<br />
<br />
I mention the loot because I expected this camp to suck for my guildmates, and it turned out to be quite the opposite. The Nathsar gloves were upgrades for all of our druids, and the other drops made the chanters happy. Bottom line: don't feel guilty about dragging your guild down there, they might get some nice things. And the XP was moving nicely.<br />
<br />
First night was two full groups, mostly mid-50s, two chanters, two 60 wars and a 60 rogue. Tonight we made it down with 10 people, 1 60 war, 1 60 clr, 1 60 rog, 1 chanter and the rest mid 50s. <br />

<p><b> droprate nerfed again or removed</b></p>

<p>heard rumors this spell no longer drops at all.<br />
<br />
probably because of the new lvl 58 Spell:<br />
<br />
Deathly Temtation<br />
HP (16) to mana (6) - duration (20?) min<br />
Illusion : Skelletton<br />
Effect: Ultravision<br />
<br />
the Shroud of Undeath is just a Shroud of Death with<br />
Skellie Illusion not even UV on it.<br />
<br />
well, that's what I hear but oh well...probably still drops.<br />

<p>Well if GraagBaash got it on the 12th then chances are it still drops. We have gotten nothing but the gloves. Know a fellow who got the earing, glad that is now SK wearable. Oh well the search continues.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>We hunted this area 4 nights with our regular group:<br />
60SK, 60CLR, 60WAR, 58 ROG, 58 ENC, 57 DRU<br />
<br />
Pretty good exp, but it gets rather dull. Pathing is a joke. Skeles <br />
are unable to path properly onto the path, sarnaks are unable <br />
to path properly off the path. After trying the babysitting method<br />
and trying the train yourself method...We found that not pulling<br />
at all was the best method. Simply move around the area instead<br />
of sitting and pulling to one spot, much easier. From bridge, we<br />
go off the path and fight the first skeles at once, then back to<br />
path for 2 sarnaks, then back off path for more skeles, etc...<br />
Repeat as respawn happens. Fairly easy, and constantly moving<br />
helps to break up the boredom a bit.<br />
<br />
We got several nice items down here (we call this area crypt), but<br />
no shroud of undeath. Eight or so BM kills, no spell. I loathe the<br />
idea of going back here, but I still want this damn spell...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I just want to give a Big Hello to Hideo,  I havent seen you in a long time, good to see you are still watching the boards.  As for the spell, I dont think I will be going after it.  I got my SD this weekend and I would rather have Call of Bones then this spell <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
I have a old guise if i need to shrink down from my Natural Troll form.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
