<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My profile is here at Magelo.  Currently I think I have a good mix of AC and wisdom.  I have some extra JB I can swap in for AC, plus the shrouded medallion from ME, and an SBS.  Getting close to my epic, need the tear though :( <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me.  Oh, I tried for the jarsath leggings for a while, bah, very unlucky I guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jasper rings are the work of satan.  Replace them with Velium fire opal and pick up 15-20 actual ac and 130 lovely hps.  :)  The mask and shoulders make my teeth itch too, but they arent horrible.  I'd at least replace the shoulders with a tattered mantle or something else with 10+ ac, but I could see leaving em as is.  Rings gotta go, though.  Evil evil evil.<br />

Yeah, legs are hard.  Rygorr is an option, also totemic, or the Kromrif military leggings quest.  I'm still wearing stinking totemic at 54, but I'm too lazy to quest for better.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, thanks for the help.  I did just get that Elder wolf hide, 10 AC 4 Wis, so I can use that.  And the ring idea I had seen before, I like it, just need to wait to meet up with the guild jeweler sometime. :)<br />
