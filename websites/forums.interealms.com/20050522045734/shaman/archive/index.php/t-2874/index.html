<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings shaman,<br />
<br />
I'm a long time lurker of the Crucible (posted about four, maybe five times in my entire shaman &quot;career&quot; which lasted 2 1/2 years, but lost my pw =/), and a tremoendous proponent of what this board has to offer for all shaman, and even beyond.  <br />
<br />
With that premise in mind, I ask you all to hear me out and determine whether what I am about to request is worthwhile.  I wholly believe you will.<br />
<br />
I've since departed the ways of the shaman and found myself reborn into another EQ profession.  This new endeavor has me, once again, levelling through some old haunts, along with doing what many would never wish on their worst enemies...playing the exp game over again.  In my travels, however, I've noticed a huge trend in early 30 to 54 level shaman.  That being, they do not Cannibalize.  Or, should they, they do not Cannibalize properly.  <br />
<br />
To be more specific, those with whom I've inquired about why they are simply medding respond that it [Cannibalize] is not efficient.  When they grew frustrated with me prodding them to cast it, I notice why they feel its not efficient...they do not know how to &quot;dance&quot;.   Simply, the shaman would stand, chain cast Cannibalize, drop to 30% health and sit down.  We all know that pre-Torpor (and maybe pre-Fungi) that is is NOT the way to utilize said spell.  <br />
<br />
My request is simply thus, being &quot;the&quot; site for shaman, could there not be a sticky under &quot;Combat and Tactics&quot; or &quot;Spells&quot; for shaman new to this site to have at their ready?  I believe there is a guide accessible from the main page, however, I'm certain that many simply click to forums.  Granted, their loss, however, oftimes we must make amends for our constituents.  <br />
<br />
I forsee a not so bright future for many shaman, and, sadly, a poor reputation for this class due to most people's ignorance.  I know there is a nice thread on how to &quot;canni-dance&quot; somewhere within these archives.  Mayhaps a simple locked sticky would prove beneficial to many.  <br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe I am naive, but I believe that most Shaman<br />
A) Know how to Cani-Dance, and<br />
B) Know the benefits of its use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">most shaman on this board....yes<br />
<br />
most shaman.... maybe<br />
<br />
I see an awful lot of newbie shaman running around that either don't canablaize, or don't dance.  Either because they don't know how or they just don't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just to illustrate how ignorant some shamans can be, here's an anecdote about a conversation I had with a level 35 shaman just the other night.  He asked me out of the blue for some advice on shamans in general, and we talked about wis / ac / hp / resists, and all that good stuff.  He mentioned that he didn't really value cannibalise much, because he almost always has clarity on.  Well, come to find out later that this &quot;clarity&quot; was actually his newbie bearform.  Someone apparently told him that it gave 5 wis and clarity.<br />
<br />
I set him straight and pointed him to this site.  He seemed to be a smart guy, and was very polite and well spoken (not a dood or anything like that).  So, it's not like he was an idiot, he had just never been exposed to &quot;the truth&quot; about shamans.  I hope he does read The Crucible, because odds are that he'll turn out to be a good shaman.  He even mentioned that he likes lguk (woot, not going to be a level 60 outdoor noob).<br />
<br />
Also, who reading this site doesn't know about Canni-dancing?  It's not a matter of sticky or not.  It's a matter of people who don't know anything about their class that they didn't figure out for themselves.  If they don't read The Crucible, sticky or not won't make a bit of difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never did Canni-dancing.  My macro that I've used for a long time (pauses adjusted for spell changes) is simply /sit off;  3x /pause xxx, /cast 8 ; /sit on<br />
<br />
As inefficient as Canni 1 might be, sitting and medding at full health is a waste.  Always, always, canni a bit - you'll be sitting anyway, and that way you are not wasting the hp regen.  I never tried 'catching' the med tick.  Ever.  I thought I was Canni-dancing, but when I realized what everyone was really talking about, I decided I didn't want to practice eyestrain watching for movement on my manabar before casting canni once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">cani-dancing is ghey only.<br />
real shaman wince til they black out and catch the hp regen tic!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&gt; I decided I didn't want to practice eyestrain watching for movement on my manabar before casting canni once.<br />
<br />
<br />
I sympathize with that thought.<br />
<br />
A solution is however quite easy. Open thy inventory and watch your health (as a number) increment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I much prefer rigging the hotkey with a second pause to force you into a tick cycle.    make total cast time and /pause equal out to 6 seconds, and you won't have to watch after first click.   Or just go without and count on random chance if you are nearly FM anyhow (my personal choice is get a horse and not care.... But I realize not all are willing / able to get a horse)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Second post in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1922) is the best Canni-dancing guide I've seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually think it is more efficient to chain cast it, if you have that ranger or BL in the group healing yah :)<br />
<br />
i normally can dance though, but if i have a hybrid, i chain and grab heals, cause their mana &lt; my mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've never been so pressed for mana that I have to time my canny to coincide with my natural mana regen tic.<br />
<br />
Heh, but I do hear alot of weird stuff from other shamen like:<br />
Bearform gives breeze, and Fury (can't remember if thats what its called, sounds right though) Gives Clarity, and regen is a waste on Shamen, cause their almost always full hp! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I never bothered canni-dancing by timing the meditation ticks. I always found it better to just balance the hp/mana bar, and then sit to gain maximum regen/regrowth benefit so I could do some more cannibalizing. Now, with torpor, the only time I sit down is during breaks in pulls or when I'm not adventuring (i.e. tradeskilling).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail,<br />
<br />
I used to always dance. :D Made me feel very efficient, although I did suffer from eyestrain until I learned to switch screen modes.   I started dancing about a week after I first memmed Canni.<br />
From about 24 to 44, I continued to dance often.<br />
<br />
As I became more powerful, I found the need to dance to be less and less.  Still, in tight situations where mana was at a premium, I would be dancing.  Getting my JBB affected my dance times significantly, as I no longer needed every ounce of mana at all times with such a powerful tool at my beck and call.  Part of this might be attributed to laziness as well I guess.<br />
<br />
My dancing regimen reduced some more after sit aggro bit me in the bearform one time too many. :o  In many situations cannidancing can get you killed. :\  It took a little time to break the habit I had formed of always dancing whenever I didn't have aggro.  After my group wiped because of a bad chain of events that was spurred by my dancing at the wrong time, I became much more wary of the dancefloor. <br />
<br />
Now, I can't remember the last occasion I danced.  It has been a long time.  I have a horse, JBB, Fungi, and just got my epic last Sunday.  Memmed Canni3 this evening.  As such, I still fall into the level range that you are talking about.<br />
<br />
At this stage (newly dinged 54) in the game for me, in times where things are touch and go, I'd prefer to pay more attention to what is going on around me than make sure I get that extra tick (indoors obviously, as outdoors who cares when astride a pony).  If I so desperately need that little tick, then I'm in trouble already.  If I'm inside, we're having a med break  &amp; things are clear, I STILL end up chain-casting vice dancing because I have hybrids or other priests healing me.  I am the only 50+ shaman in my guild.  Many times MY health/mana level determines the pull rate.  Who cares if the ranger burns his bar dry w/ gimpy heals as long as it gets me to a point where we can pull again?  The faster that happens, the faster the raid progresses.<br />
<br />
I know how to dance, but I choose not to anymore.<br />
/mourn the Cannidance<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Clarity thing on bearform might stem from the Druid Wolf form. Form of the Howler, as that form does give an effect of Breeze (according to a druid I met last night in Scarlet Desert).  Maybe they assumed that all forms gave a clarity type effect *shrug*<br />
<br />
I try to cannidance, but I don't specifically watch the tics as the movement is relatively minor and if I need mana now, I'm not gonna sit around for a few seconds just to catch a tic.  My groupmates would absolutely kill me.  They've grown accustomed to the green cloud that always surrounds me even if I'm tanking for the rogue :eek:<br />
<br />
I've even canni'd while tanking for dog-dog solo with an add that i just rooted waiting to pounce on me, call me a freak, but it's saved me more than once with that extra little bit of mana.  AC/HP's works to your advantage if you solo.  My druid friend sometimes hangs out and is in awe of what i can pull off tanking for wonderdog.  And druids in awe of a shaman soloing just seems a little off to me for some reason, hehe.</div></div><hr />

What's full hp? ;)<br />
<br />
Don't think I ever really timed the med tick either, still dancing tends to be more efficient anyway as you're bound to hit it once in a while. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Full HP is when the red stuff fills the first four bubbles in your health bar.  You then have to cann to keep from going beyond full.<br />
<br />
I have to explain this to clerics on a regular basis 8^)<br />
<br />
I used to cannidance religiously, but with Cann III, regrowth, and bearform things are easing up a bit and I don't have to do extended chain-canni sessions much any more, so I generally don't bother.<br />
<br />
I am definately interested in a horse as soon as I can save up the cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I find my connection's laggy enough that cann dancing just wasn't productive.<br />
<br />
Now I melee and cann between hammer swings.  Or swing my hammer between canns.  I'm never quite sure where my emphasis is.  Either way, with regrowth on, I can pretty much end the fight full of mana, and at Twoflower's verion of &quot;full hp&quot;<br />
<br />
Consider it stolen, Twoflower!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I learned about Cannidancing from this board. I don't really use it. I think the idea is sound and I understand the reasons for the belief but using it drives me nuts :)<br />
<br />
One thing I noticed was that my health regens in an odd way. I use a Fungi and Regrowth. My health jumps a few numbers then maybe loses a few then takes a big jump. I never really seem to know when my &quot;tick&quot; is because of this. I prefer to canni the crap out of myself (anywhere from 2-4 bubs of health remaining) and regen it back. <br />
<br />
It may seem ignorant to some but it works for me. Bottom line is that I have mana and I don't get people killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unfortuanately I'm going to admit I'm unskilled in this as well.  Since day 1, I've been /cast Cann /pause 36 /cast cann /p 36 /cast<br />
<br />
I just can't pay that much attention to EQ anymore :).  I have a h orse now so it doesn't matter and I SEE the advantage in it, it's just too intensive for me to get into. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Canni-dancing sucks. Period.<br />
<br />
You turn into a bard with all the timing of you buttons and when to sit down and stand up.  Screw that.<br />
<br />
I never go above 80h anyway.  And it's always about getting to 20m so you can cast slow one more time :)</div></div><hr />
