<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rakhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could start sometime in your late 40's/early 50's, no clearly set level where you should start. It's up to you, really. I'd say 51-52 would be a good time. Most rangers I've seen beyond 55 already have Swiftwind.<br />
<br />
Having acquired Swiftwind about 11 days ago, my answer as to whether or not it's still worth pursuing is a solid YES. As for whether or not it's worth actively pursuing Earthcaller...well there are others here who can give you a better informed opinion on that. I'd say if you get it, that's great, but don't fret too much about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grazyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for the info. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Start working on some of the running around as soon as you have the spell Levitation (and that only because its faster to run through Timorous Deep than it is to swim).  <br />
<br />
To actually talk to Telin Darkforest, I believe, you need to be 46.  <br />
<br />
To do some of the other stuff, such as getting the ancient pattern or the platinum speckled powder, or even the enchanted clay (if you buy or get awarded a jade reaver) should be doable at any level so long as faction (alrick in TD) isn't a problem.<br />
<br />
Why wait to get started, when you could have gotten the legwork out of the way and actually get Swiftwind (at least) as soon as possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's a quick roadmap for going epic by level.<br />
<br />
Levels &lt;39. Forage for the five foraged items as you happen to be in the appropriate zones during your normal adventuring.<br />
<br />
Levels 39-45. Actively forage. Do the Ancient Pattern and Platinum Speckled Powder subquests.<br />
<br />
Level 46. Formally initiate quest with Telin. He won't speak to you earlier than 46. Do the Coin subquest up to the point where you come back to Telin.<br />
<br />
Levels 46-49. Do the DE Corruptor, jade reaver camp, the Hole, and VSR as available to you. It has been recommended to me to MQ the SSoC.<br />
<br />
Level 50. Obtain Swiftwind. You cannot do turn in before level 50.<br />
<br />
Level 50+. Raid Hate as available to you in hopes of obtaining SEoC and Earthcaller.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm waiting for VSR to show up, then hopefully I'll be paying for the SSoC MQ with my silver chitin handwraps since I'll have a new haste item. In the meantime, I'm abusing JP griffs and checking KC in pursuit of 50 (been 3 years now, getting close).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok so what is the go here? Will my SCHW's become useless when I get my Swiftwind? Will they add no haste AT ALL? Or is it reduced or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you'll still use SCHWs when wielding a 2-hander.  When using the swiftwind, it's 41% haste is better than the haste of SCHW, so they will add nothing (to haste).  they are still a decent pair of gloves.</div></div><hr />

Swiftwind is 40% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, they are a decent pair of gloves, and yes they are useful when switching to two-hand. But woe, am I broke, and the SSoC MQ goes for 3k-5k on my server.</div></div><hr />
