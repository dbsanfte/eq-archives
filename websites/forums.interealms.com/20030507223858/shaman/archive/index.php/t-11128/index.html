<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">drop all wis gear and go for HP mate. I'm level 45 and i have about same HP/AC as you lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meat Puppet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Funny how I mentioned that to some of the higher level players in my guild and they say that I need more wisdom. How far can I go down on my wis? 200?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Many of the non-uber shaman (other than the Ikkys, whose set of available armors is a bit different) around here run with Wis down around 150ish.<br />
<br />
The ubers tend to have high wisdom simply because the armor that has the stats they are trying for (HP, AC, and useful focus effects) available at their level of play also tend to have big hunks of Wis on them as well.<br />
<br />
The correct level of Wis is a matter of personal preference (and available gear of course).</div></div><hr />

Were they high level Shaman or high level players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Wisdom's been between 170-210 for levels 53-59, depending on upgrades/changes.  Now sitting at about 200 (no kei) and that is plenty.<br />
<br />
Quick suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Dump the rings and get the 6 ac/65 hitpoint wedding rings.<br />
<br />
2) Find out who the tradeskillers are in your guild and think about collecting parts for Earring of Soltice.<br />
<br />
3)  Not sure on the stats on yer head piece, but Metal Linked Crown dirt cheap in bazaar and decent stats.<br />
<br />
4)  Switch shields, get a Sarnak Battle Shield--more AC/hitpoints, and resists.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't concentrate on WIS on my gear, preferring to go the AC/HP route, and with C5 and Bearform my WIS is 240 at level 60. So if you upgrade the AC/HP as you level, the wisdom will increase as your gear improves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meat Puppet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok thank you for the advice. We have only one shaman higher level than me and he is level 61. Yeah metal link crowns are cheap. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am 55 now and my unbuffed ac / hp is about 950 / 1750 or so but my working wisdom is only 145.  I can bearly break 1k ac self buffed.<br />
<br />
Shabby had some good ideas,  all I would add is that you should drop the Polished Tin Mail Shirt and equip an Iksar Chestplate....  but this may be a moron statement if you da Vah Shir can not equip.  If you can equip it then the regen is very nice in comparison to the stats on the shirt.  It would take about a Vindy level BP to get me to swap out my iksar chestplate for anthing other then a fungi untill I get to level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Need more HP.  With POP its pretty easy to raise your HP alot.  Metal Linked crowns, Leaf Scale gloves, those cheap Torques from poi, etc.  My magelo has alot of good items which you can pick up pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>godgav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm surprised no one has mentioned this to you yet, but the best favor you can do for yourself is to buy one of the cheap horses. I had an Iksar BP and liked it, but found it less useful after I got regrowth and sold it to finish off my horse fund. It is by far the best equipment investment you can make unless you spend a large percentage of your time indoors. Whatever HP/AC you could gain buying equipment with that money will be dwarfed by the HP you save by not getting sit aggro. <br />

This forum officially converted me to the Horse &gt; all religion and I have not doubted my faith once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tomcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Missing out you think, I wouldnt say missing out. I am a 62 Shaman on Sol Ro server and the items and wisdom / hp that i have make up for it. Yes some shaman feel hitpoints is more important that wisdom, but like i tell all young and upcoming shaman &quot; Get atleast 200 wisdom, then get a crap load of hp/mana items you can, but always keep a base of 200 wisdom&quot;. I have roughly around 2k in mana items alone and another 400 in hitpoint items. Took me a while to do it, but i did it finally and i am happy where i am at. I can cast 6 Group Focus's before OOM, so i think i have plenty of damn mana around to spare. Just my 2 coppers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i would say go for HP. wisdom around 150+ is ok till yo uhit your 50s imo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A good general rule of thumb seems to be shoot for 200 wis, 1000 ac, 2000 hp. From there you can adjust to your playing style..<br />
<br />
Baete</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wisdom will come.. even when you're not trying for it.. my hp is still a little low unbuffed at 64 (around 1956 or so) and my ac is around 1037 unbuffed.  I can get pretty damn close to 1100ac self buffed but not quite yet.  I need to replace my face slot item, get a new set of legs and I might just replace my AoI with a higher ac/hp item and just swap out when I use lower level buffs.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm at around 214 wis hehe..</div></div><hr />
