<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking at the new spells, I realized there's something way amiss.  Unless they up the level on the level IV focus items I don't see me using many of the new spells anytime soon.  The new heal is 25% more heal, at the same efficiency and cast rate as tnarg.  To use it (if they follow the established pattern of installing level V focus effects to go to 70) I'd have to replace preservation of xegony, quickening of mithaniel and marrs gift before the new spell would be better than a focused tnarg. Don't see that happen anytime soon. To a lesser extend that is true for nukes and dots.<br />
The only thing we probably have to use are the new buffs, will cost us an arm and a leg in mana due to the lack of mana saving and buff extender focus, but people will want and need them.<br />
When the level cap went up from 60 to 65, max focus effects were less than the increase in spell power.  This will be the first time where the new spells are useless unless accompanied by a complete re-gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've read, the focus effect issue is still up in the air.  One things the devs are considering is having current effects work above 65, but scaled down, so a 25% focus4 effect might be 15% for level70 spells.  Seems like a decent compromise if they don't want to just take focus4 up to 70 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Items like Mana Preservation IV should be scaled down, but good focus effects like Quickening of Mithaniel with a special name should work till level 70. They did that to VT gear. It would be totally BS if they made us collect gear over the past 2 years, to find its use largely degraded.</div></div><hr />
