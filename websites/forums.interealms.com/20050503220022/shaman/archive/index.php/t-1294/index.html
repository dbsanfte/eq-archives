Come to think of it I have never killed one of these.... anyone give me a rough idea of how tough they are?</div></div><hr />

Been spending alot of time in skyfire killing GW's lately.<br />
<br />
So that's where they've been going ;-) <br />
<br />
I used to spend tons of time in SF in my early 50's.  I have been thinking of returning for GWs, but none have been up the last few dozen times i've checked with my taxi/tracker gimp.  I've only seen the AW up 2 or 3 times ever, and have never fought one.  It's a rare spawn, but as far as I know it's just part of the rare cycle for the zone.  Keep killing the nameds / rares &amp; it should pop eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the Ancient Wyverns spawn around the entrance to VP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok so I guess this goes under &quot;try it and see n00b&quot; eh? =)<br />
<br />
Willdo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We took one of these down a while ago with a mid to upper 50's group. They summon and hit pretty damn hard (got wacked for 200 or so a few times in a row). Could a 60 Shaman solo him? I would think so, but would need the trifecta and Topor.<br />
<br />
I am sure some Oracle here has tried to solo them... anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, we were monopolizing the spawn for a while, but I think everyone has lost interest after 56 wurms and not a single usefull spell for anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plus, there are alwys peeps killing time in the zone now waiting for Ragefire to pop, so GW's go down quick now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok if you have no tracker for l33t pulling or whatever, how does a normal shaman find a Guardian Wurm?  I spent like 30 minutes browsing the zone invis looking for one but never found any.  Can anyone give me some clues here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Head to the north end of the zone, there is a plataue that you can park your party on, and pull to.  Free of wanderers ect.<br />
<br />
Almost directly south there is pool of lava.  Wait about 5 mins and 2 GW's will eventually path to this area, just be ready to con everything.<br />
<br />
The 3rd generally wanders between this pool and the VP zone, so it is basically a little off to the west.<br />
<br />
1 will generally be around the VP zone, often times stuck there.  <br />
<br />
By no means is this a perfect way to find them, but even without a ranger I can pull all 4 within 30 mins using this method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ANCIENT wyvern??<br />
i always kill him when i see him.<br />
i got a lv 54 druid parked there(on other account)and before i log my shaman i check if he is up.<br />
when i saw him(killed him maybe 10 times solo)<br />
he was 9 times up near burning woods zone.<br />
he hits max 220,don't cast.(easy)<br />
had only 2330 hp 997 ac and 185 wis the first time i tried him.<br />
now i have 2441 hp 1024 ac 214 wis(he goes down much faster now.<br />
i pulled him whit malo,<br />
cast slow(easy to land),<br />
cripple(i have my pet...:-)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Near BW zoneline, or VP entrance.<br />
Soloable but not a pushover.<br />
They indirectly cast spells by poisoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can these guys be done without level 60 spells? like malo and torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Probably soloable at 60, doubt it without torpor (probably fine without malo, just kite it until you've got him slowed).  You're just not going to keep up with the damage output of a mo that hits for 200+ w/o torpor.<br />
<br />
I've seen them on the north edge of the zone, but not very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ancient Wvyern Sloweable at 58, I tanked it the other day with my 57 monk. We had me and my shaman in a duo and another group with enchanter another shaman SK  cleric druid necro. Was very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ghetto track maybe?<br />
<br />
From zone in.<br />
<br />
Cast pet<br />
/pet attack &quot;Guardian Wurm&quot;<br />
/target Pet<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
Works for most mobs as long as you get name exactly right, I think I had to type something like /pet attack A_iteara_Vius00 once before. I don't think they nerfed this yet.</div></div><hr />
