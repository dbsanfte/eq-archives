<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heres a fun thing to fill 15 minutes if you get bored.<br />
<br />
I found my old profile on Castersrealm the other day, from just before I dinged 60. It was post Velious and long before Luclin.<br />
<br />
I plugged what I was wearing into Magelo, those who don't have old profiles knocking about will have to have good memories :) I'm sure some of the old timers have some even more old school profiles to share, pre Velious? pre Kunark?<br />
<br />

<br />
What were you wearing when you reached a milestone? What item makes you cringe now or do you have fond memories of where you got it from?<br />
<br />
Medicine totem - cringe! At the time a guildmate passed it to me and I was so pleased because I was having trouble getting the first few shawl quests done to get my Seal of Thoridan, was before the Benevolence quest went in/was discovered iirc.<br />
<br />
Fairy Hide Mantle - Id gotten all the bits for this quest in one trip to Sky after the quests had been upgraded and couldnt believe my luck, I think I wore that for ages just because I was still so impressed I'd gotten the pieces. One day while running through LOIO on the way to Cabilis I was checking the stats on it, misclicked and discovered that the pet on it is instant cast, I was so annoyed at wasting a charge on it, I think I sulked for hours.<br />
<br />
Kylong Wrist Guard - I was having terrible trouble finding a second bracer at the time, remember when bracers were such a pain to get the one you wanted to show up? Damn that red bracer....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I got my epic at 56 or so, i was wearing:<br />
<br />
Runed mith bracer<br />
Jarsath legs<br />
Froggy chestplate<br />
Barb shield from Hate<br />
<br />
I'm embarassed to admit that at one point I was wearing full totemic and the blackened iron bp from RE (I hated the red chest look of the bloodstained tunic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey!   I just upgraded my Totemic legs to Jarsath Legs.   Finally got a pair of Jarsath legs to drop :p<br />
<br />
Taladaen - shaman of 55 winters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recently replaced my Jar Jar bracer with SS, but have yet to win SS pants to replace the frigging jar jar pair I'm wearing now.  Man, I can't wait to hand all my old Jar Jar suit to a PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=299975) is probably the worst I ever looked. Tree weave, Jarsath legs, Eboots, Jaundiced and Totemic plate. It's done from memory, but I think it's pretty accurate.<br />
<br />
It was my &quot;balance&quot; stage, there were some low ac items (eboots, plat ruby veil) to balance out my zero wisdom slots (bp, rings, jaundiced bone stuff). I was around 56 in level, it might have been around the time epic weapons were introduced into the game. I'd just bought a JBB and a Paw, and added 5ac/55 hp rings to JBB tank better with.<br />
<br />
I was happy when I got an Iksar Ceremonial BP, I also replaced the Jboots with Rune Etched shortly after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">click on my profile and look at &quot;noobish&quot;<br />
<br />
thats what i was wearing before i started doing high end stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Gloriana's my long lost twin.<br />
<br />
We're wearing pretty close to the same stuff now, and when I got my epic (at 56) I was wearing close to what she's describing, 'cept I was lucky enough to score my JBBP a scant three nights earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got a screenshot from when I got my first pet which, outside of hitting 50, was the biggest EQ achievement out there at the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got a runed totem staff from the gnoll camp in Lake Rathetear at level 12. Took me 3 days of playing and dying repeatedly because I was too low level to be there, but finally a couple level 18 or so folks helped me kill a totem staff carrying gnoll. <br />
<br />
I used that weapon until 35th level when I killed what's-his-face (cant even remember it's name now), the evil eye in RunnyEye for the lens and got a Staff of the Observers. That's about the same time I finally finished the 'new' totemic armor quests and got to retire the last of my banded armor. Though, I was still wearing a runed circlet because I didnt like the barbarian horned helmets, and the totemic helm quest was a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
I was still using the Staff of the Observers months after I hit 50th, when Kunark came out. I had upgraded most of my totemic to Rune Etched by then, however. Shortly after Kunark came out, I received a spitestone shield on a Hate raid, and a friend gave me a howling harpoon so I retired the 2h blunt and learned piercing. Then came epic quests, and I was glad I had switched to piercing because I was almost maxxed by then.<br />
<br />
By the time Velious came out, I was weilding epic and wearing full rune etched + spitestone shield. That's pretty much how I was equipped up until level 58 or 59 when I got my first piece of Wolf Callers. <br />
<br />
When I hit level 60, I was using pretty much what is on my magelo profile now, except I only had Wolf Caller arms and the rest was RE. I had an AC 6/65 hp ring instead of the shadel bandit ring, and I think I was still using the howling harpoon in range slot instead of the talisman of benevolence.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, I just looked at my profile and remembered...I wore a totemic cloak until well after Velious came out. I finally upgraded it one day when we found an ancient seahorse hide cloak in Siren's Grotto. Then I did the cloak of truth quest when Luclin came out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I was 46 (before kunark or even plane of fear existed) I was wearing gatorscale legs, bloodstained tunic, efreeti boots, jasper rings, runed mithril bracers, charred guardian shield, platinum armbands (no AC, but my god the wisdom!). I don't remember my weapon, it was before there were any decent spears in game, so it was likely some 1h blunt. Possibly that one from lower guk, enammeled black mace. I believe I had a nightshade wreath or a runed circlet for a helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm...<br />
lvl 44  (the great HG soloing level )<br />
I had 1 RMB, Totemic BP, Legs,helm, bracer. 6wis rings, grotesque mask, chared guardian shield and some 5wis mace that droped during the kithicor war event. Neck was Chrysoberyl Talisman. <br />
<br />
Looked good in that totemic, I looted bark off grizleknot by chance the week the quest NPC were put in.<br />
<br />
<br />
54 was my next landmark.<br />
Rygorr BP upgraded to PoG...then Fungi a week later.<br />
Legs went from jarcrap to PoG<br />
JB arms upgraded to PoG<br />
Jarcrap bracer and mith bracer (got JBB to replace mith that level too)<br />
JB boots, imbued ivory collar, 5ac 55hp rings.<br />
<br />
Was a good level for me.</div></div><hr />

Velio-what? Couldn't run those crap zones on my AMDK62-450.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When I got my first peice of rune etch, I had full banded, no earrings, cutthrowt rings, leather apron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey, I wore banded until about 25.  I exchanged a few pieces out for that blackened armor, can't remember the name.  My big goal back then was to get a Staff of the Observers.  By 30 I had swapped most of my banded out for totemic, except for a Blood Stained Tunic and Runed Mithril Bracers.<br />
<br />
I stayed in totemic through my 30's and early 40's, but began to pick up some minor JB items.  I also acquired a Jade Chokdai Prod from a high level shaman (thanks Shardmoon where ever you are) who was giving them free to young shamans.  I traded my prod for a Totemic Helm, because I never saw the bear, ever.  I also remember camping the alchemist all night in Permafrost, who finally popped with my mammoth cape after some 12-14 hours.<br />
<br />
When Velious came out, I picked up Ry'Gorr to replace my totemic because it looked so cool.  I loved the old Ry'Gorr look.  Sad thing that they could never implement it for the new models.<br />
<br />
Late in my 40's and early 50's I picked up a Frog Scale Chestplate, Jarsath Legs, and Bracer.  After 3 or 4 attempts at completing the bugged broodmother quest, I finally got Kromriff leggings to replace my Jarsath.  Sometime during this time I started my on again/off again relationship with the JBB.<br />
<br />
When I got my epic, I think I was wearing Kromriff Legs, Barbed Ringmail, Black Fur Boots (JB boots looked TERRIBLE with Kromriff legs on the old models), JB helm, Chrystal Chitin Gauntlets and Vambraces, Spitestone Shield (my first ever planar item), Thurg Bracer, Rune-etched Bracer, Mammoth Cloak, Spine Chill Spear, Ivory Imbued Collar, and Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt.  I think I had a howling harpoon in my range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I hit 60 I was still wearing an Iksar regen BP (really bad luck on all my shroom king visists-started going there at 54) and Jarsath legs. edit-ack! how could I forget, was also wearing a mammoth hide cloak when I dinged 60!<br />
<br />
Wasnt till the high 40s, low 50s when I started getting Jaundiced bone and the first JB helm I bought was 8kpp and I paid around 5k for the arms, 3k for the gloves (was mid 40s when Kunark was released).  Luckily I got the boots as a drop.<br />
<br />
Had full banded until my mid 20s and full totemic at about 37, but wore RMBs instead of the totemic bracers for a long time and carried my CGS until my high 40s when I finally replaced it with the epic shield.</div></div><hr />
