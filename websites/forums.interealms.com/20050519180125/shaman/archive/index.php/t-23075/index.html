<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was watching a baseball game so i put my mule in after i patcheded. Went to watch game and come back to check on my trader and i'm at server select with a message that said i was inactive longer than the server allows. Ive been booted before as a trader but not in a long time and never with a message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am thinking you went LD, or quit to character selection screen, and you were there inactive for longer then the inactive timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dunno about the ld but i dont think i camped. I was in trader mode and do that all the time before i get in and start actively playing. <br />
<br />
I probably should of waited to see if it happened again before i posted just caught me off guard since ive never seen that message before and i leave trader or up on char select screen pretty often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you notice when you hit OK it took you off the server select screen and back to the login screen? Because the server select screen is where you were inactive too long, not in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've had a similar problem (usually in bazaar when also in trader mode).<br />
<br />
Join /auction or other channel where there is a lot of text flying back and forth.  For some reason if there is a long period of inactivity in the Bazaar (happens early AM - EST) you get kicked out of game.  Have had this happen to me numerous times on dial-up and DSL.<br />
<br />
Joining auction channel helps. (Unless they go mute)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most of the time this is caused by the individual server crashing. Since you get booted to server select when that happens, you start the timer there. I do not think there is any sort of activity timer in the game itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, typically you LD or the server crashes and you drop to login screen.  After a period of time on the login screen, you're out with that message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Probably your server crashed.  I know that the servers were blinking in and out like christmas trees last night.  <br />
<br />
At one time, Rodcet, Emarr and Tor were all down within about 2 minutes of each other, and I saw other servers up and down as I refreshed the network page.  annoying to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nope. Wasn't a server crash on my char. She was doing fine in trader. I left the comp to go do dishes and I come back and I have that same message. Inactive too long. Logged back in and put her back in trader and ..Bam...did it again.</div></div><hr />
