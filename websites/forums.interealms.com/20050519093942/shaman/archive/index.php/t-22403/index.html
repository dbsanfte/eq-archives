<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not that I think he will ever some to these boards but I have to give props to Sharpy a rogue on the Xev server.  Last night while waiting for a trial 5 or 6 group to start up I was killing the mobs in the &quot;tunnel&quot; there by the stoneshifter mob.  Up comes this dude and he kisses me on the cheek.  I blast back with a degrogatory word and he is like &quot;NO *** !LIES!..&quot;  So it begins.  LOL I am laughing just thinking about what ensued.  <br />
<br />
So Sharpy starts taunting me, you had to be there, but he was talking like skater gnome the whole time.  I pull another mob and as I am killing it he is trying to tell the mob how to kill me.  He was like &quot;Ok keep your chin up, when root breaks you will need to run over and use your magical powers to make him root himself so you can kill him&quot;, &quot;YES KILL HIM!!&quot;, *** I told you dogde and weave?!?!&quot;..it was funny as hell.<br />
<br />
He went on taunting me and never once did he interfere with my killing just was being a funny, funny charecter.  After a while he saw I had no problem killing these mobs with ease and he would be like &quot;MOB INC!!&quot; after I would root them and he would go BS it and break root.  It was all in fun and I was never in any danger really.  He would say &quot;OH no plz don't die...nah go ahead&quot;<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you guys and gals know that if you ever have the pleasure of hunting around this guy or if you are looking for a rogue on Xev this guy is worth grouping with.  He will keep you laughing for hours.  I went to bed with my stomach hurting!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i love posts like this..hehe...<br />
<br />
used to get stuck in groups all the time with someone on Ayonae Ro that drove me absolutely insane. after awhile, i started to like having him in groups with me, as long as we viewed it as a five man group plus one idiot, because he just cracked me up beyond belief by being a complete moron.<br />
<br />
now i call him &quot;The Zeby Experience&quot;...he's a bard, and all he does all the time is Levitation song. seriously. doesn't matter what you're doing or what he's supposed to be doing, you can count on zeby to levitate you all and go off in group chat about how high you're floating and who is &quot;winning&quot; (whoever is floating the highest at the moment is 'winning', apparently...though the contest never ends). he gets so happy with the floating, it's amazing. happiest person i've ever met in EQ...so simple. <br />
<br />
that said, he sucks. funny at times, but he is terrible. hehe.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that's the only song he has in his songbook?</div></div><hr />

You don't even need it in your songbook - just click singing steel boots :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think those are the pants, who wants water from someone's pants anyway? =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">summon bread was in the pants...though why you'd want bread from someones pants is just as bad as water.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
cleric velious armour was also known as vending machines. summon food on their boots lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">won roll on boots the other day with my Rogue in KC - effect is some sort of levi song, which you don't even need to twist. Of corse bard joined the group just after I won the roll, so I gave them to her. <br />
<br />
Now I think of it, clicking the boots was about all she was doing too....</div></div><hr />
