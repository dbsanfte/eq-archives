Could you explain how the shaman slow/agro bug currently works?  The new spdat shows that you are taking away 200 hate from the caster each time the spell lands.  Is the bug related to hate per tick?  If so will this lower hate for the shaman by 200 per tick or just 200 total?<br />
<br />
When we changed the melee slow spells to be removable with Cure Disease, it had the side effect of increasing the amount of hate that was generated when you slowed a monster.  To fix this, we've added a hate reduction effect to the spell to bring it back down to the hate it used to cause when you cast it.  When this version of the spell goes live, it will generate the same amount of hate it used to before we added the disease component, but still be removable with Cure Disease. <br />
<br />
Edit: They also stated that this would go in on Wednesday.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does spells with more effects generate more aggro when resisted? if so this fix won't help as long as you resist, which is when you actually got hurt by this bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's a good question.  But whether or not it generates MORE hate when resisted it's still going to generate the same excess hate that it is now when resisted.  So either way, if you bounce slow your in a MAJOR world of hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did anyone ever prove that you actually get more aggro when slow is resisted than when it sticks?<br />
<br />
I know it sure feels like you get more aggro because the mob is unslowed but is it really more difficult to taunt a mob that resisted off of the shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One really  strange thing I've noticed in past few days is that our slow seems to be much easier resisted than Enchater slows. <br />
 Lately I've done a lot or camping in CT, and at the sewers the Oozes, especially pools of oozes are really pain to slow. In most cases in need Malo to get slow trough, and even then I can fail 2 or even 3 casts. <br />
 However, we had an enchanter in our group, and he saw my struggle with slows and decided to try. He didnt even tash, and every single one  of his slows went straigh trough with first try (well few bad rolls for exceptions of course).<br />
 I was pretty boggled about that and had to ask the chanter if he was tashing or what. He said no, just cast slow as soon as they arrive to camp. ´<br />
 Then it's my turn to slow again, because I really dont want chanter to do my job. Resisted, beat to 30%hp, get heal while waiting the gem to unblur again, cast again, and resist. Then I see the &quot;Pool of Ooze's Body Slows Down&quot; -message again. <br />
 Yesterday we were camping reports in Sanctus Seru, and again I see the same thing. Chanter slows land on first try, I get resisted several times in a row before I malo. We decided to try this out with a guild enchanter, and really he slowed them mobs so much easier that I got laughed!<br />
 After that I've talked to a couple of chanter friemds about this, and they both have said that it seems that chanter slows are less resisted than Turgur's now.<br />
 I havent noticed this before they added the disease encounters in game, so I was wondering if any of you other shamen have noticed anything weird in slowing besides the damn aggro.<br />
<br />
 Slowing is my job, and I'll rather make a ranger than let the weakling chanters to do my job. I mean it's a matter of class honour here!<br />
 I'm the guy who Yawns mobs and then takes a couple of hits, Torpors up and saves cleric mana.  Not the chanter who slows, takes 3 hits and gets 3 heals right after! And it's not like chanters didnt already have something to do in exp groups already...<br />
<br />
 Has any of you noticed this or am I just on a 3 days of bad rolls or what? Sounds pretty akward to me if it is so.<br />
 Next time you go to a camp with rather Mr mobs, please try this out with your chanter, I want to know if we somehow got screwed with the new slowing thingy. At least from what I've tested it so far it seems that there could be a problem somewhere.<br />
<br />
BTW, something to share too: We killed our very first Tunare this saturday, 2 deaths and boy what a rush it was! He dropped a Golden Leaf Earring, Shammy Bp, Rogue Bp and the 15/18 monkey fist (wish I could have gotten that to my beastlord twink lol). We also completed a succesfull Ring war yesterday, and right before that in CT I got a goddamn nice earring:<br />
 Lizard Tooth Earring, +5ac, +6agi, +6str, +8sta, 75hp, +5svfire, +5svmagic, +5svcold.<br />
 And to top it off, I FINALLY found myself a Shadel Bandit Ring hehe. Very nice weekend in the land of Norrath!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">enchanters have an easier time landing theire slows yes :)<br />
<br />
but they dont last as long and the 5% more slow on ours does indeed help, not to mention chanters die in 2 hits, use malo on the higher ct mobs.<br />
<br />
on a related issue, am i the only one who thinks our dots cause an unreasonable amount of aggro?<br />
fun seein a wizard chaincrit for 4k, while i'm easily outtaunting ANYONE, even a 3-4 mins headstart for a warrior i can outdo, using (2) dots, who arent even in the same league as wizard nukes, it's almost like we get a full 1600 dmg taunt per tick on bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd be a little steamed if the chanter slows landed that much more frequently.  I know level makes a big difference, but Darius's account is from an oracle's perspective.  I'm hoping the differences were mostly fluke, but wouldn't the resist modifyer be listed in the spell dat file (forgot the name and I'm at work, can't check)?<br />
<br />
A 5% difference and a buck fifty will buy you a cup of coffee.  With rune 5 a chanter can take an initial pounding if he doesn't tash first and waits on slow a little.  The big difference here is the cast time.  Tugur's is half the cast time which is important for EXP groups as most die so quick that a chanter slow lands when the mob is at 50% health or less.  But on raids, if the slow is harder to resist, makes more sense to use the chanter slow.   Just what we needed, one less reason to bring a multiple shaman along.<br />
<br />
Most chanters I know love having a shaman in their group who slows so they can CC with a saftey net as they don't need to build extra aggro slowing and when mez breaks the mobs don't b-line to them.</div></div><hr />

Our DOTs get a triple ration of aggro: once a tick for the DOT damage, once for the DD damage and once for the number of counters the DOT puts out. except for the DOT the necros have in common with us, NO other DOTs get that.<br />
<br />
On the topic of the fix, what worries me a bit about it is that, given Verant long history to mess up, the added Hate debuff ends up adding another 'all or nothing' resist check to the spell line, making our oh-so-easy-to-land slows that much harder and that less useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got my Lizard Tooth earring from Cazic Thule at 4c camp.<br />
 In each of the 4 corners spawn 2 regular green lizards, and one Brown lizard. <br />
 The Brown lizzies are PH's for Taew Ritualist, lvl 60 necro lizard  who drops the earring. We spent 3 hours there and got 2 earrings. However that must have been pretty lucky because on my  previous camps in 4c I've spent hours and hours in there and never saw a ritualist once.<br />
 4c is a great exp camp, but dangerous too. Bring and SK for main tank, monk to split the corners, cleric, you (shaman) and a 60 Chanter. I wouldnt trust anything lower than a 60 chanter there. Rest of the group should be rogues, rangers or monks, because you want to have very high DPS here to  keep up with the spawns.<br />
  Heck, it's a nice earring, I've already been offered a Fungi +35k for it, but I'll rather keep it to myself. 100hp's and 5ac in ear slot is kinda nice:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm annoyed at this &quot;fix.&quot;  Not because I want the spells to stay the same, but because it's not a fix.  It's piling on effects to a spell, which means any time they ever touch slow spells again they have the chance to screw them all up.  The spell generates aggro, and then reduces aggro all in one shot?  Ug it sounds unbelievable.  The only possible good thing would be if by some stretch of reality the aggro reduction kicked in even when the spell is resisted.  I know, I know, there's no chance of that happening.  But wouldn't it be nice to get some benefit from an obvious hack &quot;solution?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The spell parse data seems to indicate the chanter slow is &quot;+5&quot; less resistable to the mob, whatever that means:<br />
<br />
Turgurs is Lvl 51 Shammy 66-75% slow<br />
Turgurs resist = Magic +0<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1370<br />
<br />
Shiftless Deeds is Lvl 44 Chanter 49-65% slow<br />
Shiftless Deeds resist = Magic +5<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=185</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As a follow up, the lvl 57 chanter slow Forlorn Deeds (67-70% slow) is resist =Magic+0 just like Turgurs.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1494<br />
<br />
So compared to chanters we get the big slow at 51 instead of 57, and it should have the same resistance check.  Plus we can live to tell about it.  Shaman = Still best slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kilguren Frosteyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Anyone else worried about this &quot;fix&quot;?<br />
<br />
The way they are handleing the extra aggro is by adding in a Jolt counterpart.  Which means that if we we get resisted we dont get the aggro reduction and we are generating just as much hate as before.  Maybee more with the extra effect added in.<br />
<br />
The ONLY time that this will make a difference is when we get Slow to land the first time.  Other than that shammies are going to be beat on just as much as in the last few weeks.</div></div><hr />

I read about the proposed fix for the Turgur's Insects spell (and other slows and tashes) at Caster's Realm: http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4241<br />
<br />
There is a flaw in this fix as presented, because the hate reduction will only take effect if the spell actually lands, not if it is resisted.  Thus, after this upgrade to the slow and tash lines (which is appreciated btw, thanks :), we are worse off if the spell resists.  Before the fix, a lot of shaman already had a macro of &quot;Turgur's resisted, gonna need a heal&quot; or similar.  A resisted Turgur's is now a death sentence as it takes that much longer for an MT to taunt a mob off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Rangers have never really figured out whether a resisted jolt (which is 500 hate reduction with no other effects) actually has some effect or not.  It's my belief that a resisted Jolt has some partial hate reduction, but it does vary, and mobs that are completely resistant it will have no effect on at all.<br />
<br />
Now as for the slow spells, I imagine if the slow component is resisted, then all parts of the spell will be resisted, including the hate modifier.  This is normally true of multi component spells, resist one part of it, resist all of it.    With that theory you could say that resists might increase due to the possibility of resisting the hate reduction, but not the slow component.  <br />
<br />
Quite the kludge.</div></div><hr />

The extra aggro was being generated because of all the disease counters that are being piled onto the mob.  Now we get an equal (?) reduction in hate so that the effect of the counters is null.<br />

If the spell lands, counters go on and the hate reduction effect also takes place.  net result = normal aggro from slow.<br />
<br />
If the spell resists, the counters don't land, and the hate reduction isn't necessary.  net result = normal aggro from slow.<br />
<br />
Isn't this correct? Or is additional hate being generated by the fact that the spell *could* land a disease counter...not that it actually *does*?</div></div><hr />

ENC lands slow much easier than SHM. <br />
<br />
I think this is proof positive that CHA makes slowing easier!!!<br />
<br />
That's basically exactly what I was going to reply.  I have a shaman and chanter both same lvl, 49.  I've been playing both with my monk lately, and it's always been the case that the enc slow'd easier.  I figured it was cuse the shaman was a few levels behind, but now he's even, and it's still the case.  I didn't even consider the possibility of a CHA check on slows.  <br />
<br />
Well one day I was working on alchemy, and gave all the CHA equip off enc to shaman to buy herbs and what not at the lowest possible price.  Totally forgot about the transfer of equip, and went exp'n the next day with my monk.  Now I had both shaman and enc with me attempting to slow.  For some odd reason the shaman was slowing everything first try, and the enc couldn't land a slow to save his life.  Then when I had looted up a buncha crap, I goto inventory to give to my druid to sell, and boom, i see my CHA at 105, and no CHA equip.  Then I remembered I gave the shammy the equip.  I check on him, and he's got like 140 CHA or something.  That itself was proof enough to me that there's a CHA check on slows, though it's been debated back and forth that it isn't so.  Since then there have been times when regardless of CHA, slow doesn't seem to stick, but for the most part i've noticed an increase in slowability in mobs when I give the shaman a CHA buff, even more effective when the enc has one.<br />

A little long-winded sorry, but wanted to explain as best as I could.  It may just be luck, but i'm convinced =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Anomalos, I just can't believe cha does anything for slowing.<br />
<br />
My guildmate is a troll 60 shaman.  He has a very low base cha and is also wearing an Eye of CT (-25 cha).  Although his cha has to be at least 50 points lower than mine, it's a guild joke that he consistently hits slow more often than I do.<br />
<br />
I would say the difference in enchie and shaman slowing is the fact they are NOT the same slow.</div></div><hr />

Yea I remember you posting that on the last &quot;CHA check on slows&quot; debated, and I don't have a reason to doubt the validity of what you're saying.  The fact is though, MY particular chars seem to work better with a HIGHER cha.  Maybe it's just me, but the thing is I had really not seen a CHA debate on here until like 2 days AFTER that happened to me, which is when I started to think maybe it's true =).  Time will tell, but this isn't something that's happened to me over a period of a few days, it's happened now for quite a while.  Could I ever prove it? No.  Do I think I might be crazy?  Yes.  Based on what you say,  and other arguments though, it could be totally random and i've just been getting unlucky without CHA, I can't really say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are they *really* not the same slow? Is anything different between them the cast time and slow percentage and the spell message when the mob is slowed? Do we really think VI coded 2 totally different slow lines that are different? Or did they just change the spell message, spell names, slow percentages and cast times/recast times and give the line to 2 different classes.<br />
<br />
Something makes me think the latter rather then the former. I believe that chanter/shaman slow are the same underlying code base. Perhaps they give the chanter slows an easier resist because they are inferior, and chanters also are weak dress wearing wuss's who cant take hits.. but I do not seriously think the spells are &quot;different&quot; in the manner you suggest. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Back during that other &quot;CHA affects slow&quot; discussion, I came up with the idea that each race/class combination might have its own &quot;magic number&quot; for CHA that is a kind of sweet spot for resists on some spells. The closer you get to it from either direction would make your resists approach the ideal limit. So, for a troll shaman, the number would be lower than a barb shaman, which would be lower than a high elf enchanter, e.g. That would explain this bell curve range phenomenon that arises from the contrast between accounts like yours and Gloriana's.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's more likely that this is all due to some post-hypnotic visual suggestion programmed into EQ to make us bray like donkeys whenever the words &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;charisma&quot; appear in the same sentence. ;)</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, extra hate was being generated even ON resists.  A resisted or &quot;will not take hold&quot; effect on a spell still generates hate. AKA willsapper.<br />

I haven't tested the new patch yet, but I am not holding my breath. Even money we still get munched on a resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">From the experience of all Willsapper holding wars in my guild, a proc that gets a &quot;will not take hold&quot; message does not generate any agro. It's as if the proc never happened. However, a &quot;so and so resisted&quot; message generates just as much agro as if the spell had landed.<br />
<br />
It's easy to test, you just need to find a lower level shaman. Cast Turgur on a mob, and have the lower level shaman chain cast. You will notice that whenver he gets a &quot;so and so mob resisted turgur&quot; message the mob will likely turn towards him. However, a &quot;your spell did not land&quot; doesn't seem to do anything at all. Or, if you can't find a low level shaman, just find a equal level enchanter and pingpong spectres or something.<br />
<br />
EQ checks for resistance first, then it checks to see if there's a higher level spell already on the target.<br />
<br />
I just came back from a NToV raid, and I'm pleased to say that I only had to tank one flurry drake (2 resisted turgurs, 3rd time succeded) instead of ALL of them a few weeks ago. The only time I managed to die to a flurry drake was on a resisted slow just as the MT was slowed.<br />
<br />
I have agroed a few normal drakes with a resisted turgur about 5 sec after the war engaged upon a resist, but I don't recall any mobs being glued on me upon a successful slow.<br />
<br />
Maybe the fix worked, but we won't have anything substantial to prove that a resisted turgurs generates more agro until we have more time to test.</div></div><hr />

I can tank most mobs just fine so it doesnt really bother me much but why do we have to get aggro from having a spell resisted? Do misses from melee characters generate any aggro?<br />

If you think about it from the mobs point of view - would you stop attacking a player bonking you with a big nasty hammer just because a sorry excuse for a shaman casts a spell on you that is resisted? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I would. If I was Lord UberDragon and a shaman cast slow on me and it was resisted, chances are pretty good that he is going to try and do it again, and keep trying until it lands.  I'd want to kill him before he did that :)  If it had already landed, though, there wouldn't be much point in killing him because the damage has already been done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I spent about 8 hours last night hunting the courtyard (no chanter to go deeper in) in CT and this is what I found out.<br />
<br />
The fix was bunk.  Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
However, I have found a bit of a workaround that most of you probably already know.<br />
<br />
For the first few hours we had an epic'd Ranger from our guild cast snare then I would land slow.  With a small amount of practice I found that we coudl cast at the same time and land his spell then mine one right after the other.  Most of the time, the ranger snare would be enough to maintain the agro. But about half the time we'd see &quot;You will not evade me, Azmodai!&quot; So he'd just cast snare again.   The most he would need to snare is 3 times but that was only when I had to try to slow a few times due to resists.<br />
<br />
Later, we had an SK with us and she pulled with a snare, but it didn't seem to hold the lizards attention enough to keep them off my ass, so our guildleader suggested she pull with a lifetap.  That worked just as well, if not better than the ranger's snare.<br />
<br />
Even later still, our guild leader simply walked up and started beating upon it with that Strength of Grodan axe from ME and stunning the mobs.  God I love paladins. :)  <br />
<br />
All three tactics worked.<br />
<br />
Admitedly this is a workaround in a high level zone with nasty mobs, but its still an xp group, and not a raid situation.  So, I can't speak much for those situations, but this seems to work well enough for an xp group.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, we had two warriors in the group who were unable to taunt off the mob from me, even when I would wait till it was below half life (just once, to test agro).<br />
<br />
I personally believe VI needs to do something else about this. This is a sorry fix for a problem they created.  Especially concerning resists.  Come on Verant, get with the program and quit hiring preschoolers as your programmers. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">CT is not a good place to test slow aggro. This zone's aggro is broken because mobs are over level 50 and it is still following &quot;old world rules&quot;.<br />
<br />
From the experience of all Willsapper holding wars in my guild, a proc that gets a &quot;will not take hold&quot; message does not generate any agro. It's as if the proc never happened. However, a &quot;so and so resisted&quot; message generates just as much agro as if the spell had landed. <br />
As for did not take hold messages:<br />
This is very easy to test, you can test it yourself with a tank. Was really easy to test when slow aggro was broken.<br />
<br />
Turgur slow a mob. Warrior taunt mob back to himself. Cast walking sleep on slowed mob. Mob smacks you.<br />
Aka you get &quot;spell did not take hold&quot; message, but it WILL still turn on you. This means spell is still generating aggro with did not take hold message. <br />
Test it. It's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Krak0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Cleared sleepers Golems last night, the slow agro reduction is working as far as I can tell.  Before the agro reduction I would die after most slows that landed.  Last night I only died from resists which is pretty normal for sleepers.  I agree CT is one of the worst places to test agro changes since agro in that zone is pretty screwy to start with.  After slowing named golems I was able to sit after a few seconds and swap spells without getting summoned and pummeled.<br />
<br />
Resist rates were in line with what I am used to as well so no hidden nerfs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Went to Ssra and The Deep...with mobs that had damage already done to them (5-15%) I still took aggro when slows landed.  Didn't seem fixed to me from what I saw last night.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">On ME gorangas, XiVius, and FG shrooms last night, I noticed no change in slow agro with the patch. Even if I wait a while for the mobs to take damage I still gained instant agro from a landed slow. And a resisted slow was instant heavy agro for a long time (this with a 60 ranger and a 56 warrior taunting). Business as usual:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Noticed a change in KC and Chardok. Back to normal aggro levels. Problem is I can't pull aggro like before which allowed me to root mezz things when there wasn't a chanter around. Well at least not as easy. <br />
And slowing in CT was ultra aggro before they changed slows. Went there a couple days after it opened. Slowed mob and for the entire fight was the tank. 55th Warrior unable to taunt aggro away even with 2 procing weapons.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why some people are raising a stink about resisted slows...tell me if I'm missing something:<br />
<br />
The extra aggro was being generated because of all the disease counters that are being piled onto the mob.  Now we get an equal (?) reduction in hate so that the effect of the counters is null.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Turgur pre-counter patch = X aggro.<br />
Turgur post-counter patch = X + 200 aggro.<br />
Turgur today = X + 200 aggro.<br />
<br />
Post counter patch:<br />
- You cast Turgur. Generate X + 200 aggro points whenever the spell is resisted OR not.<br />
<br />
Today:<br />
- You cast Turgur.<br />
- You generate immediately X + 200 aggro points.<br />
- If Turgur lands, you immediately reduce aggro by 200 points. This is the VI monkey coders uber coding skill. If your Turgur gets resisted, tuff luck, no aggro reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Part of the reason it may seem to not be &quot;fixed&quot; on alot of the Luclin mobs is due to their insane AC.  It takes alot longer for a melee to generate a good agro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Good point Jallail.<br />
It's very hard to do proper testing of this in many zones.  I think the sleeper zone test offered was the best source of info given so far.  <br />
As for myself . . lemme see . . o right . . I logged on wednesday and the guild was in Fear.  I went up and started slowing stuff, nuking, etc.  Actually Fear is so goddam easy these days we try to pull trains just so we can stay busy and clear it fast.  We were after CT u know . . and the plane must be clear for him.  <br />
<br />
I actually had a hard time keeping aggro off the chanters with their aggro from mezzes.  prepatch I'd normally have aggro or at least CLOSE to aggro after mez broke.    <br />
<br />
Lemme give you a specific example.  I see a mob come into camp with an assload of mobs behind it, it's a Knight (octopus head thingy) and my guildleader (60 chanter) attempts a mez.  It's resisted, he runs off a step and tries again but I've tried a slow by then. . I toss him a fast 'blast to keep him going and proceed to Malo and slow the beast.  Then he's got it mezzed right?  Anyway I figure i'm gonna have some fun cause everyone is busy with other mobs at this point and there are three other 60 shaman on the raid who are competent too.  <br />
So I epic dot the mob and immediately follow up with a Nuke . . . . I've got a haste ring on (thx mages) and it lands about same time as the dot does dmg and mez breaks.  Full dmg, mob goes RIGHT after the chanter, doh.  I nuke again, still aggroed on chanter . . my epic dot working still . . ***.  I had to nuke twice more to grab aggro.  Anyway . . not like a slowed mob is gonna waste a lvl 60 uber chanter, but whatever, that's not the point.  <br />
Point is, slow is NOT doing the aggro it used to do.  <br />
I had two slow attempts on him (one resisted) and it still wasn't interested in me.  This on a approx lvl 52-53 mob.  <br />
<br />
So yah I think the patch changed the way slow affects aggro, significantly even.  <br />
<br />
You can still gain aggro, but sheesh, u know that anyway.  Same rules apply, 'sini before slowing on super MR mobs that have a potential to lay the smack on you.  You don't do this, yer asking for a LOADING..PLEASE WAIT...</div></div><hr />
