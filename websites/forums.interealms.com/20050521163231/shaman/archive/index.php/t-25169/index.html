<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoddie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sorry if this seems a bit redundant but I am seeking guidance from the veteran Shammies.  I am currently level 61 with 12 AA's working towards Canni V.  I am in a guild that is not a regular raid guild but does tend to group alot together.  Typically, our group consists of my 61 Shaman, 65 SK, and 61 Beastlord.  My SK is at around 1300 AC 6700 HPs fully buffed which obviously restricts many places we can go.  My Beast friend is VERY concerned about AA's and does not want us to attain lvl 65+ until we are ready.  She fears that we may receive a bad reputation if when we hit lvl 65 we are not able to bring to the table AA wise what an average group would expect.  My intention is to stay at 61 until I get Canni V then head to lvl 65 at 100% XP. At 65 we agreed to get the crucial AA's that are needed for our class.  From what I have read and understand, the following AA's might be beneficial / sought after at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
MBG<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Mneumonic Retention<br />
Spirit Call<br />
LR<br />
VP3<br />
SCM 3<br />
<br />
Am I on track here or way off base?  My hopes are to get my core AA's then continue leveling towards lvl 70.  RL restricts me from attending most raids, so grouping and soloing are my main focus.  I have included my magelo profile.  What I am hoping to get from this post is some advice and possibly some direction if I am going down the wrong path.  It will not be long and my SK is going to become benched 90% of the time.  Ever since lvl 55, I have noticed how much more powerful we Shaman get every level :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">finish off Mental Clatity 3, then CanniV.  Then level to 65 - there are some GREAT spells available at 65.  The rest are all fine choices, you might want to put in 3 level of HP - more hp = better for CanniV<br />
<br />
MGB is a complete and total waste unless you raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MGB is very useful, if you actually raid.  If you don't, then it's a waste of points.<br />
<br />
If you play only occasionally, and plan to get level 70, and want the AAs that mean the absolute most to you and your group, go for:<br />
-MC3 and Canni5 asap.<br />
-RC1 is highly useful, and only costs 2 points.  One of the best AAs ever for it's cost.<br />
-VP1 is somewhat useful.  It's something that can easily be skipped, but there's many situations where being able to push mobs back is nice.  It's also a root that works off something other than magic, which can be a blessing.  It's an AA, so you can cast it immediately after casting another spell, which is also nice (no spell refresh delay).<br />
-Mnemwhatever the 9th spell gem.  Only 3 points?  I'd have payed 30.  Nuff said.<br />
-Shaman res AA ability.  Summoning the cleric back to their corpse after a bad situation and saving the group huge time getting them back?  Yes please.<br />
-Group Heal over time.  Get 3 levels of this.  Group HoT is hot.<br />
-Spiritual Channelling is big too, but if you don't have the HPs to power it, it's dangerous.<br />
<br />
Not too many other AAs are really OMG gamechanging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On your list and given your playstyle/grouping etc<br />
<br />
MC3 &amp; Canni V - a must-have (get your hps preferably above 2600 unbuffed to canni V with no buffs without low hp aggro)<br />
MGB - don't bother unless you are going to raid<br />
RC1 - very useful, it think RC3 better then VP3 for your uses - others may disagree (but it is also OK to just stop at RC1 or 2)<br />
Mnemonic retention - another must<br />
Spirit Call - nice toy, I still haven't got it with 120aa<br />
LR - again, another must, but you need CA3 (12aa) to get LR5<br />
VP3 - very useful, but VP1 is enough for general grouping<br />
SCM3 - very useful, especially when you have quiescence<br />
<br />
Suggestions<br />
Healing aa's - I notice you group with SK and BL, that means you are main healer a lot I guess, suggest you consider the healing aa route fairly soon starting off with healing gift.<br />
QB2 - with a spell haste item a quicker Q can be lifesaving.<br />
<br />
Gear<br />
I suggest you drop the chitinous belt and the GEB's and get something with hps in both slots. GEB focus is redundant for you now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AAs in order of importance:<br />
<br />
Canni5<br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
Call of the Wild<br />
Virulent Paralysis 3<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Maxed Healing Adept<br />
ND3<br />
Maxed Avoidance AAs<br />
Quick Buff (whatever it takes to get your HoT down to around 3 sec)<br />
SCRM<br />
Spiritual Channeling<br />
Maxed Healing Gift<br />
<br />
After that, you can either work on fun stuff like nuke/dot crits, or hone or enhance your existing abilities with SCM3, curing AAs, etc. but what I listed above is stuff that's of utmost priority.<br />
<br />
I threw spiritual channeling in there because I'm very impressed with what I can do with it in those &quot;oh s***!&quot; situations when I don't have time to cannibalize and I need to lay the ownage down or keep someone alive. If you're grouping in challenging areas it's definitely something I'd look into. At the very worst, it saves you some mana. At the best, it can save the day AND you won't lose mana :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The more I use Spiritual Channeling the more I like it. Right now I consider it one of my best AAs, right besides Call of the Wild and ahead of Cannibalisation. Yes, ahead. Cannibalisation may give more mana per hour but the effect of Spiritual Channeling is so immensely powerful it feels like playing a different class. As someone else remarked in another thread the ability to chainheal for 5 minutes straight is hard to overestimate.<br />
<br />
That being said I agree with most of the posters here as to what AAs are great. I do not really think grinding out tons of AAs at 65 is a great idea but they will not come that much slower then at 70 so at least you are not losing much in the long run.<br />
<br />
Given your Shaman/Beastlord/shadowknight group this would be the order in which I would spend my AAs (not listing prerequisites):<br />
<br />
1. Spiritual Channeling (Just amazing, have to wait until level 70 though)<br />
2. Canni 5 (Because mana is good, especially when you mainly group)<br />
3. Call of the Wild (Can be a huge timesaver, have to wait until level 70 though)<br />
4. Mnemonic Retention (Even 9 gems is not enough)<br />
5. Virulent Paralysis (Your regular groups features no crowd control except the little you can provide. This will help.)<br />
6. Spellcasting Mastery (For you SCM3 equates to FT5 and 320 mana)<br />
7. Radiant Cure (RC1 is just sooo cheap it seems like a crime not to get it)<br />
8. Quick Buff 2 (To cut down Torpor/Quiescence/Trushar to 3 secs or near that)<br />
9. Spirit Call (Offtanks/Supresses summoning/interrupts)<br />
10. Healing Increase/Healing Crits (Looks like you will be the main healer quite often)<br />
11. Durability, Avoidance, Mitigation (Extra survivability is always good, but with a Shadowknight tanking this should be low on the list)<br />
12. Group HoT (Extra instantcast healing is always good)<br />
13. Buff Extension (Extra healing is always good)<br />
14. Spellcasting Subtlety (Less aggro is good, but as you have a shadowknight tanking ...)<br />
<br />
Anything past Spirit Call are things I would not be willing to give up levels for myself. Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given your normal group, here's my priority list:<br />
(No prerequisites listed)<br />
1. Cannibalization<br />
2. Mnemonic Retention<br />
3. Natural Durability 3<br />
4. Maxxed Healing Adept<br />
5. Maxxed Advanced Healing Adept<br />
6. Virulent Paralysis<br />
7. Radiant Cure 1<br />
8. Maxxed Healing Gift<br />
9. Maxxed Advanced Healing Gift<br />
10. Quick Buff 2<br />
11. Spell Casting Mastery<br />
<br />
Once you hit 70:<br />
1. Call of the Wild<br />
2. Spiritual Channeling<br />
3. Group HOT<br />
<br />
Ok. I like healing AA, and given your group makeup, I daresay you should, too. I also like the OOW Healing Adept Mastery (I maxxed it, and you probably ought to at some point) but haven't done the OOW Healing Gift Mastery yet. Avoidance AA's are awesome, to be sure, but with an SK tanking they should be relatively low on the list IMO. Spirit Call ... meh, with nearly 300 AA, I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I'm missing something awesome, I don't know ... but truth be told, the only times I've seriously wished I had it were TZ raids. Buff extension AA are great (longer HOT! yay!). Honestly, MGB is a huge waste of your AA unless your play time changes to include regular raids.<br />
<br />
After the goodies, it's time to get the LR5/ID5/PP5/IE5 stuff, then finish off the buff extensions (if you hadn't already), finish off VP (though that should be a priority) and Radiant Cure, and then you get to play with fun AA like crit nukes (you wizard, you).<br />
<br />
Shaman AA Chart (http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/aa-chart.html) would be a good thing for you to print and have handy, though it doesn't yet include OOW or GOD AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MBG<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Mneumonic Retention<br />
Spirit Call<br />
LR<br />
VP3<br />
SCM 3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To emphasise what has been said already, MGB is only useful if you are in a bigtime raiding guild that does not have a lot of raiding shaman.<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting Radiant Cure 2<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention is an absolute must<br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes is probably the best AA you will get after Canni5<br />
<br />
Spirit Call is nice and fun, but not particularly important in the greater scheme of things<br />
<br />
SCM is nice, but in my opinion SCR and SCRM are more important - not for extending buffs...like who cares?....but for extending Torpor &amp; Quiesence<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis is very, very good<br />
<br />
As a snapshot opinion, I would rank our AA something like<br />
<br />
Canni5<br />
LR<br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
SCR SCRM<br />
VP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thugrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Honestly I dont think there is an AA out there that is more usefull than Lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Magni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am sure this horse has been beaten to death.  I personaly would craft your AAs around your playing style.  When I was working on 65 I was in a raiding guild that was pushing level 65.  Since then I have become a solo shaman and work on getting the AAs that benefit me as a soloer and not a group or raiding shaman.  Basically go for whatever benefits you and your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What may also work for you is basing your AAs around your causes of death.<br />
<br />
Died to getting slow aggro and getting beat down? Get defensive AAs or spellcasting subtlety.<br />
<br />
Died to running out of mana and not being able to heal the tank? Get Canni 5 or spellcasting mastery.<br />
<br />
Died to not being able to control adds? Get Virulent Paralysis.<br />
<br />
Don't find yourself dying at all? Play in more difficult places until you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My Beast friend is VERY concerned about AA's and does not want us to attain lvl 65+ until we are ready.  She fears that we may receive a bad reputation if when we hit lvl 65 we are not able to bring to the table AA wise what an average group would expect. Your friend is wise; being thoughtful and cautious often pays off.  But I think in this instance her fear is misplaced.<br />
<br />
When you get a random group at level 65 there is some small danger that someone may say &quot;What!? You're level 65 and you don't have BlaBla!?&quot; /disband  /publish-horrible-reputation-stuff-about-you<br />
<br />
But it is actually more likely that you will get in reputation trouble for:  being a loot whore; being afk at critical moments; not knowing how to play your class; not knowing how to work with other people.<br />
<br />
As to what order you get aa.  Cannibalize 5 aa may be more significant than Level 65.  <br />
<br />
Maybe not.  Level 65 grants you the spell Quiescence, which even with no aa helping will be game changing for your groups.  As you gain aa to strengthen it -- quick buff, extended buff, spell casting mastery -- it provides a lot of healing for very little mana.  <br />
<br />
I'd certainly say that the combination of Cannibalize 5 and Quiescence is so powerful that there is no other aa you 'obviously' ought to get sooner than that.<br />
<br />
(There are very powerful aa available at level 70, but you won't be there for quite a while.  And clearly you can't plan to get level 70 aa before you get level 65 :) )<br />
<br />
My intention is to stay at 61 until I get Canni V then head to lvl 65 at 100% XP. I myself did it the other way around, and have no regrets about that.  But your plan on this is fine, I think.<br />
<br />
After that:  MBG<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Mneumonic Retention<br />
Spirit Call<br />
LR<br />
VP3<br />
SCM 3MGB is wrong for you, you don't raid enough to make that worthwhile, as many others have said.<br />
<br />
I'd put Mnemonic Retention next.  From there I like Murtak's way of analyzing what to get next.  Why do you die?  Get the aa that will strengthen you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I too think that the fear is largely unfounded. My Shaman got to 65 with 0 AAs and did fine in groups before and after. Granted, Canni5 was a huge upgrade when I got it, but it's not like I couldn't find a group without it when I needed one.<br />
<br />
The only situation when I wouldn't be leveling to at least 65 is if I didn't have my level 65 spells in the bank. In that case I would be working on AAs while saving money and haunting the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Right now I'd say the target level should be 68 - simply because you can get your 66 - 68 spells fairly easy with single groups in DHc.  69/70 required multigroup stuff or Rifts, and that's no place for a 7 k tank.  But I'd go to 68 before switching to AAs.</div></div><hr />
