<br />
I am considering creating a shaman, or a necro. The main reason I think i am going to go for the shaman is because they can solo, and can group. I like to solo, but I find grouping more enjoyable. From what I've heard and seen. shamans are a great group/solo class. Also, I've heard they are a very fun class also. So, to anyone reading this, could you tell me if they in fact are a great group class, and a good soloer? Also, I've heard shammies are one of the funnest classes out their. <br />
<br />
So, if anyone could tell me anything that would help me along, I'de really appreciate it. I have an EXTREMELY hard time sticking with a class, I want to make sure I can stick with this, hopefully ntil the higher levels. <br />
<br />
Thank you all for any answers. =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necromancers can solo better than Shaman and are an asset to a group that isn't closeminded.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo and have a decent chance to get a group, play a Shaman.  If you know you'll be soloing alot more than grouping, make a Necromancer, they're just better at it.<br />
<br />
Above statement will create a derailment to this thread by page 2.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, play what you have fun with.  But be aware that shaman don't start becoming powerful until 24 when we can Cannabilize I and Regeneration.  At 34 we really start kicking when we get our first pet.<br />
<br />
Just have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sooda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion, Necros are suited very well to solo outdoors with room to move/fear.. thier roots dont seem to hold as well as other classes.. Outdoors and with room to fear, nothing touches a necromancer...<br />
<br />
That being said, I believe shaman are the most powerful &quot;All around&quot; soloer in the game... With a shaman it seems if it can be slowed, shaman can keel it....  Plus I would consider slow one of the if not THE most powerful line of spells in the game.. even your second level slow will start making a Huge difference.</div></div><hr />
