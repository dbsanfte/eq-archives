Think I can get 10k for it? Anyone really miss the effect on the lower level spells? I still cast torrent of poison and icestrike alot in exp groups...and turgurs everyonce and a while ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I ding 60 and scribe Topor I'm handing my ODS over to my cleric.  I can't afford to land a second one for her but the mana savings will be more important with her, my shaman's mana regen will be higher and therefore not require the savings as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I never had one. I have the coldain 8th shawl, and gosh, it is very very nice. Goes all the way up to 65, so replenishment, agility of the wrulan, go that extra 20% longer. Since I get annoyed with refreshing buffs often, it's coldain 8th shawl all the way for me.<br />
<br />
I want an affliction IV or III item badly though, but can't find any that are tradeable.... there's that pottery item that only goes in primary. No, I won't trade out my epic. *rude verant*. There's a gem ring that nobody ever sells from seb. There's an apness from PoN with no descriptions on who drops it and is never sold that goes in range.<br />
<br />
And the 2 boots off of wtov dragons (we are not wtov capable).<br />
<br />
Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ODS is Mana Preservation III - reduces the mana cost of all spells lvl 60 and under.  I should take it off for a while and see if I really miss the mana savings I get from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Turgurs is level 51, Torpor is level 60, I cast those a whole hell of a lot more often than I would cast FoS (if I can ever get the damned parchment).  I'm using Nev's left eye for mana pres, it's a nice range item anyways, but I don't see reason to give it up just yet, unless you're using nothing but 61+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know what ODS is. I personally think that in my line of work, Affliction Efficency III or IV would help better than Mana Pres - 20% vs 10%, and I do a lot more pox/plaguing/turgur's/maloing while soloing than I do buffing. Since I don't have torpor, and since Kraggs is immune to any form of mana pres or healing extentions, it's not really worth it to me.<br />
<br />
For example.<br />
<br />
I buff up. (25%). Then I pull shrooms. Each shroom gets slow, pox, plague, epic, jbb on it. That takes up 25% of my mana. Since I can do 5 patches of 5-6 shrooms before I have to rebuff sta/agi, that's 25-30 shrooms using 625% to 750% of my mana vs 25%. So for me, 20% reduction on the cost of killing a shroom is greater than the gain of saving on buffs and chloroblast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I sold my ODS yesterday :(  I couldn't make up my mind whether to keep it or not.  What finally convinced me was looking at my typical spell line up. Only one spell that i routinely use is affected by an ODS anymore (torpor). The rest are all either lvl 61-62, or are affected by aff haste III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sold mine for 10k, <br />
<br />
I wont miss it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can you not stack aff haste III with aff efficency II or IV or mana conservation III or IV?<br />
<br />
I didn't know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Harvyst...do the Coldain Wristguard Quest for your Affliction Efficiency III item.  Takes 2 hours tops.<br />
<br />
On Topic:  I have an ODS, Coldain Wristguard and Amulet of Insight.  I don't see myself getting rid of any of them anytime soon.  The combined effect is considerable.  At 59, the combined effects are considerable.  With the rate that I am getting parchments drops (very slow), I will be using them until 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, they don't stack, the best focus effect takes precedence.<br />
<br />
For example, I have a mana preservation III item as well as an affliction efficiency III item. When casting an affliction type spell (slow, root, malo etc) the affliction efficiency item triggers.<br />
<br />
Now, you can stack focus items with AA skills.  For example, my QB1 AA skill stacks with my spell haste III item for a faster casting torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ERRRKKKKK...Stop the boat.<br />
<br />
Mana Pres does not stack with Affliction Efficiency or Beneficial Efficiency?<br />
<br />
So then having ODS AND Coldain Wristguard and Amulet of Insight is redundant?  <br />
<br />
Say it ain't so pretty lady!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If the focus effects are the same effect:  Efficiency/Haste etc, they don't stack.  But Efficiency stacks with extension stacks with haste etc.   You can save mana, and cast faster and have it last longer, but you can't cast it for less, and less, and less.<br />
<br />
Having ODS, and Coldain Wrist and AoI is not redundant.  ODS makes the spell cheaper.  Coldain makes your Dots/Debuffs last longer.  AoI makes your buffs last longer.  Circlet makes your dots and debuffs cast faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah yes.  You are right.  My head is small today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally I haven't had an ODS for ages. Sold the one I had long before it got the focus effect. I went the way Harvyst went. I picked up an affliction efficiency 3 item and use that. Most of what I do is either already covered by the affliction efficiency or wouldn't matter much if i saved 10% mana on.<br />
<br />
When buffing a single group it's no problem to keep up with what ever else i need to be doing. When buffing a raid I'm always done before the clerics are so I just end up fm and waiting anyway.<br />
<br />
The only thing I cast with regularity that would be effected by the MP is torpor and thats pretty cheap already. I'm starting to cast tnags  mending more tho so that might change my mind on MP items but I wouldn't go with an ODS. I would end up picking up something for another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have really felt my ODS was very useful still, until this weekend (I was out of town and I still managed to get loot, /hug my guild).<br />
<br />
This weekend I scored an Affliction Efficiency 4 item.<br />
I was thinking, what spells am I casting now that would not be effected by Affliction Efficiency 4(25% savings) that are effected by mana pres3(10% savings)?<br />
<br />
Torpor<br />
Primal Essense (I also have grp PE hammer)<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura<br />
Spirit of Bih`li<br />
Invisibility<br />
<br />
Remember that any spells over level 60 are uneffected by your ODS.  So it does not work with Tnargs.  Neither does it work for pretty much all my best buffs - soul, boar, ac, agi, regen, haste.   My nukes don't work with ODS anymore, since they are level 61 and 64.   My debuffs/dots are covered by Afflicition Efficiency 4 better than Mana Pres3 now.<br />
<br />
The stats are bad enough on the the item I got that I think I will get rid of the ODS and try to make up the stats I lost on a new shoulder item.  The spells I mentioned are pretty low mana anyways and not really commonly used, except for Torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coldain Military Wristguard is Extended Affliction III, not Affliction Efficency.<br />
<br />
I have one, it's nice, but I was looking for mana savings on dots/slows in addition to longer dots/slows.</div></div><hr />

Henora, which Affliction Efficency IV item did you get?<br />

I'm still seeking one that is either not in Wtov, or obtainable by a group. There is a shamefull lack of AE III and IV items that are either not no-drop or not WToV or Tier 2 of the planes hard.<br />
<br />
To be exact, there is 1: gem encrusted ring with crap all stats from Old Sebelis, which I have never seen for sale.<br />
<br />
There is supposedly a sharp claw apness for IV that drops in PoN, but nobody knows where, and I haven't seen that for sale either.<br />
<br />
Looking further, there's a pottery made ceramic hammer of judgement, again, haven't seen it made, my pottery is only 222 and it is &gt;250 so I guess I'll need to get my tradeskills in order to get that one. It's a primary slot only, which means (fume), switching out my epic back and forth with it, and the loss of mana/hp/resists that causes.</div></div><hr />

If you looked it up on Allakhazams or perhaps even read another thread on this forum from today you could figure out where it came from. ;)<br />
<br />
Gem Encrusted Ring hasnt dropped in a long long time, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've got ODS, Coldain Wristguard, Boots of the Dead Dread, and Circlet of Falinken.  (mana pres 3, extended aff 3, aff efficiency 3, and aff haste 3) and it will take really quality loot out of VT or Ssra or PoP to make me not want to equip them anymore.<br />
<br />
My ODS affects my gfos, torpor, malo, malosini, group sta, group regen, turgur, and a variety of other utility spells.  I haven't gotten anything that helps much more than ODS.  Ever since I got the boots from the dragonin Ntov (Lord Feshlak is it?) I don't get as much benefit from just the ODS anymore.  But I haven't seen many shoulders that make me want to give up the ODS yet.  Perhaps if I got off my ass and finished getting faction with Chardok, or managed to kill Yael, I'd swap it out.  Matchless or Peerless Dragonwing Pauldrons might be an option too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Last 2 weeks I have been swapping mine in and out. After 30mins of play or so I can certainly tell when I am not wearing mine. Even with C3 and horse med it is noticeable. I'm not saying that I have mana problems, but I definitly am more aware that I am not sitting at FM nearly as much, and make a more concious effort to Canni5 every second it refreshes.<br />
<br />
This includes raiding, grp exp, and solo. <br />
I have a nice pair of Strength of the Elements that I swap in, but I still prefer the ODS for most situations. It still works with 75% of the spells I have memmed at most times. Maybe my tune will change as I get more 63-64-65 spells, but for now it still is great, especially soloing.</div></div><hr />

Check the thread on ultor today. Drops the range slot AE4 item you wanted.<br />
<br />
To be exact, there is 1: gem encrusted ring with crap all stats from Old Sebelis, which I have never seen for sale.<br />
<br />
Actually the gem ring doesn't drop in sebilis and never did. It was a bugged drop that dropped from forest giants and such in FM and DL the first week or so of kunark. Pretty limited quantity item on most severs and wouldn't be commonly sold.<br />

<br />
procceded to head to PoV for some groupage...didnt miss it a bit. I am on horseback most of the time in zones like that, and not having the ODS didnt slow me down one bit. No C3, but did have bardsong. Probably use the funds to get a bracer of fortitude.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, magelo doesn't list focus effects.<br />

I wish it did. <br />

Talisman of Evasion wasn't listed as an affliction item from alla.<br />

I'll see about tracking that Uldak down though :)</div></div><hr />
