<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having trouble getting obsidianwood saps to finish my Aid Grimel quest and was wondering if anyone has had any luck soloing the spiders in PoF that can drop this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trivially.  You can root and rot them with no problems, except for the few that are immune to run speed changes, and those you use run and rot on them (with the pet biting on their arses).  Plenty of room to kite them around behind zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gotta have non-poison DoT's to kill the spiders too they are very very PR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have a 40% chance of posion dots working. Make sure you do sinia and they drop very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was able to do this today and after figuring out where to pull them to and kite them if needed it was pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Got a sap drop off the third spider or so I killed then a few hours later had a spider drop 2 saps for me.<br />
<br />
Finished the tailoring part of quest, then the fletching then the baking, turned in my hope stone and now have my earring.  :D <br />
<br />
These are selling for 20k on Fennin. Might be a good place to farm for some cash and get some decent exp if you have your PoF flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Unfortunatly the price on saps is down to 10k on Ec'i which is makes this not worth it. Oh well, it was good pp while it lasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i was have soloed the yellow field quite extencivly.  I found the drop rate in that field to be not worthy of cash farming.  think the last sap i sold was 18k?  Anyway, the reds in the second castle proved to be much easier for xp purposes, but only drop a flameing head as your &quot;cash&quot; loot /boggle...i figure for cash a poegroup/ldonhardfarming/tactics pit area farming is the way to go...can pump out much more cash in a shorter time even if the xp isn't as good.<br />
still, it is nice to know that the spiders are easily soloable if you need the sap and can't find any up in the baz.<br />
Also, noticed these had a strong posoin resist rate and a moderate magic resist rate.<br />
<br />
on a side note, i hate the magma guys and their stupid high HP + MR + crappy magma drop rate lol..</div></div><hr />
