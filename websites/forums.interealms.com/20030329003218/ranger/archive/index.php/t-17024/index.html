<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just been reading up on a few possible targets I am thinking bout hunting;<br />
<br />
ToFS; what floors can I solo at 47 (see sig for gear)<br />
<br />
JPF; can I solo bandits there? heard they were good XP<br />
<br />
also,<br />
<br />
TM room in Echo; anyone offer any info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as soloing bandits (I'm assuming you mean poachers) in JPF, I don't think you could handle them solo.  Some are still dark blue to me at 55 and they hit pretty hard.  Better option would be to solo the griffawns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 47 the only way to solo some of those poachers would be to root plink.  And root shooting is one of the least efficient means of doing damage (of course you could be running backwards in front of a snared mob, but its essentially the same thing) before getting into the EQ/AM series combo.  The only realistic way you could do this would be with Tolan's Bracer.<br />
<br />
At 47, solo in JP by fear kiting.  You'll get a far higher kill rate by fear kiting than you will by rooting and shooting poachers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, Puachers out.<br />
<br />
What about Tower of Frozen Shadows or the Taskmaster room in Echo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I doubt you can solo in ToFS effectively, I tried at around your level and it didn't work all that well. Basically, without a Fungi Tunic and both epics, we are limited in our soloing ability until we get AM/EQ, except for fear kiting. Get yourself a healing partner, esp. a Shaman, and you can do a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I have been thinking about making a bot but ATM it doesn't seem worth it (I have a lvl 50 druid friend and once he dings and gets hit 500-600 pt heal I am gonna get him to come do some stuff with me).<br />
<br />
Also I have my Fungi already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harijan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have worked in both ToFS and at the poachers camp extensively.  ToFS at 47 solo is not a good idea.  you need a healing partner in ToFS a cleric or shaman is ideal.  Invis up to the wedding and make a ton of xp and cash.  Keep in mind that in ToFS level one and 2 are undead, level 3 and 4 are alive.  With one or two rare spawn exceptions.  So fight thru one and two. (the mobs on 2 will follow you thru mirrors, level one will not)  <br />
<br />
The wedding is one of the best camps for pre 50 and it is almost always open.  but you need a slower with you.<br />
<br />
I have a friend who is 2 boxing a 49 druid and 42 ranger at the poachers in JP right now.  He is rolling in the xp.  When he gets board he fear kites griffs.  <br />
<br />
I think fear kiting griffs in JP is a good idea at 47 just remember to keep them close to town unless you have wolf form.  <br />
<br />
Good solo spots at 47 <br />
fear kite in eastern waiste and great divide.<br />
Fear kite raptors next to sky zone in wakening lands. <br />
<br />
have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elvix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just bought myself a new Alienware computer for Xmas. I have to say so far I love it. No problems at all. I did not get an actual Windows CD with the box just a recovery disk. One big difference I found between the econoboxes and a high-end manufacturer (Alienware, Falcon, or Voodoo) is the thought they put into the machine. My machine is nicely put together and looks very neat and tidy on the inside. It also came with a notebook that contained all the information on the hardware and drivers. There were also benchmarks to use for reference. All in all a happy Alienware customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And what does this have to do with leveling???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elvix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">doh! I wondered what happened to my reply to the Alienware post in the general forum oops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hee hee Elran,<br />
<br />
reminds me of how EVERY thread no matter the subject that has more than 20 replies ends up having a post that basically says &quot;rangers can tank in PoP zones, I do it all the time with no problems&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did bandits from 47 to 51 in Jpf. Harmony is your friend.  Just pull one solo and kill.    Be advised to stay away from named bandits since those tend to be harder to kill.<br />
<br />
Took me less then 2 days to go from 47 to 51 there. Easy  and safe exp. Just remember to snare runners.</div></div><hr />
