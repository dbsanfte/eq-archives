<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i used to be able to copy the directory of eq to another folder so i could play 2 windowed modes from the same pc but now i had to install with newly bought cds and for some reason the eq.exe is not in the directory it is only as a shortcut and i cant figure out how to get 2 instances on the same pc. anyone help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I only have one instalation of EQ. I just alt tab out and start it again. No probs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can use the [alt + enter]  to window the instance of EQ then use [shift + alt + r] to minimize it.<br />
<br />
How are you using alt tab?<br />
<br />
I have two accounts but am also unable to load both on the same pc with EQWindows.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kuukymunster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also use the (alt + enter ) then (alt + shift + R )method . I realized though that alt + tab is just the same as (alt + enter)  for me anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find when I need do something for a sec and come back, EQ by itself is just fine, but I use EQWindows to play 2 accounts on the same PC.<br />
<br />
Use 2 directories and make sure that one of them has a file named nosound.txt -- if it doesn't have one, make one.  Sound on both instances of EQ lags things all to heck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use 2 Eq Installs<br />
2 Eqw<br />
<br />
Point Each Eqw To A Sep Eq Folder<br />
Patch Both Paths<br />
<br />
Run From Both Dir's<br />
<br />
Then Alt + Tab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did a direct copy of my EQ files into another folder called Everquest2, then set up a shortcut to the patch file on desktop. I crank up the new version on one account, minimize with (alt-shift-r), then crank up the original version on another account, and I'm fine. When I do it in the reverse order I get some message about eqmain.dll and can't get the second startup running. I have the Everquest2 version running with just about everything cut off (models, sound, etc.,) because I think it helps, but I really haven't tested it any other way to find out for sure. Maybe that's causing the eqmain.dll problem./shrug <br />
<br />
Once both accounts are up and running, I have no problems and switching from one to the other is fairly quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont understand why you guys have 2 EQ directories you are just wasting space.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is have one and open two instances of EQw and it will run fine (if you have a good computer). I have been doing that since I have found out about EQw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 instances of eq loaded for me cuts down on lag, zone times, and also prevents one of the accts or even rasrely both to have the mouse cursor freeze. This usually means that i would have to alt-tab-r every time i switch between accts, a huge pita.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found that 2 EQW directories seriously cuts down on the lag here.  Don't know why.  It runs OK with one EQW directory, but it runs well with 2.  Like mana, hard drive space is not an issue here :)</div></div><hr />
