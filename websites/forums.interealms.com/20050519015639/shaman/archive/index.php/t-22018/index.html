<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">shaman decays mob, then the shaman form a geometric shape by facing in the appropriate direction so if you have 3 shaman one faces say South, the next faces say ne then the third faces west, the idea is to disease root the mob in a perfcet connect the dots shape and have him end up right back where he started in under 2 seconds this way the more shaman you have on a raid the BETTER it is, you could go from a triangle to an octegon with enough shaman. <br />
<br />
what do you think, would this solve the stackability issue we have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If all the shaman duck, then you can stack 'em like hotel banquet room chairs.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In ancient times there was a bug that you could either: do multiple levitations or drop an item (I forget which it was) and you would go higher with time you did that.... You could scale unscalable walls that way.<br />
<br />
   Using this trick you could have stacked shaman in a raid vertically as high as you wanted,  the skys the limit!  It would be the ultimate in shaman raid stacking</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think they should give us a new spell called &quot;Beach Ball&quot;.  Cast it like a pet and we can then go into bear form and do circus tricks to entertain the guild between pulls.  Then there's the ever popular Bear Jumping Contests.</div></div><hr />
