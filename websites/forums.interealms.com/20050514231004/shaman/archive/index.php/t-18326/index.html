<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This game is looking better and better each time i see it and last week it finaly hooked me. The shaman class look really tight, very much like the shaman in EQ, but they can rez which is so nice and makes so much sense. The only thing i dont like about it is the classes that can be a shaman. They need to add a human/barbarian, but trolls/Orcs and Minitors are cool. Im probably going to be a Minator.<br />
<br />
How about ya all ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm probably going to play several characters, right now Druid, Paladin, and Shaman all appeal (in no particular order).  Priests also look pretty cool... kind of a chanter/cleric... looks like an awesome support class.<br />
<br />
Supposedly Shaman are going to be Horde races only, just like paladins are Alliance-only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably a dorf paladin or rogue for me, but I might try a shaman as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is why I really want to get into beta.<br />
<br />
We simply don't know enough about any of the classes and game mechanics to make an educated choice about what to play.  I really want into beta to play around with all the classes and get an idea what I want to make my primary character upon release.  <br />
<br />
I swore I'd go pure melee this time and play a warrior in WoW, but the lure of the shaman is a strong one.  Bloodlust is such a fkin cool ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I read something some time ago that lead me to believe that they were going to be the main healers. If that is the case, I think I will pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm looking forward to trying WoW in a year or 2. :P<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt the shaman class in WoW will really compare to the EQ shaman - the only class that'll compare to EQ will be pure warrior if they have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, i dont know if you read up lately, but it seems all classes with have discs they can use i think from level 1 and they claim itll do signifficent damage for your level. <br />
<br />
Have you guys been following the sight info?  There is some pretty good info on whats going on. THeir melee look pretty powerful, its kinda a shame they pure melee will have spells though. I think a pure melee should be just that. But int he intrest of fun i have to admit, their ideas for a warrior sound much more fun for the player. I guess thats my draw to WoW, it look more fun then &quot;perfectly balance and realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing you can always say about Blizzard is their games are fun.  A point that sometimes eq completely misses on.  Blizzards record on cheats, hacks, etc is a whooole other story.<br />
From what I've seen wow should be a blast.  I can really see it siphoning off a great deal of people from eq.  At least until people are willing to pay money for stuff in game, at that point blizz usually becomes hopelessly unable to deal with the problem.  This is really my only concern about it, that they not deliver online play with as many holes as diablo, starcraft, warcraft, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I for one will definitely buy WoW.  I agree with jdthomas, I have always had fun with blizzard games.  I really hope they have learned from their mistakes in the past with online games though.  <br />
<br />
As for playing a Shaman, I will definitely create one.  If it feels like a fit, that will be my choice.  If not, my next choice would be a rogue :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well I'd have to see how the game and the class shapes up first, but an Orc Shaman would probably be first choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really dont think that I will play a shaman in WOW. Personally I dont exspect them to be like the EQ shaman. And eather way it would be setting up for a big disapointment. It's better I think to start a new class and learn it from scarch. After all it is a new game. Rather then sitting around makeing comparisons of whats good/bad between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm going for a pure &quot;intelligence&quot; caster in WoW... more than likely a Magician... just because I've never played one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm considering the possibility. Much as I think he personally is vermin, have to wait until Furor does a shaman update (or I get into beta...so it'll be the Furor thing) to get better information.<br />
<br />
Class choice being comparitively smaller vs EQ, there's going to be more overlap in function of the spellcasting classes. So, shamans are definately going to be in demand as healers, they will not be the SOLE healers. The horde faction that shamans are exclusive to also has a couple of races that are capable of being the &quot;Priest&quot; class, which will be the generally more powerful healer.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing tho, there is a LOT of customization to be done, from the looks of things. How you manipulate your Talent Points will have a lot of influence over your character. The shaman who drops points into enhanced wisdom (or whatever it gets called in WoW) and fire mastery will play a lot different than the one who buffs up his strength and mace mastery, who will be a lot different from the one who goes all-out healing.<br />
<br />
The flexibility looks good...the trick will be in the balancing. Which, I suppose, is why Blizzard is anticipating an 8 month beta cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've made that mistake before. I might try a shaman in WoW, I might not. But I've learned not to try to carry over class names from one game to another. When I tried DAoC after it came out, I went right for shaman, because I liked EQ shaman so much. DAoC's shaman had heals, poison dot's, disease, root, buffs, etc... Very similar, except for the attack speed slow. <br />
<br />
Well, DAoC's shaman sucked horribly. The spells they got just were not very good. Not good at all.  On top of that, it was the only character class in the game which was almost completely defenseless once engaged in melee combat. You couldn't cast when engaged in melee. Every other class in the game was either a melee class (who didn't care) or had some special ability to cast at least some spells in an emergency. Shaman's did not, and were helpless if attacked by a remotely dangerous critter. This may have been fixed since then, but not when I was playing (fairly briefly). <br />
<br />
So... I don't pick a character class any more until I actually get into a game and find out how the classes work. I don't know anything detailed about WoW classes yet, so I can't guess what I'll finally end up playing. In EQ, I hate primarily melee classes. In Diablo II I love the paladin. It's too game dependent to guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have enjoyed all blizzard games also and i agree thier inability to stop duper/cheater/hacker is piss poor.  They have to understand if we are paying a monthly fee to play a game on their servers we WILL NOT put up with the same **** that goes on in Diablo2.  Plain and simple i will not pay a month charge to play a game if it is anything like D2 was with duping/cheating/hacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mages will be fun, Pets, Slows, Nukes, Teleports, and Polyform !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is kinda like diablo 2 but in mmorpg mode.. I love the sound of it.. the paladin auras and the barb shouts.. hmm.. I'm going to pick amazon cause I like 30 arrows who can strike through all targets..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I plan on trying out a few different classes, shaman and necromancer definately interest me but like others have said, they may not be anything like the classes in EQ.  I'll definately check out the melee classes too, they seem like a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkzeroj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never heard of it until I read most of ya talking about it, so I decided to look it up, I will admit some of the ideas are pretty good, graphics are aight, but I still feel eq has a better game play, and since it's been around alot longer it's more adult like. <br />
The only thing I couldn't find is, will this game be an online game, and also didn't see the controls.<br />
<br />
BTW I'm not in the U.S at the moment, I'm in Baghdad, any help you can give on showing me how this new game works, would be cool..<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
