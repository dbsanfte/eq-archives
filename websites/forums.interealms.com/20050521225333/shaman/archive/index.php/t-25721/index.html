<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it's been a little over a year now since I've put the IGE banner up there. I'm curious to see what people think about how things have been since then? Do you dislike the fact it's there, don't mind it, or don't really care? Did it change things for the worse like the doom and gloomers predicted? :)<br />
<br />
The secondary market seems to be pretty big in games now and I want to know where people stand on the matter, now. So please, take the time to vote and discuss as well.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I know a good amount of people use the service. I've got some pretty impressive numbers to back that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The deal was sweet, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont use IGE etc,dont like them,think they should be banned.<br />
<br />
But hey the fact you're getting money off of him for what after all is a little unobtrusive banner doesnt worry me in the slightest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't like companies like IGE, so I don't patronize them.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is they will always exist so long as companies like SOE allow them to, or laws are adopted to stop them. That being said, I can't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to offset costs of running this place by allowing them a simple banner ad.<br />
<br />
Just don't put them up on the Hunter's Lodge. /evilgrin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Just ... um ... what banner?  :D<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with Wulfbane.<br />
<br />
The banner doesn't bother me, but I wish those guys would get crushed out of business.  I think people should advance in the game within the game.  Anything else is a cheat.<br />
<br />
Other folks are effected by it too.  Prices of spells/items are definitely and substantially impacted by professional farmers/out-of-game sellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
I quit playing for a while and when I came back I was horribly behind. I bought some plat from one of the companies so I could get some better gear without being a bother on friends.<br />
<br />
However, this was before all the big companies exploits came to light.<br />
<br />
After I found out what some of the plat brokers were doing to illegally gain plat I would never buy from them again. <br />
<br />
I also Adblocked the IGE banner from the web page so when I say, “What banner” I really mean, “What banner?” <br />
<br />
I only hope you forgive my hypocriticalismness due to the fact that I had no idea that these companies were doing bad stuff to get plat.<br />
<br />
I don’t really know if it was IGE or someone else but several of them were busted for bad things. So if it wasn’t IGE, sorry but I am still never buying from a big company again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much love for ad blockers!<br />
<br />
As for the rest of it ... at least you had the balls to admit it. That's more than most can say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The &quot;secondary market&quot;, as others have said, is probably unavoidable. Demand creates suppliy, especially given the disparity between the income of a Chinese teenager and a First World middle class gamer. Doesn't make it a good thing, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I also have not seen the banner since the first day that it made its appearance.  <br />
<br />
As far as the secondary market goes: I couldnt care less.  If someone wants to buy plat or items to enhance their character more power to them.  Buying characters Im a little more wary of but only because Ive suffered more than one death because of a freshly purchased character.  They simply go on my list and I aviod them.  Again, no skin off my back.  Its against the EULA, so I dont do it cause I like playing EQ, but from a business standpoint I have to applaud the people that came up with the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't mind the banner, much less even notice it any more.<br />
<br />
Don't use the service, but will admit I have been to the site for curiosity's sake.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I ponder... that my Shaman is trully ghetto, and what a guild or I myself couldn't get would certainly be attainable through their service (i.e, spells, plat or droppable gear).<br />
<br />
I been playing my Shaman for 2yrs (12 of Feb is his brithday), and only recently hit 65.  My gear for the most part stinks, and will never be an ubah.  Never had more than 22k pp on me at one time (and that was just this week, until I got me a pair of used boots that still had a bit of sole left in em)...<br />
<br />
...  But that's what keeps me logging to the game.  The ability to work towards and acheive a goal, whatever that goal might be... <br />
<br />
Each to their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally, I don't use and have no need of the companys services.<br />
<br />
Personally, I despise the activities of the company, those who work for it and those who use it's 'services'. I also feel the actions of the company have an overall negative effect on everquest in general.<br />
<br />
However, I like the crucible, I like the fact sunmoon not longer has to pay/donation drive to keep it running, and it always seems to function well for me; so in all I cannot really object the the company paying for it all. I just see it as the mugs that buy plat or whatever pay for a website I like ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mm, I've made 2x plat purchases in my life, wich I used to esepicaly advance myself, my fave tank, and pay my tv bill(don'task).<br />
I heard rumours before purchasing, but have seen fact since. Haven't gone back for a third purchase either.<br />
<br />
Selling plat they earned is one thing, cheating for it is another.<br />
<br />
But seroiusly, when you get down to it, the best gear is one gruopable no drop, or raidable no drop. And IGE can never offer the means to buy that.<br />
<br />
Plus, I never noticed the banner, even tho I don't use ad-blocking  software.<br />
<br />
My vpte is cast in the name &quot;I really don't care, it doesn't bother me&quot; <br />
<br />
~_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I can tell the cheaters/glitchers tend to be the small man teams. From what I can tell places like IGE tend to make their money like most buisnessman buy low sell high.<br />
<br />
Either way don't particularly care what other people do with their money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To the virtual good market, it ruined some aspects of Everquest for me.<br />
To the advert, I don't really notice it. Which surely is a bad thing for an advert designed to make sales?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Voted don't really care.<br />
<br />
I haven't used the service before and seriously doubt I ever will.  If someone else wants to spend their money for in-game cash/items, it doesn't bother me.  If they want/need to spend their cash on in-game items/pp to enjoy the game, that's their choice.  I'd rather spend the time in-game with my friends to get said item or complete the quest, gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride in my character and for me is a big reason why I keep playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Till I read this post I don't think I have really noticed the banner, except while reading posts about it when we first got the thing.  If it pays for the site and it is so small and right up with all the rest of the things I scroll off screen immediately (and out of the eyeline), who cares? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  I have been to a couple of the sites that buy/sell people to find out just how much I could make off Caanus were I to completely retire at any point.  But I doubt the numbers will ever get high enough to keep me from thinking &quot;But what if I want to come back?&quot;  (the same mentality that leads to buying platforming games that I pass in 2 days rather than renting them).</div></div><hr />

EQ's economy is since long destroyed though, but it would be nice if maybe WoW's survived a bit longer.</div></div><hr />

I was nodding my head in total agreement to this statement.  Very well said Gart.<br />
<br />
One is *supposed* to play the game, to *play* it, right?<br />
<br />
However, I did vote for the non-controlled methods becuase the option for message boards was in it.  I can see message boards used as an extended bazaar option.  Someone may not have the option of keeping a trader up for long periods of time in the bazaar.  So using a message board might be a better route for them to buy and sell for their characters.<br />
<br />
EBay on the other hand just leaves a bad taste in my mouth in terms of selling/buying items.  Real money is used.  Real money was used to play the game in the first place and that is where it should end.<br />
<br />
Maybe I missunderstood the options, but overall someone (other than the company running the game) making a profit off the game is bad thing.  There, that is what I am trying to say.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
