<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wandered through the boat in the Abysmal Sea hoping to find the spell vendors up. They weren't. <br />
<br />
I had my map window open and found the place where the shaman vendor was supposed to be. Then I chuckled quietly to myself when I read the name of the vendor. &quot;Hatem&quot;. Which I pronounce &quot;Hate-em&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sat for 4 seconds pondering the possiblity of the name being an accident, coincidence, misspelling, or that I mis-read it. Didn't have time to come to a conclusion.<br />
<br />
hehe :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Monjay, I had to delete your sig since it didn't meet the sig requirements here at the Crucible. I copied it from your profile and sent it to you via email since it looks like a lot of work went into it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The spell vendors marked on the map were in the Beta, not in what you're playing now. Purportedly the spells for Discord are all Drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SylentsofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont know about the spell venders for the beta, because all you had to do is /spells and you get your spellbook updated with all the GoD spells<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, that's what I had read/heard from others. Did you see any vendors in Beta in those locations then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya that would explain why I wandered there for half an hour and couldn't find the spell vendors even tho they were clearly listed where I was looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vendors never went live, but in beta I dont recall seeing any of the new spells for sale. Only some PoP spells and lower. Didnt think they'd see the live release because they were selling spells only avail from Eth and Spec parchment turn ins as well.</div></div><hr />
