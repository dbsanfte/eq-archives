<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't get to raid much, but I am looking to upgrade some of my equipts with the money I make from buying/selling things.<br />
<br />
Here is my profile, I'm mainly looking for 'droppable' items (or no_drop items that are easily obtained solo/small group), and I'm a 'raw stat' whore, so anything that raises Mana/HP at the same time without 'loosing' any from what I replace, is a good thing.<br />
<br />
I want to keep my HP's above 2200 (they are now, somehow food doesn't factor in), and improve from there.<br />
<br />
The rings I got the handle on, Going to get Valorium rings once I get the money, replacing what I have adds +29 hps and +80 mana... so that's a no brainer.<br />
<br />
Rest, I might need your help.<br />
<br />
Your sage advice is much appreciated.<br />
