<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have pondered this a LONG time trying to understand how DoTs can be so much more aggro than a DD.<br />
<br />
I have come to the following conclusions:<br />
<br />
DoTs with aggro all have 1 thing in common: counters<br />
Aggro is generated two-fold by DPS and counters<br />
<br />
I believe what is happening is this.<br />
<br />
DoT lands adds counters (aggro)<br />
DoT ticks adds DPS aggro and COUNTERS.<br />
DoT crits adds crit DPS and crit COUNTERS.<br />
<br />
Basically each tick it is applying the full spell effect over rather than JUST the DPS part.<br />
<br />
It is the only possible way I can think of that DoTs are as much aggro as they are. Would also go a long way to explaining why SCS doesnt really affect DoTs because SCS is only working on initial aggro not on each tick so adding say 5-6 ticks of counters without SCS and bingo.<br />
<br />
This would also explain why the epic DoT isnt much aggro... No counters.<br />
<br />
I can not come up with any other way to explain how a 3-5k dd crit would be less aggro than 1 tick of a non-critted dot.<br />
<br />
I believe the way Sony currently has DoTs coded is to reapply the full affect over a period of time rather than just the damage.<br />
<br />
I am unsure id BA4 is increasing counters but it would also make sense.<br />
<br />
So basically a focused Bane would hit 24 initially then a full crit with BA4 would hit for 1008 Damage and 58 curse counters making the aggro from a crit pretty high.<br />
<br />
Well just a theroy I have been working on it makes sense to me but I currently have no way to prove it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting theory.<br />
<br />
I think you are incorrect in the idea that a crit tic adds more counters to the target.  The amount of counters that a DoT has is constant and dependant on the type and level of the DoT used.  Bane will always apply only 24 curse counters to a target regardless of the chances of getting a critical tic.  <br />
<br />
One can test the theory by using a low level cure spell and counting how many casts it takes to cure the particular DoT type.  It will always take 3 casts of Remove Curse (clears 8 counters/cast) to cure Bane regardless of any crit focus the DoT caster may have had.<br />
<br />
I do agree with your assumption that DoT agro is high because of the duality of calculating initial agro plus the counter agro.  While I disagree with your assumption of addition counters being added on crit tics I can see how additional agro would be generated  by a tic doing more damage than were in the normal perameters for the tic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Incorrect.  If it added more counters, a DoT would be harder to cure the longer it went on.  They are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I should have been more clear in my wording I suppose I didnt mean its actually adding the counters but the aggro of that many counters.<br />
<br />
I would still have to stand behind a crit critting the aggro of the counters though due to the fact you cant account for a 1k crit being that much aggro over a 5k nuke any other way.<br />
<br />
If you just do damage+un modded counter aggro it wouldnt be enough aggro to account for what we see.<br />
<br />
Either way it means Sony has some really broken DoT code ;)<br />
The funny thing it it is prolly maybe a 2 hour fix tops and they will not fix it in the next 6 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I looked at this a while ago, BoS was doing roughly about 800 hate on landing. After that the additional hate corresponded roughly to the dps output of the DoT. The initial hate appears to be due to the poison counters, but after that the counters apparently dont play a major role.<br />
<br />
One explanation for the crit thing could be that when the calculation for hate is done after each tick, it treats the crit as if it were the first tick of another dot, ie Counter hate + tick hate. In the case of BoS, it would be as though you were stacking another DoT on top of it, and we all know what happens if you do that without enough of a hate platform under you ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Come up with a logical and reasonable explanation of why a 420 tick DoT has more aggro than a critted nuke then?<br />
<br />
Like I said its just theroy but rule out everything else it can be and whatever is left must be true.... This is what I end up with.<br />
<br />
I can't explain that extra aggro any other way...<br />
Maybe somebody else can but it is certainly not in line with DPS from any other source (Melee, Nukes, Ranged attacks, anything).<br />
<br />
The one common thread I saw was the counters.<br />
<br />
Melee doesnt add counter aggro except on procs and then that proc is massive aggro. DD dont add counters.<br />
<br />
You however can reproduce the same affects I see by chain casting a DoT or chain casting slow.<br />
You cant reproduce it chain casting any of our DD spells so that would pretty much rule out damage as the cause of the aggro.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how our poison nuke chain cast is higher DPS than a single cast of Bane so if you Nihil (to reproduce near the same initial agro) and chain cast the poi nuke you should produce more aggro than no slow and Bane which is simply not true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is assuming that nukes generate hate on a 1:1 basis with damage, which may not be the case. DoT damage seems like 1:1, and I assume melee damage is too, but it is possible that nukes generate less hate per damage point, which would account for those observations. I'll have a look at it when I get a chance this weekend, and see if I can get an estimate of nuke hate generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah a bit hard to gather imperical data since none of this information is really sent to the client and I ddoubt Sony will drop by and tell us how it works... <br />
<br />
Looking forward to what others can come up with as I am at an impasse to explain it past what I have done. Maybe if we can get a grasp on it we can make Sony fix it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If counters were solely responsible for the aggro, BoS would generate 9 times as much aggro as any Tash and that's bull****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well BoS does do DPS and DPS is SOME aggro that is established but we can also establish that DPS can not account for ALL the aggro.<br />
<br />
A simple test for that would be to have a Chanter tash then BoS and see who has aggro assuming both have the same level of SCS.<br />
<br />
If the Shaman has aggro after the initial cast of both then 9 counters would have to be more aggro than 1 counter....<br />
<br />
Not a test I thought of and at work atm so I can not log both my Shaman and Chanter in atm to see.<br />
<br />
By the same token though Malos has almost no aggro and Malosinia has much more. Cripple is also a good bit of aggro without counters.<br />
<br />
If we &quot;know&quot; counters have aggro... Well maybe the theroy of the counters having any aggro at all is completely flawed then and aggro is calculated entirely differently... Which just makes more question no more answers ;)<br />
<br />
Our entire thinking of that 1 poison counter on Tash is what causes the aggro could be flawed then.<br />
<br />
There could be a hidden aggro modifer someplace or something that is accounting for the aggro rather than any number of counters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I firmly believe that there is a set of hard coded agro numbers.  You brought up cripple, which is a prime example; no counters, but nearly the agro of slow.  <br />
<br />
Ive always thought that agro on dots was calculated in the following way:<br />
<br />
DoT is cast.  A set agro is generated from a successful landing of the DoT spell; this agro is simmilar to the agro generated by a direct damage spell.  After successfull landing agro is calculated, a measure of the counter agro is assessed.  We know that poison counters generate much more agro than disease counters (I believe hard coded to be), with curse (magic) counters not far behind (explains cripple/slow agro effects).<br />
<br />
All that in the first tic of the DoT.  Then, the next tic is counted.  The same rules apply as the initial tic, so the landing agro is calculated, and then the cumulative agro from the counter type is added again.  Have you ever had a mob ignore you on the first tic of a dot but glue to you on the second (and subsequent) tics?  I have, and this is the only way that I can make sense of it.<br />
<br />
Third tic: landing agro is assessed AGAIN. Counter agro is assessed AGAIN.  At this point, the agro you generate is moving in an exponential curve, simmilar to the following pattern:<br />
<br />
Successfully landing the DoT-----L+X    where L is the landing agro<br />
Tic 2 of the DoT----------------L+(X*X)<br />
Tic 3 of the DoT----------------L+(X*X)*X<br />
Tic 4 of the DoT----------------L+[(X*X)*X]*X<br />
<br />
You can see where it goes from there.  In effect, you are multiplying the entire agro schedule by itself every time the DoT runs an additional tic.<br />
<br />
So...if this is the case, why do disease DoT's generate so much less agro than poison/curse DoT's?  Well, a few years ago SOE removed most of the agro from disease counters.  There is still a healthy bit of agro generated by disease countes as evidenced by slow agro, though this could be easily explained by postulating that specific agro numbers were added to direct slows, but not to all spells that added disease counters.  <br />
<br />
In this way, disease dots calculate the landing agro every tic, but its simmilar to DD landing agro and generates an exponentially smaller amount of agro than the other DoT types.  (Fire DoT's seem to follow a different set of agro rules.  The level 1 (level 9 ranger) spell Flame lick generates a healthy amount of agro; it generated ehough agro to be used in tier 2 planes by a ranger playing &quot;rabbit&quot;.  Yet subsequent fire dots generate what seems to be much lower agro.  I have been in groups where necros have let 2 Pyre's (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2885&amp;source=Test) run, and yet I grab agro after the second tic (only 640 damage) of BoS) Why?<br />
<br />
This is all pure conjecture of course, because SOE will not release hard data as to what happens agro-wise when a DoT is landed, mainly because they are unsure of what is happening themselves.  Rytan has mentioned in numerous occasions that DoT agro is broken and that he does not know where it is broken...one of the pitfalls of having one person entirely responsible for the spell system.  However, that is a discussion for a different thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think DoT aggro has more to do with how taunt works. <br />
<br />
(if i remember properly) taunt places the taunter at the top of the aggro list on a successful check.<br />
With a DoT in place, the shaman is going to get to the top of taunt, causing the pingpong effect we all know and love.<br />
<br />
If they dropped the amount of aggro DoTs cause, that would lessen the problem, if my assumptions are right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, it doesnt work like taunt. If it did you would be getting agro literally every other tick on most mobs irrespective of the type of dot and when it is cast, and that is clearly not the case.</div></div><hr />
