<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i decided to do extensive parsing with eq companion to see how our spells effect our pets. (we all know the effect they have on pc toons)<br />
<br />
i was bummed with what i found out.<br />
<br />
agility buffs = NO effect on our pets<br />
<br />
staminia buffs = NO effects on our pets<br />
<br />
ac buffs = NO effects on our pets<br />
<br />
ranger attack buffs = NO effects on our pets.<br />
<br />
it seems our pets have a fixed amount on thier sta, agi, ac, and attack skills. i wish i would of known about this a lot earlier.<br />
<br />
save your mana, only buff dogdog with haste/ regen .<br />
<br />
don't flame me if you kinow this already.... people out there don't so i wanted to post findings. the tests were done over a 7 day period with 100 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm kind of surprised that ranger atk buffs don't work well.  i seem to remember (anecdotally, no numbers) that avatar really helped out my pet the few times i did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.... interesting I knew about the sta and agi part but not dex and AC. Thanks.<br />
<br />
However, I still cast str on dog dog. found that it hits max 60 hits far more frequently with str buff. This was reconfirmed by my monk guildmate. Fought same mob without and with str and pet hit for max noticeably more often.<br />
<br />
Anyway it's mana less buff for me wiff me JB sleeves.<br />

i did not test strength on pets , just agi , sta, ac , and ranger attack buff (i partner with a ranger from time to time.)<br />
<br />
i'll test strength and see how that goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure all ranger attack buffs are group buffs and there for can't be cast on pets.</div></div><hr />

Theres a lot of Ranger buffs that ain't group.<br />
<br />
My question is: <br />
<br />
Do HP buffs have an effect on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes, buffs that directly add hp, like FoS, add the hp to pets.</div></div><hr />

Thank god for that. I was worrying for a second there. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I'll have to agree with Shandy here. I'm sure that theres been a noticable difference when my dog is AC buffed, and when it is not. <br />
I'm wondering if it has something to do with what level pet you have. For example, say if your pet had 750 AC by default - you buffed him and it sent his AC over 800. I think you would see noticable change, because 800 is one of those watershed points. Whereas if you AC buffed him and it only sent it to 775, then there wouldn't be a considerable, noticable change.<br />
<br />
Just a though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll let Shandy do all the parsing, she's the master of that, but as far as useless anecdotal evidence goes I've also noticed pet taking less dmg when he's shroud of spirited.  Still, if two independent parsers confirm AC is doing nothing, I'll just /rude VI and start saving myself some buff time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the tests were done on the level 55 pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ranger attack buffs = NO effects on our pets.<br />
<br />
I find this one to be rather questionable, given that Avatar/Primal Avatar have already been shown in quite a few tests to have a substantial effect on a pets damage output. Admitedly, most of the tests I saw were done on Mage and Beastlord pets, but it would be beyond strange for +ATK buffs to work on one type of summoned pet and not on others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Avatar works just fine on shaman pets, at least the 61 pet.<br />
<br />
Without Avatar, he hits normally, range of damage amounts, etc.  With avatar it seems like 50% of his hits are for max.  It makes a big difference, in any event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm i  dunno about all this. I have never parsed it but i analy pay attention to the procs and how much i have to heal puppy. I know stam does nothing and for a while i though agi/ac didnt either , but i notice that his health goes down like he is avoiding hit or mitigating them alot more when he has ac/hp buffs.  As far as putting avatar/attack buffs , that i dont know , but i know there is a big different the damage my puppy does when he is naked then when he has FoS/Daiku/Avatar. Did you use procing weapons in your test?  I would like to see your results here so we can compare them. I think i would like to see what you used to fight against and all the scenrio details too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">include the parses? without those this post really holds no water</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ranger attack buffs are group and therefore can not be used on pets.  That statement made by jathu that ranger attack buffs have no effect on our pet is perfectly accurate.  /snicker    nubi<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar makes a very large, very noticeable difference in the way my pet attacks.  Raising the base attack of an NPC (which pets are considered a type of NPC) raises its &quot;to hit&quot; number which makes it hit and hit for max more often.  <br />
<br />
But as far as buffs for pets go . . . here are the ones I use.<br />
<br />
Focus = hps, possible str add, might not matter tho<br />
<br />
SLTW = haste, undeniably good for pets to have haste<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar = my pet connects much more often and much more often for max dmg when his attack is thru the roof.  <br />
<br />
sometimes Replenishment for regen so I don't have to Q him so much when farming greenies.<br />
<br />
That's all i give my pet.  It's all that's been proven to work.  And it's all I can be bothered to cast on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, parsing would go better if I'd remembered to have my logs ON.<br />
<br />
Also hard to do when one is in a raid -- poor Goner just doesn't gain as much agro when things are mes'd and being MT'd.<br />

I'll revisit it this weekend, will be soloing sometime Sunday, I think.</div></div><hr />

Went looking in lucy and found http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1397&amp;source=Live so rangers could have buffed fido's attack with the right spell altho 25 isn't a large increase. All the other buffs i found where either group and couldn't land on pets or lower version of the same spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know for a fact that Dex buffs work on pets.  I have dex buffed a mage pet with FoS(dex70) and PE (dex20), which stacks with Nights Dark Terror (dex120 with atk45 and a life tap proc)  and I tell you, I had to turn off the spam after a few minutes because it was procing EVERY hit.  No joke.<br />
<br />
I did the same with DC pets with stun whips and Yaks and its sick.  We had a fungus beast in FG procing 4 different procs. (stun,Yak effect, life tap, and snare)  it was fun to watch but again, you end up turning off other spells because the spam is so intense.<br />
<br />
I had my dog procing like crazy as well with a stun whip.  Same dex buffs as others.  When NDT (12min duration) wears off, its obvious.  Although procing is still nice with PE and FoS, there is a noticable difference without NDT.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone is suggesting you made this up, it simply is very useful for folks to run their own parses.  Plus some folks that are picky about error bounds (like myself) might be interested in std. deviation, etc..</div></div><hr />

Jathu read Drinner's intent the same way I did.  I found that statement a little offensive also.  It is not like Jathu is calaiming some new solo acomplishment and providing logs to back up his claim.  If Drinner wanted the data to analyze he could have asked for it instead of using the &quot;this post really holds no water&quot; phrase.<br />
<br />
Jathu,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your efforts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well I hate to say it but in a way he's right.  Without the logs to back your claims you really do not have a claim at all.<br />
<br />
It's best to be thorough and correct, than be ignorant and 'think' you're correct.  A lot of myths surround the effects of stat buffs and I would hope that in the spirit of this thread we could abolish some of them.  The only real way to do that is to provide evidence in the form of logs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, I blew a morning of good shamaning and ran Goner (our lev 61 pet) through his paces.<br />
<br />
3 hours in PoI, 3 hours in Chardok, and I'm tired.<br />
<br />
First 90 mins in PoI Goner had Focus, celerity, replenishment and a pair of velium weaps.  I fought my way to one of the little rooms and stayed there fighting a mix of critters, all dblu at 61.  After 90 mins, I gated out, and did the exact same thing but added Shroud of the Spirits.  Goner actually took more average damage during the 2nd 90 minutes, fighting the same mix of critters.  Max hits were compared by critter type and were identical.  Average damage was 2% higher.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, Chardok was a different story.<br />
<br />
Parked myself in a nice undisclosed location, summoned Goner, and did the same thing.  90 mins without AC, next 90 mins with.  This time he took roughly 4% less damage the second go around.  Max hit by critter type was again identical.<br />
<br />
What does this mean?  It's all within the realm of &quot;normal effect of 29 AC,&quot; and within &quot;This AC buff has no effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, it was inconclusive here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't mages get a Phantom armour line? Could you get a mage to summon up some armour and Toss on mutt? I know mutt will equip certain things. Like belts and stuff. <br />
<br />
It could be a nice use for the crap drops in some of the lower level zones. If it had an effect.<br />
<br />
I am mostly curious because I am going to blow a few more points On the Pet in my Pocket AA. (The second rank) The first rank is moderatly useful But mutt doesnt keep his weapons and buffs. Second rank would mean alot more use for storing if all this just does effect his ability to tank.<br />
<br />
Coolest thing this week. I hit the Pet in the pocket aa and he says &quot;By your command.&quot;<br />

And When I bring him back he sends me a tell.... &quot;I live again&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm sorry, but there's a big difference between +25 attack from ranger buff, and +150 attack from shaman buff. <br />
+25 attack could easily get lost in sampling error.  It's not that I disbelieve Jathu, I just find his conclusion on attack to be worthless.<br />
<br />
Attack helps immensely.  I have used FA on lvl 35 critters a low level druid was charming for use as a pet.  I pulled some lvl 40ish rock dudes for her and her pet was hardly denting them.  I added FA and the pet started hitting like normal.  Conclusion?  Attack helps pets connect more often.  <br />
<br />
I really don't think that had to be proven tho.  Anyone with a decent knowledge of the game would understand this without explanation. <br />
<br />
Stamina, agility are worthless on pets.  Str has very limited value . . . and dex also has very limited value.  But with Focus and FA on puppy, i'm including 222 str and 210ish dex to his totals.  If those stats make any difference, in those amounts they will.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I have ever felt uncertain about with pet buffs is Dex.  And heres why.  I was in a group in DL with a Mage.  He asked for a dex buff for his pet I gave. Tw o secs later shammy buff my pet with Dex.  I did. . . He doesn't believe me. . I say okay and do it again. . . 2 secs later . . Shammy dex buff my pet. . umm i did twice he has it. . no he doesn't. . How do you know?. . . He says he did a /health  er something and his dex is the same. . .I'm like ??? err you can do that? And than maybe my dex doesn't help your pet. . all in all I eneded up dex buffin this silly pet at least 5 times . . when finnaly the MAge decided i was an a$$ not buffing his pet. . . .So it made me wonder if it has any effect at all. . sicne he obviously couldn't tell  a diff with his pet for whatever reason. I was lvl 48 I think at the time.  I typically HoS the pet and regen and sow him, I find he keeps up and listens better with a sow (odd) regen I find helps me not have to heal him ever, and HoS sure does make him tuff.<br />

So 2 cents from a still kinda new shammy :)</div></div><hr />

The only thing I have ever felt uncertain about with pet buffs is Dex.  And heres why.  I was in a group in DL with a Mage.  He asked for a dex buff for his pet I gave. Tw o secs later shammy buff my pet with Dex.  I did. . . He doesn't believe me. . I say okay and do it again. . . 2 secs later . . Shammy dex buff my pet. . umm i did twice he has it. . no he doesn't. . How do you know?. . . He says he did a /health  er something and his dex is the same. . .I'm like ??? err you can do that?

Where you using hos or an actual dex buff?<br />
I've never seen the buff not land on the pet just might not do anything when it's there.<br />
The command he was using is /pet report health which lists all buffs by name on the pet. He probably just didn't know that hos had dex in it and was looking for something more obviously named.</div></div><hr />

I believe I prob used Dexterity on his pet in an effort to conserve mana.(that would mean i was prob lvl 49 not 48 )  HoS is such a long cast and soo exspensive mana wise I avoid using on pets unless i'm in a duo group (IE Shammy Necro).  but thanks for the info :) Good to know that command</div></div><hr />

That phantom armor helps ALOT.  If I can snag a bag of it before solo'ing I do.<br />
<br />
Greatly suggest someone do some parsing on it, I'm lazy and taking a break, actually un-installed eq to make sure I take said break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haste mask=notta<br />
celerity=good<br />
spirit quickening=good<br />
celerity+spirit quickening=better<br />
<br />
I'm figuring its just the attack bonus and other stats it adds which helped it connect more often, then again, npc's are goofy.</div></div><hr />
