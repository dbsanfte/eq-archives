<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for some good places to go for my cleric with me boting my ranger for heals, ds, buffs. I tried kaesora but got whiped real quick. Anyplace with a good ZEM (zone experience modifier) or just good exp in general. Tried Echo but the needlites spawn way to slow and everything else isnt really worth it exp wise. Was thinking maybe Splitpaw. Also if you have any good places for higher levels like up to level 40 when I can just group her with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A friend and I have been PLing his shaman recently for use in PoP.  We went for outdoor areas out of convenience more than anything.  25-30 we did tizmaks in GD and cougars in IC, then moved to Dawnshroud until 35 and killed zelniaks and lightcrawlers.  35-40 were spent in Scarlet Desert killing cheetahs, sunflowers and lightcrawlers.   <br />
<br />
Avoid casters as much as possible.   They are mana-suckers particularly when PLing, since the mobs tend to be much higher in level than the character you're PLing, and spells are rarely resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I brought my Cleric up to 36 I think in Sol A.  I would run around and grab 4 or 5 Goblins with the ranger bring them back to the cleric and let them beat on me until the DS wore them down.  Then the cleric would hit them with a couple AE nukes and clean up the mess.   You need to keep track of the goblins you are pulling to make sure they are dark blue to cleric.  Also, I would kill any casters before pulling back to the cleric.  You can kill Gnomes in Sol A past 36 but they seemed to be camped alot. <br />
<br />
Once she hit 36 she gained exp while grouped with my 55 Ranger.  We headed to CC and she watched as I tore up Geos and Spiders.  We could have headed here earlier than 36 and killed Orcs using same methods for Goblins in Sol A.  <br />
<br />
Once she got CH we headed to entrance of KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spidaaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im not quite sure on the nuke power of a cleric of that level, but if you were too run around in paw and bring 4 or 5 gnolls, wear em down on your damage shield and let the ole cleric finish, try and keep the cleric skills up now as there a pain to get up later....<br />
<br />
Those gnolls can hit real hard, maybe 1 or 2 at a time would be more sensible ) hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually Echo is still the best until about 29 or so. Do the needlites and in the downtime run into the swamp next to needlites and kill the mutants there. You will get better exp doing that than anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Annalyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to Crystal Caverns, pull orcs to the zone in, snare, melee until they are fleeing, zone out and let the cleric polish them off. It's corny but effective. At 25 you will make probably 3% per miner and 4 or 5 for each watchman or oracle. XP is decent into the early 30's</div></div><hr />
