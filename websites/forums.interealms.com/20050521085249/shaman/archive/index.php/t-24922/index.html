<br />
I know Ture has been changed once since OOW came out. Last night while killing him with Triality, a dev appeared in the zone (hidden mode though) to watch the fight. <br />
<br />
As a shm, this makes me nervous, in the last 5 expansions I've only found 3 raids mobs that lived long enough to justify disease dots or could be debuffed to the point that disease dots would land.<br />
<br />
Would really hate to see us get tweaked out of this encounter. So far its the most fun a shm can have on a raid mob in oow.</div></div><hr />

And they owned in Vex Thal, or hell, any Ssra encounter.<br />
<br />
When we do time Terris and Saryrn I usually get Wunshi, Ultor, and my pox click in, then demem the disease ones for Sisslak an Bane, and when I'm not casting those, I use Yoppa's Rain/Spear. Can put out some decent DPS that way, and the disease DoTs keep going along, contributing about 20-30% of my DPS. It isn't much, but it's something.</div></div><hr />

vex thal/ssra are 6 expansions back<br />

We used to ae the phase 5 stuff (shm ae power rawr) and to cc inny (which was a blast). Yet, terris &amp; saryrn were always more cc debuffs &amp; spot healing the off tanks while keeping fa up instead of having anytime to dps. Would have been fun to do a little dotting just didnt have time to do much of it in Time. <br />
<br />
Coirnav was last EP god our shms got to let go, once he became active our shms &amp; necro would stick every dot they could load on him. Idea was to protect the wizzys. Was sorta funny how many times a shm ended up tanking him and surving.</div></div><hr />

Our OTs can almost solo them.</div></div><hr />

Ture is &quot;working&quot; as is.  Before the last patch on him, which was preceeded by another patch to make him harder, he was casting Wanton Destruction every 6 seconds.  A 4000 DD every 6 seconds sure makes a mob hard.  Mysteriously after the last patch, he was casting every 60 seconds (hearsay from our official raid AE timer). 6. 60. 6. 60. (or 1. 10. 1. 10 if the duration is entered by ticks). Looks like someone forgot to add a zero the first time.<br />
<br />
Ture is a long and boring fight.  30-40 minutes of a CH chain and curing Wanton Destruction.  I specifically remembered SoE saying they wanted to move away from CH chain encounters, yet mostly every raid in Anguish and all the ones needed to get to it require CH chains.  I guess they let the Inktu'ta designer make the Trial of Foresight and the Trial of Subversion before they fired him (or he was lured away by Blizzard for being a diamond in the rough).<br />
<br />
Keldovan needs one less AE as well.  Right now he's a brutal fight and forgives no errors at all.</div></div><hr />

30-40 mins ouch. He dies for us before second disease dot spread is done. Nadox/RGC/RC3+ all sorta own his ae's too.<br />

Keldovan's got some mean stuff that's for certain. Played with Warden Hanvar yet?</div></div><hr />

It sounds like they changed Ture again.  A round of disease dots lasts maybe 3-4 minutes.  If he's dying in 4 minutes, they've done something to him; like change the range on his rampage or its frequency.  That would lead to the biggest reduction in kill time.  The couple times we've killed him have taken 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
We've gotten Keldovan to under 20% twice, and I don't think he's been killed since the new changes (the lack of new loot links on Lucy tends to indicate that).  Dropping one of his adds or removing the ghetto ferubi AE would make him doable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We got the new revision on 11/12, but I slacked on doing SS's on the loot. Drops were Sorrowmourn Stone (melee range ice nuke foci without shms on it), Stud of Chilling Precision (fire caster earring), Infernal Staff of Fiery Fate (priest primary that has no melee nor any foci and a crappy graphic). <br />
<br />
The drops I've seen in oow so far really arent shm friendly. None of the arms have healing foci, they've put so much attack and avoidance on chain items it means every rogue and ranger will get one before any shm, alot of the foci's that do exist are so out of whack or weak that you will prefer your pop/god foci instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman drops in Omens are few and far inbetween. Could be true for a couple other classes but hey!<br />
If an item is nice looking stat wise, chances are very high there is no focus nor effects on it.<br />

<br />
Poison nuke focus on some stuff would be nice &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
