<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best tactics for pvp against pallys with high mr, fr,and pr?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get your MR up as high as you possibly can, or else you are going to spend the fight stunned and blinded.<br />
<br />
You said that the pally has high MR, FR, and PR.  You left off DR, so try landing disease slow on him.  Paladins have the ability to cure disease, but I don't think any paladin in the history of everquest has remembered this and actually cured a slow during a duel.<br />
<br />
If you can get disease slow to land, you can probably get disease dots on as well.  Do that.  Have a pet and a DS potion up, and just stand there and heal yourself.  Hopefully he will burn all his mana trying to stun and blind you unsuccessfully and not have enough left over to heal himself.  Also dispell all his buffs (he gets a self-only haste spell and decent HP buffs), and watch for him to use his heal over time on himself and try to dispell it.<br />
<br />
Paladins with great gear and a lot of AA are probably one of the hardest classes to kill.  At high end, they use almost exclusively 2hander weapons, which means a DS potion isn't going to do much to them.  With EP gear, they usually have enough worn regen to almost completely negate the DS damage they are taking.  On top of that, if they geared themselves to have a lot of FT (some knights do, some don't), they will have enough mana regen to heal themselves almost indefinately.  On top of that, a lot of their weapons proc a heal or rune effect, which causes problems for obvious reasons.  The biggest problem I have ever had with knights, though, is the freaking twohanded bash AA.  I have serious difficulties channel even a 3 second quiescence through a bashing paladin.<br />
<br />
Basically, paladins are not as dangerous as shadowknights, since pallys don't get any uber low-resist nukes dots or snares.  With 210 unbuffed MR, I have never had a paladin land a spell on me.  However, although a paladin cannot kill you quickly, they can last for a very very long time in a duel and eventually wear you down.  Remember: if you go oom, you're screwed, but if a paladin goes oom, he can still melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get massive magic resist, and then kite him :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep kiting him and hope he gets impatient and blows mana on stuns/blinds.   Dispell him completely, they can buff themselves pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in a staged duel with a raiding shaman vs. a raiding paladin (both in good gear), get a pet and keep it alive.  Strip off all his buffs, make that a priority.  Then just rabid bear and melee his ass with your Dark Mace of Thought.  Keep yourself healed with Quiescence and the occasional Tnargs.  Keep him dispelled.  Melee like a mofo.  The mace will drain his mana (into your own mana pool haha) and without mana he's just a poor excuse for a warrior.  <br />
<br />
That is how I would beat a well-equipped paladin anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the best way to beat any class in PVP, bring a partner, we don't have the DPS for one on one to be worth our time</div></div><hr />

Funny you should suggest that Landragon - A friend of mine (65 Paladin, 250+AA, approx 200 unbuffed resists all slots) dueled a time enabled Shaman friend just the other day, and that is pretty much exactly what he did - drained his mana with the mace while meleeing him in rabid bear, and dispelled him like mad.  Took about 15 minutes for the fight, but the paladin lost in the end.  Shame that I wasn't online - I'd have paid to see it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gear and skill make all the difference. There isn't a shaman on any server that could kill one of our guilds top 5 paladins 1 on 1. Just wouldn't happen. They are monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Going to have to agree with Shiner. Once a paladin reaches high enough mr to resist root and blind after malo+tashstick and has high enough ac+regen to make our doggie cry there is no chance of a shaman beating him.  The tactic of kiting a paladin only works if doggie actually does any damage.<br />
<br />
Two instaclicks, nullify magic, one heal over time and crusaders touch is all a paladin needs to wear us down and make us run. Granted, he cant really stop us from fleeing. But running is still a loss in my book.<br />
<br />
Meleeing a paladin, be it jousting or 'in teh face' with ToT mace, should always result in the shaman loosing more mana having to heal than he can drain from the paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, unless you have some mana drain procing wep with fast dly (Dark Mace), you arent gonna kill a paladin thats even in OK gear.  If he has 150 MR and 100+ in rest of resists, your screwed.  That is, if he knows what he is doing...if he is a dumbass and chains blind \ root \ stun, then ya might be able to take him.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just looked at your level so I am assuming the paladin DOESNT have insane resists, so, ya just dogdog kite him or something hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another trick to effectively drain casting classes, use cheap very low level spells to spoof big dots, most people don't notice the difference between blood of saryrn and envenomed breathe, they just cure the second they see that icon.  Once they stop curing the small stuff, try something big, if they do cure it, oh well they caught on, if they don't, its killing time.</div></div><hr />
