<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its Funny... www.everquest.com says the servers are up now, and its only been like 3 hours.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">same here, - i get the same error<br />
<br />
also, yesterday around lunch eq was working fine for me, but i tried to get on after class at 3 and i kept getting the connectivity problem or rerun patch....<br />
<br />
so i reran patch many times and still couldn't get in, i tried later at like 9 and i was able to finally get in, but it took like 4 min for me to send a tell to someone and even before i logged in, it took like 45 sec for the servers to come up on my screen in server selection after i logged in......<br />
<br />
anythoughts on either? i'm hoping the first prob is just a stupid patch problem that will be fixed, and i'm hoping the second is just stupid server problems (but dunno cause nobody else was getting 80 to 100 percent packet loss constant as well as the 4 min tells....)<br />
