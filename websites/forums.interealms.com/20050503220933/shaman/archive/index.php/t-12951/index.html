<br />
OK.. up til recently my guild has been doing HoT platform mostly..<br />
lately i have started leading some raids and we are crawling HoT np, adds are easy to deal with. <br />
last night Telk in wtov was up..we were all ally or close to cov..so i asked the raid if we wanted to try.<br />
killed telk, had only 4 or 5 deaths out of 32.<br />
<br />
now my question is..a lot are tired from HoT (myself included, i need nothing from there except for the leggings)<br />
i would like to know some other zones we are ready for.<br />
our fairly active MA has a BOC<br />
i am the only raid active 60+ shaman , though we may have a 61 shaman, however i believe he is a late night early morning player.<br />
<br />
are we ready for Vindi? ie, is Telk harder or easier. We had a 6 second CH chain when defensive was down for telk, 8 when defensive was up.<br />
had 4 clerics, and usually have lots of druids (58+)<br />
how long do guilds usually do vindi before switching to WTOV?<br />
is WTOV worth it except for telk and gozz?<br />
can we do rhag 1?<br />
rhag 2?<br />
our average raid level was 59, with 32, for telk.<br />
can we do statue?<br />
<br />
i'm not asking because i'm not afraid to try..i know a lot want to try these and i want to as well.<br />
but i would just like some advice, and maybe other possible targets.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok, the thing in WToV you want is LtK for the ST keys.   With 32 people and clerics who know how to do a decent CH chain you should have no problem with Vindi either, if you have a good MT that can hold aggro Vindi is easy.  Vindi gives a pretty decent faction hit, so  in case you want to switch to do WToV and go on giant faction you might want to skip that one, the Tormax hit is hard to make up.<br />
Other nice targets at that stage would be Rhag 1 and 2 in Ssra, IV/Va'dynn in AR, and the named in UP (RC, doom and the camel).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rhag1/2 are wimps, you can take them easy I'd say.  Lendi is well worth it for the st key, a few other items are decent.  Dozekar quests are doable too.  Only way to know with vindi is to try it, he's an 8 hour spawn, so you probably won't be fighting a ton of competition to get a shot in.  SoRZ and RC (in UP) are both slowable, so probably even easier than vindi, assuming you get them slowed asap.</div></div><hr />
