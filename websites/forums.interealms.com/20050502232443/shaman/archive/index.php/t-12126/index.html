<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cythilix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
I used to play a shaman on FV and some 9 months ago deleted him as I was quitting EQ for good (or so I thought) Gave all my stuff away, and destroyed my planar armor. Moved back to Europe. <br />
<br />
Fastforward to last February. I find my EQ CDs and with shaking hands install it. Couldnt resist the temptation. So created a necro, fooled around some and finally last night decided to petition to have my shaman restored. The Guide I talked to was very positive and said the head GM would probably restore my 51 shaman.<br />
<br />
So, if this works out, I´ll soon have a naked 51 shaman. How do I equip him? Any place ideal to farm pp so that I can start saving for new gear? It´s a daunting task and Id appreciate ayy suggestions / words of wisdom.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Cythilix Yz´ulqun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well at 51 you can hit Rathe mountians and farm HGs for a few days to make the plat to hit the bazaar and re-equip. You'll be surprised that alot of the items that were unatainable just a mear 6 months ago are very reasonable if not down right cheap.<br />
<br />
Look at combination cheap /mana-Wis-Hp gear to start out. <br />
<br />
The Bazaar search function is your very best friend.</div></div><hr />

Sounds good, I´ll give it a try (thought the giants in Rahe were nerfed though?)<br />
<br />
Many thanks for the reply :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Giants havent been nerfed. I recommend 2 items to buy straight away : Leaf Scale Gloves and Metal Linked crown. These cost 50pp each cos they are so common, but the items themselves are quite amazing for their price. <br />
p.s. What server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A friend of mine did something very similar (except for moving to Europe part). He deleted his epic wielding lvl 55 shaman, and decided to bring him back. He got him back from an old EQ tape. He had all of his No Drop loot, and even his epic (which he deleted) but was put back at lvl 45 as a sort of penalty. He also had a monk alt of his restored, and the GM was nice enough to give him some no drop armor that was far better than anything a lvl 40ish monk would start out with. He didn't complain at all to that, and was quite content, as was I, since I didn't have to PL his new shaman any more!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Plate metal torque is a cheap upgrade also. (I think thats the name, look at the neck slot in my magelo)<br />
<br />
Plus he is on FV, I have a mule on that server that I check out the bazaar with (8th shawl for 100k WOOT!) But anyway, because there is stuff like SS armor for sale the usuall shaman stuff goes quite cheap. Saw quite a few pieces of thurg armor going for around 500p!!! (I paid 6 times that just for the gems on my boots LOL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cythilix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hrm getting all the No_Drop stuff back sure sounds nice...except there is no No_Drop on FV :( Maybe the powers that be will take that into consideration... thanks all for the input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rofl , the giants nerfed . Man that brigns back memories, anytime the giants dont drop 24+ plat 3 tiems in a row the whole zone agrees its been nerfed. I dont miss that place :p<br />
<br />
But its a good suggestion , or you can do HHK guards for fine steel or get a seb group , seb has some nice equipment for your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OOps I missed the fact you were on FV.... Im not sure if that modifies your ability to safely be in Rathe Mountains... Im pretty dumb about the non carebear servers. Please take that into consideration before going there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol<br />
<br />
FV is a carebear.  They just have that retarded trivial loot crap.  Seems like it'd be very hard to *farm* pp.  Or items for trade skills.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dear Gwain, the TLC only affects good items, mobs still drop coin loot and crappy everyday cash drops (i.e. tradeskill items)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah people on FV have figured out an easy way to get around TLC, just a bug, might be fixed.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is go into a PoP raid mode with someone, dosent matter the level, poof TLC disapears.</div></div><hr />
