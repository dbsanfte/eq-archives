<br />
Well, you can raise melee skills dueling blue+ pets, but I am not sure it's worth spending any significant amount of time on. Your melee damage output is not that great at level 45 anyway and your skills will eventually catch up when you tank slowed mobs for your pet/DOTs.<br />
<br />
Also, STR is supposed to be a secondary stat for offensive skill increases, so it doesn't hurt to buff it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's easy enough to get the weapon skills maxed -- just takes some dedication.  I've found it easiest to duo with a tank of some sort and after slowing mob, just step in and melee right next to the tank.  I almost never get agro once the tank takes it and the melee skills move up.  I actually maxed piercing while soloing with dogdog.  I'd tank alongside him and step back when I needed to heal up or meditate.  Haste and a fast weapon make a lot of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As the poster before said, haste and a fast weapon. If all your trying to do is max the skill, find a fast weapon, haste yourself and tank for dogdog. I maxed my piercing long ago, tanking for dogdog and have 1hb pretty decent and 2hb 120ish, alot of people will say your dps is irrelevant, but i like crankin out an additional 300 easy, if not more on some mobs, with my REIF. I always tank, if i dont need the med time on horsey while canning, or unless im being lazy just grinding out slow safe xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make yourself some Greater Null Potions, for an extra 25 dex! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've found weapons that proc life taps are great incentives to melee :P. I've been playing around with a Black Acrylia Spear and my piercing has gone up 20 points. Can't wait to get my hands on a Soulstripper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know how you feel.  My combat skills were doing okay all the way up to level 38 when I started grouping.  Then I became almost a pure caster till about level 50.  As a shaman you have several options, at least for weapon skills.  As someone mentioned, group with friends who don’t mind you stepping into melee.  Slow and dot the mob and then step up behind it and swing away.  If you solo some, tanking with your spirit puppy biting at the rear, your weapon skills will increase along with your defense / offence skills.  Another option, which I’ve done with my ranger who has far too many weapons skills to keep maxed, is to fight outside a group.  Find a group fighting blues or better and ask if you can beat on their mobs.  Shaman do so little damage that they will get all the xp and loot so they shouldn’t mind.  You can also offer to buff them in exchange. You won’t get any xp this way, but your weapon skills will go up without much risk to your health.  <br />
<br />
Again as others have said, if all you’re after is skill gain then get the fastest weapon possible.  For example, if you want to work on your 2H blunt skill get an abandoned orc shovel (Delay: 27, Damage: 4).  It’s about the fastest 2H blunt in the game and its completely free.  Just don’t expect to do any significant damage with it.  You can pick this shovel up off the ground in an orc camp in Lake Rathetear.  If you zone in from South Karana turn left like your heading to Rathe Mountains.  The orc camp you want is between these two zone lines.  It either the second or third patch of land you come to.  At your level the ors will just stare evilly at you and let you walk away with the shovel they left lying on the ground.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

Fast hitting low damage lightblue - blue mobs work best if you are using a damage shield to help with that.</div></div><hr />

This is a total revolation to me.  It almost seems to good to be true.  Time to start duo'ing with a druid.</div></div><hr />

I have a Druid and yes, you can get Offense increases from a DS even when auto-attack is off. I don't believe I have ever seen a weapon skill increase from a DS when auto-attack was off, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree.   I've PL'd a mage with my 55 druid  for a bit and his offense is maxxed for his level.    Weapons skills doesn't seem affected.  (It's still pretty high since you need to do one point of damage in order to get exp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a Druid and yes, you can get Offense increases from a DS even when auto-attack is off.

So by turning on auto-attack is the system confused to giving you weapon skill increases when the mob hits your damage shield, or was there a mistake before?  Doesn't hurt to try this out reguardless, just wondering.<br />
<br />
Another approach, and potentially less of a hassle, would be to duel a high level pet class, and gain skill ups on their pet. The only thing you have to make sure of is that he has the aa &quot;Pet Hold&quot; command. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried this yet, but maybe you could hang out in the bazaar, and try to find a trader that's going afk for the night.  Ask them if they would start a duel with you in the Arena, and have them leave their pet behind.  I haven't tried this, but I would imagine that the pet would stick around and fight you, even though the owner is clear off on the other side of the zone selling stuff...  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Maximise your dexterity<br />
*Maximise your haste (use spell haste and item haste)<br />
*Minimise your weapon delay (i.e. dont worry about weapon damage or even ratio, just go for fastest weapon you can)<br />
*Hit things that give experience (you cant get weapon skill raises off green /con mobs), preferabaly dark blue /con or better<br />
*Try to find mobs that hit fast but not hard<br />
Take off cissy wisdom gear and put on AC / hp gear and use all your AC buffs like rage and shifting shield etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you can get weapon skill (1HB, 2HB, etc) increases from a DS. I have only seen Offense go up from DS's, but I wouldn't swear to it.<br />
<br />
Getting weapon skill increases is trivial with a Druid. Take an outdoors mob down to &lt;20% with spells, re-Ensnare and keep hitting it in the back until it dies. Boring, but easy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually you would want the lowest possible level mob that you can still get exp from.  Since you can only gain skill from actually connecting you want to maximize the number of times you hit.  The higher level the mob the more you miss, the fewer the increases.  Thus Light Blue cons would be the optimal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually this is not true anymore, I got a dmg shield on my monk the other day and just rounded up gnolls in bb, I didnt even attack 1/10th of the mobs and got exp off of all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Getting weapon skill increases is trivial with a Druid. Take an outdoors mob down to &lt;20% with spells, re-Ensnare and keep hitting it in the back until it dies. Boring, but easy :)<br />
<br />
That's one way to max hand-to-hand, even without snare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the theory is that higher level mobs have a better chance of giving you a skill increase when you do connect - or giving you a Defense increase when they miss. However, based on my Monk's experiece, I am not so sure about that theory.<br />
<br />
When the lizard turned 51, I took a break from leveling, did Run2, attended public raids in PoSky, Fear, Hate, Chardok, the Hole and so on. Hung out with the guild in Velks, Kael and PoD. Farmed (mostly light blue) Geonids and Terrors for cash in CC. Much of the time I was the puller and occasional tank on low blues, so I got hit quite a bit. I didn't get my final point of Defense in 51 until I was 1.5 yellow from 52.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to 52. I got my first point of Defense quickly and was prepared to wait for the other two to take forever. A few days later I was soloing Terrors in CC (still 50% light blue) and one of them gave me 2 (!!) point of Defense and 1 point of Riposte.<br />
<br />
So I figured it was totally unpredictable and stopped worrying about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually you would want the lowest possible level mob that you can still get exp from.

<br />
<br />
It was always my understanding that the higher level the mob, the higher the chance. Also, I may not be remembering this correctly, but I have received skill ups from misses, so it doesn't matter if you connect or not. That being said, haste is key, along with a quick weapon, and since you don't have to connect, the only reason to try to skill up on light blues, is because they won't hit for as much damage. To maximize increases, go with at least dark blue, or like I said in an earlier post, jump in on red's when in groups/raids. This has worked great for me, as I remember it taking forever to get increases when I was fighting light blues, but when I switched to dark blues, whites, they flowed.<br />
<br />
When I lagged behind my skills, I used a bronze main gauche, has a super low delay, and does crap damage, so you can sit there whacking away at a mob forever until you kill it. If your only trying for offense and weapon skills, slow the mob so you aren't taking a lot of damage. If you are looking to get defense, unslowed will get you ups faster (be careful, as much as a badass the shammy is, unslowed dark blues (forget about whites) can be asking for trouble :) )</div></div><hr />
