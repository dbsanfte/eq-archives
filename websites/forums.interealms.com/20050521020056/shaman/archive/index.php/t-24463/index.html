<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Epic1.0 has slot for type 4 augmenting.<br />
Given shaman's role where one might be expected to do some &quot;tanking&quot;, but that tanking is never really for melee DPS, is it worth considering a &quot;Guard III&quot; Augment as opposed to any of the other available type 4 augments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not for my playstyle; I don't swing/poke enough to proc anything. My 1.0 has a 10 Sta aug on it from way back, but I ony swap it in to click when soloing, or trying to get agro from the MA for fun. <br />
<br />
I pulled the Costruct of Nightmares off of him for about 1/3 of the Hedge fight today, with malos, slow, cripple and 6 dots running, hehe. Gotta have fun in this game, no?<br />
<br />
Well, I just checked my logs. I never actually had all six cooking on the same tic, I guess I'll have to try harder next time. I did have healing duties as well, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I undedrstand where you are coming from Samanna. If I have aggro it sure as hell isn't from melee! I currently have a stam aug im Epic as well, but since type 4 does allow certain non standard type augments that would not otherwise be available, I had to at least ask the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70019 would be a good choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the Tipt augments are any type any slot those would be a good choice also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70019 would be a good choice<br />

Yup, I got one of these at the &quot;alt&quot; location for the perfect skins for epic.  That location is never camped unlike the one right by zonein in DS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got one of those augs too...never thought to put it on my epic though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm going for HPs above all on the epic 1.5. A 20/20/20 Aug from Takish and I'm looking for all slot HP augs as well. I do melee, but it's only when I'm soloing. I am otherwise too busy to melee.<br />
<br />
For epic 1.0 I just added a resist aug, since it's resist gear for me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i melee mobs a good bit, so i went ahead and put a damage proc on 1.5, got a cheap 75dd on it now gona put a 75 lifetap proc on it though.  Dosn't make too much of a difference but still does something, plus fun to beat things. If you have a time lapse weapon (Hammer of Hours, Petrified Splinterstaff) i would without a doubt put a DD aug on one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tsk, put in some nukes ;) For you melee shammies out there. Got 2 of em in my epic 1.5</div></div><hr />
