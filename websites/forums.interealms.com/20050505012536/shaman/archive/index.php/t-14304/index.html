<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought all 3 levels of combat agility today.  The description of Combat Agility reads:  This ability increases your melee damage avoidance by 2, 5, and 10%.<br />
<br />
While I was training Combat Agility I decided to parse vs the same warrior class stormrider in BOT for a comparison vs POP mobs.  I had to slow these mobs, then I tanked them doing nothing but healing myself and sitting on my horse for 15 mins, at which time I was nearly out of mana(had no KEI, did not canni in order to make parsing easier).  <br />
<br />
My AC for all stormrider fights was 1157, which is focus, sta, virtue.  I tanked the mob for 15 mins on my timer, then rooted it, zoned to tranquility, trained my AA, then zoned back in and re-engaged the same mob.<br />
<br />
The sample sizes are much smaller than I would have liked.  I imagined that these mobs would be hitting me more than ~200 times in the space of 15 minutes, but this will have to do.  <br />

So to recap, smaller number = better.<br />
<br />
No CA/LR = 66%<br />
CA 1 = 76%<br />
CA 2 = 70%<br />
CA 3 = 70%<br />
LR 1 = 62%<br />
LR 2 = 69%<br />
LR 3 = 67%<br />
LR 4 = 66%<br />
LR 5 = 65%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sample size is much too small to draw any real conclusions, especially for increases of only 2-10% in avoidance.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before I bought any levels of combat agility, I also had a mage friends pet beat on me for about a half an hour.  The pet is the level 57 earth pet, light blue at 65 (dark blue at 63).  During these 2 trials I had 1090 AC, I was buffless.<br />

<br />
Nice analysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL Nice post Henora.<br />
<br />
I love it when SOE is publicly embarrased by it's own players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice work Henora :)<br />
<br />
I guess ill scratch off CA from my list of AA's to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's all true.  The first three levels of CA don't help much vs. PoP mobs.  You will notice a difference on non PoP stuff however.  Or at least I did.  You'll need to train LR5 before you'll see a big difference in the way PoP mobs connect with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're missing the point of combat agility.  It isn't there to reduce the amount of damage you take.  It is to give you streaks of misses that save your life.  At CA3 you'll see this happen occasionally, but it starts to happen A LOT more at around LR3, which is where I am at now.  When I am pulling mobs in pov or bot, I pull with malo, run to my group, and then slow as it is incoming.  I usually get smacked w/ one round of combat before the tank gets it off of me.  Used to, I would get hit by golems and spiders for triple 544 almost every time.  Now, though, its usually a miss or two and a low hit, like 120 or 240 or so.  I am still getting tripled for full damage sometimes, but it is not happening anywhere near as much as it used to.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you think the CA line is a placebo effect, you are mistaken.  It is a very good skill - just ask any tank that has LR5 and they will tell you how great it is.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that HAS lr5, and is disappointed with it?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Thank you Henora for taking the time to log, parse, and share this data, as well as spending 27AA on a sort of &quot;research&quot; endevour.  It's stuff like this that I like to see, even though I think it is inconclusive, for the reasons that you listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sample size is way too small, as noted by Henora.  In addition, I'd say the biggest use for CA is that it opens up LR.  I didn't notice any difference with CA3 in PoP myself.  With LR5 though, the story is quite different.<br />
<br />
Would I spend points on CA/LR or CS/ID if I didn't have SCM, Canni5, MGB, SCRM?  Nope, and I didn't.  I don't think it's as much of an enhancement to the SHM class as those, but I do think it's a very worthwhile AA series to go after in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're missing the point of combat agility.  It isn't there to reduce the amount of damage you take.  It is to give you streaks of misses that save your life.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're missing the point. Henora posted both damage and accuracy, but it was the accuracy that she bolded and discussed.<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed that so many AA points produced no noticeable improvement in our avoidance against the mobs we are usually fighting. Sure, we can always do more testing against other mobs to corroborate what Henora saw, but I think it's not unreasonable to have expected better.<br />
<br />
So what are the missing pieces of information?<br />
<br />
1. Does CA provide an avoidance improvement versus non-PoP mobs (i.e., mobs with lower attack). Anecdotal evidence says yes, but we have no hard data.<br />
<br />
2. Is LR worth getting? Anecdotal evidence says that LR is effective against PoP mobs while CA was not. Therefore, because CA is a pre-requisite to LR it's worth getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an ongoing discussion over at Steel Warriors about the effectiveness of CA3 and LR5.  The general concensus is that CA3 is roughly a 7% increase in avoidance and LR5 is about 1% per LR level.  <br />
<br />
AC has no affect on whether or not you get hit by a mob, because a hit can't be mitigated to a miss by high AC (Again, proven a while ago by the folks over at Steel Warriors).  If you fail your avoidance roll (CA, PE (do shaman get PE?), LR all affect this), you get hit for at least the minimum damage a mob can do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm disappointed that so many AA points produced no noticeable improvement in our avoidance against the mobs we are usually fighting.<br />
<br />
Defensive AA are the second most game changing AA after Can 5 in my opinion.  RL5 and ID5 make shaman and melee live longer period.  A LR5/ID5 ranger can tank in HoH with just Q, no way they can do that without it.  You start to live through one round of a boss mod's attention.  You can live throught three resists on an exp mod without a heal.  I have yet to meet a shaman that wants a refund once they get LR5/ID5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I said &quot;so many AA points&quot; I was referring to the 12 needed to purchase CA 3. From the evidence that Henora posted, it doesn't seem like those are 12 AA points well-spent from the perspective of reducing how often we get hit by PoP mobs. Maybe further testing will reveal that Henora's experience was an anomaly. Certainly, it looks like getting hit or missed is pretty streaky. Nevertheless, the hard data that Henora posted does not look encouraging.<br />
<br />
People that have LR3-5 are saying that they do notice a difference and are glad they have those skills. That's a lot of AA points to invest to get to that point, though.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I need to read those threads on Steel Warriors. There are Rangers in my guild with CA3/CS3/LR5 that tank very well. I'm worried though about the differences in mitigation/avoidance between Warriors, Rangers and Shamans. Can a Shaman expect to tank as good as a Ranger? Are CA3 and LR5 of as much benefit to a Shaman as a Ranger?<br />
<br />
Henora, would you grind some more AAs to get LR1-5 and repeat your Stormrider tests, please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Henora, would you grind some more AAs to get LR1-5 and repeat your Stormrider tests, please?<br />
<br />
There are 2 factors to tanking, avoidance and mitigation.  Avoidance is affected by your AA's (CA, LR, PE (again, not sure if shaman get PE)), your avoidance table, your dodge skill, and some say your AGI (Originally, when EQ was in beta, there were 2 numbers that affected your AC.. Avoidance and Mitigation.  Avoidance was directly affected by AGI.  Verant later combined the 2 numbers into 1 to make it easier to understand)  Mitigation is affected by your AA's (CS, ID, PE?), your defense skill, and your AC.<br />
<br />
It's been proven that there are seperate avoidance tables for different classes.. (Hi monk nerf!) so if shaman and rangers are on the same avoidance table (no clue about this, never tested it) then yes, a shaman with LR5 and CA3 would be missed just as much as a ranger with the same AAs would against the same mob.  <br />
<br />
Now, you have to factor in AC though, because tanking isn't just about being missed.  While AC won't affect the number of times you're missed, it will greatly affect the amount of damage you take from each hit.  If you have, say 1000ac and your ranger has 1500ac, he's going to see a significant reduction in the number of times he's hit for max damage.<br />
<br />
edit: added more content to clarify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still love my CA3 would be going for LR5 soon but i quit playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have CA3, and I also have LR5.<br />
<br />
With CA3, I was actually very pleased with the effect (even in PoP).  In fact, I was so stunned by the difference that I actually regretted not purchasing it sooner.  I was not impossible to hit by any means, of course, but I saw alot of misses.  For example, a Guardian Of Marr might break root, run over to me, and then miss me 6 times in a row or miss me 3 times and get a few low hits.<br />
<br />
Since I've upgraded to LR5, I've been even happier with it.  The giants in BoT are finding me much harder to hit these days.<br />
<br />
I guess it is a hard to quantify skill, though.  I personally believe that it works like this:  you have a straight-up 20 percent chance to avoid any single incoming hit when you have CA3 &amp; LR5.  If you continually do a /random 100, though, you'll see that EQ does a pretty funny series of &quot;random&quot; numbers.  You'll see streaks of high numbers and streaks of low numbers.<br />
<br />
Regarding sample size, &lt;300 hits is not enough (as the original poster stated).  The EQ random number generator isnt very well implemented.  I would suggest a sample size of perhaps 2500 hits.  The more the better, of course, but even 2500 hits would take a fairly long time to sample.  You would basically need a cleric standing there healing you.<br />
<br />
In any case, theres isn't too much reason to over-analyze this.  Unless someone is willing to do the research, it will always be a question of whether or not people have it have subjectively noticed a difference.  On any given day, some will say yes and some will say no.  I personally am pleased with the AA and would recommend it to anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I remember CA3 as being &quot;nice&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then I got LR5, and now I can solo tank giants in bot and end the fight with 55 mana or so, depending on the giant, resists, etc.<br />
<br />
They are both insanely excellent AAs. Another example: On raids, my guild has 2 shamans.... the one without AAs dies at least 5 times a raid... anymore, I don't usually die. Yes, I am on top of slowing as he is, yes, I get beat on just as much as he does (if not more) but I'm the one that comes out standing even though a mob that hits for 1000 just attacked me.<br />
<br />
It was pretty cool when we were going back to kill AoW, and someone trained him on us, to be the last man standing (though not for long :o ) and get missed 16 times in a row :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">After parsing a number of AA's with my monk - and finding NO difference - Seeing this parse adds to suspicion that many of these AA's do NOTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LR5 definitely works. I didn't notice much difference with CA3 but I was barreling right through to LR so didn't have that many situations to test it. I think it was around LR2 or LR3 that I started to realize things were having more difficulty hitting me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I noticed a difference when I  had ca2 especially. Progressed now onto lr5 and it has made a huge difference. Its nice when 3 VT mobs miss you in succession or a Pop mobs misses you a few times in row too. It certainly does make the difference. I am now considering the mitgation line of aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hit % is pretty random, a few lucky miss can make a big difference result since sample is small, <br />
<br />
eg do some simple statistic analysis:<br />
test A : Stormrider vs Henora with no combat agility.<br />
Total Dmg: 49,610 - Avg Dmg: 324<br />
Hits: 153<br />
Misses: 71 (Dodged: 7)<br />
total hits = 153+71+7 = 231<br />
<br />
Accuracy: 153/231 = 66%<br />
<br />
Test B : Stormrider vs Henora with Combat Agility 3.<br />
Total Dmg: 51,601 - Avg Dmg: 323<br />
Hits: 160<br />
Misses: 64 (Dodged: 6)<br />
total = 160+64+6 = 230<br />
<br />
Accuracy: 160/230 = 70%<br />
<br />
assume it is binomial distribution <br />
for test A : <br />
with n1 = 231, p1 = 0.66<br />
so mean u1 = 153 with s.d1 = Sqrt(231x0.66x0.34) = 7.2<br />
95% confidence interval is : between 170.4 and 135.6; hence between 58.7% and  73.8 %<br />
<br />
for test B : <br />
n2 = 230 , p2 = 0.7<br />
Mean u2= 160 with s.d2 = Sqrt(230x0.7x0.3) = 7.0<br />
95% confidence interval on hits is between 160+14 and 160-14; hence between 174-146; that is 63%-75.6%<br />
<br />
you can see the interval is pretty big which hard to compare and ; a higher sample size will reduce this error and make it easier to compare</div></div><hr />

Now, if someone can get data for the same mobs without any defensive aa abilities at all, it would be a nice comparison. A good test would be either Sentry of Justice or A rusted suit of mail seeing as you also have agility shown there.<br />
<br />
I think that miss ratio before I had any defensive skills were about ~27% up to about 33-34% now on normal exp mobs.<br />

The result of it making me tank &quot;worse&quot; than LR1 sample is almost certainly a reflection of that.  (see Shamam's post)<br />
<br />
I'm just posting the same test (flawed as it may be) for each level of LR because I said I would.  I like to follow through.<br />
<br />
Fatsow, your data is clearly much better statistically.   Howver, my data doesn't fall far from yours with that accuracy being from 60 - 67% in your different samples, with LR5.<br />
<br />
Mostly my observation is that the changes with the CA/LR line just don't seem very dramatic.  I certainly notice more chains of consecutive misses, but overall I don't notice a substancial increase in overall misses.  Such small samples as I provided are especially terrible for judging subtle effects.<br />

Nice things about those is that you can take 2 of them and tank them unslowed. Means you get data much quicker, although you wont get exp. These are also alot lower level, so not sure how much difference it would be, but sure its there seeing as avoidance is mostly level based.<br />

So whats it all mean? You spend a TON of AA, and get missed 5% less...sounds like a waste to me.<br />

I am for sure 100% happy that I spent the points to acquire it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A possible explanation and wild guess would be that Sony simply programmed some &quot;Mob_1 missing you&quot; messages for those with CA and LR AA skills to make them happy.<br />
<br />
Most players with LR5 were happy because they saw a lot more &quot;Mob_1 missing you&quot; messages compared to before they trained LR1 to LR5.<br />
<br />
Like some said, so far those who trained LR5 were very happy with it and wished they had trained it earlier (including myself) and those without CA and LR were dying a lot in raids from normal aggroed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">For the record, I &quot;feel&quot; like I get missed more now that I have LR5.

On the other hand, I was paying close attention now - it's very subjective, when you are anticipating an effect, you are likely to see an effect.<br />
<br />
People have gotten awfully defensive here in this thread.  My goal is not to demonstrate that CA/LR is useless and that the people who have invested AA's in it made a bad decision, by any means.  I think CA/LR is a wise thing for a shaman to invest in.<br />
<br />
My goal is to see how much measurable effect there was when I trained the AA.  I've found very little.  Perhaps displaying some evidence like people have posted in this thread might warrant it getting tuned up a little.  <br />
<br />
I was just curious if the effect was as profound as some had told me it was.  In my opinion the effect of the 27aa I spent on these skills is small, far smaller than it should be.  I'm writing up a feedback on it and I hope that I can get someone to take a look at it or possibly explain what CA/LR does for me and why I am not seeing the results I feel I should for the size of the investment that I have made.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is only my tests, admittedly.<br />
Perhaps it is that my overall AC is too low to matter on POP mobs.<br />
It could be a number of things, but it just doesnt seem to me like I am getting 27aa worth of results.</div></div><hr />

Last week I tanked a mini named at the Fire entrance (altough with two healers) and we managed to bring it down (Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Rogue, Shaman).

In the other hand vs normal mob, I can feel mob miss me more than without any CA / LR.<br />
However, if CA3+LR5 total of 27 aa worth it? /shrug, when mob double/tripple/quad you for 1k each, this is best bet to save your life (maybe get ID5 will help mitigation too)<br />
At a point if all you raid/kill is PoP mob, this is a must; if you just kill non Planar mob, this doesnt really matter imo.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see any real evidence that CA/LR is working effectively for priests. Especially considering the heavy AA investment.<br />
<br />
Everyone THINKS they are getting hit for less, but no one has provided any evidence to bear this out. For the record, with NO skills I have been hit, and missed with plenty of PoP gods...its all random folks, seeing 7 misses in a row and saying &quot;yupp, that's my kickass CA/LR working for me&quot; is being a little naive. People have been getting strings of misses since day one with nagafen.<br />

I had strings even against my light blue mob where he missed me 12times in row, but on the flip side he hit me 20times in a row as well.</div></div><hr />

What you need to do is with a certain aa lets say none, parse a fight, then parse it again, then again like 100 times.. then find the mean and the sd and see how much you get hit.. then do it again with ca1 then ca2.. even if you get 1000 hits, you need multiple samplese of the same data in order for it to have much real value.. I personally w/o any ca did not see the mobs in bot missing me 1/3 of the time! 1/3 is a lot and I hope when I get lr5 the mobs will miss me 1/3! <br />
<br />
IMO what someone should do (nope not me *grins*).. is just keep /log on and do your normal xp routine (tier 2+) and just get lots of samples every day until you get the aa to train.. then do your analysis.. train and continue.. new gear etc doesn't matter much, because we need to know what the general thing is that happens when we play eq.. I don't really care if a mob_01, the one on the right side of the named in DS misses a certain amount of times given a condition.. =]<br />
<br />
Anyway, cann v -&gt; scm3 -&gt; rc 1 -&gt; lr5 =] is the route I'm taking.. everything else (except channeling maybe) seems just a waste compared to this.. like scrm = 8+2+4+6 = 20aa to really get 600 more heal with q and a 9 min avatar woopie.. doesn't help on raids (when have you mgbed, then had focus run out before you needed to remgb because lots died? not counting vt.. )..</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to testing mobs in different &quot;eras&quot;....why bother? If it doesn't help on simple blue/light blue mobs in PoP (where everyone wants to exp and raid) then it's not worth much.<br />
<br />
I'd agree that you need many more samples to make a real comparison, but this is the same argument that goes with &quot;stat buffs&quot;.<br />
If you have to parse and parse and parse to see ANY noticeable difference equating to a 5% difference...then the effect is minor...to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Its also about ~15% more misses with max avoidance than without. <br />

Anyhow, as far as the %'s go, it's the same argument that people make when comparing slows, you can use whatever ratio's you like.<br />

Its a few days of hard work(full group at castle 2 in fire is about aa every 30 min if the groups good), atleast if you are elemental capable. Try tanking 2 of the sentries unslowed at same time, that should give you data quickly. Pull them into a secluded room to not get adds. Set up in a corner to avoid pushing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I've spent a lot of time kiting/soloing the red con mobs in Plane of Fire -- probably over 300 AA worth so far.  At the beginning, I didn't have LR5, or even CA5 I don't think.  If I got lazy and let a mob hit me (and stun me) I'd often die.  After earning LR5, I almost never die when I get hit/stunned.  (I am sure some of that is because I have better gear, more hps now, too.)  Back in the early days, I'd get smacked for 3 times almost every round, and probably kicked once too.  Now, I usually only get hit once, maybe twice per round.<br />
<br />
My personal conclusion (not substantianted by any documented numbers, sorry), is that LR5 makes a much more significant impact on mobs that triple or quad, or on mobs that hit for high numbers.  In other words, you notice the difference when you're taking 900 instead of 2700 from a round of attacks.  If a mob's only hitting for 200 and it misses you, that's a big difference vs. a mob missing you for 900.<br />
<br />
Of course, what Henora stated is also something I've considered a lot, too!For the record, I &quot;feel&quot; like I get missed more now that I have LR5.

Then you do your parse at no CA. A long one, say 5000 swings (I would rather like 100000 swings but this is a game, not a job  :p ).<br />
Then you do it again and CA1 . . and so on.<br />

Now what is the odds of someone saving up 27 AAs just so he can do all his parsing on the very same MOB with the same gear? Sadly these parses prove little either way.
