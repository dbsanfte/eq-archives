<br />
The air smelling of newly arrived leaves, grass and flowers. the birds were abroad in the great woods of Kelethin. The leaves, sheltered by the cool rain water from the night before, fell upon Oether's forehead. Wiping them away, he kept on jogging. With the spirit of the wolf within, he ran faster than the orcs that pursued him. Oether, cried out for help. &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; He finally reached the lift for the city of kelethin. The guards, rushing by Oether, quickly slayed the orcs. &quot;Thank you guards, i am grateful for your help,&quot; Oether said nervously. Eh, no problem, thats our job you know.&quot; Oether steadily walked back to the Clan Crushbone entrance. There his friends were waiting, standing aside three bloody orcs. &quot;Welcome back Oether, how was your jog? &quot;Shutup metherous,&quot; Oether spat out. Metherous growled. Of course, Oether knew Metherous was joking, but he didnt like being teased. Metherous continued playing his harp for the wounded friends. When everyone felt much better, they continued onward, towards the river. Oether, standing at the bridge, the other friends behind him, shot an arrow at the sleeping orc. The orc waking up, from the arrow bouncing off the metal-studded leather armor, growled and ran towards the group of friends. &quot;Watch out guys, a orc is coming!&quot; Oether yelled. The friends took ready. Tentar, sword at the ready, stood with the bravery of a barbarian. Crysthaline, glowing with blue light, prepared for the cuts and bruises this ferocious orc would cause to her friends. Metherous, playing all the songs he could, hit the strengths with such feeling and power, you could hear him play all around the hilly area. Oether breathing out of control,reached the group and spun around,yelled to luddaen &quot;cast now!&quot; all of a sudden the orc was sorrounded with bugs of all sort, stalling the ravage beast, and slowing him down. Everyone at arms, rushed at the blinded orc, gashing and spliting the orcs skin. Luddean, freezing the orc, then bursting it into flames, yelled with victory. the cruel orc fell, breathing the slightest bit</div></div><hr />
