<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something that has always bothered me with the cripple line is that these spells don't directly impact casters.   Plus the fact that Shaman's don't have a true castable Stun type spell (some of our DoT's have knockback but GL on getting them to impact casting of a NPC spell caster).  <br />
<br />
I understand that casters have lower AC, Dex, Agi, and Str for the most part ... in theory.  But most SoE encounter NPC casters have so much AC and other related stat's that one may as well call them melee-casters.   By level 66, most mobs/NPC's are going to have high stat's across the board ... casters included.   In fact, I would not be surprised that 65 plus NPC midlevel mobs have maxed stat's (350 plus) across the board.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Crippling Spasm should have some sort of reduction in spell cast time for the target or spell damage reduction effect against caster types.   <br />
<br />
Crippling Spasm    <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease DEX by 100 <br />
2:  Decrease AGI by 100 <br />
3:  Decrease STR by 100 <br />
4:  Decrease AC by 39 <br />
<br />
Add - 5: Decrease Spell Haste ~or~ Decrease Spell Damage by 10%<br />
<br />
Call it a crippling spasm of the spell casting fingers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm Beginning to think that all debuffs that reduce mob dps are just bad.  I'd Rather see mob debuffs that let players do more dps.  We can see that slow, being 75% was too strong.  And our other abilities were always tuned around that.  Not to mention, it became increasingly difficult for SOE to balance encounters around slow.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, SOE reached a point where the unslowed dps of a mob would instantly kill most tanks, while the slowed dps made the encounter trivial. So, they introduced mitigated slows.  Adding new ways to debuff a mobs dps won't help our situation.  If its too weak, its useless, if its too strong, SOE will eventually just nerf it.  <br />
<br />
If I had my way, I'd remove slow and cripple from the game, retune all mobs accordingly, and give shamans something useful in its place (more healing, more buffs, more dps, and more debuffs that help a player damage a mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the shot term the effect on Shamans would well...crippling. People think shaman they think slow. Thats what we do, slow and debuff. If they removed slow and gave us high dps/healing for a first couple of months people would think we're just another useless spot taker (more so tha atm) and it would take a long time for others to realize our new potential (whatever that might be).<br />
<br />
Remember when Beastlords were put into the game? At was at least 1 year before people really understood what they could provide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what the Devs made us believe and almost everyone bought that ****(I don't think any class has ever taken it up the ass so bad without making a huge stink about a game changing nerf of ones main ability). <br />
<br />
Slows should have never been nerfed through mitigation. Mitigation was never a tool to balance encounters better or they wouldn't have used it for trash(exp) mobs. Or how do you explain that now some exp mobs mitigate slows, but on the other hand come into camp hasted?!<br />
<br />
If you think hard about it, you'll come to the conclusion that mitigation was a straight nerf, a reaction to Thott's graphs right before PoP with the purpose to take some power off the slowing classes, not the game function itself. <br />
They didn't like how 1 member of the group was able to contribute that much by casting one single spell, they could have cared less how much you gimped their NPCs, because that's easily adjusted and countered with a lower delay, procs or innate haste buffs etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Giac is correct on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The cripple line could have been split into two aspects: one done by enchanters affecting casters, and the other done by shamans affecting the physical.  Enchanters could cripple the mind of casting mobs, causing them to fizzle more, decide to cast lower level/less effective spells, or some such.  Shamans could cripple a mob's physical aggressions, by crippling its chances of riposting, parrying, dodging, decrease in dps, attack, etc. <br />
<br />
But instead, we've had to share the exact and similar debuffing spellines with other classes, yet other classes have gained new and seemingly more efficient debuffs over the past few expansions.<br />
<br />
I don't see the new cripple being any different from the old one.  Dropping stats off today's mobs is rarely noticable if not at all.  A mob will still kill someone fast if not paid attention to, and the mob will still die fast enough if adequet dps is inflicted on it.  For all I know, a mob can have 0 strength and still has 3k ATK and still hits for 1300.  Heck, I'm not even sure if dropping 100 in str, dex, agi will have much impact in PVP (if it lands), but that's not my area of expertise.  But I do stand firm on this: the only way debuffs such as cripple will be effective, is if its function deals with today's mechanics.  It has changed drastically over the past couple years.    <br />
<br />
I've always wanted shamans to have a unique and slightly superior edge in debuffing compared to other classes, since SOE has strongly geared other classes more dps-oriented.  It really fits the shaman character.  But instead, we seem to just stay stagnant or fall behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  They would just think we are druids with melee buffs:)<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't like how 1 member of the group was able to contribute that much by casting one single spell, they could have cared less how much you gimped their NPCs, because that's easily adjusted and countered with a lower delay, procs or innate haste buffs etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me see if I can do some quick math because I'm too lazy to search for the older posts on this.<br />
<br />
Say you have a cleric who can use SL to heal for 450 hps.<br />
Say you have a druid who can use NI to heal for 291 hps.<br />
<br />
And say the mob's average hit is 1200 per pop, and can quad that amount.  So its about 4800 damage every 3 seconds or so.  That means 1600 dps.  Both the cleric and druid's combined heal rate wouldn't keep up.  Now, add 75% slow.  Now the mobs is doing 400 dps.  And, as you can see, the encounter is now trivial.  The cleric alone can keep the tank alive.  <br />
<br />
You can scale these numbers up to raid encounters too.  Where the unslowed dps of a mob can drop a tank in two rounds, whereas the slowed dps requires nothing more than a standard CH chain.  <br />
<br />
I don't disagree that part of it might have been disliking how the slowing classes contributed so much, but the raw numbers are much more revealing.  They couldn't keep adding dps to raid mobs without dropping any main tank before slow, while trivializing the encounter after slow.   <br />
<br />
And don't forget this post showing how we have been balanced around slow:<br />

<br />
The fact is Giac, you're right.  We did receive a direct nerf.  And the hits just keep on coming.  Now, the majority of boss mobs I fight are unslowable (ikkinz currently).  And this is precisely for the reasons I laid out above.  Unslowed, the mob would chew thru our tank in a couple seconds, while fully slowed, we could do it with 25% of our healers.  SOE's solution?  Make the sucker immune, and make the raid size limited to 54, and then crank the dps up to the point where that set amount of 54 people is just barely able to keep the tank up.  Thereby making the encounter &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
If we receive any new dps reducing debuffs, and they are actually effective, SOE will just have to make mobs immune to them to tune encounters.  If the debuffs aren't all that effective... then why have them?  <br />
<br />
Its just my opinion that we'd be much better served asking for bigger heals, debuffs that allow players to do more dps, buffs that allow players to do more dps, and faster/bigger burst damage.  Anything that effects mob dps is going to be &quot;tuned&quot; at some point.  I'd rather stop seeing my desirability &quot;tuned&quot; every darn expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I seem to remember that mobs do not really have &quot;stats&quot; or that their abilities are independent of their stats. Whichever, cripple has always been very situational. We rarely do it on raids even because it does not seem to make a difference.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic. A stun would sure be nice but I do not think we would get one. There are enough classes with stuns to almost always have one or to of them in your group. Other specialized caster effect? Sure, why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They couldn't keep adding dps to raid mobs without dropping any main tank before slow, while trivializing the encounter after slow.<br />
<br />
I do not agree, that raid encounters have to be immune to Slow in order to be challenging or not trivial. Most of the Luclin bosses were slowable, yet, back then, the fights were challenging enough.<br />
Now, even if we assumed that bosses had to be immune to Slow in order to represent a challenge, there's only one possible explaination for why they didn't limit Slow mitigation to bosses only. <br />
The reason is, that they felt the need to reduce the contribution of a slower to a group, period.  <br />
<br />
Unslowed, the mob would chew thru our tank in a couple seconds, while fully slowed, we could do it with 25% of our healers.  SOE's solution?  Make the sucker immune...<br />
<br />
And here's further proof of why the reasoning given by Devs in regards to Slow mitigation is totall bull****. Why are you insisting on making mobs Slow immune after you introduced Slow mitigation so you didn't have to pick between 75% and 0% Slows?<br />
<br />

<br />
That's because we are willing to take it in the ass, and they already know that. Reducing the mob's DPS has been a Shaman's main ability since level 39, which for some of us means 5 years of playing that role, and for 3 and a half of them this had worked fine.<br />
<br />
Face it, Slow mitigation or any debuff that cripples a mob's DPS are perfectly valid functions in EQ, if you put some creativity into the design of new encounters and if you are going to design a DPS vs. HPS encounter ala Ikkinz bosses for whatever reason, make *only* the boss immune, we will handle. <br />
None of us cried foul, when Nagafen, Lady Vox, AoW and the countless other mobs were not slowable, as long as it doesn't become the rule, but remains the exception(****ing exp mobs being slightly or not affected by one's main ability throughout an entire zone isn't cool, k?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is a good change actually, as it will allow you to lower the cast time further with a haste focus. There's nothing positive to say about the Spiritual Channeling nerf though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't disagree with you there.  The fights were challenging because it wasn't always purely about dps. Think emp.  Adds, long durations, lots of things to watch and keep in balance.  The problem is, SOE seems to be lacking imagination in the encounter department, so they just kept upping the dps.  And that resulted in encounters that were unbeatable without slow, and trivial with slow.<br />
<br />
The reason is, that they felt the need to reduce the contribution of a slower to a group, period.<br />
<br />
Not saying that wasn't a factor, but disagree that it was the main motivation.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you'll remember, they first tried mitigation before realizing that even the difference between 35% slow and 0% slow meants the tank was alive or dead, respectively.   Keep scaling the numbers up, and you can see how slow is a problem.  Make a hypothetical situation where a tank has a million hp, mob has 500,000 dps, and healers are roughly the same scaled up to those numbers.  Now run how long the tank lives at 35% slow versus 0% slow.  Any dps reducing debuff encounters this problem as you scale up.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Face it, Slow mitigation or any debuff that cripples a mob's DPS are perfectly valid functions in EQ<br />
<br />
Nope.  Truly its not.  SOE burned that bridge when they started the great gearflation that has become each new expansion.  As long as SOE's answer to challenging content is upping the numbers (both in terms of player hp, player dps, mob dps, etc..), debuffs that effect mob dps will be hard to balance.  <br />
<br />
I totally agree with you Giac, that SOE could have been more creative with encounters.  But they would have also had to bring gear up more slowly, heals up more slowly, focus be less focusing, etc.. so the numbers didn't get so extreme.  <br />
<br />
What happened was, 75% of 50dps wasn't a big deal.  75% of 100dps wasn't a big deal.  But 75% of 1500dps, 75% of 3000dps...etc. thats a big friggin amount of hp saved. The raw number between unslowed and slowed dps made keeping a tank up either easy, or hard.</div></div><hr />
