<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you who've been playing in beta (and later anyone playing live!), now the NDA is lifted I'd love to hear where some good spots are for soloing in GoD - either in terms of XP, nice loot, or getting our new spells.<br />
<br />
Also wondering if there is a shift in tactics - i.e. are mobs mitigating slow, hitting hard, using AEs/dots/nukes or just the usual mix? Lots of hp like luclin, or faster kills like normal ldon?<br />
<br />
Any info much appreciated, bored at work atm :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Apologies, but the first post I made returned an error hence the two identical topics - but the other one seems bugged so best reply here I guess!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the little bit of actual fighting I did in the 1st zone (Shores of Natimbi, or something close to that), the mobs seemed pretty difficult for their level.  I never did quite figure out which mobs have it, but several times I got some sort of funky dot on me that did some serious damage, like up to 600/tick (Chaos Claws was the name, I believe), I'm pretty sure the damage actually varied per tick, which was odd, but it did hit for max quite a bit.  Now that I think about it, dots don't normally tell you what you're getting hit for, do they?  So it's definitely something funky. ;)  Anyway, yard trash that has a proc that can do up to 10k dmg on ya (lucy says it's up to 660/tick for 1.5 mins)...  Fun!<br />
<br />
I was silly enough to try to take on some named archer guy I saw, too.  Figured if I could get him slowed, I would be okay.  Well, I was on a mountain side, and right when I pulled him, he warped on top of me and start hitting me for 550-ish, so I was pretty beat up right off the bat.  I tried to run, but being an archer, he just started shooting me, again for 550-ish, and he procced that chaos claws thing, too, so I lasted about 3 seconds before I died.<br />
<br />
Definitely is going to be a challenging expension to solo in, I think.  I'm sure some stuff will be easily doable... It's just a matter of figuring out what. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I think I stand corrected on the chaos claws thing...  Not quite sure what it does yet.  Does hit for up in the 550-600 range, it seems, but it's not like every tick or anything.  'Tis an odd spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't have much time to explore last night. After spending some time hunting green cons and completing one of the quests (collect 4 frog skins, reward was 7pp woot!) I wandered off to Natimbi.<br />
<br />
After hailing a few NPCs I headed off to the ruins in the hope of finding some essence that was mentioned. Found some ghosts of some sort, conned light and dark blue. These were easy kills (1xBoS, BoN, epic + dog dog) and gave about 1.5%xp, and dropped some higher level runes/words and up to about 7pp. Never did find any essence though.<br />
<br />
Then I moved up the stairs going up the hill, sounds like the place you mentioned - at least, there were theses big beasts which I proceeded to pull one of, but then got two little adds and these little fellas hit me with that funny DoT. They proved extremely resistant, even after malos and I ended up zoning.<br />
<br />
I didn't get any further than that - tried to put a group together but after waiting 45 mins and patiently trying to sort things out it was getting late and I logged. <br />
<br />
Saw some pretty awesome drops that people were passing links around for, a really sweet MP4 item and something else with BA4 on it. Hoping to get a proper group and really explore over the next few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I explored some of the entrances to the zones off Qitimi (Riwwi, Ferumbi, and I forget the last).  The guys at the zone in were basically the same guys outside, easy solo if you root and DoT.  They seem to have some nasty procs so I avoided tanking in teh face.  <br />
Exp was pretty mediocre actually, and no loot to be seen yet.<br />
I'll have to get used to the mobs in this expansion, they are definitly different from the stuff in other expansions.  They don't appear very dangerous at first, but they hit so darn fast and have some powerful procs that really sneak up on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I soloed right off of Riwwi, in the castle there is another zone called Coliseum of games.(spelling??)   Anyways I used Assidious Vision to explore the zone.  Mobs seem to be stacked thick in these zones.  Things in this zone resisted all disease based spells, including VP3.  Only poison dots and epic stuck on them.  As I was exploring invis, I sprung a trap.  It was a dead corpse on the ground.  When I ran over to it, about 18 mini mobs popped.  Luckily none of them saw through invis.  Personally I thought the mobs were a bit weak here.  They were easily slowed and didn't have any summoning ability.  They did mitigate somewhat, but with malos root landed fine.  I could root rot them in reasonable time about a one minute fight.  Didn't run into any named mobs at all.  Not sure exactly where to head to as all mobs were pathing.  Seemed that if you found a camp you would have to deal with more than one wanderer.  Mobs were hitting for about 300 max, but oddly enough most hits were under 100 and some even in the 70's. Mobs seem to path and path over each other.  Meaning would be hard to find a decent camp that you could get away with going afk.  There were some really crazy places where there were about 30 hidden mobs above your head.  There were only 4 mobs visable.  If you pull one you pull all 35.  Seemed that they are trying to really push the envelope here on what we think as far as usual gaming dynamics.  I would be very careful if you explore and take someone that can summon corpses. :) <br />
