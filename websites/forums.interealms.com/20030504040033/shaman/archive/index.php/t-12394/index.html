<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. First time caller, long time listener here... <br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone had any luck with pox research parts.  I can't do a search for pox in search engine here because it's only 3 measily letters long. /sniff<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been watching the new research scene like a hawk since it was introduced. The items and especially words used in pox o bertox are very rare. In fact I havn't even seen some of them on sale once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I managed to acquire the items for pox, but unfortunately, I can't tell you where they all drop.  Got Words of Agony in Seb, and got Words of Revenant in CT, but got the Lodestone in the Bazaar, so I don't know where it was originally from. <br />
<br />
Dunno if it was smart or not, but after being offered 85k for it, I scribed it anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">whoa is pox of bertox that rare of a spell? Forgive my ignorance but a shaman guildy handed it to me the other day and let me scribe it along with Tirgirs. I knew tirgirs was rare but I had no idea pox was worth 80K.<br />
<br />
Wow I guess I owe him a ton now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive gotten the flake of lodestone in CT in the maze. I havent been lucky with words of revenant in CT but friend of mine got those in seb but i dont know where off hand. As for the worth of pox, Its rare and its worth is one of those spells depending how much someone is willing to cough up for it since its not for sale ver often.<br />
<br />
  Ive seen it sit for a bit at 17k on CT server and was up for 4k one day and i'll be damned if i had just bought some stuff and had like 3k and friends werent online to borrow from /sigh. Needless to say it didnt stay for sale very long. That spell made me change my spending habits as i dont let me funds go to low now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pox is nice.<br />
<br />
Low aggro, lots of damage, doesn't break root, but takes longer than epic to finish.<br />
<br />
After malo/slow I'll PoX, epic, then bane.  After bane I'll re-bane, re-epic, and still be waiting for pox to finish.<br />
<br />
Still..discounting pet and melee damage that's a hell of a lot of damage output.  Got it in a lucky drop off Gore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pox does have a chance to break root with its 90 damage dd component.<br />
<br />
heck of a spell though, very useful in LoY where the greenie mobs have a ton of hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pox is disgustingly rare, moreso than Torpor and Malo on Ayonae Ro at least.  I have absolutely scoured the bazaar many times every day for pox basically since the bazaar was implemented, and have seen it for sale all of one time....for 70k.  And someone bought it at this ridiculous price within hours.  <br />
<br />
The research components for it are stupidly rare also, and one, words of agony, is in very high demend by necro's also.  I have all components but this one, at this point.  Meanwhile, some words for levle 60 spells in some cases are very common....I just don't understand that one.<br />
<br />
I can't for the life of me understand why they would make this spell so rare.  It's just a dot that is only really useful when soloing, and not that outstanding even then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any other reports on these drops? Ive seen words of revenant and Flake of lodestone drop from Maze lizards. As normal streakness of eq i got two words of reventant to drop in like an hr after nothing for many sessions. <br />
<br />
   I also had two words of sapience drop close together in CT and than nothing again. What about words of agony? The one i'm missing for poxx and i havent had the chance to go try and find it yet just finally got the words of rev.</div></div><hr />

I've gotten Words of Agony off ZI/Maze lizards in CT.  Sold them for 15k to a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">15k?ouch heh, Yeah think necros use same words for Dead MEN floating which is also rare spell. Guess i'll keep plugging away in CT and hope for a drop. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not sure this particularly helpful but had a Flake of Lodestone drop in Vex Thal. Lots of the high end pieces drop off the yard trash mobs there. Yes the yard trash can be level 66 so not exactly a useful place to go looking for research components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Luckily,<br />
<br />
I bought it for 3.5k a LONG time ago.  The seller said he needed cash fast and wanted to sell.  I just happened to be at the right place at the right time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For sale now on Ayonae Ro Bazaar for the second time i've ever seen, for 55k.  First time was 70k.  Totally ridiculous.  I just got level 65 and bought both the level 65 and 64 dots for less than this together.  <br />
<br />
As for the Words of Agony drop....they screwed that one up.  I could have made every level 60 spell 4 times over with the research items I've seen, but not this one level 59 spell.  I just don't understand this one, or the rarity of shaman spells in general.  (Malo still going for 70k+ too, and torpor never even for sale....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kajer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">actually right now...as of last night anyways pox was for sale on ayonae ro for 50k but still crazy</div></div><hr />
