<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ninja2708</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, going to be getting back to EQ soon, too busy at work atm and too tired when I eventually get home. I have decided to get back to my first character, who I could never bring myself to delete, his Magelo is in my sig (I hope :D). Looking for some suggestions as to where to solo at my level and up to 44 for next level of spells and alse what of my equip (and don't say all of it :D) needs upgrading first. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

These to me are where I always start, and then accesorise from there. Don't know ya so not all that sure on how much plat you got to spare, but I would look at the assory items, ie: Ears Wrist Fingers. Look at what will give you the best combination of HP/Mana/AC.</div></div><hr />
