<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK on Vallon Zek the ruleset says that all resist Debuffs are 50% more effective than on Blue servers for the purposes of PVP. Malos  should knock off 82 or soo to your resists, malicious decay should lower your disease resistance by  78, and Malosinia should  lower your resists by 105.    <br />
This is all good an well but, Have you seen the resists of toons recently?  Knocking off 105 MR,FR, CR, and PR  isn't much when people are running around with 400+ in resists. seriously,  Am I the only person who thinks we need an Upgrade to Malos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, but you might be the only one actually bitchin for it cause everyone else is afraid of being labeled a whiner cause it might make us too powerful or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just remember the more you can malos, the more advantages other people have because every single spell they cast has a -resist modifier, and our -resist is malo.  All you'll be doing is making other casters more effective, while you still won't be able to do anything.<br />
<br />
PVP IS BROKEN.  You know it, I know it, we all know it.  Stop bitching about it, they're never going to fix it, SOE doesn't care about the zek servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not like this is a PvP only problem. Same thing applies to PvE, just to a lesser degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am I the only person who thinks we need an Upgrade to Malos?<br />
<br />
A solution to the PVP resist problem wouldn't be a solution at all if it created problems with PVE balancing.<br />
<br />
Better solution would be to readjust the PVP resist modifier.  It's not just shamans that are having problems, but anyone with resistable spells.  I haven't been rooted or snared in a year and a half (besides one tendonslice).  I personally dont think anyone should be *immune* to PVP spells and thats where we're at with the current resist levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate teh Toetwister and tendonslicer.  snare sucks ass ;(    that being said.  I have around 130 MR and I almost always resist the spells cast on me so I Imagine that if you aren't doing direct Melee Damage to someone it isn't getting done. a typica scenarion for me in PVP is someone Dispells me I start Insta clicking they try to cast a root or snare that 99 times out of 100 I'll resist.  If it's a shaman and they land Malos(Shinerbokk).  I'll still Resist most magic spells  even when i only have 35 MR.  which is Kinda strange if you ask me.  though shaman will usually light me up because My PR/DR is in the low 30's. Me attempting to PK someone usually results in the same thing.  Land an unresistable then have everything else Resisted. maybe it isn't the spells  maybe it is the resist check.  Either way it needs Fixed.  I pay my 13 bucks a month like every other EQ player.  I don't think it's asking much to make a few  changes.<br />
<br />
As for Mobs.  as long as a Malo is on them i can land almost any spell (Save for the Mobs in BoT).  I haven't had any Problem with mobs in the lower tiers of POP.  but then i'm not in the Ep's yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Kori? Hows your dog? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I kind of look at the resist issues in 2 ways. <br />
<br />
1. Offense...Yes I have a hard time landing a lot of spells in pvp so adjusting the resist modifier on pvp servers even more would be of great benefit for us.<br />
<br />
2. Defense...I run around in pvp with all resists over 300. Magic resist is 425 in pvp. I resists almost everything. I have only had snare land once in the past year that I can remember. <br />
<br />
I usually get irritated with this game when I see Bards, for example, that can run around and dot kite me so damn easy. There needs to be the same resist check for their songs that the shaman have for their dots. EQUALITY for ALL classes. Make my dots land with the same ease of a bard song or adjust bard songs to be resistable like shaman dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On one hand I hate not being able to cast on people in PvP.<br />
<br />
Then I see &quot;You resist the Strike of Solusek spell&quot; among many many others, and decide it really isn't so bad.<br />
<br />
I only really have one issue in PvP.  Unresistable mezzes piss me off.  (Don't laugh) I can't DoT myself any more for mez prevention (without taking off 50% + of my armor) so any noob chanter with an unresistable mez can hold me mezzed as long as he wants.  Very very annoying.<br />
<br />
They need to make our epic unresistable, or with a -300 to -400 adjust , just so I can DoT myself again.  Would rather eat a steady diet of 'curse of the spirits' than sit around getting debuffed and mana drained till the chanter gets bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can't DoT myself any more for mez prevention  <br />
<br />
Carry crimson potions. Buy them from the vendors that sell pumice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">still not sure why you all would like to make the job of wizards any easier than what it is right now...<br />
<br />
don't lower the resist checks or whatever in pvp.  just increase malo debuff amount.  that way certain classes don't receive an even greater boost, yet we still do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shinner is right on the money. <br />
To resist Strike of Solusek you need a lot higher resists than a Wizard needs to resist Bane. <br />
Debuffs are fine as they are, they ned to adjust Shaman spells, if anything Shamans should have the easiest time among all classes to land a spell and we shouldn't be penalized for our debuffs to the point that even after Malos, we can't land a spell while other classes can without having the ability.<br />
<br />
And as i said, if you think this is a PvP problem exclusively, you are wrong. Shamans needs an innate resist adjust for their debuffs and DoTs. <br />
Sony is known to balance classes based on &quot;grouping&quot;. I.e.,a class is balanced, if it is &quot;balanced&quot; in a group situation.<br />
And here's the problem, because in a group situation, everyone will have it easier to land their spells than *us*. <br />
Same holds true for raids and in many cases for soloing too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The problem is when changing stuff to fit PVP, it might trivialize the PVE enviornment.<br />
<br />
What i would like to see is a tone-down (tone up when it comes to bards and their god-forsaken songs) of the resist scale for players. I think that would work better somehow than changing our different spells.<br />
<br />
Also, if we talk abour wishes, id love to have AE Malos like :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't see how things would turn trivial if Shamans got an innate resist adjust for detrimental spells. <br />
Will landing malosinia or a DoT earlier or more reliably trivialize anything ?<br />
Not even Slows would be an issue, since the Slow mitigation. It doesn't matter much anymore, when a mob mitigates to a high degree. <br />
The mobs you can't slow now are immune anyways, so there's no change really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well the fact that they have a 50% bonus to resist debuffs in PVP is cool.  but in this day and age you need to have a 250% just to dent Players.  it's not the spells so much as it's they apparently and once again failed to consider PVP servers when they  came up with the added resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If they retuned our spells they have to retune the mobs resist values and that means they have to retune all other classes spells in order to keep the encounters at the same difficulty level. And it would take them years of patches to sort that out. I think stuff needs to be kept simple. Nothing wrong with the PVE for most part, and if they start modifying spells that will affect PVE.<br />
<br />
It's true that mitigation will balance to a certain degree but in the end its like a fractal: A small error will multiply and cause the downfall of a delicate system.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there never was a balance to begin with so what the hell am i babbling about? <br />
<br />
Any change for the better will be welcome. I'd love to be able to face more classes on an even footing.</div></div><hr />
