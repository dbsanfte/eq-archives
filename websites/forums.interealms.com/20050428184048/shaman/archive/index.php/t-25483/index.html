<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some 60 mage named jubjub, gnome of course, tough tough tough. Had some battles near and in everlook, he pk'd me while fighting, twice, because I was a meathead, I killed him a bunch of times as well, but without other people around, man they are tough. Sheep ya, get range, pyroblast and all their tricks, blink gets them out of stun, frost nova freezes ya. I am still 58 btw.<br />
<br />
Toughest opponent I have seen yet.<br />
<br />
Of course we also had the 47 level 60 pallies there, beat their asses with a rubber hose. Nothing makes me happier then beating them up and stunning them before they can insta-full heal.<br />
<br />
Alliance hunters were cheating again, of course, somehow getting up on a house, but a resourceful shammy almost killed him with his lightning shield, and then one of our rogues figured out he can jump and swing in the building entrance. Why do people cheat?<br />
<br />
<br />
And for christ's sake, why do people constantly jump? My god that annoys me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its not cheating to climb a building. People do it all the time. What is super lame, and both sides do it, is when a bunch of gimps camp out in Gaz sniping people so the guards will kill them. Since its a nuetral town the guards will attack anyone in pvp, but since they don't have range attack they leave the guys on the roof alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the right talents, mages can push out a hell of a lot of damage.<br />
My mage's talent build is mostly into arcane for the channelling missles, less aggro, instant arcane explosion, instant spell casting, and the ability to do the 35% more damage.  I've got just enough talent points left to acquire the other arcane skills I want, as well as getting the uber fireball.<br />
Once I get that, my standard combat tactic for super huge dps will be to pull with fireball, active next spell to be instant, active 35% boost, fireblast, instant super fireball, cone of cold, arcane missle, fireblast, and arcane missle just as the 35% damage output is running out.<br />
Doing this without the super fireball (just using regular fireball), I push out 150dps with regularity at level 40.  I can knock an elite level 35 mob down to about 1/3 health before i've lost even a quarter of my own hitpoints.  I know the arcane missle probably won't channel due to stuns on a pvp server, and cone of cold is hugely overcosted vs only a single target, but most of that will all be instant casting, so aside from the arcane missle, you have no casting times to be interupted by stuns or counterspells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">stuns are the only things that seem to counter mages, and even then only sometimes. I usually kidney shot them rather then evis.<br />
<br />
My 22 mage is kind of fun, so used to not having ranged attack, I is fun to blast things. I get all scatterbrained in heavy pvp sometimes, not sure if would make a good mage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All I can say is....Hunters own mages in PVP, at least on the PVE servers during duels/consentual PVP. I have yet to be beat by one =/+2 levels. At +3 it starts getting more difficult to land attacks (especially if they've added +resist gear), but +2 or lower, not a problem.<br />
<br />
Pet stuns + Concussive Shot + Aimed Shot + Rapid Fire + DoT + Arcane Shot = dead mage in pretty short order. Considering I've spec'd out to increase my ranged damage + crits, a couple of timely crits (AS + normal ranged shots) will quickly chew down what few HP's a mage has to begin with.<br />
<br />
Rogues on the other hand (and to a lesser extent, well played Druids)...damn you, damn you all to hell! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The funniest duel I ever saw involved a mage and a hunter. The mage immediately sheeped the hunter, and then killed the pet with a combo of frost ring and nuking. The whole time he was burning down the pet he kept resheeping the hunter. After the pet was dead the mage turned the firepower toward the hunter. Hunter didn't last long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pretty sure mages can activate an intant cast for a spell, sheep is powerful, frost nova pet, get distance, pet toast, attack hunter at will.<br />
<br />
Really, the biggest thing is who gets the jump.<br />
<br />
Mages get almost exponentially more powerful at higher levels too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really, the biggest thing is who gets the jumpI can agree with that. If I get sheeped first, sometimes pretty hard to recover unless pet can keep him stunned. Usually only takes the mage turning has back on the pet once for that to happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't mind sheep. its free health</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is what my mage can do for damage output at level 40:<br />
<br />
1.  Activate next spell becomes instant (instant ability)<br />
2.  Activate all spells do 35% more damage (instant ability)<br />
3.  Fire Blast = 242 to 290 Fire damage (instant ability)<br />
4.  Cone of Cold = 49 to 163 Frost damage and slowed to 43% of normal speed for 9 sec (instant ability)<br />
5.  Fireball = 255 to 335 Fire damage and an additional 32 Fire damage over 8 sec (instant ability due to #1)<br />
6.  Scorch = 100 to 120 Fire damage (1.5 cast time.  hard to interupt)<br />
7.  Fire Blast has an 8 second cool down, which is almost done.  8 seconds after you cast it in #3, it refreshes and you do 242 to 290 more (instant ability)<br />
8.  Scorch = 100 to 120 Fire damage (1.5 cast time.  hard to interupt)<br />
This is about when ability #1 has worn off.<br />
9.  Cone of Cold = 49 to 163 Frost damage and slowed to 43% of normal speed for 9 sec (instant ability)<br />
<br />
<br />
Total damage output:<br />
242 + 49 + 255 + 32 + 100 + 242 + 100 + 49 = 1069 (lowest amount assuming no resists)<br />
290 + 163 + 335 + 32 + 120 + 290 + 120 + 163 = 1513 (highest amount possible assuming no resists)<br />
Multiply that by the 35% damage enhancement<br />
<br />
Damage output ranges from 1443 to 2042<br />
They can do this in under 15 seconds, all with instant cast spells, with the sole exception of the 2 scorches at a quick 1.5 cast time each.<br />
This is when they will pop off their mana agate for 550 to 650 free mana.<br />
And this is where the arcane missles and fireblasts start coming alternating until the mage runs out of mana.<br />
Arcane missles do 115 Arcane damage each second for 5 sec.<br />
<br />
How does hunter dps compare at level 40?<br />
Also, how many hit points does a hunter have at level 40?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mage should open with pyroblast shouldn't he? Once sheeped, has plenty of time to cast that long long spell.

Can't wait to get him higher level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damage output ranges from 1443 to 2042Pretty nice!<br />
<br />
DPS? Dunno. I refuse to turn this game into the min/max hell that was EQ (at least for me). I even deleted the DPS meter that came with CTMod because frankly, I just want to play without having that thing staring at me. I change out gear until the damage I do vs the lvl of mobs I'm fighting &quot;feels&quot; right to me.<br />
<br />
However, my best volley to date (was at level 40) has been<br />
<br />
756 (Aimed Shot crit) + Concussive Shot (stun) + 254 (normal shot crit) + 254 (normal shot crit) <br />
<br />
3 crits in succession for 1264 dmg (in under 5 seconds) not including the 210 from Serpent Sting R5 (15 second DoT) + pet damage/stuns + Arcane Shot + another 1 or 2 normal shots for 160'ish each thrown in between.....lotsa damage in a very short time (generally 10 to 12 seconds for that series to occur). And that's without using Rapid Fire (40% speed increase on ranged attacks) or any of my multi-shot attacks (useless in 1 on 1 combat though).<br />
<br />
Since then I've put 2 points into Mortal Shots and will keep putting them there to its max of 5. I'm spec'd for ranged damage crits. Though I'll admit if someone can get/keep me inside my minimum range distance, but just outside of melee range, I'm a dead Hunter. Of course, I try to keep that from happening, but damn Druids are sneaky. :)<br />
<br />
HP's? Depends on what gear I'm wearing. Ranges from just shy of 1400 to a little over 1600, but I don't have the best gear either. I mainly focus on +AGI/+SPI gear to enhance  my ranged dmg and regen rates.<br />
<br />
A Mage can do that damage in under 15 seconds only if they get the jump on a Hunter. Otherwise they're half dead after the first shot, stunned with the immediate second shot (so long as the Hunter is spec'd that way) then whittled down before they can get more than one or two spells off at most. Their best bet is to get the Hunter sheeped a.s.a.p. and hope to not get stunned by the pet while doing so. Then they need to get the pet out of the picture post haste (well before Hunter de-sheeps :)). Else they don't have a chance.<br />
<br />
At least that's been my experience. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Considering one of the most played classes is hunter, gonna get ganked like 1 million times by em growing up, will let ya know how I do :)<br />
<br />
Valgoth, spirit? Seems kind of weird for a hunter, regen doesn't work in combat for health at least, and food is plentiful, stamina might do alot of good man. Just my opinion. I think Ihave + 3 spirit or something like that on rogue, ha.<br />
<br />
I plan to be at or around 4,000 hps unbuffed on my rogue, no matter what I have to sacrifice. Pretty amazed at the crap I can survive right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with ya on the +SPI Mill. It just seems most of the gear I get with decent +AGI also has SPI. Check out the Tough Scorpid armor as a reference. The only real benefit is that I don't have to sit/eat as much to regen, so get back in the fights pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather have STA (don't care too much about STR since I don't engage in a lot of melee), but such is my luck. :)</div></div><hr />

Depends what your build is.<br />
I'm going primary into arcane.<br />
I will not be able to get pyroblast (that's the super fireball, right?) until level 51 due to my talent order.<br />
BUT, when I hit that point, sub out fireball for the super fireball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Biggest problem with Spirit is that you don't regen mana for 5 seconds after casting a spell.  Which means that for most classes, Spirit is useless during the fight.  And who cares after the fight, you can eat/drink/dance on the bodies as long as you need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">JuuJuu,<br />
<br />
why arcane? curious, arcane seems, well, weak to me, I am likely just missing something.<br />
<br />
Fire tree has some badass talents, last of which is intant activate, next fire spell is a critical strike, sheep + critical pyroblast followed by some 800 point fireballs sounds, well, toasty.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to clarify, that is not fully accurate.  If someone of the opposing faction attacks you the guards will only attack you if you fight back.  If you are a healing class or have other survival/getaway tactics it's not to hard to avoid being killed.  And if the attacker isn't up on a building exploiting pathing then the guards will own them while you stand and look on, np.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Mill, I went with arcane because it provides more utility than fire.<br />
Fire pretty much just adds more damage straight up, with chances to stun mobs a bit.  It's pretty boring IMO.  The only really exciting thing is the ae stun, but I can live without it.<br />
<br />
The arcane tree adds a lot of stuff.<br />
-mages do huge damage.  damage = aggro.  less aggro means less wasted heal mana from healers<br />
-I hated my fireballs being interupted by mobs meleeing me.  arcane missles always does full damage for me, unless the mob uses a stun attack.<br />
-clearcasting 10% of the time means roughly 10% less mana usage on my DD spells.<br />
-better dampen magic means I take noticably less damage from any caster<br />
-better energy shield means I can use my immense mana pool as a health pool with less refreshing of the buff<br />
-instant casting arcane explosion is huge.  there's none of this annoying casting time to have to deal with.  In gnomeregon, I can run into a pack of 6+ gnomes, chain arcane explosion about 6 or 7 times in about 10 seconds, and they all die.  I can also AE 3 mobs of my own level at the same time for xp gains without problems.  I could probably do 4 or 5 if I have a good healing potion on me.<br />
-silencing counterspell.  hits casters hard.  when combat is measured in the seconds, 4 seconds of inability for a mob (or player) to cast a spell is huge.  casters have lower hp than other mobs, so they live even shorter, so this 4 seconds hits them really hard.  fighting casters like shaman, this is very useful.  before I got this, I'd counterspell a lightningbolt, and immediately i see the mob casting a heal spell on himself.  Silencing counterspell just turns of casting period.  Also, it works even if the npc isn't casting a spell.  You can preemptively stop casting for 4 seconds to stop instant spells too.<br />
-presense of mind is very very useful.  Need to push out as much dps as possible in a short period of time?  Instant fireblast followup with instant Fireball.  Need to polymorph that mob quick?  do it instantly, without worry about interupts.  Want to AE those mobs like a champ?  Pull with the big fire explosion, then follow it up with an instant fire explosion.  Mob chasing you that you can't sheep (golem, dragonkind, etc) that resisted your ice root?  Instantly ice nuke it and run away.  Also, there's enough talent points to be able to buy the super super fireball from the fire tree, and still get Arcane power, and a few more arcane talents if you so desire.<br />
-arcane power is huge too.  Mages can push out a large amount of damage.  Why not just push that damage out even faster?  If you can kill a mob with X mana in Y seconds, why not do all that damage in Y/(1-0.35Y) seconds.  Let's say something dies in 15 seconds of fighting you.  If you channel this ability, it dies in about 10 seconds instead.  That's 5 seconds less damage you take.  When you combine this with the number of instant spells a mage can dump out, you can really spike your dps over a short time.<br />
<br />
The other stuff from arcane is ok, but nothing really worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 1 earth shocks + grounding totems = virtually no casting save for instant casts.  Magic resistance potions + resistance totems help resist the rest.<br />
<br />
This is the exact combo I use and I have only lost once to a mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thought arcane explosion damage was pitiful, hmm, might have to rethink.<br />
<br />
Right now working shammy though, just too badass, their friggin rockbiter at high level adds more attack then my rogue even has hehe.<br />
<br />
Mages are tough if well played, easy if not, and nothing makes me happier then monkey flipping a gnome mage. Is one called &quot;Genkage&quot; on my server, total ass, nothing but pk'n, no matter how many times you kill him he comes back, funny,<br />
<br />
Thanks juujuu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Arcane explosion is pretty ass.....if you are bothering to spend time casting it...<br />
When it's reduced down to instant casting time, it's pretty mean.<br />
The only thing you wait for is the standard spell refresh of like 1/2 second that happens when you cast any spell.<br />
Killing about 6 gnomes at once in gnomeregon, I'll do about 400dps at level 40 (went there to finally get my robe).<br />
You should see how fast I can kill a group of mobs when I pull with AE fire, make my next spell instant, do 35% more damage, land a fire explosion centered on myelf, then push out arcane explosions until nothing is left alive.<br />
2 mages together doing the AE thing is even scarier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Went through talent trees and spell lists again, ya arcane seems pretty nice, maybe I will respec the little guy.<br />
We were in some temple dungeon last night, just 4 of us, pulls of 4 normals and 2-3 elites each time, sme aoe would have been really nice.<br />
<br />
Anything to avoid in arcane tree really or just load it up?<br />
<br />
Mill the not good mage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">OH!  I forgot about the other ability, Evocation.<br />
This is the best mage talent ever IMO.<br />
Once every 10 minutes, you go from OOM to FM in about 8 seconds.<br />
It's a channelled spell, so being damaged will make you lose some of your total mana regen.<br />
BUT, you see that spell shield ability we have to make us lose mana instead of health?<br />
Guess what?  If you activate it, then pop off evocation, your channelling of spells isn't being interupted while it's still active.<br />
I'm not sure of exact numbers, but I'll estimate here to show how it ends up working.<br />
Suppose my spell shield absorbs 300 damage.  With my talents, it absorbs 450 instead.<br />
Suppose a mob hits for 90 a hit.<br />
It'll take him about 5 hits to get rid of my spell shield.<br />
Instead of taking the 90 damage, I lose 180 mana instead, and 90 damage is absorbed from the spell shield before it gets removed.<br />
In total I'll lose 900 mana instead.<br />
But, evocation makes my mana regen so huge, that I *still* go from OOM to FM, even dispite the fact that the mob is beating on me.<br />
So when evocation ends, I'm back up to full mana, and spell shield is about to drop.<br />
I can pop spellshield back up, and nuke down the mob with my new full mana pool, and take zero damage.<br />
It's sick.<br />
<br />
Other important times I've had this come up is when you get adds you weren't expecting, like when repops happen, or whatever.<br />
Those fire mages at level 40 have around the same stats as I do.  They have their 1k health pool and 3k mana pool.  Same with me.<br />
Except that every 10 minutes, I have a 6k mana pool.<br />
That rocks.</div></div><hr />

You might want to skip getting #20, and go with more fire talents.<br />
You might want to skip on #19, but I think mana regen in combat is good.<br />
<br />
The Wand Talent is ass.  I barely use wands  They get resisted too much, and are too tedious to use.  **** em.<br />
And I don't really are for a bigger mana pool.  When I need more mana, that's what Evocation is for.</div></div><hr />
