<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to tell people, if some didn't already know, that you can get an improved healing V aug solo or duoed in Stillmoon Temple. <br />
<br />
To get to the camp invis up and head North upon zoning in, it will be the temple directly in front of you. You will enter the first room with stairs run past this to the first tunnel straight ahead.  It will split left and right, you want to head East (right) and follow that around to an open courtyard.  The courtyard is filled with wandering drakes and stationary goblins.  <br />
<br />
The first room on the right is where to set up an easy camp.  There is one drake in there and nothing else.  The mobs mostly hit for about 200 to 300 hundred.  Some drakes dispell and heal, so keep that in mind, but they are casters so really makes the fights easy.  They do wander so the pulls are usually single.  I believe these mobs are the PH for named, but can't confirm it. <br />
<br />
Stillmoon Basalt Mage  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=17586) <br />
<br />
The named mob is Stoneskin and can pop at any of the stationary mage spots.  Just keep the whole room clear.  The wait time between mobs can be a bit, I think the timer is the standard 20 minutes.  He has two drops in his loot table I have seen. <br />

Item info:<br />
You must use the solvent Class X Augment distiller to remove augment safely.<br />
<br />
I believe the average camp time is between 2 to 3 hours. Augment is 20% healing increase.  Hope this little guide helps you save some of the crystals. I would say to effectively solo the named you would need to be at least EP geared and can be done easily in Time gear.  If you don't have either just bring a friend.<br />
<br />
Good luck great item for a shaman to have and fits on many pieces of armor. <br />
<br />
/Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a lot of info on this camp over at the Mage boards: http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=20122</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Webbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How is the difficulty of the mob?  I saw that a 67 Mage soloed easy, but I know squat about mages.  Think a 65 Shaman with my gear could take him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not too difficult, however, keep in mind that the names summon, and the caster types will gate if you dont interupt. If you dont have those rooms broken you can very easily end up with a fair number of adds, which could get messy, since you are bound to have a few cleric types with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can confirm that the repop time is 20 minutes here. I have soloed Stoneskin twice (lvl 65, bazaar gear) and had no particular trouble, once he's slowed. Poochie with SoL takes him down pretty fast. No CH or gate from him yet, although some of the other mobs have Ch'ed on me as much as 5 times.  :o <br />
<br />
I kill the single in the small room first, then pull everything into there. When they gate they go back into the courtyard, so once you've cleared it the first time it's just an irritation.<br />
<br />
I keep gate memmed just in case.<br />
<br />
I get dispelled quite a bit, but they don't seem to get any buffs beyond the first 6, so put the junkers first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanted to say thanks for the info, hoping to drag a couple supergimp druid friends over to camp this spot soon.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">druids? wru Greenvale Arms?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">greenvale arms?  I'm even more clueless about druid gear than mage gear, but both a close friend and my little brother play 65 druids, unguilded, with super, super gimp gear....just trying to push them in the right direction with at least some focii.<br />
<br />
