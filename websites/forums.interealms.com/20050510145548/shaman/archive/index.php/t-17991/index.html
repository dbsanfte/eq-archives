<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After all the different answers to Stolastorv's thread I thought I'd post a poll on the best expansion, the number of different opinions is really interesting, any way here it is:<br />
<br />
Which expansion did you personally find the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kunark = Iksar = Win =P<br />
<br />
Velious was pretty good for expanding raidability of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tough for me to give a good vote because in my first EQ life I went from release til just before Kunark...so I know the old world very well...and since then so very much has been added.  Since I haven't been around through all the expansions I never truly experienced them full time the way many did, and I'm only scratching the surface on them as I visit them now.  In my 2nd EQ life (when Evolution came out) I'm seeing all expansions at once (so much to see) and picked up LDoN when it came out.<br />
<br />
I voted LDoN because it's so different from existing content (and from the usual approach to content in most MMORPGs) and I absolutely love the idea of a 'classic dungeon crawl'.<br />
<br />
I've visited and enjoyed many of the expansion zones and I like the additional races, classes, and features (particularly PoP travel, the bazaar, and the LoY maps), but the reason I gave EQ a 2nd shot was the concept of LDoN, and I haven't been let down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When LDoN first came out people were generally enthusiastic about it: so why is it now rated as the worst expansion save one?<br />
<br />
It's clear that a lot of people have changed their minds about this - anyone willing to give their reasons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think that the fact that it is on the bottom means that people aren't still fairly enthusiastic about LDoN, its just that the others were generally better.  For instance, I love LDoN Adventures, but I don't think its anywhere near the best expansion so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know why LoY is considered so poor.  I loved doing the Gunthak, then Dulak progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm surprised Velious was so popular, I hated that expansion. Trying to get the entire guild to agree on a faction nearly tore the guild apart. Then, switching factions so we could hunt NTOV caused another huge brouhaha. Not to mention the whole Plane of Growth issue where none of my good-aligned guildmates wanted to go. I also hated the armor system.  Piece of armor PLUS gems PLUS faction -  so annoying.<br />
<br />
I will agree that the Ring War was beautifully done and a really fun event. Of course, shutting down a very popular zone for the duration of the event led to a LOT of bad feelings, at least on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think most folks on this board are &quot;raiders&quot; and Velious was the first REAL raid quality expansion.  Other than that, it's kind of a Blah expansion . . . and it's cold.  Yeah, Luclin and PoP brought a lot of Raid situations, too, but they also came with a LOT of bagage (mulitple keys, flagging, etc.)<br />
<br />
Oh, with that said, Velious does have the best (most fun) dungeon ever . . . ToFS.  If they'd actually add a little loot to this place people would get hooked.  Lot's of good memories there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I voted LDoN because it's so different from existing content (and from the usual approach to content in most MMORPGs) and I absolutely love the idea of a 'classic dungeon crawl'.<br />
<br />
Have you played LDoN?  It is nothing like a dungeon crawl.  The dungeons are extremely cookie cutter, small and have very little story behind them.<br />
<br />
Chardok was a dungeon crawl, lower guk (before it was overrun) was a dungeon crawl, sebilis was a dungeon crawl, fire giants was a dungeon crawl.  LDoN is much closer to an Anarchy Online mission, &lt;font color=red&gt;You have failed your adventure, please insert a another quarter&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
And I am not surprised to see Kunark and Velious at the top of the list.  I thought Velious was the beginning of the end, but at least parts of it took some kind of skill to play in.  Kunark was an excellent expansion, bar none.  Those monkies at Sony fired everyone who knew how to make well designed expansions after Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Imho velious tops the list, followed by Kunark, Luclin, PoP and Ldon are kind of tied, LoY trails along in a clear cut last place imho.<br />
<br />
Velious had its issues (Most of which Glori pointed out), however I don't think any expansion had quite the magic and quality Velious did, the ingame lore was superb, the plot fantastic, the progression was great, it had a mass of raid level encounters compared to what was previously availible, but still managed to offer stuff to draw the lower end players into it.<br />
<br />
Remember how bustling Thurg used to be?  How about when you had to sneak through Kael like a mouse praying invis didn't fail, Seeing CS for the first time before it became overun with quadders was a spectacular sight that half prepared you for the 'omg all these dragons' factor that was your first time in WW.  It really did recreate the magic and mystery of originally starting out in EQ again.<br />
<br />
Kunark was quite possibly the nicer expansion without the nasty issues of velious, but the end game in Kunark was horridly thought out leading to horrible overcrowding in the end game dungeons.<br />
<br />
Luclin should and could have been so much more than it was, it really wanted to be kunark and velious combined, with a ton of other stuff thrown in too, sadly VI just didn't have the staff to pull it of I guess and it ended up a mishmash of subpar content, much of which didn't even work for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Problem with LDON is it's way too generic.  Great concept (instancing), great mechanics (getting adventures is like questing), but implementation (go to the same dungeon with the same mobs with one of a select few adventure types) just plain stinks.<br />
<br />
What should have happened IMHO, was to create a bunch of dungeons with flavor and pizazz (like guk or runnyeye), many unique quests, and let the dungeons be instanced.  The whole beat the clock scenario makes it more of a nascar like racing game than an RPG.<br />
<br />
Kunark was great in the early days.  Bunch of lowbie iksars fighting in their n00b zones and curious explorers of other races cautiously learning the lay of the land.  The keyed dungeons sucked though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think people like playing ldon but if you took away the dungeons and make new ones would you miss them? If you took kunark away or velious that would be weird. The ldon stuff has a carnival feel to it. Its fun but doesnt feel as permanent to me. <br />
<br />
Kunark was my fave. Was what got me to stick to playing eq. I played off and on before that but fob, kurns tower and com would places i hung out alot. Suppose being Iksar Shaman swings my biase also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had to pick Velious, tough choice because Kunark was great as well (and if Old World were an option I don't know what I'd have done :p).  I liked Luclin as well, but wouldn't rank it up there with the first two and old world.  I don't raid at all, I find it boring and very annoying at times.  Therefore I strongly dislike PoP.  While Velious offered something for that crowd (and by the tone of most posts, enough of it), it also offered great zones &amp; lore for everyone else (the majority of their playerbase).  From what I'm hearing about LoY and LDoN here, on other boards, and in-game, I made no mistake by not buying them.  I just wish I could go back in time and not buy PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Go go go go Velious!<br />
<br />
Actually Velious made me feel like playing UO (without PvP). In UO you could/can make a very powerful character in matter of 3-4 days. After that the game is fun, no grind, exploring places killing bosses. Same with Velious, there was no rush to get 50 gazillion AA, nor to get level 60, just lay back, go check out KD, then WW, then Siren's ... great expansion.<br />
<br />
Factions were nicely done, NToV is an awesome zone and of course the ring war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My vote goes to Kunark.

<br />
Actually yes, I've done quite a bit of LDoN (nearing 100 adventures completed).  Do you know what a dungeon crawl is?  I loved Lower Guk back in the day and I enjoy classic dungeons but they are not &quot;dungeon crawls&quot;.  Having creatures respawn and sitting on one place repeatedly killing the same critters over and over is &quot;parking/camping&quot; not doing a &quot;crawl&quot;.  A crawl is clearing an entire dungeon from start to finish.  LDoN does have elements of repetition but it's the closest thing to a classic PnP dungeon crawl you can find.  LDoN has as much lore or story behind it as any other aspect of EQ - and how many people do you know that actually give a flying monkie's butt about EQ lore anyways?  I sure haven't met any and I'm rather social.<br />
<br />
There are few dungeons in EQ that you could do some sort of crawl in, because most EQ dungeons have a wide range of critter levels and therefore difficulty.  Romping through a level 40 dungeon with a raid of 65's ins't a crawl, it's a slaughter.  You *might* be able to crawl a dungeon like LGuk these days with a good group or two made up of levels that would be challenged and get xp, but back in the days when LGuk was actually (over) popular there was no chance of doing a crawl there since every spawn in the dungeon was camped and you could often move freely from end to end in there without danger.  Before LGuk was overrun how many people did you really know that would crawl it - ie, fight from one end to the other?  Not that many people did it, I can assure you.  I might've done it once back in the day...whereas I can do several LDoNs a day on the spur of the moment with ease.<br />
<br />
Hehe, if I could get a group up to go massacre LGuk I'd be all over it - I used to live in that place back in the day.  From my experiences I'd guess that over half of today's EQers 1 - have no idea where Guk is, 2 - couldn't even navigate live side to get to lower, and 3 - would get so lost in LGuk that it'd be a total disaster.  I've done exactly 1 SRo LDoN adventure and a few people in the group couldn't find the entrance to Guk, then once in couldn't find the entrance to the adventure, and it was just a (comical) mess.<br />
<br />
LDoN missions have a timer and a goal - they may not be that complex but they do have goals and the timer keeps you moving.  If you crawl in a classic dungeon what is the goal?  What is the motivation to even finish?  The other aspect of LDoN that's nice is that everyone has more potential for rewards - there are chances for augs to customize/enhance your gear, chances for drops which are sometimes very nice, and even if you get none of that you earn points to buy things you actually want.  In most classic dungeons even if you crawl them with loot in mind you may or may not get said loot depending on whether mob X is up (and if you camp him you're not crawling anymore) and if that 1 item does drop only 1 person can have it. <br />
<br />
I've played multiple MMORPGs and dungeons/content in them are basically the same.  Camp, kill mob that respawns in in the same spot/pattern repeated, repeat, repeat, repeat.  Every static dungeon has the exact same layout with the exact same critters at the exact same spawn points every single time you visit them.  At least LDoN offers some randomness within the various themes and dungeon layouts.  How are the LDoN dungeons with varying critters over time, random loot, and adjusting difficulty levels any more cookie cutter than a static dungeon that is always exactly the same (aside from the occasional named vs placeholder hell) ?<br />
<br />
I don't know about your server, but on Xev there aren't that many people in the Kurnark and Velious zones I've visited.  I've done some travelling to check out some remote zones in Kunark and I can easily be the only person I see for 3-4 zone transitions.  Maybe I'm just visiting the wrong zones...could easily be.  Meanwhile, /lfg is chock full of people flagged as seeking LDoN and everybody else is seeking planes.<br />
<br />
Having read many threads regarding LDoN on various forums there seem to be very few people that dislike LDoN, but they seem to violently dislike it.  That's cool - whatever you do for fun is cool with me as long as you're not exploiting or ruining fun for others.  I and many others, however, seem to find LDoN to be quite enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Most expansions bring the same kind of additions - new classes, new races, more content that is basically just more zones (more of the same), a few new interface features to make life easier, etc.  LDoN brought a whole different type of content.  Yes, it's like AOs missions but AO isn't that fun (point blank battles with ranged weapons that lasts for minutes at a time is downright silly) and AO missions were even more generic that LDoN is.<br />
<br />
You can like or dislike LDoN but I still contend that it's the closest thing to a classic PnP dungeon crawl and in many ways is more rewarding than attempting to simulate a crawl in a classic dungeon.<br />
And you don't have to like it, but I do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am probably one of the few people that rank Kunark fairly low, but I have my reasons. For one, it created a whole generation of &quot;Level 50 Noobie LFG&quot; type players. Before Kunark, you HAD to xp in dungeons. You HAD to have half a clue. However, once Kunark shiipped, it was a simple matter to take a character to lvl 50 via LoIO, FM, OT, DL, and never have to enter a dungeon, heck, never have to fight more than 1 mob at a time. Pull 1, kill, repeat. The faction for evils was a disaster as well. If you were an evil race, you basically either skipped HS and KC, or screwed your faction in the only city availble to you on the continent. The first few weeks of Kunark were a disaster gear wise as well. I can understand a new expansion having gear that is a LOT better than the current crop, but stuff like Gem Encrusted Ring and Polymorph Axe shouldnt have been dropping off YARD trash. What a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Having creatures respawn and sitting on one place repeatedly killing the same critters over and over is &quot;parking/camping&quot; not doing a &quot;crawl&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not a crawl.  It sounds like that is what you did back then, and it makes sense that you would enjoy LDoN more than that.<br />
<br />
A crawl is clearing an entire dungeon from start to finish.  LDoN does have elements of repetition but it's the closest thing to a classic PnP dungeon crawl you can find.  LDoN has as much lore or story behind it as any other aspect of EQ<br />
<br />
Not really, compare Sebilis to any dungeon in LDoN.  Sebilis walks all over the LDoN dungeons in terms of storyline.  LDoN is a randomly generated &quot;mission&quot; where the story is always the same, kill really fast, don't worry about pulling, don't worry about tactics, just get in there, kill the spoonfed mobs and get ready for the &quot;Your adventure is a success!&quot; message.  Sebilis has a dragon at the very bottom, when you spent an hour or two fighting your way to Traks lair, pulled juggs for a bit, and then headed off to bed, you felt like you went somewhere and did something.  In LDoN you are showing up to get spoonfed mobs that are nicely lined up and easy to pull in groups small enough to be handled by even the lamest of groups.<br />
<br />
There are few dungeons in EQ that you could do some sort of crawl in, because most EQ dungeons have a wide range of critter levels and therefore difficulty.  Romping through a level 40 dungeon with a raid of 65's ins't a crawl, it's a slaughter.

I might've done it once back in the day...whereas I can do several LDoNs a day on the spur of the moment with ease.<br />
<br />
Several LDoNs don't size up to even one good lower guk dungeon crawl.  My friends and I would crawl in places like Lower Guk, Sebilis and Chardok all the time.  <br />
<br />
Hehe, if I could get a group up to go massacre LGuk I'd be all over it - I used to live in that place back in the day.  From my experiences I'd guess that over half of today's EQers 1 - have no idea where Guk is, 2 - couldn't even navigate live side to get to lower, and 3 - would get so lost in LGuk that it'd be a total disaster.  I've done exactly 1 SRo LDoN adventure and a few people in the group couldn't find the entrance to Guk, then once in couldn't find the entrance to the adventure, and it was just a (comical) mess.<br />
<br />
Right, Sony dumbed the game down so that people could show up, hit attack and put yellow in the bar.<br />
<br />
LDoN missions have a timer and a goal - they may not be that complex but they do have goals and the timer keeps you moving.  If you crawl in a classic dungeon what is the goal?  What is the motivation to even finish?  <br />
<br />
An example of a goal back in Kunark was to fight down to Trak's Lair, spend a bit of time killing Juggs and then log off for the night.  That was more than enough entertainment to fill an evening.<br />
<br />
The other aspect of LDoN that's nice is that everyone has more potential for rewards - there are chances for augs to customize/enhance your gear, chances for drops which are sometimes very nice, and even if you get none of that you earn points to buy things you actually want.  In most classic dungeons even if you crawl them with loot in mind you may or may not get said loot depending on whether mob X is up (and if you camp him you're not crawling anymore) and if that 1 item does drop only 1 person can have it. <br />
<br />
Sure, that is a great feature of LDoN, idea is decent, the implementation is horrid.  The dungeons are small and uninteresting and not immersive in the slightest.<br />
<br />
I've played multiple MMORPGs and dungeons/content in them are basically the same.  Camp, kill mob that respawns in in the same spot/pattern repeated, repeat, repeat, repeat.  Every static dungeon has the exact same layout with the exact same critters at the exact same spawn points every single time you visit them.  <br />
<br />
Camping is a choice.  Don't like camping?  Don't do it!  I never understood the people who bitched about camping, and then went ahead and did it hours on end.<br />
<br />
At least LDoN offers some randomness within the various themes and dungeon layouts.  How are the LDoN dungeons with varying critters over time, random loot, and adjusting difficulty levels any more cookie cutter than a static dungeon that is always exactly the same (aside from the occasional named vs placeholder hell) ?<br />
<br />
The LDoN dungeons all look like they took a base dungeon for each theme, and then cut and pasted that dungeon to make the rest of the dungeons for each theme.  Comparing the level of detail in Crypt of Dalnir, Droga, Sebilis, Lower Guk with any LDoN dungeon and the LDoN dungeon comes up sadly lacking.<br />
<br />
I don't know about your server, but on Xev there aren't that many people in the Kurnark and Velious zones I've visited.<br />
<br />
That is because Sony dumbed the game down to where you sit there and wait for the mobs to be spoonfed to you.  At least they moved everyone out of Dreadlands 9.0 into tiny dungeons, but the challenge is about equal.<br />
<br />
I've done some travelling to check out some remote zones in Kunark and I can easily be the only person I see for 3-4 zone transitions.  Maybe I'm just visiting the wrong zones...could easily be.  Meanwhile, /lfg is chock full of people flagged as seeking LDoN and everybody else is seeking planes.<br />
<br />
Of course, because the only place you can advance your character with any kind of alacrity is either in LDoN or PoP.  Every where else you go results in much slower advancement and horrid equipment.<br />
<br />
Most expansions bring the same kind of additions - new classes, new races, more content that is basically just more zones (more of the same), a few new interface features to make life easier, etc.  LDoN brought a whole different type of content.  Yes, it's like AOs missions but AO isn't that fun (point blank battles with ranged weapons that lasts for minutes at a time is downright silly) and AO missions were even more generic that LDoN is.<br />
<br />
Not by much.<br />
<br />
You can like or dislike LDoN but I still contend that it's the closest thing to a classic PnP dungeon crawl and in many ways is more rewarding than attempting to simulate a crawl in a classic dungeon.<br />
And you don't have to like it, but I do!<br />
<br />
&quot;Crawling&quot; LDoN dungeons requires the exact same strategy for every dungeon.  Kill stuff really fast.  You don't have to be a good puller.  You don't have to have good crowd control.  You don't have to have class interdependance.  In classic dungeons, you needed people who knew how to play a much more complex game.<br />
<br />
Just curious, when did you start playing?  Because if you haven't played from pre-kunark, you and I are probably talking apples and bowling balls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True enough.  But what fascinates me is that LDoN is the expansion that belatedly fixed several of the worst flaws in the game<br />
<br />
- that getting loot was constrained as much by getting a camp before another player as it was by defeating the mobs guarding it.<br />
<br />
- that the biggest hazard in a dungeon wasn't the mobs as such, but noob0100 who'd train you.<br />
<br />
 So I would have expected it to very frequently be peoples favourite expansion.<br />
<br />
As LDoN is doing so badly I think it shows there are major flaws in SOE's implementation - things that aren't implicit in instancing - that lower people's enjoyment of this expansion.  My personal hate is the timer - which transforms a game which I used to play to relax into a horrible rushfest.  But maybe that's just me: I'd like to know what's putting other people off LDoN.<br />
<br />
Edit: added training to flaws of pre LDoN</div></div><hr />

Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told of his captivity within an ancient city of Iksar now claimed by the Samak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Samak with numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars underneath were for no lizards eyes. his great perseverance gave him an inner strength no other monk could lay claim to.<br />
<br />
He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left arm. He could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with as if having a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. All the empire under respected or feared him. None would spar him outside of the taverns. with grog comes stupidity.<br />
<br />
Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay within the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted. This is his tale as told by Rinmark.<br />
<br />
Taken from a tome looted from the Dark Elf Spy in Northern Ro:<br />
<br />
Nestled deep in the plains of the Overthere rests the cliff city of Charasis. This city of grandeur was home to the mighest of all Iksar tribes, the Kunzar.<br />
<br />
Charasis is also recorded as the birthplace of the great Emperor Venril Sathir the uniter.  Although Emperor Sathir ruled from the Kunazar city of Sebilis, he was rumored to have  stored his most valuable possesions within the library of Charasis.<br />
<br />
Emperor Sathir's beloved, Drusella, rests within a grand crypt in Charasis' depths. After her funeral and burial, Emperor Sathir cast all citizens from the cliff city. Only the royal guard and servants where allowed to stay, forever.<br />

How can you compare that to<br />
<br />
Oh, we um...found some dungeons and stuff. Go kill things and we'll give you some points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually the five main storylines for the different themes as well as the story of the wayfarers leaders (in the storywindow) are good to read and quite interesting (most provide very few new informations unfortunately).<br />
<br />
Granted they are nowhere near the depth, complexity and flavor of the old Kunark stories.<br />
<br />
Voted Kunark. Yay for crushed ancient empires and epic mystic battles  :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I voted Kunark. It was by far the best expansion of its day. <br />
<br />
Why? The game world was horribly, stupidly, brokenly overcrowded before Kunark. Two dungeons high level people could exp in (at least if you wanted any possibility of loot at the same time). Newbie zone and city guards and high level NPCs camped all over the world, just so people could get exp. Out door mobs hunted to extinction. <br />
<br />
EQ on the live servers was hell before Kunark came out, in a way that would have made French existentialist philosophers smile. I can't remember if it was Camus or Sartre who wrote something that perhaps can be best translated as &quot;Hell is other people&quot;. That was EQ pre-Kunark, because it was just too damn crowded. <br />
<br />
There's a reason I played on test server way back then. ;)</div></div><hr />
