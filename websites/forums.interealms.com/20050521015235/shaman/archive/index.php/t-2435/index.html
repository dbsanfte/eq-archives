Caster NPC Update<br />
<br />
As Alan's already said, the driving idea behind these changes to NPCs is to make them more interesting to fight. Previously, especially toward the high end, it's no secret that many caster NPCs were considered free targets. They spent the majority of their time casting ineffective spells, and frequently the same ones over and over again.<br />
<br />
Originally, they were given exemptions to the normal spellcaster rules to make up for their shortcomings. It only makes sense that the average NPC should be a challenge for the people who can gain experience from its demise. However, we think it should instead feel like they're playing from the same rulebook as player spellcasters. <br />
<br />
Making them challenging within a similar framework to the one that players use, we feel, provides for more rewarding victories. Conversely, let's face it, the argument, &quot;Of course NPCs cheat -- They're NPCs.&quot; really doesn't make anyone feel better when they've just gotten themselves obliterated. Yes, dying is painful, but doing so in a fair fight is much more tolerable.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of this is an attempt at &quot;Making EverQuest Universally Harder.&quot; We'd like our NPCs be a little smarter than they were previously, yet an encounter with them should still feel challenging, but fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
In last week's patch we introduced a significant enhancement to the &quot;Challenging&quot; half of that, which from observations on the Test server appeared to be mostly fair. However, we feel confident enough in the NPCs' newfound strengths that we've taken a look at some of the special bonuses that they get just for being an NPC.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we've internally tested some changes to address the &quot;Fair&quot; half, and they'll be available for public testing on the Test server over the next few days, in the hopes of reaching a balance between player and spellcasting NPC. Ideally, we would like to have a balance which leaves them a challenge; something to be mindful of, but not inordinately unfair. <br />
<br />
There are some that we're still internally debating, but we all agree that we'd like to see them in action in front of a wider audience before we make any final decisons. <br />
<br />
<br />
* NPCs are now bound by the same Line of Sight rules as player characters. (An NPC must be able to &quot;see&quot; you to hit you with a spell.)<br />
<br />
* Neither NPCs nor player characters will use mana on targeted spell casts that do not connect due to Line of Sight. <br />
<br />
* NPCs are now bound by spell casting distance rules. Meaning, an NPC's spell will no longer connect from halfway across the zone. (We want spellcasters to be challenging -- Not a deathtrap that a person has no ability to run away from.)<br />
<br />
* NPCs now have a chance to be interrupted by normal combat when casting newer spells.<br />
<br />
* NPCs that are extremely green have had their potential casting damage reduced using a similar mechanic to the one that player characters' level differences use. <br />
<br />
* NPC Wizards no longer have an inherent bonus to their fire and cold based spells. They appear to be doing just fine on their own.<br />
<br />
* Most NPCs that had previously had their spellcasting level inflated to make up for poor spell selection have been brought back into line with their actual level.<br />
<br />
* NPCs no longer automatically get free access to rarely dropped spells, such as Garrison's Superior Sundering and Funeral Pyre of Kelador.<br />
<br />
* We've begun looking at NPC pure caster hit points and melee damage, and will continue to watch how this plays out over the coming weeks, making adjustments in some cases. Some adjustments are already visible on the test server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even this balance may not yet be where we'd like it, but please rest assured that it will continue to be tuned. Most of us enjoy playing the game as well, and what we would like to see in our own playtime is NPCs that are a reasonable challenge.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think taken as a whole (assuming those changes go live) the NPC caster changes are a Good Thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it will probably still be a horrible trainwreck.  Many of these changes (LOS, range) are flat-out BEGGING to be exploited.  Lowering the HPs of caster mobs would be a balancing nightmare.  The combo of the two would make PC ranged damage dealers--who are balanced by having relatively weak defense--many orders of magnitude more powerful than they were before.  <br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">god i love descriptive subject lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice ain't it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still think Verant is full of it, these changes should have never been made or they should have been corrected a long time ago. The &quot;real&quot; newbie got screwed when these changes were implemented. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, dying is painful, but doing so in a fair fight is much more tolerable.  <br />
<br />
Who decides what is a fair fight or not ? Was it fair that an unarmed Froglok wizard can punch for 100+ damage ? Or be backstabbed by a rogue-type mob for 100+ damage with a rusty dagger ? Or give Shardwurms (who are lvl 34 at max).....lvl 56 spells ? There has been NPC caster inblance from jump, and its taken them this long to try to &quot;fix&quot; it ? <br />
<br />
<br />
No matter what color you paint it, they are full of crap ! Focus items by no means balances the NPC caster &quot;upgrade&quot;. <br />
Guess time will tell, but I don't buy it for one second, I think things will be just as screwed up as much as they were before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am very encouraged by Scott's post.  It was well written and shows he completely understands the issue.  Contrast that to Absor's previous &quot;aint it cool&quot; comments.     <br />
<br />
Smarter mobs *will* be more fun.  Right now they don't seem smarter, they seem like landmines.<br />

EDIT: Oh, and Soup is right.  Please use descriptive thread titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's nice that they are fixing it this fast but it should have been tested out first then corrected then sent to the live servers.</div></div><hr />
