Now this is someone who truly loved the game.<br />
<br />
As I watched this, I had a flood of memories hit me.  It was bittersweet to remember what was ... and explains why I still buy expansions ... the hope that it will return.<br />
<br />
I am not naive enough to know that it will ever happen.  But wow, I am glad I was there for the glory years.<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
ROFL<br />
<br />
Since I got a neg rep bump out of this, I figured I better finish why I posted this, even tho it is a remake of an old album.  After I watched this the other night, I went and rolled a baby hi elf mage just for the hail of it.<br />
<br />
Decided to do the tutorial, since I never had.  It was really a blast as most of you know.  I ran thru the tutorial, and then headed to Greater Fey at level 5.<br />
<br />
First off, I ran to get my spells.  Decided to use the find button in Felwithe.  And lo and behold, I jumped into the water, where the mystical path lead me, and never could get out where it did.  I knew where the spells where, so after a couple of attempts, I just portalled in and bought them.  But I will tell you, if I had been a newbie, this would have driven me nuts trying to follow that path to nowhere.<br />
<br />
Got my newbie armor quests, my pets, and headed to GF.  Where my pet would follow me no where!  I mean this earth guy took off at the wierdest times.  So I tested it. <br />
<br />
Went to the orc lift ... and started up the path to the orc hill.  Was watching my pet the whole time.  Halfway up the path he was off ... so I followed him.  That sucker had run speed 27 on, cause no way could I keep up with him.  He disappeared into the mists, and I headed back to orc lift to wait.  2 minutes of my rapid punching pet follow, he decides to show up.<br />
<br />
Decided screw it, and just went hunting.  I was looking for wasps (drones, workers and warriors) for the pollen they drop for the armor.  This is what I encountered after 3 hours of hunting:<br />
<br />
Lots of drones .... 3 workers and no warriors.<br />
<br />
That zone is just dark.  I have a new computer, new graphics card, and this surprized me.  I mean I know it is a forest, but damn.  It is either dark or foggy.  Would a little sunlit patches hurt every once in a while?<br />
<br />
At the end of the orc hill path, I found the 3 workers. 2 of these babies conned white to me when I threw a nuke at them.  By the time they got to me, they conned yellow.  I actually saw one of them change cons before my eyes.  And, of course, since my pet was off doing his own thing, I ate the deaths.<br />
<br />
I have never been inspected so many times in my life.  Every time I sat down to med or regain hps, someone was looking at me.  Made me wish I had put a message in my box that said &quot;Yeah you can look at my undies ... you just damn well better respect me in the morn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally had to turn off shouts and socials.  These people are inventive!  Reminded me why Lori has hers permanently off.<br />
<br />
And the begging.  This one I loved ... &quot;My husband made me this character and I don't know what do to.  He said I need to ask for armor and stuff so pst !&quot;  By the way, that is verbatim.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you guys, but it took me about 1 week to get all the different modes of talk down ... and I damn well didn't know pst wasn't pacific standard time when I was new.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a good time was had by all.  Never got my newbie armor, never did find my pet while I was hunting, but a Temp buff did wonders for my morale and I made level 8. <br />
<br />
Moral of this post ...  I had a bit of fun. But it wasn't the old days  :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
<br />
I think that watching that reminds me of a very important point that i want to share. That point is that though we have all been in EQ a long time and most of us have seen the progression from crushbone to Elemental and beyond, that its important that we approach upcoming MMORPG's with the same newness that we did with EQ. Yea its easy to look at wow and go &quot; Elves? Been there done that &quot;. But its important to realize that its a new land we are about to enter and that we havent been there and done that yet. That if you approach this and even EQ 2 with this newness and open mindedness that you have the chance to form memories like you did with EQ. The memories of making friends as you progress, exploring new lands that are dangerous and interesting to you.<br />
<br />
A lot of people say that what EQ gave us can never be gotten again. I think they are wrong. I think it can be gotten again and WoW will deliver that joy and that good memory when we look back at it 5 years from now if we dont bring out unhappiness to WoW. Just take the game for what it is, feedback changes you want to blizz, but dont obsess like we have here in this forum for the last year. <br />
<br />
I think if one thing i have learned from all this is that obsessing over things like we have here is not healthy and it only ruins what joy we have left in what we do. Granted im not saying to ignore all the faults and accept something thats crappy all for the point of living in ignorrant bliss, but to just not take it to the level that we did in EQ. Its fun &gt; all, not game mechanics and spell descriptions and uber gear from uber mobs. Its crushbone and blackburrow and mistmoore, its oasis and kaesora and CoM, its your epic done with your friends and its your friends you lost during leveling at 20 that you found again at 65.<br />
<br />
Bring the right things with you where ever you move on from here and be happy and leave the lead weights behind is all im saying.<br />
<br />
On that note i want to add i wish you all happiness in your upcoming games and hope you make many new friends and have many fun adventures that allow you to rise or fall back to a more fun time then what we have all delt with in regards to the new SoE and the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just... wow...  this actually brought tears to my eyes.  I've played since release and I finally cancelled billing (again).  I think it's more upsetting this time because it feels more real and permanant than any other time, so this is very touching.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's apt that my account ends on my birthday.  Who knows.  Maybe I'll be back when my friends return.  That's when the game will be fun again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">nicely made movie, I am sure I remember the mirage crew they were on torvo I think. Japanese guild. I think its interesting to see the focus of eq being a world changing to that of a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow<br />
<br />
Very well done...even if there were no trolls in it<br />
<br />
Thank you for that link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe same anonomyous n00b must not have appreciated the asshat comment and gave me an anonomyous negative bump /shrug...well your still an asshat and a lot more that I cant post here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The other one was better.<br />
I would have to agree. The previous version of the memory album movie (http://home.att.ne.jp/surf/mirage/memory_album.html) was better IMO, but I think they're both great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">According to the mirage website, the song was &quot;My Sundown&quot; by Jimmy Eat World.  <br />
<br />
No idea who wrote the instrumentals before it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the first memory album, the song was &quot;Just Watch the Fireworks&quot; by Jimmy Eat World. <br />

I just logged of EQ for the night and after watch the video again I want to log back on...LOL<br />
<br />
Warren do you have a link to the first memory album?  I'd love to see it.<br />
<br />
Edit just realized the first one had been the one I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hiya Zug,<br />
<br />
If you look a bit closely, you'll see that Felstaff included a link to the first Memory album right above my post.  I missed it on my first pass through this thread.  <br />
<br />
If the link is broken, you can go to:<br />
<br />
http://home.att.ne.jp/surf/mirage/<br />
<br />
both memory albums are linked in the left menu bar.  The real question is, does anyone know how to save flash/shockwave files as other media types?   That way people could have a permanent copy of the file d/l'ed to a harddrive when and if they decide to take those links down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Warren</div></div><hr />

Want to cry? Hell I bawled like a little baby. Wow. <br />

Here is another a friend of mine made a long time ago. Its not a &quot;flashy&quot;, and its kind of old, but its still very moving. There are actually 2 &quot;Memories&quot; vids on this guilds website:<br />

EDIT: Just a note, Pug, the author of this one, was a very very good friend of mine in EQ.</div></div><hr />

We had such a great core of wonderful people.  The vast majority have quit for a variety of reasons, but mostly because of PoP flagging frankly.</div></div><hr />
