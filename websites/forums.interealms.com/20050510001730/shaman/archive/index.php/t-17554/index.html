<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Title says it all, I am bored. Level 65 shaman all flags up to time, decent gear and 200+ aa's getting bored now, was wondering what alts and why and how much money you spent on them, have you made? I can get 120k to spend on an alt without really touching my mains gear, any responses will be great, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest that what ever alt you do, as long as your a blue server, you should do the PvP quest.  Makes Powerlvl'n harder, changes the games aspect, which I imagine is what your looking for an alt to do.  Although that puts you in solo only classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try a Bard, Mage or Necro, they have been loads of fun for me.  Or if u are looking for a melee type pally or sk.<br />
<br />
For a bard, its probably wise not to twink too much early on as you need to get a feel for what the class can and cant do (which isnt much).<br />
<br />
Just my 2c.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">eek no on pk.  Red on a blue server is not very fun.<br />

The problem with bored as a shaman is that shaman is a rounded class... All you can really do is be more specialized in your alt.<br />
<br />
What I would recommend is to try a different game for a while..</div></div><hr />

I think a druid is more rounded than a shaman.  But druids suck hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">melee is not fun without partner &amp; ubber tweak gear<br />

I like nuke . I alway though I should play a wizard, but alway give up after hit slow level; necro is also fun and easy to play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solo up a monk and do the whistling fists quest.<br />
<br />
Id have continued with my monk a bit more if i had time to get her some gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'd be too spoiled as a shaman to try another caster, most likely. Go with one of the pure melees. I love my warrior for a complete change from a caster, and I'm enjoying the challenge of trying to hold aggro for a change instead of avoiding it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You avoid agro on your shaman? Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You avoid agro on your shaman? Why?<br />
<br />
I dont go out of my way to grab agro, but if I do get it I dont usually mind for a round of three.  In a dungeon or two Ive evn been the 'tank' when grouped with many casters.  <br />
<br />
That being said, when its a raid situation or something like BoT tower boss I dont want to tank.  I want to give the agro back as fast as I can (if I was stupid enough to pull it to begin with).<br />
<br />
As to topic, I've tried many alts.  A level 40 wiz is my highest, and really the most fun for me.  However, level 40 is a terrible level to be stuck at on my server, because those level zones are empty and I dislike soloing now.<br />
<br />
Ive also started a beastlord (I know..the dark side) and its actually alot of fun.  I tried a monk, but I really really missed spells, so I tried the next best thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Every time I make an alt I end up going back to my Shaman. The only time that didn't happen within a few weeks was when I switched servers and created a Rogue. She lasted a whole 10 months before I went back to being a bear :)<br />
<br />
If I had 120k to spend on an alt I'd make another Rogue (DE of course), twink my bazaar-mule Froggy Paladin or start an Iksar Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Of all the classes, I think a necromancer offers the widest variety of interesting tactics and fun abilities. I didn't spend much cash at all to twink mine up... with a 65 shaman backing him up, he can play pretty much naked and still gain xp very rapidly. I raided my Bazaar mule for some robe caster gear one night and threw it on him.<br />
<br />
I'd level my necro up to 65 (52 now), but I just can't deal with the horror of flagging another character. It's too stressful to even think about. I'd rather camp the VT key 10 times over than reflag... at least I can do that solo.<br />
<br />
I always have fun when I play the necro, though. I don't have to worry about buffing anyone. I get to play around, chat with friends, and sometimes I even get to do some FD splitting. Not having to hit the canni key all the time is wonderful! The life of a DPS class seems so peaceful and relaxing after dealing with a night full of buffing, debuffing, rebuffing, etc.    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had fun with my Rogue for a while, he's lvl 38 now. Things might be different wilth LDON, but the idea of the OT, DL, KC express &amp; the people on it is a bit depressing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I made a rogue to group with my shaman at level 55, both are 65 now and the rogue is my main (and I pleveled him to ~51).  A lot of neat things they can do, and they can go anywhere so makes exploring the game a lot of fun and they are even more fun with a 65 shaman standing behind them at just about all times.<br />
<br />
Playing a melee and actually doing good dps is a lot of fun also, great change of pace if you get sick of buffing or whatnot, so I would recommend some form of melee class over a spellcaster.  Regardless, if your class can use a fungi tunic, get it for them above all else, especially if you are going to solo a lot.  Unfortunatley rogues arent great soloers.<br />
<br />
Ive heard beastlords are fun, certainly are powerful, but Im not really big on pets.  Shadow knights I think are supposed to be soloable and seem to be pretty strong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like BLs, but I tried a warrior, an SK, and a mage.  I also have my BU main (my origional char) a ranger.  Soloing a melee isn't all that much fun, but the mage rocked.  I had so much fun trying to split multiples with a mage and learning the class.  That said, I don't think I'm all that great a mage, gnomes in a robe don't tank for their pet all that well like shaman do ;)  Lastly I started trying to solo stuff for my mage using my shaman (to get FT items), then the game got fun again with my shaman :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I started 2 boxing when I started getting bored originally.  Thats when my shaman came to life.  Now the AA grind got boring, and the cleric came to be.  Still learning to do the 3 boxing thing.  I think a mage would probably be next for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have played nearly every class in the game to their 40s(exception is chanter and cleric. I have played a 65 chanter and a 65 cleric before though). imo, chanter is extremely fun to play, if geared well enough. I can't bring myself to level one up though.<br />
<br />
Wizards are a nice change from shaman, it's cool to see all the dmg that you can put out compared to other classes.<br />
<br />
Monks are an insanely fun class and very useful in many situations. can solo without good gear as long as they have decent weapon(s). I'd like to start my monk up again if I could bring myself to gear him up again.. right now he's 51 with zippo gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a 51 druid, my first character, and a 51 ranger.  I would play my druid until I got bored with being a caster and then I’d play my ranger.  When I got tired of pulling and melee I switched back to my druid.  For reasons not worth going into, I stopped playing both those characters and started playing a shaman.  Then I made a beast lord, now 54, and did the same as I did with my druid and ranger.  <br />
<br />
There are a lot of different classes to play and only your own likes and dislikes will ultimately decide which you like playing most.  But I would suggest a melee type over a caster.  Necromancers are a great class, but they are still casters.  If you don’t want to be completely without magic, which is why I could never play a warrior past 20th level, take a look at the ranger class.  They are a great DPS class and with the right equipment they can tank rather well, at least up to the early planes like PoN and PoI.  I regularly group with a ranger and he’s proven time and time again that he’s one of the best tanks I’ve ever grouped with.  And rangers get some very nice support spells to make life a bit more fun.  One of the reasons I didn’t get any further with my ranger is that like most melee classes, you are your equipment.  I’ve never had much money so my ranger was always poorly equipped.  But with such a large sum to tweak with, you could make one kick ass ranger. *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Doesn't matter what you try, at some point you become to realize the obvious fact: damn, it's still the same game and I still have to do the SAME STUFF over again, with a bit different spells.. But it's still the same. The boredom and pain in the butt on the way to lvl 65. And lo and behold, soon enough you're again grinding for the AA's like you just did, in the same old boring way.<br />
<br />
Want something different? Play another game. Either you'll like it, or you'll not like it and get enough boost to come back to EQ to play with what you have. But if you're already bored, then re-doing it all may very well bore the total heck out of you and kill even the last sparkle of interest you have left...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Right now, if I had to start over a non-shaman, I'd prob go with a mage.  At 65 when I get into a group with one, it's like stepping into the middle of a nuclear holocaust with the mage being the composer.  Their pets are nuts, their nukes are great...    DPS DPS DPS.  And it's sustained.  And I don't have to buff a mage much.  And they have some... different... yet cool utilities.  CoH, summoned items; great DSs, their AAs are real fun; ;)<br />
<br />
*mage enters group*<br />
&quot;Hey all, I'm here, commencing melt-down on %t&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just get the feeling that all the mages I meet just really enjoy their class right now, and hell *I* enjoy their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Its funny but most people have PL'ed to 51 ... I have the same problem ... things change after 50 and makes it so hard to PL anymore, I guess we have to take things seriously or we get others killed =)<br />
<br />
I have 2 accounts and my main is a 65 cleric .. on my other account I have a 56 warrior, 51 rogue, 51 monk, 44 chanter, 40 something SK and a 30 something ranger.  With a cleric PL any melee up to 50 is easy.  My shaman is 55 now and shares my account with the cleric, she kinda was made for everything the cleric couldn't do.  After 50 slow is so much more important than big heals but I have to say I didnt PL my shaman but rather paired her up with my monk.  In all honestly all I wanted to do was duo them in Seb and make millions of P =) .. that of course gets real boring fast and I really enjoyed playing my shaman.  Since she dinged like 50 I basically stopped playing my cleric and have focused on the shaman exclusivly.  SO for me I got board with my main and play my Shaman .. which is so much more fun.  <br />
<br />
Now here is the problem with swithing to a twink .. your going from a shaman who has little trouble finding a group to a LFG gimp unless you pick a chanter or cleric .. so keep that in mind.  I originally picked a cleric because I hated LFG and I think that if I picked a melee type who find it tougher to get a job I think I would have gotten depressed to switch back.  <br />
<br />
dugann I would really like to know how well your rogue tanks for ya or if you use the shaman as your tank .. I really like this class but after reading about all the tank issues out there and the fact that I will never duo in the planes &lt; I can't believe this is a big concern for people, I was considering a light tank rogue/monk to play with my shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyway ... its all about having fun so pick a class that interest ya .. you have 7 more spots to check out other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Playing my paladin or bard IS a whole different game.  Swarm kiting 30 mobs at a time with the bard, pulling in 1/3 of a level, and being instantly ready to start again.  No, sir, this is NOT the same ol game.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
And the pally just because it's nice to hit things reliably and very hard.  Beastlord might not be too much fun just because they're going to excel in the same places where shamans do.  Paladin has really given me a chance to mess with some undead, which the shaman has to stay clear of, solo anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bard nothing so fun as mezing 3 mobs while meleeing one down and singing aoe slow at lvl 23 while noobs look at you in awe saying how the F do you do that? i got 65 shaman but playing bard atm and omg the power!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ok yes -- Bard is a different experience -- only thing is that not everyone can really play a bard -- if your ping isnt really low and you arent prepared to hit keys like crazy to twist songs....<br />
<br />
But yes -- if you want a different experience while staying in EQ bard is it...<br />
<br />
I still think you would have more fun and perspective trying out a different game for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">People on Test hate this...<br />
<br />
But you can log onto the test server and type /testbuff and instantly have a 25 lvl character with maxed skills, all or most spells, and level appropriate no drop gear. <br />
<br />
Its a great way to test a class out, as by 25 most classes have their major functionalities.<br />
<br />
If you decide you like test, ditch your free gear asap and be ready for  a whole different world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hmm also a chanter is really kinda fun at low levels, twink to bits with hp/mana gear. Then as you progress you get some really fun spells lvl 1-16. 12 is charm. And you can basically charm solo really fast. Charm one mob to hit another when one gets low break charm and nuke it down. Btw Dark elf is best class to do this with as they can hide. Also in paladul caves there is like a amazing lvl 25 or 26 mob there which you can charm later on for amazing backstabs in group, relatively speaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Phatcow<br />
<br />
On tanking with my rogue, after 60, I preferred to group over duoing so I rarely needed either to tank unless I was doing a Kunark quest or just messing around somewhere like Howling Stones or Sebilis.  If its any mob the shaman can tank, I root tank with the shaman so I can backstab with the rogue (~1/3 damage comes from backstab).<br />
<br />
Either can tank tier 1 stuff (or LDoN/old world) just fine but tier 2+ stuff I avoid as much as possible, neither tanks all that well to make it tier 2+ stuff worthwhile, however trioing with a real tank would be more realistic.  The rogue is just way too much fun to play (the backstabs, sneaking in creepy places) though but I wouldnt count on him tanking hard hitters above 60 efficiently, plate tanks were made for that.  Not sure if I answered your question well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I enjoy developing toons.  I like the variety and learning about each classes spells, abilities, group role, and strategies.  You do learn quite a bit just by grouping with and relating with others but I think you get a better insight by actually playing the class.  And it's fun.<br />
<br />
I almost always be ma shammy but I have a ranger, paladin, wizard, enchanter, necro, and monk at various noob levels that I dink with if I feel like something different for a few hours.<br />
<br />
If you have that much money and you're experienced you should be able to get any class to the mid 20's in almost no time.  You could spend 1-5k on gear and still make a toon nicely equipped.  Once you've tried a few to the mid 20's it should be easier for YOU to decide which type of alt(s) suit you.  If you finally decide that you like one particular alt then you could blow some big plats twinking them into submission.<br />
<br />
You could do some noobie armor quests or other quests to indulge in something different, visit some noobie/lowbie areas you never fought in with your main - ie, enjoy some content that you never experienced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Avenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Rogues are a blast to play 40+. Two of my good friends both play rogues, not even twinked at 42 and 45, they regularly backstab for 250ish. I can only imagine once they are 55+ how insane its going to be. Bard is a blast, you can spend 1k on gear and he'll be pretty good till 30ish. Then spend 10k and he'll be good till mid 50's. At 35 on my bard, I can solo 10+ mobs at once, not many classes can do that. I can mez/charm/fear/snare/haste my part/dot/resistance buffs/damage shields/SELOS!(note: its almost a crime how fast I run)/ and his melee damage is decent. If you want a fun alt, go with rogue or bard, also enchanter is pretty good - its a great feeling when you save your entire group by mezzing 5+ mobs. Or as other people suggested, try a different game. <br />
<br />
As a previous shadowbane/SWG player, both are 'ok'. Shadowbane makes you respect Sony for all the work they put into EQ. Shadowbane is pretty fun for about 2 months, then its boring inless your an officer in a major guild. You can hit level 50 in about a week, or 60 in 2 weeks. Its fun to be a grief PK'er, people get sooo mad, its great. Well good luck - hope you find something you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I've got tons of alt projects, but I always go back to the shaman.  So, I've ended up with a handful of half-decently geared level 20s-40s and blown too much time on the unfinished projects.  I'd suggest you take a break or try another game for awhile.  Say no to unfinished twinks!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ranger was my first class, but only have a level 41 ranger.  For it to be fun you have to put in a lot of money and get nice haste, bow, weapons, fungi.<br />
<br />
I have a chanter going currently..nearly level 35, love the class and what its capable of.  Nothing beats mezzing something and also having it mem blurred, and pacify is the greatest ability ever :)  Not to mention charm and such.  Jboots are a MUST if you want to solo, or if you make SoW potions, but the cost on potions can be prohibitive.<br />
<br />
I tried the whole bard swarm kite..what i liked to call the long march of doom, but it got boring.  Beyond that, the constant key pressing got to me.<br />
<br />
I had a beastlord, got to level 25, and couldnt figure out where to level so was stuck and gave it up; sort of wish i had kept at it though as i really like what the class is capable of--have been thinking of starting another one, but dont know if it will happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I found myself with a bunch of spare chain-class wis-caster gear in the bank somehow (imagine that) shortly before PoP.  I was bored, so my ranger Rikkiti Kittavi was born.  I didn't want to be typical, so I made her human (which gave me a nice place to drop my old tranix crown).<br />
<br />
She got to about 20 ish, then PoP showed up and my shaman got busy for a while.  Rikki has spent a lot of time nearly forgotten, but the end of PoP saw her at 55 with full ornate (thanks sol ro tower farmage), and LDoN has been pretty good to her, she is 57 now with 4 aa and about half the flags she needs to be  elemental (I really want her to track named for me).<br />
<br />
I kind of wish I had put her on a second account now, because she really could use a shaman to duo with.  However, I am enjoying the unique abilities of rangers.  Jolt, snare, harmony, trueshot, the ability to grab agro off almost anyone and park a mob where it is needed is very similar to shaman as well.  She also has 'DoTs' for me to giggle at.<br />

I wouldn't try red on a blue server, unless you want to be a strong solo class like a necro.</div></div><hr />

If u bored with your shaman i think u should go bard or necro for same reasons has me.  After playing necro and having soo much fun with dots and insane mana regen i dont think i can play any other class other then shamans for their canni and bards who dont even NEED mana.  <br />

so i doubt after usin canni u can sit on your ass medding for 10 min after every kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">PL'ing up to 30 or 40 is nice - until you finally have enough variety in your spell lineup to actually DO something interesting.  Trying to PL past that just ends up being a lot more boring and tedious (for me) than actually playing the class at that point.  Not to mention, having gotten 5 characters over 50 at this point - no matter how well you know this game, there ARE still things to learn about playing your new class effectively that you'll need to learn through trial and error.  It's really not enough to know what spells you have and what their description is on Lucy.</div></div><hr />
