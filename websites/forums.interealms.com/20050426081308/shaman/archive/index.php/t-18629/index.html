<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kissaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, it is not the fastest Xp or greatest loots, but I have had fun hunting in a new zone...<br />
<br />
Nedaria's Landing.<br />
<br />
I hunt near the entrance and have been making great use of my charm spell.  I charm a wolf, bear, or griffon and have it go after some others.<br />
<br />
You will get on average 2 kills out of a pet before it turns on you, and if you are lucky, you can take out your former pet as well.  Of course, you may also not get a kill before you have an angry mob or two after you, such is the nature of charm.<br />
<br />
Most often I run when the charm breaks and med to full for another round.<br />
<br />
No real loot except for skins, though I have 3 HQ bear which should sell.<br />
<br />
Just an alternative for those who cant wait for their doggie.</div></div><hr />

I've been duoing here with my 32 pally/shammy combo and it's been great XP.  I am camped at the wayfarers camp and just head over and kill what cons blue or better.  There are griffawns and kitties further down that still con white/yellow at 32.   It's a great zone and I love being able to pop into BB or any other adv camp and start up an adventure at a moments notice.  The loot isn't the greatest minus the occasional pelts, but it's a good place to work up fishing too (just bring poles/bait with you as I haven't found a vendor there with them on it - you can sell to the magus however).</div></div><hr />
