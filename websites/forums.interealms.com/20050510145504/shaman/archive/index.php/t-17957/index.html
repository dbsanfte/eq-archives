<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure why SOE decided not to put the shaman class on all the pet focus items. <br />
<br />
1) We get pet upgrades every so many levels. <br />
2) We get pet Hold AA<br />
3) We get suspend Minion AA<br />
4) We get spirit call AA <br />
<br />
Obviously, we were are considered to be a pet class.. We may be the worst. But I think we should at least be added the the LDON pet focus agumentations. <br />
<br />
/Feedback Asking sony to add the &quot;Shaman&quot; class to the LDON augmentations.  There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to focus our pets.</div></div><hr />

As a shaman, you have a very defined place in a group or raid with or without your pet. Your pet is kinda like icing on the cake and almost nobody will mind one way or the other if you use it or not. They want you for heals and slows (I'm speaking from my experiences here).<br />
<br />
As a mage or necromancer (and to a lesser extent, beastlord), without a pet we count as about half a class. A mage without a pet is simply a gimp wizard.<br />
<br />
While it would be handy to get a focus item for my shaman, my mage takes much higher priority. Enchanters and SKs fall into the same category. To them a pet is simply one more tool in their lineup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id have to say that any class that actively uses a pet would be a pet class.  chanters and sk would be excluded from this in my opinion, chanters have no control over pet and sk rarely use thier pet.<br />
<br />
Based on this the only reason i could think of that we were excluded from the pet focus is because our extensive ability to buff our pet combined with the fact that our pet is intended to be weak compaired to those of mag, nec, and bst.  <br />
<br />
i have ot say i was quite disapointed when i saw we were not included onthe new pet buff aug...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it depends on your definition.  My druid friend uses his bear pet quite a bit for the hell of it.  So he has a pet and uses a pet but I certainly wouldn't consider druids a pet class.  I consider a pet class to be a class that is built around their pet and I believe that is the general consensus.  I'm sorry if you were &quot;miffed&quot; at my statement but it was not my intention.  I was just trying to explain the probable reasoning for shaman being excluded on the class list for the pet augment.  Would I like to be able to use the pet augment?  Sure, but I don't see it happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would use it if I could -- it also made me upset that they didnt consider us pet class enough to have the focus augment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've thought of Shaman as a pet class since well before Kunark.  I don't see why they weren't at least added to the LDoN-buyable augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I too am disappointed and feel we should be included.<br />
<br />
However, I am most disappointed at the number of Shaman who don't believe we are a pet class.  Let's see, we have a pet available to us early in our development.  We get multiple upgrades to the pet.  We can actively command and control our pet.  We can buff and heal our pet.  We have pet specific augmentation spells.  We have pet specific augmentation aa's.  We can give our pets weapons, and they will effect his melee ability (both dual wield and procs).  We can give our pet mage summoned items.  We use our pets to park mobs, tank while we root/rot, pet kite, Etc., etc. etc.<br />
<br />
So, how the hell are we not a pet class?<br />
<br />
Yes, your definition of a &quot;pet class&quot; may vary, however, there is no arguing that most Shaman effectively use their pets in many situations during the majority of their lifetime.  And, as such, we should be able to use any pet augmentations, whether they be mage summoned or LDoN drops.<br />

They are like a dot that keeps on ticing on each mob you pull and only (in most cases) had to cast it once. Foolish imo not to have one up almost always.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">your definition of a &quot;pet class&quot; may vary<br />
I don't consider shaman a pet class. I would say a pet class is one that is defined by their pet and it's use. At that point it becomes very clear why Mages, Necros, and Beastlords can use the item and others can't.<br />
<br />
Also, shaman don't get a pet till level 34. Compared to the other classes, that is VERY late in the cycle. (Necros at 1, Mages at 4, Beastlords at 9).<br />
<br />
And that very same focus worked on our Pet until it was nerfed after 2 years.<br />
What focus item are you refering to? Pre-luclin, focus items were class specific (Mage and Necro only). Once Luclin was released Gloves of Dark Summoning in VT focussed both Necro and Mage pets. Only with PoP and the Symbol of Ancient Summoning were beastlords added. All of these items must be equipped to focus the pet and were restricted to these 3 classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What focus item are you refering to?<br />
<br />
I'd have to guess he's referring to the mage torch/shovel/etc items.  I was never aware of a time that the focus effects worked on our pets.  The right click reclaim energy did work for us out of inventory.  I hardly consider that a nerf of a focus item, the spell is not the focus.</div></div><hr />

Awe then you are correct. To actually focus the pet, you have to equip the item while summoning. Since those items are Mage restricted, they wouldn't focus the shaman pet.<br />
<br />
Also, until recently, focus items where hard coded to the specific pets they worked on. If you look at the spell data on Lucy, you'll find the listing of focus items. http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=633&amp;source=Live<br />
Newer focus items do not have to be listed on the spell data to work (such as Symbol of Ancient Summoning and LDoN focus items).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Being a pet class or not would depend on the focus. A mainstay of the Necro and Mage and BST are through their pet. That's a large part of what those classes are. Their pets aren't tokens, but the Mainstay for them. Yes they have utility beyond the pet, but not to the degree the other classes do.<br />
<br />
Shaman, Chanter and SK pets are more tokens. Each class has a different focus. Melee for SK, Chanters with their Crowd Control, and Shaman with their buffs/debuffs. Thats where the focus of those classes lay.<br />
<br />
Even a wizard has a pet, that would follow the same definition as the shaman's pet. It's more a token, than the central idea around which the class was built.<br />
<br />
Makes no real difference to me. Have too many other things going on as a shaman, than to worry about Fido being the same level or being focus'd. I buff him up, and send him on his way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">IMHO, we are 'shaman' class...not healer class, not melee class, not pet class....we are all of those, and more, wrapped into one.  Of course I would like to see things that make us better, more powerful, whatever you want to call it....BUT we don't really need it, because we are one of the classes that are better because of HOW we play, not an item or spell we are given.  There is no other class in EQ that will let you be so effective based on pure knowledge of the class, and how to play it.<br />

<br />
I don't know if there IS a &quot;rationale&quot; explanation.  It's a cool aug, though, it would help with an otherwise weak pet.  It shouldn't tick off the &quot;pet classes&quot; who currently get it (who snicker about our pets anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The short answer is that is not correct. The long answer can be found here: http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3283 (this thread does not contain information about PoP or LDoN focus items yet).</div></div><hr />

They are all ready as jumpy as a scared cat on a tin roof about the power of BL pets, and soe includes content that cause the least amount of riots; aka warrirors revolt<br />
<br />
Having played a friends alt bstlord, our pet feels a bit like a toofless old mutt (with or without the added fleas)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">People keep referring to shaman pets as companions and not pets. <br />
<br />
They refer to our pets as &quot;companions&quot; because thats how Absor stated they (SOE) considered them.  I don't remember exactly what the issue was at the time, but he claimed we didn't have a &quot;pet&quot; we had a &quot;companion&quot; when he was responding to it.<br />
<br />
Really a stupid comment for them to make to begin with, a pet is a pet, but I can sorta see the reasoning behind leaving the other pet classes off the aug.  Our pet isnt anywhere near as important to the class as they are to nec/mage/bst, even though some of us make it a part of us.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd be happier if they put all the pet classes on the aug, I'd certainly use it at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how either the history or function of a shaman pet is going to change if shamans got this augment.  The shaman pet's function is as a long term dot.  With augment, he'll still be a long term dot, marginally more effective.<br />
<br />
It will give our toothless hound a canine or two, but he still won't be offtanking adds for more than 4 seconds.  He still won't be putting out an appreciable amount of damage.  Instead of 15-30dps (the 30 being on a_moss_snake_01 in EC), he'll do what?  16-31?  17-32?  He'll have what?  200 more hps?  <br />
<br />
This augment isn't anything more than candy--it is NOT game altering, much less game breaking.  Sure would be nice if SoE would share it around.</div></div><hr />

It won't. I was referring to the history and function of focus items.</div></div><hr />

It's hard for me to see this as a &quot;very good rationale&quot; then.  I have no idea what you are talking about unless by &quot;history&quot; you mean that shamans have never gotten a focus like this in the past so they shouldn't get it now--which I don't think is a persuasive justification.  History and tradition are always thematic arguments for maintaining the status quo--but they're always just empty rhetorical gestures.  <br />
<br />
I thought the &quot;function&quot; of focus items was to increase the efficiency or effectiveness of spells--or pets in this case.  Again, not a persuasive reason to exclude shamans from this type of focus.  The shaman's pet becomes more effective, but hardly in a game altering way.<br />

Heh.  Shaman pet as long term dot is just a descriptive analogy, although a poor one at that.  It's just meant to make the distinctions and difference between the shaman pet and mage/bst/nec pet's more clear.<br />
<br />
I don't see how what you say helps to understand why SOE doesnt' want to focus shaman pets.  I don't assume that SOE has any logical reason for doing many of the things that it does.   <br />
<br />
It's more interesting to me how people try to provide justifications for what SOE does when SOE itself doesn't do so.  <br />
<br />
I'm not even saying that shamans SHOULD get this type of focus.  I don't think we're getting screwed out of anything.  I think SOE has drawn an arbitrary distinction amoung classes that have pets without any real reason or justification.  Not that they need justification either--they make the rules and we play by them or leave.<br />
<br />
It's just a cool augment.  Wish I could get it.  Ain't losing sleep over not being able to.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind, I'm not arguing why you shouldn't get it - just offering reasonning of why you were left out. Focus items were designed originally for mages and expanded to the other Pet-centric classes.<br />

That's about the sum of it. Same reason why mages get MGB (only works with mage DS), but no SCR. A 72min ability for a 9min buff - yeah that's usefull.</div></div><hr />
