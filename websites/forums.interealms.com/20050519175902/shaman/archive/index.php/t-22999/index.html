<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I harbor no illusions that even one of these will get implemented. So without further ado:<br />
<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
1) Fix Guk targetting. There is nothing more frustrating than the inability to click on MOBs to target.  This is semi-componded on multi-pulls and semi-solved with the cycle ability.  But there are times you want to click on a distant MOB to root it and simply can't.<br />
<br />
2) Implement two new 6-man levels of play.  One is in between the current &quot;normal&quot; (MOBs hit for 388 to 392) and &quot;hard&quot; (MOBs hit for 988 to 992).<br />
<br />
The second is harder than hard where MOBs hit for 1288 or so.(*)<br />
<br />
3) Change the points. It's fine to keep 51 points for a baseline reward. Heck, I've been in groups where it took 89 minutes to win. But <br />
<br />
105/51 is 2.1<br />
<br />
However, 988 / 388 is 2.5<br />
<br />
The reward for a now &quot;hard&quot; should be closer to 129 points, not 105.<br />
<br />
This would mean that the new &quot;medium&quot; (688 hitters) would be worth 78 points for a succesful run, and the new &quot;hards&quot; would be worth 170 points or so.<br />
<br />
4) Implement a new line of armor and augs.  Where is the MP 4 aug? (for example) Implement a line of armor costing 2100 or so per piece.  Scale it so the base armor is at EP levels.<br />
<br />
5) Change the final reward (Wayfarers Brotherhood Emblem) so that it can be equipped in ANY slot and not just the Charm.  Currently the WBE replaces the Adventurers charm for a whopping net gain of ZERO.<br />
<br />
100 hit points isn't going to break any &quot;down the road&quot; encounters and is a nice &quot;atta boy&quot; for those who complete 366 (MINIMUM) adventures.<br />
<br />
6) Fix Raids.  No I haven't been on one, but neither have I gotten married to a needle-sharing, cross-dressing Haitian prostitute with AIDS.  There are some things that go without saying.<br />
<br />
(*) Note you will have to change pathing and other things or the LDON model. Trial 6 doesn't require you to face up to 4 MOBs at one time, why should an enclosed LDON.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks to the issues in Guk I discovered the cycle target button.  I now use it on every ldon.  You need to be careful though because I have pulled a full room plus scrolling though cycle target not paying attention to who was in the room and who was just past it with friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You forgot to add:<br />
<br />
7) Remove that &quot;resting period&quot; between LDoNs.  This is a penalty for groups that complete adventures &quot;too&quot; quickly.<br />
<br />
8)  Select adventure types.  Allow us to have option to choose only slaughter or collect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fin - duly noted.  And a big 10-4. Nothing like sitting for 9 minutes attempting to get a collect or slaughter.<br />
<br />
Which brings up:<br />
<br />
9) Fix Rescue and Assasinate.  Nobody does those. (That I know of).  See example of Hatian, drug-using, needle-sharing, transvestite for reason why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pick lists. Big time.<br />
<br />
Arching storylines for better AP gain or rewards. Do a collect and find out about a rescue. Do the rescue get a bonus and find out about a slaughter Do the slaughter and find out about the boss that wants you dead. Kill him first and get big bonus and item. <br />
<br />
The loots you get in the runs should be turned in for AP rewards. Make staying after the win to see what named are up worth something. <br />
<br />
Fix the damn chests. There should a reason to open them EVERYtime. <br />
<br />
AP reward bonuses for killing named.  Larger bonuses or garunteed reward of some type for Assinate missions and rescues. <br />
<br />
Make the no drop Loots from collects worth an AP point or two. So people care about looting. <br />
<br />
Slaughters should give bonuses for how fast you complete them. I mean you are on a rampage. It should feel like it. (Also would be a reward for the DPS gods. Maybe a point for every minute faster than 45 minutes or something. Not huge but something. <br />
<br />
Rescues should lead to quests. For bonus AP items or both. See arcing storylines. Some of these quests should requre All sorts of weird stuff with clues as to where to get them.<br />
<br />
Edit <br />
<br />
Adding something here. Make the arching storylines based upon an item like a note. Hand the note to A specific Camps adventure getter and get tailored adventure type. (x number of bosses up Assinates and such) That way they can be spread out some and feel like a true adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas rehased over and over again. They are not listening however.. (Sigh)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some good ideas here and some that could reinvigorate enthusiasm for LDoN again.  As a very gimp level 65, its difficult to find people my level willing to do Normal LDoNs and I sure as hell dont have the HPs to survive a hard.  Perhaps the intermediate difficulty between Normal and Hard (as well as corresponding increase to mob xps) might revive that and get more out of BoT.<br />
<br />
For me, there is a MAJOR content gap between what I can and can't accomplish due to my gear.  I can usually find a camp group in BoT and hope for a lucky roll but mind numbingly camp-pulling or I can sit and go LFG for an hour or so trying to find a level 65 group in LDoN.<br />
<br />
People like grinding AAs out in BoT and might be willing to grind out in LDoN if the xps was comparable.<br />

I hope you are saying that the coin went away about the time that they implemented DX9 and not that its DX9's fault for having no coin drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also, I have been on adventures where I could open the chest , but because some mob was &quot;aware of my presence&quot; I could not loot it and neither could my mates.

<br />
Its stupid and annoying like hell, that mobs can't be targetted because some little anthill or other trash ON THE FLOOR is in the way.<br />
<br />
I can see most of the mob -&gt; i should be able to cast on the mob.<br />
<br />
If devs are too incompetent to solve that issue, it would be a good idea to stop creating zones with that type of design at all :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
Chests:<br />
Lower the stupidly high gem costs for disarm gems (only the caster has to pay it normally or you go begging group for reimbursement) or at the very least do not use reagents on failed attempts. What genius came up with that?<br />
<br />
Oh and the recast time on object spells is another nice touch, thanks for wasting my and the groups time  :mad: .<br />
<br />
But as others have said, LDoN is old stuff meanwhile and chances are slim to non existant, that anything is done about those valid points.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to make us suffer with Assasin and REscues and no drop down menu, then at least have the assasin mob have the drop table of a named in the adv, and as a &quot;reward&quot; for rescuing the named in a rescue, have him reward a named drop as well...it would certainly make those 2 types of adventures more attractive and would make me cringe less when I go to get an adv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Looks like they &quot;fixed LDoN&quot; again.  I noticed even less xp from a slaughter 60... less than what it was for a slaughter 53 before the patch.<br />

And we'll hear the same story that the &quot;ZEM&quot; hasn't changed, or something to that extent.<br />

OMG this threads been up a day so far and no ones hijacked it or laughed at this suggestion :) (jk)<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though LDoN is now 2 or 3 (?) expansions old and you know what Sony thinks of updating old expansions.<br />
Youre **** out of luck is their answer (they use nice phrases though).<br />
I think in a way LDoN saved SoE's butt bigtime as in it kept the casuals in the game when i think a lot of them had just about had enough of SoE's poor CS etc.<br />
<br />
Rescues....<br />
Never do them any more as the few times ive done them about 50% of the time we'd get the rescuee back to the start zone and for the life of us couldnt get her (is it always a her ?) to hit the trigger spot despite running her around the whole zone room.<br />
Also the amount of times she wouldnt move because some nasty beasty was looking at her funny even though it was in the room next door which because of the layout of the dungeon was in fact right at the other end of the dungeon.<br />
This may have all changed now and i could be missing out.<br />
<br />
Layouts.<br />
I seriously think the dungeon layouts were designed by Steven Hawkins using Etch-a-Sketch.<br />
They are unbelievably banal did any thought actually go into them ?.<br />
Theyre just square boxes with a few squiggly bits in joined by the odd straight corridor.<br />
Theres 1 zone in EC i think it is where youve got a room with a waterfall and a bridge etc in it thats a quite nicely designed zone (well for LDoN it is) did they sack the designer of this zone for being too imaginative then get in the team of monkeys to do the other zones ?.<br />
<br />
Mobs.<br />
What the **** happened to mob placement in here ?.<br />
Its just mobs standing around doesnt seem to be any thought put into where they are,what theyre doing etc.<br />
You open a door theres 6 or 7 mobs in that room you clear that room open another door and theres 1 mob in there.You clear that room you open a door and theres a corridor with 4 or 5 mobs virtually standing on top of each other.<br />
In some BB zones youve got some  undead mobs laying in coffins.That was imaginative but once again they used this 1 bit of imagination then gave up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN could have been the best expansion ever.I remember reading posts on here of people dreaming of Seb style dungeons etc.<br />
What did we get ?<br />
Dreadlands indoors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and as for loot i read somewhere that apparently LDoN was bringing 150k pp per hour into the economy which is why it was nerfed.<br />
But typical SoE they bring out the nerf bat and hit you with it not once but several million times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The zone design is what bothers me the most.<br />
<br />
But, again, that is the case with most of the new EQ zones.<br />
<br />
If you want to see what im talking about i recommend you visit, some places in Kunark like:<br />
<br />
The Cliff in Emerald Jungle<br />
The Trakanons Teeth aqueduct<br />
The bridge in Warslicks Woods<br />
The pit in Field of Bone<br />
<br />
These are all prime examples of unique compelling locations that adds to the feel of the zone, not take away from it.<br />
<br />
We want unique stuff. Not cut and paste zones like most LDON ones.</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough ive always hated the design of FoB especially the pit but yep gotta agree 100% with you on the others.<br />
<br />
When you think of the technology etc available to EQ designers now compared to when RoK and SoV came out there is no reason for poor design apart from lack of imagination or laziness.<br />
<br />
Take GD or Eastern  Wastes as examples theyre just a big zone full of snow but somehow because of the thought that went into them they just look &quot;right&quot; (best word i can think of to describe them).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the fix I would like to see the most is make a way avalable to you to summon your corpse out of the adventure when your done. Nothing worst then having to wait an extra 30 minutes..  or even longer if everyone else is done for a stinkin rez.<br />
Sadly because of this I don't do ldon's anymore unless I have a pally or cleric in my group.</div></div><hr />
