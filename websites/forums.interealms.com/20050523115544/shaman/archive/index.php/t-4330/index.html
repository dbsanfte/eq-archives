<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We know Seb and HS, anyone tested others?<br />
<br />
ToFS? <br />
<br />
Ssra AL/Creater keys?<br />
<br />
ST, VP, VT?<br />
<br />
SS zone out to CS?<br />
<br />
Not home yet to test ST, ToFS so thought I would see if anyone has done so, so far today!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ST key did. that's the only one I got to test so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shissar ring to get to emp shows up too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Info on how to use the keyring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When it works properly:<br />
<br />
Use key to enter zone (or if it works with ToFS keys, portions of zones), get message &quot;key added to keyring&quot;.<br />
<br />
Destroy key.<br />
<br />
Enter zone (or portion of zone) at will by clicking on door whenever you want later on.<br />
<br />
That is, when it works. It isn't now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont destroy any keys. Keep em in the bank for now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shrine key works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I have seen and played with so far, the only keys that go on the ring are soulbound keys. However if the Emp &quot;key&quot; goes on the ring this would blow that theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TOFS keys went on the keyring as of the day after the patch.  But it seemed buggy to me--clicked through the first mirror with the first key and got a message that Key 5 had been added, and after that, I didn't have to be holding a key on my cursor to enter floors 3 and 4. A friend in the zone at the time had the same experience.  Needless to say, I decided not to destroy my keys just yet...<br />
--Abani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lithas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SS key also added to key ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Scepter of Shadows goes on the keyring, its the VT key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by taraddar <br />
Shissar ring to get to emp shows up too =) <br />
<br />
Heh... very doubtful that I will be destroying that key. It's too useful to me right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If ST key goes on ring, wouldn't you be able to then turn in your ST key and Scale and still be able to get into ST?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I turned in a Prismatic Scale on patch day.<br />
<br />
Got one of the items and another ST key for my efforts. I now have 2 ST keys in the bank, ST key on my keyring, and afraid to delete either key because of a messup.<br />
<br />
Instead of reducing inventory slot use, I just had one more taken up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">how do you see your keyring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After you've used your key once (for example, used your OS key to enter OS) you will get a message that the key has been added to your key ring.<br />
<br />
Type /key to see the keys on your key ring.  (they will appear after you have used them once normally to enter a zone)<br />
<br />
Confirmed - VP key added</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ahhh no wonder /key didn't work, I hadn't used a key yet. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hear there's a new npc outside ST now that takes prismatic scales and gives the same rewards as Melalafen, but does not require a key. Guess that solves the ST key problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can also confirm the ST quest guy gives essence prizes with only the scale turn in, not key.<br />
<br />
/hug essence lens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zazuzh's Key goes on Key Ring, as well as Emporer Key, both confirmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I turned my Essence Lens into the Gnome in EW last night. Got me a new ST key and eventually got my Essence Lens back from him, too. I was a bit worried at first, because he gave me the Essence Mace when I gave him my Lens. I wasn't sure if the rewards cycle through, but they do. Had to go through all the rewards and finally got my Lens back, and a ST key to boot. I was worried I'd have to get a brand new spanking ST key off a dragon again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey Jing, did you ever get Quickbuff 2?  What's the torpor cast time with QB2 + SH3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Confirmed , VP Key goes on the key ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ST key must be in hand to zone into ST as of last night.  One of our monks had banked his and had to go back and get it.  I also tried to click on it while my key was in inventory, no dice.  Had to actually click key on &quot;door&quot; to get into ST as of 8-21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">FYI The key to the Hole does not show up on key ring. I bought one in Paniel just so it would be on my key ring and it doesnt show up. Probably because its not a sould bound key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No, because it isn't a &quot;teleport&quot; key, it just moves the rock out of  the way.<br />
<br />
PoA island hopping keys confirmed to not add to the keyring, BTW.</div></div><hr />
