<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talanie Glacierwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there both Attack of Grummus, and Cloud of Grummus?  EQ Casters Realm says Attack of Grummus, but I bought and scribed Cloud of Grummus.  Cloud of Grummus is not an area effect, I know that much for sure, and it is a slow spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Baelish, the British chap that runs EQ.castersrealm just posted that he's been lagging in updating PoP spell info (among other updated info) and that hes working on a revamp of his EQ site.  I've emailed and posted on his site about the name change to this spell a few weeks ago and i'm sure he'll be changing the info soon, in addition to a bunch of other changes to the lists.   What he does for the EQ community rocks and I appreciate his hard work and am glad to hear hes gunna work on it rather than closing down the site.  Updates coming soon!</div></div><hr />
