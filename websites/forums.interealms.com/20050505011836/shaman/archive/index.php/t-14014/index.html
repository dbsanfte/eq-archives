<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HarpuaKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail and well met fellow shamans!  I am Harpua Bloodmoon of the Kane Bayle server and would be pleaseed if you could answer a question or two.  First, a little info on what I plan on doing.<br />
<br />

<br />
I plan on leaving the last three slots open for potions, and here's my question.  What potions do you think would be best suited for a Nagafen encounter?  I'm thinking Kilva's Skin of Flame and Stinging Wort for two.  Maybe the +25MR +25 DEX potion?  What do you guys think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off, forget slowing Nagafen. You have about a 1% chance of landing a slow on him, maybe even worse.<br />
<br />
You seem covered on healing, so go offensive. Was ages since I was of that level so I've forgotten how dots/nukes land on him. Someone else will fill you in on that surely.<br />
<br />
As for buffs, use both +25mr and +25fr. Your bufflist seems pretty ok, but I would throw in more fodder buffs. Enduring breath, resist disease, group charisma etc. Most important part is having hp buffs, fr, mr and haste for melees in buff slots 10+. <br />
<br />
Make sure everyone has at least one instacast item. Spyglass is cheap and should do the trick. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'll forget about slowing, maybe DoT him.  As for the fodder buffs, only the first three buffs will be dispelled so three should suffice.  (Unless I'm not understanding correctly how the dispell works.  Is that why you mentioned moving HP and resists to slots 10+?.)<br />
<br />
I will substitue Brell's for Quickness.  I would opt for high level chanter haste, but we're buffing up in PoK and hauling butt to SolB where our 61mnk and 61clr will be clearing the way.  We'll pull the FGs immediately and Rokyl and then move onto Naggy.<br />
<br />
I changed it from one group to possible two groups due to the fact I may need more healers and I have friends who already RSVPed whom I can't leave hanging.  With two groups, we'll head back to PoK, rebuff, and then drop Vox.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply and all of the help Asta!<br />

Junk buffs before HP buffs and he's dead. With all those highlevel buffs you shouldn't even bother with any potions except Kilva's for some unresistable damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if you understand about the dispell.  Its not a one time cast dispell.  Dragons dispell EVERY cast of their AE, with a single group he will get off more than enough AE's to wipe out all your buffs if you don't have at least one form of instant click buff.  You used to be able to use bard songs to counter the dispells by having the bard song in the first buff slot, it would get dispelled then take hold again next pulse, but you can't do that anymore with the new songs buff window.   I would recommend people get Gobbie Earrings, Telescopes, or something of that nature.<br />
<br />
For the melee:<br />
<br />
01-Instant Click Item<br />

15-FR Potion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This comin from a guy that never been on a successful naggy raid, but i think i would substitue a cleric for a rogue perhaps if all possible. Just something that can add a little dps and as far as potions aint there some decent FR potions out now? that should help with the ae i would think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah too many clerics imho.  Drop 2 add a rogue and a wiz.  As shaman focus on backup healing and nuke if you have xtra mana.  One group kills are definately possible if you have decent resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For all intensive purposes these dragons are practically 100% MR to a shaman at level 52.  Don't tell my guild but I did a little experimenting on our first Naggy encounter.  I had a Rod of Malaisement insta click and Naggy resisted all 7 charges.  I cast insidious decay and tried to land Plague - resist.  Not to be stopped I tried EB.  That of course ended with a resist and a shaman tanking.  Against Vox I wanted to try to get the killing blow. My poison nuke hit for a whole 4 points of damage.  I don't recommend any of the above to a shaman on his/her first Naggy raid.  I am just thick headed and did not believe how completely resistant these old world dragons are to a level 52 shaman.  These dragons are not Lodi!!!!<br />
<br />
The key to both dragons is resists.  Their meele is pathetic.  I believe Naggy doubled me for 173-175 dmg max. On Naggy if you pull to the gate you can hide a cleric right around the corner out of range of the AOE.  <br />
<br />
I agree with some of the above posters add DPS.  Two clerics and a patch healer(shaman or druid) should be more than adequate if your MT has sufficient resists and HP buffs.  Remember their AOE's are directional.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont know if its here or on the ranger board but there was a discussion about a single grp of 52's doing naggy/vox.  Basically after doing them 20+ times, they have it down to being able kill them w/ a grp of 4 clerics, a bard, and warrior.  Initially they had lvl65 buffs, but they can do them w/' self buffs now.  Its just a matter of positioning of the clerics outside the AoE and having a proper CHeal rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail harpua, you are forgiven for killing jimmy's cat, for he was a troublesome beast and more problematic then most felines and as such not really suited for jimmy, though he loved him dearly.<br />
<br />
You will be happy to know that jimmy has a puppy of his own now that he is training with much love and attention. I am confident in time he will learn to be strong and protectful and posses understanding,loyalty,strength and wisdom. He will be a good dog for jimmy.<br />
<br />
I ak of you to bring my greetings to the shinny music from overhead for we travel there as we speak, jimmy and I, and our journey i think is nearing its end. Well, atleast this part of the journey ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sirenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">member you gotta be in melle range to land a spell on ole naggy<br />
also from the 9 naggy raids ive been on, never once been to vox(<br />
poison dots never ever land same with slow<br />
<br />
but about 80pct of the disease dots i tossed at him landed<br />
but if i were you id just focus on healing for a shammy or tossing ice nukes(just remember you will be in melle range[dont get agro or u dead] and that means very much in fear and aoe range so buff your hp as much as possible<br />

Perhaps our paths will meet.<br />

<br />
PS, I think Jaradis summed it up real well.<br />
<br />
As for the cleric issue, I'm going to need all of them for a seccessful CH Rotation.  I'm going to do my best to keep them out of AoE range, which should be the bridge given Naggy is on the back wall.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help all :)</div></div><hr />

Remember to Read-Icculus everyday and welcome to the cruciable btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BTW...I never did get to kill Vox before...however I can say that after mass attemping to slow Naggy, I'm 99% positive that when he was standing over me, I got him slowed.  Then again, that was in the day and age when I didn't know how to turn off others attacks and didn't have more than one message window, but I'm pretty sure that I casted, then it hit him.  Was ugly and we ended up the fight with only me and like four others surviving out of 50+...but we got him.</div></div><hr />
