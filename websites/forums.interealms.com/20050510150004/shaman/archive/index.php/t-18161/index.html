<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorfdoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have recently attained Lvl 30 and i am fed up of HHK, I have gone over to DSP to continue my lvling, alas it seems there are never any groups. I have a limited amount of game time so waiting for groups is not really an option (Even though i think it is probably best to group at this lvl). <br />
<br />
I am aware of the shroom house on the South side near GE, and its relative safety to pull too (Between GE and Shroom House).<br />
<br />
My question is can i solo at lvl 30 pre pet lvl (34) ?<br />
<br />
If so please can some of the wiser Shaman please advise on soloing tactics ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help offered is appreciated<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

You can root and rot. But at that level I remember pulling with slow<br />
and just picking away at them with my sticker. Really helps keeping<br />
your melee skills up. I always make sure that im hasted and fully<br />
buffed.<br />
<br />
Also, I went to LoY for a lot of my 30-50 levels. The beach there is <br />
great xp and almost all single pullable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi there.<br />
<br />
Could be tough at 30 unless you have very nice gear. I remember them shrooms hitting hard and roots breaking almost instantly at your level. I did solo there and zelniaks at 34 with pet and was great fun and exp.<br />
I think at 34 there was a decent exp hit for handing the drops ( deadly mushrooms ??) to the guys in the camp to the right of zone in. Good luck mate remember you can only die trying  :D<br />
<br />
Edit - Tactics - get buffed and tank em down. Pull with slow and stick em with any other spells you have  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, get em slowed and tank em down, this only applies if you have decent HP/AC.<br />
<br />
If you are taking too much damage doing that, then it's Root/Rot time.  Try and find mobs with very low MR if you are doing this, as root will last a lot longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
go to the needite cave in Echo.<br />
<br />
the needites hit for very low damage and are spaced out enough to just use the slow on them and then tank the face. vendor and bank is right inside the zone. you can probably take on the queen as well if you can get her alone. she drops usually a back item or a dagger as her rare which sells for 19pp to the npc vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I remember correctly I killed the gnolls outside of Splitpaw. Root and rot or just ran in circles with sow and rotted. I also would watch for /ooc for grps in Splitpaw or zone in off and on to see if there was one. If the group isn't full you'll always be able to join.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are having a problem with mobs hitting to hard, go back an expansion or 3.  Mobs in Kunark (OT, Swamp ofno hope, FV) don't hit nearly as hard as mobs in DSP, and the exp is comperable.  Mobs in Velious (IC at 30ish) hit harder, but not much.<br />
<br />
I would aslo second LoY zones, but be warned that mobs there have alot of HP for their levels.  You might do well to use a combination of Root/rot to 50% and them melee them the rest of the way.  The undead there dont run, but others will which can cause nasty trains.  Stay away from diseased drogmors, as I seem to remember their HP regen being insanely high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorfdoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have asked a question in the spell section of the forum about charming a pet.<br />
<br />
Would this be helpful in soloing i.e Zel in DSP, ( Don't know lvl limit of mob for spell have asked in spell section)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree with Thorzion<br />
<br />
I soloed almost exclusively to where I am now.  I did Swamp of No Hope to about 32 or 33, then moved to Overthere.<br />
<br />
Luclin mobs hit stupid hard and have insane hps for their level, and unless you're working tradeskills, the loot isn't so spiffy, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I forget when this stopped being a good tactic, but back when root was too expensive to cast, I just used flash of light as a ghetto fear while the mob was dotted up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Raise your 2hb skill and buy a &quot;blight, hammer of the scourge&quot;.  It procs Scourge, a level 34 DoT at level 30.  Pull with slow and melee away.  I also had a Staff of Living Sand that procs a DoT at level 20 and I would interchange them once the first one proc'd.  At level 30, I was soloing the Gnolls in South Karana at the spires and at 34 I did the Tizmaks in GD until 38 when I went to the Gunthak Beach.  By level 40, have a soulstripper and continue in Gunthak until 43.  Then go to Dulaks and start camping for your 44th spell Stoicism and the xp will still keep on coming in.  At 44, do the elementals in Nadox for the best solo xp in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you can Charm Mammy's in EF and kill mammy's for good loot and exp at 30, not the greatest exp but the loot is hard to beat at that lvl for a soloable mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would definately try one of the spires at Splitpaw at least.  I solo'd there pre-34.  OT could be good as well.  IIRC a ranger guildie of mine also did crazed goblins in Butcherblock at 30, but this may have been made possible by harmony.  You could also try charming a small zelniak in DSP and soloing there by tanking another small zel.  If charm breaks you'd probably have to zone tho.  I solo'd with my pet from 34-39 on zels in DSP inbetween guild groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree that the spires outside of paw will be a good place for you to hunt.  You can get an early start on collecting some Gnoll Hide Lariat's and Dagger's of Dropping to use at level 34 for your pet to...ummm...chew on, yeah, that's it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IIRC a ranger guildie of mine also did crazed goblins in Butcherblock at 30, but this may have been made possible by harmony.<br />
<br />
The three goblins are far enough apart that single pulling is very very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The three goblins are far enough apart that single pulling is very very easy.<br />
Aye very soloable at level 30 even with average or poor gear; I leveled on these and made tons of cash back in the day that the Ghoulbane was droppable (thats a while back in case you are wondering). You can single them easily and tank them to get your weapon skills/defense up quite easily.<br />
There are a few problems there, the main being that they are a very long spawn time like 15 min or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No mention of Sol A yet? Solo you need to be careful working your way through the dungeon. Have root up and keep your magic/fire/cold/poison/disease buffs up. Lot of casters but easy kills at 30 and good to 36 or so. Downside is the potential trains when a gobbie gets loose and runs away.<br />
<br />
Hella-fun once you get the tactics down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At those levels I would pull with slow (even though it doesn't do too much), put autoattack on, throw a DoT on or two, root, back up and regain hp/mana. When root breaks, melee for a bit, then root and rot it away until death.<br />
<br />
With that method, the idea is not to lose too much HP or mana. At 34 it gets so much easier. I normally ended up between 70 and 90 hp and mana after fights. Not too bad when you can always cani back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hunt at the zone line in lower guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is still a ton of dark blues in Lake of Ill Omen at 30, you can pull singles all day inside the Saranak Fort. If you have REALLY good gear, you can try FM, although it can get rough with some of the gobbie casters in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You can charm/befriend/whatever animals at that level.  It's often risky but when it works you have a pet for a while.  Find somewhere with space so you have room to run and recharm when necessary.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer to group and started doing LDoN runs at 30ish - I enjoyed making a level every 2-3 adventures.  On Xev DSP is usually rocking with several groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stepping</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">OT for me as you can get a ton of whips since the zone is mostly deserted now and turn them in for xp.. every lil bit help<br />
