<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which shaman stands out the most to you since you've been playing the game as &quot;the shaman&quot; as far as knowledge of the game and overall knowledge of the shaman class. To me when I think back I'd have to say Ceno from Fires of Heaven was what a shaman was all about. He had tons of game and class knowledge and seemed to be a good guy as far as helping out with the shaman class. So who would you pick as &quot;the shaman&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its hard to pick just one.  Ive known a lot of shaman from my server, and had contact with quite a few more on this board.  <br />
<br />
From this board, Id agree with your assesment of Ceno as one of the pillars of shamanism.<br />
<br />
On my server, for me its a toss up between Fletchera Debuffinmuffin(EiE) and Zirithi (RoS).  Both are paragons of all things shaman to me (even if they both are Vah Shir :(  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On these boards, I think Nixx was the standard bearer.  Nixx was almost always right, and he blazed the trail time and again on what was possible.  <br />
<br />
Guys like D'artanian, Jing and Ceno also came up big in different ways.  Chukzombie was pretty good too, even if I disagreed with some stuff.  <br />
<br />
On my server, I always thought Naghite was the best shaman I saw in action.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is no way you can pick any single Shaman as personifying the class in game. That's a silly concept.<br />

Too many different types of play styles and too many guild types.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as in-game shamans, on The Rathe server my personal vote would have to go for Thunderump and Zarfian. Not only did they play the class as well as anyone I have seen but left a wake of talented shaman behind them who they taught to play correctly and imparted knowledge to all the younger shamans to help them become something more than just a &quot;bot&quot;. <br />
<br />
On these boards, my measuring stick for knowledge and insight would have to go to Jinheim (who appears to have hung up his spear for good) who had an abundance of knowledge and tactics like few I have seen and shared it at every opportunity. Speaking of soloing Yeldema, it was his ideas posted here http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13226&amp;highlight=soloing+dragons that got me through my first solo effort way back in the day. You are well missed Jinheim. A tip of the hat to you wherever you may be.<br />

His exploits on Test, not just Yeldema, but the Crypt in Sebilis and other Kunark/Velious stuff, stuck it right to all the original naysayers proclaiming the end of the shaman class.<br />

Heck, when I started to play the shaman, in beta phase 2, there were only handful of shamans around, and at first it didn't seem that popular class. Guess the limited weapon skills and armor skills didn't seem that appealing to most... What actually made the shaman more popular was the &quot;discovery&quot; of SoW spell and Levitation, those 2 spells were a miracle, sort of, heh. After that, many more shamans appeared in the beta. Back then SoW even worked in dungeons, in indoor areas.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I had no &quot;shaman rolemodel&quot; myself, I learned the class from the beginning, on my own.</div></div><hr />

Although I am willing to bet not one reader will know this shaman ... Grixdalf was one of the smartest shaman players on innuruuk, and Tumal was pretty good too.  Those two in addition to Gart on inny.  On these boards, I always felt Landragoran (spelt wrong but I'm not looking it up now) also usually gave very good advice/opinions.  Grizlor is a bit outspoken, but he's got balls and that's how a shaman should be played too (imho).</div></div><hr />

I have/did always enjoy conversations with Jenamdar, Collectra and Aruman who were/are some of the top geared shaman of their time.<br />
<br />
I'm more of the conversationalist though, i don't really care who you are, if I have a second to talk, then I tend to open my mouth.  A lot of the reason that to this day I still talk a bunch in the shaman serverwide channel (as well as try to help out all of the younger shaman in there learn the ways of the shaman) and never to put down someone even when they come up with the most absurb stuff.</div></div><hr />

Looking at his answers and actions he must be the only one understanding the shaman class and how it interacts with the world while we are all wrong and ignorant.<br />

<br />
No matter what you or anyone else says you are a &quot;new-age&quot;-shaman. Its fine that you want to help new shamans now but you werent here 3-5 years ago when this game was new and still interesting. Probably 90% of the beginning shamans - or any other class for that matter - are probably not real newbs.<br />
<br />
And look at some of the uber-shamans you enjoyed talking too like Ceno and Jenamdar - they arent here any longer. EQ is loosing both the very highend players and the causual players. This is not really your fault. And it might not even be in your interest that they should still be here if you are in one of those close-to-the-top guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I can only think of 1 person that is like how i would expect a true shaman to be. Im not talking about a class hero for the game of EQ, im talking for real.<br />
<br />
Gloriana after a while really earned my respect. I now see her as a wise elder of the tribe. She is how i would expect how a real shaman would be.<br />
<br />
Me ... i still view myself as the shaman that is still in the learning phase. Im still eating peyote buds and smoking funny grasses to see how they effect the human body. Not that im doing that though lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously incase i dont get a chance to say it again. Thank you for being who you are gloriana, i wish i would have seen you clearer sooner, it would have been nice to actualy know you.  You are a under appreciated source of inspiration here that moves in ways i think people miss or forget. But such is the fate of the truly wise and helpful.</div></div><hr />

He was the first shaman I ever saw say &quot;HP &gt; AC &gt; Wis&quot;.  It seems obvious today but was pretty radical; we were stuck in AC vs. Wis threads back then.<br />
<br />
His soloing of Yeldema was legendary.  Another great thread was going into Siren's Grotto when 90% of us had no idea how to even get there and parsing his dog against an ulthork.  THAT showed the power of torpor.<br />

anyways  its hard to say who is the most &quot;legendary&quot;  cause all our opinions are diffrent.  if it was anyone it would be either ceno or the blades of wrath shaman crew (warguren, jenen, corath) they pretty much taught me how to play my shaman</div></div><hr />

As to the shaman from Cazic, it'd have to be Alysheba, Smokejaguar, and Thrynne for sure.  Never seen any better than them, even if they are all retired now.</div></div><hr />

Gikk was cool.  He moved to Maelin when it opened and was an officer in my guild (Hammer of Retribution).  He was kinda my superior for a while, helped me and showed me around a bit before I really knew much about raiding, then decided to quit playing when he got sick of the bull**** of being an officer.  His character I still see runnin around sometimes, but not sure who is playing it now.  I know it's not him.</div></div><hr />
