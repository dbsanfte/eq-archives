<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Selan Stormmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As an avid reader, and sometimes participater in the crucibal, the one current issue I don't see much talk about are horses and what a HUGE benifit they are to shaman.<br />
<br />
I can say without hesitation that I thought horses a waste and clearly a &quot;show and tell item,&quot; for the rich peeps in our little world.<br />
<br />
Boy was I wrong...the concept of no sit aggro, allows shaman not only to get the extra mana you recieve while sitting, but we can swap out spells. I can honestly say that all shaman who can afford the cheapest horse, should buy it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Obviously horses can only be used in outside zones, and the cheapest horses are not very fast ( I have a chain horse myself), but for an example...once I have KEI, and I self buff myself, I can kill nearly non stop in zones like Madiens Eye, with nearly ZERO downtime....<br />
<br />
I hope everyone reaps the benifits I have...<br />

I am pretty sure he was ready for the glue factory when I bought him.  I didn't think it would make that much difference when I got him, but man it's nice!  Horsey is my outdoor only, ghetto flowing thought now.<br />
