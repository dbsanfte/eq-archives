<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few questions about the last two battles for the Shaman epic.<br />
<br />
1) How hard is the Neh Ashir fight?  What would be minimum needs in terms of groups and / or group members to win this fight?<br />
<br />
2) What is the respawn time on Neh Ashir?<br />
<br />
3) What is the respawn time on Rak Ashir?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give.  My guild has two shaman, myself included, that are ready for these last two fights.  We already have our tears and would like to finish both epics during the same CoM raid.</div></div><hr />

The trick to the reaver fights is the fact that multiple reavers may spawn, over and over again.  All the basic reaver fights are the same.  They are completely MR and cast blind.  They hit very hard.  Reavers are primarly a tank fight, make sure you have sufficient healing power and well managed mana (what if you get 9 reavers?)  So, you pull Neh's reaver.  Kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver spawns instantly in its place, kill it, another reaver...I've heard of 12 spawning, but I've only seen 7 as a max.<br />
<br />
Neh isn't that tough at all.  She is very MR and is mostly a tank fight like a reaver. Rak, of course, is a whole different ball game and really needs level 49 page pets (immune to his fire AOE) to get the job done safely.<br />
<br />
Remember, both Lords (Neh and Rak) can gate when low on health, they gate back to their spawn point (ie where their reaver died and they appeared).  This gives us a great deal of power, since WE decide the spawn point. Utilize this to your advantage.<br />
<br />
There was a time when MULTIPLE Lords could be spawned (ie, a raid group came in, farmed some reavers for Jade Reavers and left the Lords spawned (only Ghiosk spawns aggro).  Previously, if Rak was spawned and his reaver was also up, you could pop him again.  This no longer works.  If Rak is up and his reaver is up, killing Rak's reaver will not spawn another Rak. (or Neh)<br />
<br />
My guild did the fights for two shaman back in the day for me and another guild shaman.<br />
<br />
This is what we did.  We popped Rak, left him standing.  Went up to Neh's area, first shaman did his turn in, we killed her, got diary.  1 mage bound where we kill Neh, clerics/mages floated down to Rak while the rest of us stayed in Neh's area and farmed repops.  Cleric/mage team killed Rak, first shaman looted scale, went out and got epic.  All got called up to Neh, waited about an hour (total spawn time is an hour and a half, I think) killed her again, I got my diary.  We all went down to Rak's area and by then his reaver was back up, killed Rak again.<br />
<br />
CoM is great for LOTS of classes.  Enchanters need ghost of Jaxiom (sp?), mages need the torch from Neh, druids/rangers need Jade Reaver.<br />

Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the response.  After reading the links and message, I have a couple more things to confirm.<br />
<br />
1) Is there a specific reaver to spawn Neh Ashir and where does this reaver normally wait at?<br />
<br />
2) If I understand right, there are four reavers  that are typically pulled before Rak spawns.  The last reaver, Rak's reaver, is what actually spawns him and he warps to where this reaver dies and waits for turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1) Yes, Neh has a specific reaver, she is actually upstairs (way way upstairs).<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.  There are five reavers downstairs, Ghiosk's reaver is normally pulled first since he's closest.  He always spawns aggro.  Then there are 4 other reavers that spawn plain old ghosts when they die.  Then, there is Rak's reaver.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;warping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rak spawns right where his reaver dies.  He spawns non aggro and can hang around non aggro for hours. (once you've completed the hand in and he aggros, he will despawn in 30 minutes if not fighting or killed).<br />
<br />
Now, Rak can GATE back to where he spawned.<br />
<br />
What typically might happen:<br />
<br />
You fight the reaver, Rak pops and he's not aggro.  You stop and discuss with your raid force the best way to fight him.  Your raid force decides to PULL Rak to a specific place to fight him.  You fight fight fight, Rak gets low on health and GATES back to where he spawned and begins summoning magicians and clerics for snacks.<br />
<br />
This is why its a good idea to fight Rak's reaver where you plan to kill Rak.  Reaver dies, Rak spawns, you turn in the item, Rak aggros, mage pets engage, you slowly back out, Rak gets low on hitpoints and GATES right where he's standing!</div></div><hr />
