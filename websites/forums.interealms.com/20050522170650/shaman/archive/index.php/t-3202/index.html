I seem to remember doing that a couple times as a lowbie, then trying in vain to find who I'd targetted.  I don't have any screenshots, because I didn't know how to take them then.  :)<br />
<br />
Could have just been a weirdly named PC, but I seem to remember it happening more than once.  <br />
<br />
Bridge to Halas- bah !!  What's next, fully clothed equipmentless wood-elves?!?!?</div></div><hr />

You clicked or targetted the &quot;raft&quot; that goes back and fort across. It is named.</div></div><hr />
