<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">where are they ?  i can't seem to really find any good info around , a lil here and a lil there ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you wanna make pp, the usual growth or sebilis answer, you can solo or take as much of a group as you want to any camp in the zone.  As the only good xp at 65 is in pop, I don't think there are any good solo/duo spots really, unless you 'duo' with an enchanter (steal half of their solo xp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found a pretty good spot in PoS.  Non summoning, dark blue to 65 mobs.  Hint: Go Fish.  DEEP SEA fishing actually....<br />
<br />
I get bout 1/2 blue per kill (maby a bit more)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Starweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, what is the name of the mobs your fighting here in BoT?  I have been soloing the golems in PoV, but that zone is usually camped.</div></div><hr />

Hadd.<br />
going to try to check on those froggies in innothule tonight .<br />
*EDIT*<br />
went there , spent two hours . <br />
mobs are light blue / dark blue , have low hps , hit max for 159 . fast respawn . no loot . even though it looked like a great spot , the xp was actually not that great . it might be great for a 60 shaman . frog guards are highly mr btw , bring your malo with you ( or malosini should do , those mobs are not dangerous ).<br />
*2nd EDIT*<br />
the frog guards in innothule have been nerfed , hit for 350 and summon now, not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the larvae in pov are good to kite solo with pet(s).  with kei and virt i can kill one every 10-12 min so spirit call is used on every mob.  they run slow without snare so just dot and run with pet(s).<br />
get 5-6 percent aa per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would it be possibly for a Shaman/Ranger duo to do the larveas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It is possible.  I soloed the larvas for my CoD key without hardly any problems.  Only thing that caused a problem was a bad pull or somebody training stuff by me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">don't mistake the PoD larvas for the PoV larvas ....if i remember well they are diff mobs .<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I solo'd the planarian larvae in PoV recently, they were not difficult.  Just be careful no to pull a skeleton, those guys suck (and cannot be rooted).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FYI pov larvae give 2% aa at 65 (unless they changed it in the last 2 months) so are not worth hunting at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rhugrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try BoT Stormriders, around 6 % AA exp in 65 and they can drop spectrals (very rare).<br />
<br />
No roamers, they don´t summon, hit for around 450, some nuke, some are clerics, but not problem. Fight near spawnpoint to avoid gating and no adds. If you have trouble you can always take the portal to GY and zone out.<br />
They are a 30 minutes spawn and I can kill around 4-5 without trouble in that time, the clerics take a bit longer to kill but if you are familiar with the spot you know where the melee Stormrider spawn. I pefer the root/dot tactic, never summon my pet.<br />
Just get Aego, c5 buff MR and you are fine.<br />
<br />
Also good spot for a duo, did it with Mage and Necro, but Druid and Wizzy work too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Terowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Didn't see it mentioned, so let me throw it out there...  HoH humans are a good solo spot.  Trials rooms IMO are the best, you can usually pull the ones against far wall solo.  Once those two are taken care of, if you feel daring, pull two at the door.  I start with Malos at max range, as soon as it lands I am backpedaling til recast timer goes away, then use Petrifying Earth.  Don't have BoU yet, cause I still refuse to loot and turn in spectrals (sorry, 3 ToG's in a row kinda made me sick to the stomach) so I use epic / BoS.  I dont even worry about pox, all that does is break root for me.  Takes about 7 - 10 minutes a kill at my rate (once again, I only use epci and poison, no disease yet) and get 6% aa a kill or so.  Usually pretty quiet in there too, so it's pretty relaxing.  Umm... oh yeah... Sentries suck, not snareable and not rootable, can be slowed and all that stuff... usually if one pops in my solo area, i will finish off whatever other guards are there, or move to a new basement.  I'm not super big into soloing, I like to duo with my 65 bard friend, drops our kill time down to about 3 minutes or so, with less down time than soloing (not that it is much either way  :) )  Hope this helps some, easy to do, prolly much faster with ultor, heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">as far as i knew aa exp was aa exp so it doesnt matter if you are lvl 65 or lvl 60, the same mob will give you the same amount of aa exp.  also i saw &quot;a festering worm&quot; in the larvae spawn spot(PoV) and it dropped an ethereal parchment.  only named worm i have seen but was fun.  and it is verified PoV larvae give 5-6 percent aa exp.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">latelly have been soloing in plane of Tactics , in the pit .<br />
i started soloing in the pit zone out corner but after a zillion adds and a zillion zone out and so much stress , i decided to move it . <br />
i found out two possible/rewarding spots for soloing in this zone . <br />
first one is before pit, that small room on the right , lots of room to bring diakus in there and take yer time soloing (diakus death knights HT ) , and easy to single diakus from outside . <br />
moved to pit . in the pit there are two tunnels out on the west wall . it is best to go to the south tunnel as the stampede event pathes through there . when soloing in those tunnels you will not have too much room , you will have to keep a timer ( a wanderer pathes by every 25 mins no matter what tunnel you are in ) , but you will have a chance at more spectrals and very nice loot ( random stampede event / stampeding pigglet [ spectrals + nice loot ..]  , frenzied initiates [spectrals] , enraged boar [ bracer patterns / spectrals etc] ) coming from mobs you can pull from the pit . <br />
to survive in the pit , first don't try to jump from the top down ( ok i had to try it the 1st time .... ) , even monks with safe fall maxxed don't make it down there . use levi . there is a zone out in the NE corner of pit if you have to make a mad rush . with Run speed 3 you should make it even without sow , just don't pass through mobs  . <br />
in pit use invis , most mobs don't see through , except the undeads ( war wraith , tormented souls ) and nameds ( enraged war boar ... ) .<br />
best thing is to check around going invis , hunt for a named , wait for pulling path to clear and bring it to tunnel for some one on one fun . <br />
<br />
so far i got 3 spectrals this way .<br />
<br />
as for XP now , i forgot how much i made , because my xp bar went crazy when a necro joined me . <br />
necro charms tormented souls ( hard to find sometimes ) , shm pull mobs with slow . always keep root memmed , if charm breaks you are the one to root mob ASAP . very refreshing duo , could keep up with mana no prob . 1AA an hour or around and like 8 spectrals in 3 hours ( no other loot even with  three piglet kills ) we were killing faster than a full group . try it , no need for a cleric even in this duo , we could even take 4 mobs at a time with root park , slowing , and pet killing through . <br />
