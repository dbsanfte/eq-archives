<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few observations. I have a pretty fast machine so I spent lots of time in the bazaar today<br />
<br />
If you can't find the guy, /target dude, cast a spell on them and see where it casts, I couldn't find this guy selling something I clicked everywhere, cast SoW on him, cast Spirit Sight on me just in case, did everything I could think of. <br />
<br />
Well I was getting frustrated till I looked up. What was that I see, feet, tiny little feet sticking out of the ceiling. Targeted them and OMG it was the guy. How did he get up there, he was way, way up. Har, I cast lev on him and he popped up above the ceiling. OH OH I thought, better get out of here but lo and behold he floats down to the floor and stays about 3 feet off the floor stuck to a pole. I bought a mess of junk off him just because. I also saw a few people pushed into the wall of the stalls so look there if you can't find them.<br />
<br />
Item two:<br />
<br />
Beware people selling no-rent items. I saw a few. I know that they may be needed and worth it IF you know what you are getting but it could be a rip if you don't. They were mostly those rings with focus effects and stats and selling for around 50pp or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item three:<br />
<br />
I saw people selling items that varied lower by several hundred pp for lower cost items to several thousand pp for higher end items. Most of the time they did not have the item in question. I don't know if this is a bug in the updating (yes I refreshed and did new searches several times) or if this is some kind of a scam. I didn't use the trader side of the interface so I don't know how it works. Maybe someone can enlighten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One little bug I noticed and heard of others having the same problem.<br />
<br />
With the /bazaar window now and again the search would stop functioning, results would be come invisible except when highlighted and it would be impossible to click on the trader name to find them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this will get fixed but for now, hit update traders, select a trader from the trader list and hit find. Now reset and try your search again, listing one persons wares seemed to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another hint: when trying to find a person you want to buy something from, right click on their name in the /bazaar search result window. That will point you into their general direction, much like the Sense Corpse spell does for Necros and Bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wintermoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A bug in the new user interface is that all/most scroll boxes remember the last time you used them and stay scrolled down. This will make some boxes pop up and look empty.  For these bugged searches, just hit the scroll up button in the window and the searched for items should re-appear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems that the seller has to remove a sold item manually from their list of &quot;For Sale&quot; items. If people do like most and set it up and then go afk the items remain showing available for sale but have really been sold. I didn’t find this out until purchasing a trader's satchel and playing with the /trader interface. Go figure they wouldn’t make it automated but the coding probably would bog the search down to a crawl.</div></div><hr />

Saw someone selling a summoned mage bracer for 50k, and a summoned modrod2 (not the spell) for 30k.  I was seriously considering petitioning them as a dirty rotten scammer...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Makelike pointed out the trader has to stop trading and re-start trading for the old items that have been sold to get removed. I bought a couple of bargins really quickly and they were still being listed as &quot;for sale&quot; 6 hours later...<br />
<br />
I know it was driving all the people after blue diamonds mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just because they offer it at that price doesn't mean you have to buy it.  Is someone really gonna haul 30k out of the bank and rush over to buy that?  Puhlease . . . nobody but a noob wouldn't know better, and most noobs don't have 30k.  The guy overshot on his grand scheme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, as mentioned above you can right click on the person's name and you spin to face the direction of the trader.   Its instant, so I found you can do it while running by repeatedly clicking on their name.  <br />
<br />
As far as it not updating, what I do is end trader, then begin trader as often as possible to update what i have to sell/buy.  Thats the only way to add new items/remove sold items from the list until Verant fixes this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did a search for spells and saw someone selling Bane of Nife for 200pp.  I stopped trading and ran over there as fast as I could, but the spell was not on the trader.  It kept showing up and I went back at least once to check in case I had missed it before, but no zako.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I wish that they would fix that particular feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't matter what the price was, or if someone would be stupid enough to buy it.  The guy was still trying to sell No Rent items.  His intent was to scam, whether he succeeded or not, and I have no pity for jerks like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I saw Malo sell for 10k and it was taunting me on search all night /cry :(</div></div><hr />

But when I walked up, I could see the trader just fine, standing near the wall.  Could it be that with so many people in the zone, that PC locations aren't always correct on your client? -- some PC traders will appear to be stuck in walls or stuck on poles when they're not really.</div></div><hr />

When EQ was first released I had some crappy RAM that used to overheat.  When it overheated I would get stuck in all kinds of weird places and see all kinds of weird things that my friends couldn't.  No drugs just hot RAM! <br />

Yep, yep, but even then sometimes they are a bit hard to find. <br />
<br />
Hint, hint for traders. Put your /loc in your afk message as last resort people will /tell you and your location will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another thing about finding people.... when they stop trading, they don't leave your search window, unless you update - and you can still point towards them as they walk around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Cush...The fact of the matter is even if he was trying to sell no-rent items for 30k the mod-rod and mage summoned rings who in their right mind would buy those items and furthermore it was probably a joke. This is not a scam either as a scam has a chance of tricking the person into trying to buy something overpriced thats not worth it in this situation and that &quot;scam&quot; as you call it has no chance of well...scamming anyone. If it was a dirty jerk trying to be all jerky then don't worry about it he wasted his time making those prices etc up not you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another small problem with the bazaar, is that a merchant can only have 30 items for sale. Just like NPC merchants.<br />
<br />
BUT you can put up to 80 items in traders satchels, and set prices for them all. And all of these 80 items will be listed in people's searches. So it's quite likely that items you find by searching, but then can't find on the trader themself, are hidden by the fact that the trader is selling more than 30 items.<br />
<br />
Presumably, if one of these traders sell an item, another one becomes available for sale, just like an NPC merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sigh.. Missed a Bone Braced Buckler for 300p by about 5 minutes :(<br />
Other peps are selling it for 12 and 10k ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ya I had the problem with the 'invis' merchant.. I could target them but could not see even with levi.. managed to get him by clicking into thin air hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Originally posted by Oldshaman <br />

<br />
I've noticed that PC merchants, just like NPC vendors, have a limited portion of their inventory that is visable to be browsed.  It all shows up when searching, but when you go to a PC merchant, only the first 20 or 30 items of their inventory are visable (PC merchants could potentially have 80 items for sale).  I verified this by buying a few cheap items on a PC merchant, clicking done &amp; then right clicking on the PC merchant again. The empty spaces were filled in with new items that were not previously visable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Also, with NPC merchants, you could shift-buy to get all their items in stock if they had 20 or under. PC merchants tell you the &quot;you can't afford&quot; message as if you were buying 20. Then you wind up with their stock. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Xatrei - that's what I was trying to say, but I think you phrased it better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I, too, noticed the scroll-off-the-bottom problem.  One merchant even used this to his benefit - he set a BD priced at 100p at the bottom of his bag.  Ppl flocked to him, bought some of his stuff to make it show up.  Eventually, when the BD neared the top of the bag, he repriced it at 1000p.<br />
<br />
I think they have fixed the item-is-sold-but-still-shows-up bug in one of the small patches.  I didn't observe it happening yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One little trick I noticed and did. I was selling SoW potions (They sell very well). If you put a bunch in any slot, if they are in the top 30, they take up one slot for each potion. If they are below 30, people can not get to them to buy it. <br />
<br />
What I would do was put one potion in slot number 30. It would still show, and it could be bought. Then, I would put all the rest in slots 31 on. As one was bought, a new one would move into its slot, and so on. That way, only 1 was shown, but they were all available to be bought.<br />
<br />
The thing I still hate is the search. Sometimes it does not show the items until you move the mouse over them. All you get then is the name, no price or who is selling it.<br />
<br />
Also, the list you get from the search has a set number of items it will show you. So, you may not see everything under that search for sale, or you may not see all the people selling the same thing. You could end up not getting the best price, or not seeing an item for sale you want.<br />
<br />
As I was selling, I would regularly check what was for sale that I needed. One time Saturday evening, I was looking for Shaman spells. Low and behold, I saw Torpor for sale. Then, I saw the price, and nearly fell off my chair, it was 100pp....  Now to just get through 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Durnitol Tuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">There is alos a cap of 100k for a sale price. Some guy on my server was selling a Mask of the Tinkerers?. He intended to sell it for 200k, but instead put the price at 20k. Whoops! It was boght rather swiftly by someone who knew it had to be a typo. Hope that guy petitions to get his items replaced, cause neither he nor the buyer were at fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Grippa <br />
Xatrei - that's what I was trying to say, but I think you phrased it better :) <br />
<br />
Har - next time I should try reading the whole thread before responding... heheh ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">i've seen an SoD for 300k so i don't think there's a 100k cap really<br />
<br />
also, watch out for gimps selling maloSINI for outrages prices, they're trying to scam people into thinking it's malo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hail,<br />
<br />
Canni4 for 25pp. :D  Typo?  I have no idea, but I'm happy.<br />
Several other spells extremely cheap.  I now only have 13 spells left to buy, and it looks like I'll nail another 3 down cheaply in the next week or so if my luck holds.<br />
<br />
Spider fur Cloak for 2pp3g.  Found on a VENDOR in bazaar.<br />
Drakescale belt for 3pp.  Also on a vendor.  Found Cripple (common, &amp; I already had it) for 16pp or so on a vendor, with about 10 copies all being sold, with the lowest one going for 100pp from PC Traders. /boggle<br />
<br />
Don't forget to check the NPC vendors!  People get tired of selling stuff as Traders &amp; some just unload them without burying things properly.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to bury items (like potions), use a Jewelcraft Vendor.  They are almost always stocked with expensive stuff from people skilling up.<br />
<br />
I've also had the spell listed but not found on the trader happen to me.  Voice of the Berserker for 500pp for TWO DAYS and I couldn't get through the PC inventory to get to it.  Now it's gone. :(<br />
<br />
I've made about 3kpp selling old junk, mostly non-shaman spells while afk &amp; sleeping IRL. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
