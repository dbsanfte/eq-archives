<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I ran across the link here once for the infamous &quot;page 8&quot; story, and was wondering if someone could please post the link again, or the story if you have a copy.  Lot's of friends would like to read it, and I would like to actually download it this time.  I tried to search, but unfortunately, I cannot remember anything about the names of the people, only that it was about &quot;page 8&quot;.  Thank you in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Morsereg and I were Primal Honor at the time and when this all happened.  I was also an officer at that time and had to deal with all that.  It wasn't a lot of fun.  Primal Honor has long since collapsed.<br />

If you want to know more about it feel free to ask since www.brellrants.net has been down for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This guy was accused of ripping a guy off on a thurg BP MQ.  There was a 7 page flamefest on the boards, and basically the guy that did the ripping was posting under two different accounts, trying to weave a story to clear his name, and people were buying it (they didn't know it was two accounts, obviously).  Then, on PAGE 8 the guy forgot to log out of the second account and posted as his first persona.  It was a no-edit board, so there was nothing he could do about it.  He just said &quot;welp, I'm f'd, you got me.&quot;  I don't tell the story well and you really need to see it to get the humor in it, but believe me it was hilarious.  I believe it got more unique hits than any other thread in EQ history, by far.  To this day, whenever someone does something to completely owns themself, they are said to have been &quot;page 8'd&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, yours was a pretty good version of it Jinheim.  When I first read it a few months ago, it was a spralling 100+ page morass of LOL's and Damns!.<br />
<br />
On many postings you have to read carefully because the original page structure was removed.  Page eight schenaniganns were on page 6 as I read it, but was still funny none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aack! The link is broken  :(  If someone has the thread saved, please-O-please either link it, or I can give you my e-mail address and send it to me. ;)   Yeah, I read it a long time ago, but it was something that I really wanted to post on our guild's website, it's a good tool for teaching folks about EQ ethics, as well as just good ole' reading!  Thanks again!<br />
