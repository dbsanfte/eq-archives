<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojosam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're not rich, don't have ubergear, but we have fun!  Monk does not have fungi, and shaman does not have epic or JBB.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on where this duo might do well? Want to find a spot to park them for a few levels.  I realize the level difference will affect how long a given spot will work for both of them, but any suggestions at this point are very welcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BW is one of my personal favorites, however alot of ppl don't like it.  I think the grey would be a nice zone also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hole entrance still blue at 54?<br />
Some of KC should be manageable.<br />
Personal fav would be scarlet desert for that duo, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I liked the Chardok / Burning Woods / Skyfire Mountains zones at that level. If the Chardok entrance and exit are camped, and you can't get into a group, then you head to the Giant Fort in Burning Woods. If that's camped, you either pull wandering MOBs or hunt in Skyfire Mountains (not the greatest experience but spells do drop there). If you can bank in the Overthere, and have your hammer, this area is even better. Herald Techa in Chardok will cheerily stand there and allow you to proc off him.</div></div><hr />
