<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Botuist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys I just wanted to know how much plat I should save up to buy all my 22 lvl spells?  Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't really remember off hand but I think that Casters Realm has a price for all the vendor sold spells. If you check under the rangers spells section I think it should list it all out and if you click on the spells that should give you a price listing. Although thes are only for Vendor sold spells, all npc drop spells can generally be found in the Bazaar at one point or other.. Prices can run from 10pp to 10kpp depending on the spell and also on how greedy the seller is. But mostly the expensive spells sold in Bazaar are like lvl60+ spells so you should have time to save up for them.</div></div><hr />
