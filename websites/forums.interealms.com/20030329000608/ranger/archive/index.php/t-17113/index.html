<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, this morning I attempted to solo the 8th ring war. tried to single pull chief, got him and an Oracle, which then agroed more as they came. Needless to say, Garadain died. I killed chief Ry`gorr and have his head and am working my way back through the rings...here's the wierd part, I still have the marching orders from Garadain! Wondering if I can wait for Gloradain to pop, hand her the orders and start the war, then hand in the head and get the 8th ring. Will this work, or does something happen to Gloradain when you give Garadain the 7th ring?<br />
Any help appreciated, been soloing the entire thing and it's a pain...Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, Gloridain does not change after handing in the 7th ring.  Same one pops every 24 hours whether or not you have the orders.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can hand her the orders, then go over and hand Garadain the head to get your ring.  If someone else kills Ry'gorr again, then there'll be an extra head floating around, and that always seems to start an endless cycle of MQing until someone does the quest without offering the Chief to anyone, or kills him out of spite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I turned in the Marching Orders and followed Garadain, there was another person in zone who needed the head for their 8th, so I told him to set up for pulling the Chief. I started the war and tailed Garadain till he shouted, gave the head to him and got my 8th ring. Now the question is, what to do with the 7th ring I still have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">use it as a napkin holder?  ;p</div></div><hr />

Now the question is, what to do with the 7th ring I still have? <br />
Upgrade it to 8th when you get the 9th one, and to 9th when you do the 10th. One each of 9th and 10th rings is a very nice pair to have...not uber by any means, but still better than average.</div></div><hr />
