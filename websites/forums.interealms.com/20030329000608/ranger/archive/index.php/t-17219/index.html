<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey gang, I have a quick question.<br />
<br />
I am at a cross roads here with my AA advancement, and would like your input.<br />
<br />
I am unsure which path to take. Should I work on getting Combat Agility and Stability 3 or should I work up my innate stamina, natural durability and physical enhancement?<br />
<br />
Currently have <br />
Sta 2<br />
CA 1<br />
CS 1<br />
ND 1<br />
<br />
Ultimate goal is more HPs, :D  but was thinking that by taking less damage in a fire fight from CA 3/CS3 I may be slightly ahead of the game then simply jacking up my HPs.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ND3 then CA3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pre-pop CS3 was useless for Rangers, however it has been showing increased returns in PoP since it is a flat % decrease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elnil Everstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can get 2 more percent in CA, CS and ND by getting PE for 5 aa points.  Seems the next logical step as it raises all 3 at once.<br />
<br />
Then you can work on getting CA to CA3, and cS to CS3, and ND to ND3 :)<br />
<br />
You didn't mention EQ or AM3.. do you already have these?  They are definately the biggest of any of our AA's.</div></div><hr />
