In the file EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml you will see each of the inventory spots I put in the Clickables box. <br />
<br />
To change which one is which all you have to do is: <br />
<br />
1. Find the slot you want to change <br />
2. Look for a reference called EQ Type&gt;#&lt; <br />
<br />
Change the number in ## to one of the below... depending on which slot you want it to be: <br />
<br />
Inventory Slots <br />
1 = Left Ear <br />
2 = Head <br />
3 = Face <br />
4 = Right Ear <br />
5 = Neck <br />
6 = Shoulders <br />
7 = Arms <br />
8 = Back <br />
9 = Left Wrist <br />
10 = Right Wrist <br />
11 = Range <br />
12 = Hands <br />
13 = Primary <br />
14 = Secondary <br />
15 = Left Fingers <br />
16 = Right Fingers <br />
17 = Chest <br />
18 = Legs <br />
19 = Feet <br />
20 = Waist <br />
21 = Ammo <br />
22 = General Inventory Slot 1 <br />
23 = General Inventory Slot 2 <br />
24 = General Inventory Slot 3 <br />
25 = General Inventory Slot 4 <br />
26 = General Inventory Slot 5 <br />
27 = General Inventory Slot 6 <br />
28 = General Inventory Slot 7 <br />
29 = General Inventory Slot 8</div></div><hr />

When you do the gage for hps it automatically adds the name as part of the gauge but there is also a Label tag for {EQType}28{/EQType} that gives the target name. That label is what he uses and what gives mob_01. <br />
<br />
The trick comes in at getting the name that shows up by default not to show. To do that you have to monkey with the guage properties. <br />
<br />
What I did was set {font}0{/font} to set the font size to as small as possible. You then need to set the location to something like {x}3{/x} {y}-20{/y}. This puts the gauge starting to display outside of the bounds of the window. Then use{GaugeOffsetY}36{/GaugeOffsetY} to slide the gauge down back into the same spot. Don't forget to change the {size}{{Size}CX}408{/CX}{CY}44{/CY}{/Size} <br />
y value to account for the fact that the gauge now starts 20 pixels off screen. <br />
<br />
In short change the loc line so that it's -20 of it's current value, change the gauge ofset so it pushes it back down 20 and change the size so the guage is 20 bigger. You now have you target gauge with the name of the mob being displayed off window so just use a standard label with the eqtype 28 and boom you've got your numbers. <br />
<br />
Obviously all the {} should be replaced with greater than and less thans int he xml file just didn't feel like taking the time to code it so it showed properly in the post =)</div></div><hr />

Basically, every character can have their own settings. And even if characters are using the same skin, there as still a lot of character-specific settings. <br />
<br />
In the main EverQuest directory, there is now a UI_{name}_{number}.INI file for each of your characters. This file stores the character specific settings of: <br />
- which skin this char prefers <br />
- the position and size of each window this char prefers <br />
- visible setting for each window this char prefers <br />
- the fade time/percent for each window this char prefers <br />
- (and i think it stores character specific tint colors for the windows, if you have tint on instead of background image)</div></div><hr />
