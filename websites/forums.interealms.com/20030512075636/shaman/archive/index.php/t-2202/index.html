<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this time I checked before posting.  I am trying to finish up my equipment for atleast 10 more levels.  I am still using Split Paw gloves (shudder).  I was on the &quot;I need the most wisdom I can get&quot; mode, and at level 38, my wisdom in Barbarian form is 195.  I was thinking about the Faith Healers gloves on the Moon.  Any thoughts?  Thanks for your help...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, someone is gonna say it, so might as well be me.  What is your AC?  <br />
<br />
Your WIS is incredibly high for a shaman, particularly one still in your 30's.  If your AC is not over 700-800, I would seriously go for AC over WIS when upgrading your gloves.  <br />
<br />
Jaundice Bone Gauntlets come to mind, or Ry'Gorr, or even Totemic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My upgrade path was:<br />
<br />
Split Paw Gloves<br />
Jaundiced Bone Gauntlets (still in backpack)<br />
Rune Crafter's Gauntlets<br />
Wolf Caller's Gauntlets<br />
<br />
The JB Gauntlets will probably set you back about 500pp or so, but I found the click effect incredibly useful from 45 to 51 or 52, especially before they nerfed the HoS stacking.<br />
<br />
Ah the memories.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CC gloves and coldain skin gloves are also excellent, if a little pricey for you right now.  Good long term goal gloves!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, thanks for the quick responce.  I actually have a pair of Jaundiced Bone Gauntlets in my backpack.  (a gift from a lvl 51 Mage Guildie).  I guess I was too caught up in getting my wisdom over 200.  Now, I need to look for balance since the epic boots will give wisdom too. (that is my next stop)  Thanks again..you are all so helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Joo got JB Gaunts in da bag... equip dem. LoL.<br />
<br />
If mez playing joo shaman ( so glad mez not *giggle* ) my short term goals would be to get my wisdome DOWN to a lvl that was not so embarasing.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong do...  joo migh be an uber twink wid thigh wisdom because joo cant help it.  If so mez is very sorry /blush.<br />
<br />
If not I would start a trade skill bag and place a bunch of wisdom items in it and stick it in da bank.   Then I would look at all da empty slots on mez character and fill dem up wid ac items.<br />
<br />
JB Gaunts are a nice start.<br />
CC Gaunts are a nice upgrade from dat, but before I would spend money to upgrade the JB Gaunts I would have a carfull look at what kind of wisdom garbage I was equiping.<br />
<br />
Mez not want to be rude but mez just looze a guud guild friend who was a wisdom shaman.  He struggeled along gimped with<br />
215 wisdom or so for a long time. He just getting more and more frustraited as he tried to get into the upper 50s.  Now he is just gone.  Mez still miss him.  He was one of da nicest people I ever met in da game.  Mez just hope joo not make the same kind of mistakes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A shaman's mana pool is not soley determined by wisdom and mana items, but also the amount of hitpoints that can be quickly converted to mana.  Hitpoint to mana conversion is one of shaman's most powerful abilities and if you neglect this aspect of being a shaman, you might as well start a druid, get to 255 wisdom and sit on your butt when you run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Higher AC = less damage taken per hit, meaning more hitpoints available to cannabalize<br />
<br />
Higher hitpoints = more potential mana<br />
<br />
Starting at level 24, the combination of cannabalize and regen adds greatly to a shaman's arsenal.  This ability gets stronger with levels, and finally, a level 60 shaman with Torpor and Can IV and the AA ability mass cann is a mana regen God.  <br />
<br />
You know how to make a cleric cry?  Both of you get to 0 mana, cleric sits to med, shaman starts cannabalizing, start calling out the mana as you regen, 20, 40, 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">to add a bit to Gloriana's info - at level 38 a WIS point is giving you about 8 points of mana capacity - it is raising how much you have when full mana by 8 points (formula is level/5, not sure how it rounds)<br />
it is common for shaman to wear their WIS gear while waiting around for something to start up, say a port or a raid, and then start switching out to hp/ac gear as they start cannidancing.  This allows a max mana pool at the start of the festivities (euphemism for buffing) and max hp for cannidance.  <br />
<br />
hp is important source of mana, especially with regen items and regen spell line.  ac is important to protect those hp when ya get hit, and ya need to get hit a lot to max out your defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wear the JB or get Sentry Gaunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep.<br />
<br />
Go for some of the AC.  Lets you take a few hits.<br />
<br />
My AC is just over 700 w/o buffs and level 47 atm.  Not too bad, but I need some defence increases.  I notice a huge difference when I am in my WIS gear as opposed to my normal AC/Wis Gear.<br />
<br />
Oh.  Wis is comfortably at 175ish in Troll form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My gloves have been:<br />
<br />
Patchwork/Lg Leather<br />
Banded<br />
Totemic<br />
Rune etched<br />
Coldain skin gloves <br />
<br />
I have unadorned chain gloves and gems, but I think I'll keep the coldain skin gloves (I like hps). I've had some various pieces of jaundice bone from time to time, but I would never wear it because it's piss-yellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AC &gt; all<br />
lvl 50 here have about 840ish ac and i love it<br />
wis is usually around 169<br />
about 1600 ish hps self buffed<br />
and i CANT GET ENOUGH<br />
i try to wear the most hp items i can, usually followed my ac then wis<br />
you can cannibalize....so capitalize!<br />
(hehe i aint one for exactness thats fer sure!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I strongly tend to wear what I've directly killed for or made, for the most part, so I went this route:<br />
<br />
Split Paw<br />
Northman Imbued (made myself)<br />
Jarsath<br />
Jaundiced Bone<br />
Crystal Chitin<br />
<br />
I spend almost all my cash on smithing and alchemy, and don't spend any time in EC, save when running through it.  At one time (30s-mid 40s) I was wearing a great deal of Imbued Northman.<br />
<br />
Make sure to check out the Northman Imbued Gaunts, they're not bad, and actually relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
edit:  Always proofread to make sure you haven't any words out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my gloves were <br />
split paw, <br />
jarsath, <br />
JB, <br />
Thurgadin <br />
<br />
now <br />
<br />
Barbed Ringmail<br />
(19 AC, +5 Cha, +5 vsMg, +15 HP)<br />
or <br />
Slighted Gloves<br />
(+15 AC, +15 Str, +20 Wis)<br />
<br />
I will probably be using this combo for a long time.  Considering that Wolfcallers isn't really an upgrade to speak of.<br />
<br />
Wolfcallers - <br />
(+16 AC, +2 Str, +3 Wis, +2 Cha, +1sv all, +20 mana)</div></div><hr />

Here's an easier way.. walk into a zone where you want to join a pickup exp group and /ooc &quot;X lvl shaman LFG&quot;... and when they snatch you up, leaving the batch of clerics sitting at the zone-in cursing your name. If my 55 cleric had a plat for everytime he was told, &quot;Sorry, we'd rather have a shaman..&quot;, I'd be a rich lil bastard.</div></div><hr />
