<p>One of the snowfang fishers in iceclad talks about a curse.  After going through a few dialogues with him you find out that he wants a piece of wood to make a fishing pole and some string.  The stick comes from the holgresh thingies in the Wakening lands.  It looks like a normal fishing pole.  The string comes from the tigerraptors/tigesaurus thingies in Wakening lands.  It looks like a cloth cord.<br />
<br />
You hand these two items in to the gnoll and an enraged walrus spawns.  The gnolls will attack it and it will be attacking you as well.  Once it dies an agitated snowfang spawns and when hailed he asks if you still want the magics.  Say yes you want the magic and he gives you chapter P of a book.<br />
<br />
Take the chapter to the Gnome named Ami and she will give you the Pirate Grammar Book.  Then take the book to Nilham the Chef and he will give you Ice Forged Shackles.<br />
<br />
VERY VERY nice item.  I am thinking about wearing them over my Hero Bracers from now on <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>About what level is the walrus and does he summon? Will a 57 ranger need to drag a few friends out there before I turn in the quest pieces?</p>

<br />
Yeah I am not positive about the casting time.. maybe 2 seconds or so.  It's only a 12DD spell but it's still fun to have a right clicky DD <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  Super short range on the spell too.. have to be almost in melee range to land it.<br />
<br />
Yeah that was the first thing I said when I heard the weight.. a shame monks can't use.  <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="">  Would be an awesome monk bracer.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

No clue what level it is.  Not something you need to worry about though... just snare it and kite it if you can't handle it <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  The gnolls will kill it.  A level 57 ranger should have zero problem with it.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> EASY!!!!</b></p>

<p>Saw this post almost right after it hit the board, w/i an hour i had the bracer, me and a 51 monk, but i think i could have solo'd the quest if i was careful (as long as i dispell the dmg shields off the holgresh guys), the walrus was very green at 51 and not hard at all, the npcs youre looking for, the gnoll fisher spawns between the tower and the main gnoll camp, only fisher i know up there on the main berg, and the gnomes are down by the igloos. Thanks to this post, i think i was the first person on Rathe to finish it! Thanks a ton for the info, thats 2 new bracers in one day (got a tv one too). Also now guilded after tons of lvls w/o and loving it so much, a great family to be in. All in all, one hellavu weekend. Oh, and Hurry up and finish the quest Hikage, if ya want some help, bring me along :-)<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Because this would become the newest farming craze if not.. Remember when Hero Bracers came out? I remember people trying to get 15k for them. YEESH! I'm glad these are no drop and I'm excited to get a pair of these someday. I doubt verant will nerf this quest <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>WTG Chromite!!! The Bracer seems really really great!!<br />
I know sometimes people hate when other people ask questions about quests, and tell them to figure it out themselves but since Chromite was kind enough to put up the quest i thought maybe he or someone else familiar with Velious could answer a question i had about the quest:<br />
1) Is the snowfang fisher in icelcad the same gnoll who you hand the the fishing pole and the string chord into? And do you think i can kill the walrus and loot it and talk to the agitated snowfang while all those gnolls are beating on me?<br />
2) Where does Ami and the Nilham Chef spawn (what zone)?<br />
Any Help would be great, thanks a lot.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> Heres some info on the quest, hope it helps.</b></p>

<p>Strong Raptor gut (or something similar) off raptors in Wakening (watch out for Rapticor, named raptor hits in the 100s). The pole can be gotten off random holgresh (go to the holgresh cave, loc escapes me, just hang right facing out from SS zone and after you pass through the break in the walls head down into the "bowl" search around in there for the cave). Take pole and string to the gnoll fisherman (hes the gnoll running around with the fishing pole, you can hail him if you want and ask about bad magic (think thats the keywords) and he'll tell you to bring him a good pole/string for it to apease the gods or some such). Hand him the pole/gut and the walrus spawns, gnolls will give you a hand, just make sure you outdamage them I lost a whopping 1 bubble of health (and i'm a rogue so thats saying alot <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""> so a ranger should have NO problem wackin this guy. Once you kill the walrus an agitated gnoll will spawn. Hail him and say "i still want the magic" or something like that, he'll depop and give you Chapter P. Take Chapter P to Ami and she'll give you a Gnomish Lauguage Manual or something. Take that to the chef in the hut to the left behind ami and ...grats bracer.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears everything up.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Whee, finished this quest earlier this morning.  Anderas (60 Shaman) helped me with the Holgreshes.  We found a cave of theirs, can't remember the exact /location but it was very close to Skyshrine.  I'd recommend just running around the zone and tracking down/hunting them than trying to clear the cave.  Horrible pathing, mixed with Magician/Wizard mob = no fun =P  These mobs quickly became Anderas' and my most hated green mobs in the game, heh.  Amazing how neither of us could resist their fire based spells, each with 130+ sv fire.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, pretty easy quest for such a nice item.  Wish the range on the effect was larger, but ah well.  <br />
<br />
Haha, thanks for the heads up Nova, I'll be sure to be on the lookout while around Tarya ;P<br />
<br />
Congrats again on your two new bracer last night Tarya, and I hope your raid went well today.<br />
<br />
(edit)  Hmm.  Forgot to mention this, after giving Ami the Chapter P page, she'll give you this:  <A HREF="http://members.nbci.com/daikirai/pirate.html">Pirate Grammar Manual</A>.  Which is pretty funny to read through.  Almost kind of sorry I had to give it up =P<br />

<p>couple of notes:<br />
<br />
The strong gut dropped off the Tigersaurus's not the raptors for us. YMMV<br />
<br />
The best spot to hunt both is between Wuoshi and the SS zone cave. We parked over "Mojoville" and pulled both. raptors/suars like 2-3 at a time. Holgresh solo though. (rootem, dispell em, then beatem down) I brougt a 47 wiz with me to do this quest, he got xp on every kill, and it was fairly painless<br />
<br />
Mojosticks are NOT the drop you want (hehe trust me) "Sturdy wooden branch" that looks like a fishing pole is.<br />
<br />
Any snowfang fisherman will do. I used the ones on the ice.<br />
<br />
You don't need to kill the walrus, he drops nothing. get a lick or two in, but let the gnolls do the beating. don't let it kill the agitated gnoll though.<br />
<br />
Ami is a feamle gnome located under the banner at the igloos. the chef is right next to her in the igloo.<br />
<br />
The DD sucks, and the guild Monks are pissed that they can't use =P<br />
<br />
Other than that, every guild Hybrid I can convince is coming to Vel to do this quest. (about damn time)<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I seem to remember it's called a strong wooden branch, but to be sure, identify whatever branch you have. If it's the right one, it will say something like 'perfect for a fishing pole'.<br /></p>

<p>Attached is an "altered map" of the zone showing the "target rich" environments for the 2 mob types. <br />
<br />
yes, both can be found randomly all over the zone, but they seem to be quite common/steady pulls in these areas.<br />

<p>I tried this quest last night... I managed to get both the gut and the pole but I never found the fisherman. I ran all over the snowfang camp and all around the tower... not one fisherman. I did find two snowfang fisher's tried giving the quest pieces to him and it was a no go. Any help on where to find the fisherman or his spawn time would be appreciated.

<p>"A Snowfang Fisher" is the correct mob. There were 3 on the ice for me. Hail them, the wrong ones will say "go away" basically, while the correction will initiate the quest dialouge.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Sounds like I need to go get me some of these Shackles! Can a Lvl 52 Ranger get these solo? How about with a Lvl 36 Druid Mule on a 2nd comp healing/buffing me while I do the quest? Never seen any of the MOBs that has been mentioned as part of this quest, thanks for any suggestions you have.<br />
<br />
PS: Is this a faction based quest? Can an Ogre SK do the quest? Or are they KoS to the gnomes.</p>

<p>Every time I try there are only 2 snowfang fishers.. both are static and they are on the floating pieces of ice in the water. They don't roam like all the other snowfangs and they both say the same thing. Something like, "Quiet furless one.. You may anger the sea spirits". Well, theres more to it then that but thats all I could remember. If you go through the dialog with those fishers you don't get very far. All they are talking about is Lodizal. I dunno, I'm stumped.<br />
<br />
*edit* Just another question. Could it be that my faction isn't high enough? I'm indifferent to the gnolls so I don't think that should be the problem.<br />

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon14.gif" alt="Thumbs up" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Soloable</b></p>

<p>Yes a 52 ranger can solo this. I just finished the quest, took half an hour. Got both drops one the first mobs i killed, the conjurers seem to be the lowest holgresh spawn.<br />
<br />
Hehe one note of advice, dont attack the walrus right away when he hits you. i handed in the items and just hit attack when i got hit, unfortunately i was still targeted on the fisher. I ended up snaring them and kiting them aroudn til oom. <br />
<br />
The agitated will spawn when the walrus dies, which is good sinse he spawns in place of the fisher who was trying to kill me hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the quest Chromite,another nice find. And very easy to do.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Well.. 'snowfang fisher' (lots of them about) conn indiff to me.. They all have fishing poles.. I handed them the items and they ate em.. <br />
<br />
So.. Something isnt right with this quest.. There is no 'a snowfang fisher' just a bunch of 'snowfang fisher' ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Gleh.<br />
<br />
Other than that solo'd it all myself to this point in about an hour..<br />

<p>DUH.. Never mind.. You just gotta keep hailing all the 'snowfang fishers' till you get the right one that says:<br />
<br />
'furless one wants something with snowfang? you here to help with curse?' <br />
<br />
He looks the same as all the others, and his name is the same..<br />
<br />
You just gotta find the right one!<br />

<p>Yep.. finally found the right one. Instead of being on land or ice he was pretty far away from anything swimming underwater. Not sure how he got there.. all I gotta say is I love tracking <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Finally got it.. At 52 this was easy to solo...<br />
<br />
The guts come off the greenie tiger raptors or the bigger blue ones.. Doesnt matter which just kill em all.. Had to kill about 4 avg to get guts to drop..<br />
<br />
Then you wander over to the flying monkey hell. Dont go in the cave, you'll just die badly. Just wander the EDGE of the bowl looking for em.. They usually find YOU. Pull one out to the edge of the bowl and go at it.. I used a swarmcaller so their dmg shield wasnt bad on me.. Otherwise nuke and dis-spell if you dont have a big bad 2h.. they are wimps, but they like to nuke you a bit.. but you will win eventually.. Some have pets.. ignore the pets.. they only do very little dmg.. Just go for the main guys. Avg kill to get the strong pole, about 6.<br />
<br />
Run back to ice clad.. Hail all the fishing gnolls on the ice by the frozen tower till one asks you: 'furless one wants something with snowfang? you here to help with curse?' and then hand him the pole and guts and some goofy walrus spawns.. Just kill it.. Its a wuss.. Then an agitated gnoll fisherman spawns when you hail him asks you to answer quicky... Just type in 'yes i want the magic' and poof you get a page.. take it to Ami at the gnome camp, get a book, give book to the chef in the igloo and you get the bracer.<br />
<br />
It looks GREAT on Half Elves. Wowza. <br />
<br />
Just reposting this over since this is how i did it... And i messed it up once by reading the scattered posts prior.<br />

<p>I finished the quest last night as well. Probably took about 4 or 5 hours to get it done. I think I was pulling from the wrong spot as I got too many adds. I am going to help some friends tonight do it and I think we'll be a lot better of. My WORST problem was having an elder add at the end of a fight over in the "bowl"<br />
<br />
I killed 12 monkeys before the pole dropped about 8 or 9 dinos before it dropped. string is cake as u can pull to the SS zone. monkeys are the pain as you have to fight far from zone and their DD spells can hurt a bit. Soloable, but I found it easier to bring my wife (44 druid) to help. I would keep them rooted while she DD them into death. Was quicker that way and we got less adds. Unfortunately she was killed while memming our port out after we got the last drop. 3 panthers made short work of her. /mourn<br />
<br />
Thanks honey, sorry you died.<br />
<br />

<p>Holgresh 101.<br />
<br />
1. park in front of their cave.<br />
2. Root them.<br />
3. Cancel magic once or twice.<br />
4. Melee them to zero in about 30 secs.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> re: Holgresh 101</b></p>

<p>That only works if you don't have an Add. They were no problem to kill single, what always gave me trouble were adds just walking up out of no where near the end of battle when I was low on life. Probably would be a uber cinch even with that if I had more MR. My MR is only at 42 when I'm wearing AC stuff which i was. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons I probably had a large problems with adds is because I did the quest after the server was downed. So WL was at full spawn. Tons of wanderers.<br />
<br />
I would imagine after a day or so of people pulling in WL it will probably be a very easy camp to do again. At least I hope so since I'll be helping some guildies do it.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> All your base belong to me</b></p>

<p>Me and a 52 warrior friend did this last night and it was fun and pretty easy to do.  The strong raptor gut seemed to elude us, we probably killed about 40-50 of the tigerraptors, tigerasaurus, and Rapticor to get 2 guts.  The stick seemed more common but it was slow pulling for us until the holgresh cave became available and we enlisted the help of a wizard who we paid with a spell we looted from one of the holgresh.  They seem to drop spells pretty uncommonly, we got 3 level 39 spells (necro wiz and mage).  He also let us have a cool necklace he looted from a named holgresh that is very nice, +4 fire and cold, +6 magic, INT casters only with unlimited right click identify, and it can be used in an inventory slot by anyone!  Pretty cool necklace that isn't on any of the spoiler sites yet.  We were getting ready to turn in the items to the fisher and Lodizal spawned so I had to wait for awhile before I could finish the quest, impromptu tried to kill the turtle with 5 others and got wasted, had to run from Thurgadin and get a rez, etc.  Pretty exciting day all things considered.  I think Wakening Land is a very cool zone.</p>

<p>Spent last 5-6 hours killing the damn monkeys. Prolly 50+ died, maybe 10-20 dino's AND NOTHING DROPPED. Best thing I got was a saphire for the whole night. Verant nerf? or just my bad luck getting worse? I asked a few people in the area killing stuff and they said they havent seen any drop in a while...</p>
