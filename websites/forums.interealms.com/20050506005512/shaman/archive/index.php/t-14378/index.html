<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to be having a minor defense problem.  My skill is at 185 and is stuck there and has been since I was lvl 49 or 50 (I am almost 57 now).<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:<br />
<br />
Letting dblue mobs beat on me while I heal myself (mob was slowed).<br />
<br />
Letting dblue (unslowed) mobs beat on me while a cleric friend heals me.<br />
<br />
Going with a necro friend to arena and letting his pet (dblue) beat on me.<br />
<br />
General hunting with a group where I get beat on when I slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't know what else to try besides just buying the 15 points I need (though I don't have the cash).  It just seem strange to me that by doing all this stuff I haven't even gotten once increase.  I mean hell me and the cleric let the mobs beat on me for almost 2 straight hours with no increase.<br />
<br />
I am not looking for any type of exploit and if you used something like that to get your defense up, please don't post it since I have no disire to break the rules simple for defense increases.  I am just looking for any type of advice other than what I have already tried.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a similar problem when doing 2hb late in life for fun. I ended up buying the last 40sih points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm... I'm not really sure what to suggest, since my defense was maxed naturally by my low 50s just through getting slow agro while playing normally.<br />
<br />
I don't believe you can buy Defense or Offense at a trainer though.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, you could try maxing dex, since dex is supposed to improve your chances of getting melee skill imcreases. You seem to have done everything else I'd suggest.<br />
<br />
The only other thing would be to apply the &quot;watched pot never boils&quot; principle and stop worrying about it - it'll probably go up twice in a row as soon as you ignore it.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, I do believe I need to stop watching to see if it has gone up.<br />
<br />
But, when I did the things I described above I always had my highest Dex buff on and when I could I would get a higher lvl shaman to dex buff me before I went (just to get a few points higher).<br />
<br />
At any rate maybe I just need to take your advice and stop worrying about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go out and Solo for a few days. <br />
<br />
Lower your AC and tank for your pet against a dark blue mob. It's going to take more that an hour or two.<br />
<br />
Also just to make sure, you know that you can't skill up against light blue mobs right? Make sure you are doing low dark blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You want to buff up agility, since that increases your chances of avoiding a hit. You get a chance to skill up only when a mob trys to hit you but misses. I'm glad mines maxed, cuz it would hurt to not be at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my last 3 points in a PL group - I happened to be in LG soloing and grouped up with an Ogre Warrior who had borrowed someones high level Cleric to powerlevel them, whilst gaining faction for the cleric.<br />
<br />
Having 3 or 4 mobs beating on me at the same time seemed to make it whizz up.  May just have been the RNG, but might be worth a try<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Buy 1 point to &quot;kickstart&quot; it, and see if you can move naturally from there again.  It can take a long time to get points up sometime, those last 15 are rough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Defense cannot be bought. <br />
<br />
I had the same problem with my cleric. He was stuck at 190 forever. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden last time I looked he was 195 though. <br />
<br />
My best suggestion is to just stop looking and let it go up on its own hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As others have said, you can't buy defense points, though I would pay any amount to be able to.<br />
<br />
Mine was stuck at 196 from April or so until last Friday - somewhere in the low 50's to 60, and I tank pretty regularly.  It finally went from 196 to 197 on Friday, I was so excited, I was all OMG, guess what guess what, and since I complain about my defense daily, my whole group immediately correctly guessed that I got a defense point:)<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope yours does not take so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guess is that you're not hitting back. Like others have suggested, I think you need to actually be fighting to get defense up and not just letting a mob pound on you. However, it might also be a function of your level, since you're already fairly high up.<br />
<br />
I've been soloing and tanking 95% of the time since my character was born. At lvl 44, both offense and defense are maxxed at 200. My problem is getting my 1hb and piercing skills up. They stopped going up by five per level and now go up by four per level. <br />
<br />
BTW - I always fight with all self-buffs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go on raids with mobs that enrage, and make sure there's a constant supply of them. HoT in ToV is IDEAL for this. Put the Focus on, and add in Voice/Rage or whichever. When the mob is about to enrage, equip a FAST weapon and lay a heal over time on yourself. Attack as the mob enrages, and let it take you down to 40ish %. I maxed defense in no time doing this, works like a charm :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was stuck at 195 for a long time.  I dont go solo with the shaman.  Then one hate raid, buffed up agi and I loaded up tigirs.  Got those last 5 points in just a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also just to make sure, you know that you can't skill up against light blue mobs right?<br />
<br />
Incorrect. Any mob that gives XP will give you skill gain.<br />
<br />
I personally didn't have a problem with offense/defense, but I took a fairly unconventional approach to 44-50 leveling...with the exception of a couple of trips to Fear, I did all of those levels fighting hill giants in the rathe mountains. It was enourmously slow as far as leveling rate goes, but the money was nice, and I maxxed out piercing, offense, and got defense to 198 (took a couple more months to get those last 2 points of defense...I believe I was 54 when I finally hit 200).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you want to boost your dex a bit more, try some Greater Null potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When i decided i needed to max out my Def. I did it two waays.<br />
<br />
1) Grouped up with 65 druid and pretended i was his pet so to speak ehheeh I took dah whoppin's nevah slowed the mobs skills went up like 20pts<br />
<br />
2) I went and i solod alot.  Went after elementals in Nadox after 2 days ! 6 hrs a day i have def, off, and 1hb maxed.  I tanked.  Fully buffed self with my own buffs and tanked from the minute i grabbed the mob.  Casting while i hit them. Having it slowed or not might make a diff.  But in Nadox i slowed eheh didn't have a death wish :)<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as light blues to skill up on. . . . i would never do that.  Why? been therer farmin' hour after hour and neverrf had a light blue give me a single skill up. Dark blue? woot! they like to dish out the pts :) I'm not disputing that its possible to skill up on lightblues, just that if you wanna do the long neverendin' way. . . go tackle lightblues eheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1. You definately do NOT have to be fighting back to get defense skillups.  I got my very last defense point by being summoned and whacked on by a mob on my first Hate run.  I was not in attack mode.<br />
<br />
2. You CAN get skillups from light blues, but the higher level the mob, the more likely the skillup.  A few hits from a red mob are worth more than 10 minutes of letting a light blue beat on you.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to start slowing on INC in a group.  You'll take a beating in the first few seconds of each fight that way, use Stoicism or have a good cleric who understands what you're trying to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just observations, but I seem to recall getting most of my skill ups off mobs close to or above my level.  Really low blues hardly ever seem to give skill ups.  /shrug just what I've seemed to notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">DON NOT STAND THERE AND GET BEAT UP!<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure your defense only goes up when your fighting, not gettnig beat on.<br />
<br />
Yea dude, go back to your first choice, this time  /attack<br />
if that is the case</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps so Weiis, but I noticed my skill went up alot faster when i was fighting back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd go back to the Arena.  You probably did this with a melee friend.....  DON'T.  Instead, try it with a chanter, wizzie or mage, meleeing you personally (NO PET).  They might get a couple o skillups, you'll easily be able to heal yourself easily and hopefully you'll get a point or two yourself  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All the mobs I tried to get skill ups on where dark blue to me (even the necro pet) so that's not an issue.  Also, when I was with the cleric I did fight back the whole time, of course I had my dogdog out (didn't give him weapons though), no dots or anything.  Actually did one session of this in Nadox on els, and one on trolls.<br />
<br />
LOL, I died three times yesterday getting beat on by mobs and still didn't get a skill up.  /sigh<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Deep red mobs give the best skillups in all areas. I rose 7 points in 2hb against the broken golem in PoF in a 2 minute fight. I also raised 4 points Def when i was getting mushed by chardok king.</div></div><hr />
