<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after 5 hrs of trying to patch it is finally running.  On Sony site they stated they are bring on more patch servers up to help handel the load *bonk*  For those who get IO Error, according to Verant that just means a lot of people are at the stage trying to download that one file so try again.  If you get the file lock check write protect error, look in your Everquest directory and look for a file &lt;file&gt;.gz and just delete it. If you can not reboot. Then delete it.<br />

See ya all on Lucin soon once my patching is done *grins*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now it says the download will take roughly 47 hours to complete, LOL!!!  I said I wasn't going to play until Thursday, and it looks like VI will not let me become a liar!<br />
<br />
I can tell ya...Craigy's link really helped me out on getting the patcher to run at least.  If you are having problems getting the patcher started, check out his post and follow the link.<br />
<br />
Kinda starting to feel like I'm camping the AC all over again...sleepless hours of doing nothing...must go bathroom...run back to see if it's up, LOL<br />
<br />
Good Luck all of you getting in.  I think I'm gonna let the patcher run all night...</div></div><hr />
