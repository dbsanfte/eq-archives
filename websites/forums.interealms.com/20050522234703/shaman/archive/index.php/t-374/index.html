<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fifner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 51 right now and a good friend of mine gave me an Emerald Dragonscale breast plate, which has 22ac and 20wis and 10char and some resists.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if I should sell it and get a Fungi tunic.  <br />
<br />
If I do sell it, does anyone know what it is worth?  I have checked eq price data but i don't really believe it.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

PS.  My total wisdom right now with the bp is 160</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fifner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of course I would talk with him first.  He is also a friend in real life.  What I want to know though, is would I regen mana enough to make up for the 20wis loss?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Regen &gt; All stats for shamans trying to level.<br />
<br />
Only time I ever forgo (sp?) regen is in raid situations after I'm done buffing and need to put resist gear or HP / AC gear on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;What I want to know though, is would I regen mana enough to make up for the 20wis loss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At level 51, +20 wis adds 200 mana to your mana pool (240 at level 60.)  It adds nothing to your mana regen rate.<br />
<br />
A fungi adds 9000 hp/hour (15/tick, 150/minute, 9k/hour) - which can be cann'ed for a heck of a lot of mana (3000-4500 or so depending on which Cann, what level you are, etc.) - and this is an increase in mana regen, which is what really counts.<br />
<br />
I'd seriously have to think of whether I'd take an Emerald BP over an Iksar BP (Iksar = 19 AC, 3000 hp/hour regen) - but with a fungi it's no contest.<br />
<br />
Regen &gt; WIS<br />

Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a caution --<br />
<br />
Be VERY sure that you can sell the emerald bp for enough money to pay for a fungi on your server -- and that you will be able to find a fungi tunic at market.<br />
<br />
On Veeshan, the changes to the tunic drop rate has balooned the cost, and made it VERY difficult to even locate one for sale at all.  I have a couple guildmates who have been looking for a tunic for weeks, offering outrageous sums with no luck at all.<br />
<br />
Your server may vary, but it would suck to end up with money and no BP to be found.<br />
<br />
But I agree with others, if you can swing it, Fungi &gt; Emerald Dragonscale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The drop decrease has done the opposite on EMarr.<br />
<br />
Everyone with a Fungi are money mongers and are selling them for no less than 50k because they know VI will change the rate sooner or later and fungi wil go back down to 30k so they could buy them back at a 20k profit.<br />
<br />
I see Fungi 100 percent more than I see JBB auction.<br />
<br />
Everytime I goto into EC or the auction channel I see a fungi for sale.<br />
<br />
I had to auction giving a 1k finders fee to the person who leads me to my JBB sale for 15k.  That worked real well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cripe is that thing worth that much?<br />
I have one of those, bought it for 6k almost a year ago. I never thought it was worth that much or I would have traded it or sold it for a JBB months ago.<br />
<br />
Anybody on Xev interested? I can even throw in a few K pp. I'll break retirement and log back in for this.:confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guess they have gone down a bit.  Not sure lately.  There is currently a post selling the Emerald Dragon Scales (not the finished BP) for 10k on our Brell boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm hoping your right about the 20k, the light started to shine again for a brief moment.<br />
Bah, not me, never, I'm not that lucky.:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Maybe there is another use for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I see fungis selling like crazy too; there's no shortage of them.<br />
<br />
As to the emerald BP and your wisdom level of 160 with it at level 51, at level 52 I had 120 wisdom and did fantastically well, because my offense/defense/weapons were all maxed, and I had lots of hitpoint gear and AC, and...a secret weapon.<br />
<br />
I just wore an iksar regen BP.  AC 19, no stats, 5 regen standing 6 sitting.  I had a froggy BP that I wouldn't wear, and I could have bought the emerald BP if I had wanted to.  I didn't want to.<br />
<br />
I also had gear that would bring me well over 200 wisdom, but found it didn't matter much.  When grouped, I would up my wisdom from 120 to usually 160 or so, and I did great.  Zero complaints out of anybody, always did my job very well.  <br />
<br />
Regen is the biggest thing.  It's better than AC or wisdom.  An iksar BP is very cheap and much better than an emerald BP.  And a fungi BP is godly until you get torpor(which people do NOT always get quickly) at 60(ditto).<br />
<br />
I'd save up enough money to get a fungi or, when you get a handful more levels on you or more, go camp the fungi king yourself.  The difference to a shaman is very dramatic.<br />
<br />
The emerald BP?  Just a bunch of stats.</div></div><hr />
