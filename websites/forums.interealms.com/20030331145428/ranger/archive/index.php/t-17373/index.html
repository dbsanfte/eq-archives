<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zaph0dd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive always assumed CoP gave 40atk (as lucy says), ive never really watched my atk level before and after buffing, but something I noticed today is that at 65th CoP gave me 54 to Atk.<br />
This makes me think that it went up per level from 61-65 like many other spell effects do.<br />
If this is true then is Spirit of the predator (unfortuanly a spell ive yet to gain) not that big a increase as it seems (giving 70atk @64th) and really not worth breaking my neck to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its 40 base attack before the modifier gets added on, not sure of the exact reason but I know listed attack numbers are always higher once it's been cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually, it seems like all our attack buffs are adjusted by a factor of roughly 1.35 when in actual use.  that is (1.35 x stated atk increase).<br />
Firefist - adds up to 10atk.  in-game adjustment is 14-15.<br />
Nature's Precision - 15atk. scales to 20 consistently (1.35 x 15 = 20.25)<br />
Strength of Nature - 25atk.  always adds 35 to my in-game atk. (1.35 x 25 = 33.75)<br />
MotP - 20atk, although my understanding is that it really adds 27.<br />
CotP - listed as 40, yet you say it results in 54. not the first time i've heard that.<br />
SotP - listed as 70.  should yield actual results of 94-95 atk added.<br />
<br />
so yes, the &quot;almost twice as much&quot; ratio will be preserved, relative to CotP and SotP.  so break your back, not your neck to get it.  that way you still get to play eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The modifier for ATK spells is 1.333 visible ATK.  I've never understood why this is, but it's been established for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Elured is right, 1,333 modifier applies  on all attack buffs and for all classes I would say. Avatar gives you 100 raw attack .. 130 visible etc.</div></div><hr />
