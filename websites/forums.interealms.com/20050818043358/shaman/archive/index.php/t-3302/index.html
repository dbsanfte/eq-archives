AND, what would you like to see implemented into the game with the release of PoP?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well www.planesofpower.com is a good place to start.<br />
<br />
I am most interested in the new advancement which they Still havent revealed. Alot of people assuming level cap will be raised but they arent telling us for sure yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">God I hope not.. the last thing we need are more &quot;levels&quot; to treadmill.. sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More levels means more XP grind tedium.<br />
<br />
Also, X more levels of imbalance added onto the ten they still haven't quite figured out with Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I figure they would raise the level caps..  since with the speed I'm taking 59 at, I'll hit 60 about the time PoP comes out.. perfect timing for the level cap to be raised   lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would prefer expanded AA skills over expanded EXP levels.  <br />
I still have AA skills to get.  I don't want to have 5-10 more levels to contend with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;More levels means more XP grind tedium&quot;<br />
<br />
Umm exactly why play a level based game at all it all it is is tedium?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Raising the level limits would require serious thought on VI's part as to existing encounters. Much like Vox &amp; Naggy are level capped, others would have to be looked at as well.<br />

Because the carrot at the end of the string tastes mighty good when you don't have to worry about dying (as much). <br />
<br />
I'm also assuming your making that statement with a level 60 alt.  If not - wait until 55-59 then think of this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am sure I read somewhere that they were planning on creating encounters in PoP that were going to be limited to a single group, if a second group tried to join in they would end up in a replicated version of the zone (bit like Anarcy Online).  As I said I cant remember where I read this - may even have been asleep and dreamed it :) but I really hope it is true as I would love some decent single group adventures, tailored made by the designers knowing they cant be zerged.<br />
<br />
The only thing that scares me about this is that it would be VI coding it.  I have visions of dying, returning to bind point, trying to get back to my corpse and being put in a new replicated version of the zone without my corpse in it :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe that corpses are ported to a zonal graveyard, so you don't have to fight your way through a dungeon for a CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you look at the videos in the link (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3299) that BuzWeaver posted for us.<br />
<br />
It does seem like there will be a lot of stuff in PoP for those of us in smaller guilds. So we can take on mobs designed for as six man encounter. Also as CrustyOldShaman pointed out there will indeed be graveyards for you to find your corpse at once you get the stuffing kicked out of you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the level limits are not raised, I fail to see how players could become powerful ENOUGH to keep them playing.  Carrot and stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can't see how they could raise the level cap, just for the lack of XP zones for 60-70. I'm thinking that they'll add more AAXP or a totally new timesink. Heaven knows that VI has received a ton of AAXP suggestions, hopefully they'll use some of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would be ok with them increasing the level cap if they implemented the following:<br />
 As soon as an uber mob like the Emperor dies, his essence/soul/corpse casts an experience giving AoE spell.<br />
Admittedly this probably wouldn’t work for mobs like AoW because you would be getting lots of unwanted people coming to steal exp as well as the faction hit.  But it is long over due for the time and effort that goes into killing (and getting to) some of Verants new creations.<br />
It seems odd to me that a player can spend his time “mind numbingly” chain pulling FG Shrooms for hours on end and be doing better for the development of his character than helping out on guild raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Again I kind of remember reading something about the ability to create &quot;an army&quot; for raids so that everyone share's exp. <br />
<br />
I've never actually been on a riad that involoved the death of an uber mob. The dragons raids that I was on the exp from Naggy and Vox wasn't that big. What's the exp like from the uber mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've never killed any really uber mobs, but even on my sort of raids, the xp you can get being in the &quot;KS group&quot; is significant. A way to share that xp with everyone on the raid would be excellent.<br />
<br />
I think it would encourage the more casual players to come on raids a bit more - when you play only a couple of times a week, a few deaths on a raid, even with a 90%/96% rez, can eliminate a whole weeks xping.<br />
<br />
Also being able to share xp would make &quot;mini raids&quot; a viable option for xp hunting - for example earlier this week I took 2 groups of guildies to Akheva, mainly to have a look round. We tried to arrange it so that both groups got some xp, but that's hard when you're fighting for your life. Being able to split the xp evenly across both groups would be great.<br />
<br />
I think this is such a good idea it would be a waste to only implement it on uber mobs - it should be a system available to all players - with chat channels this would effectively allow &gt;6 person groups.<br />
<br />
Of course some people might not think that is a good thing ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am waiting for the new Ancient Class Skills.  You have to put exp into Ancient Alternate Advancement points.  Each AAA point is about the same as doing level 59 twice.  The first 2 shaman Ancient Class Skills are Uber Pet Control so that your pet will actually keep attacking the target you assign it to, and Ancient Cannabalize, an automatic self death-touch that gives you a full bar of mana in the nexus.  Both skills take 9 AAA points.<br />

Maybe that's what the new '/army' command is when I do a '/help normal' in game.</div></div><hr />
