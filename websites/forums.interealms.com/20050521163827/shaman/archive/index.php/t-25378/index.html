<br />
But please will people who have left for WoW please stop saying how bad EQ was and how great WoW is.<br />
Please all the people who havent played WoW stop saying how its got no longetivity or end game etc.<br />
If you want to post about WoW feel free i enjoy reading some of the posts but please just post about whats good in WoW not what was bad in EQ.<br />
If you want to post about EQ do that do but dont compare it to WoW theyre different games.<br />
In other words please try to stop all the 1 upmanship.<br />
<br />
Just look how this thread got derailed for an example of what i mean<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont mind that much Wulf. I will agrue that topic til I am blue in the face, because I still maintain that EQ and WoW are apples and oranges. <br />
<br />
In a few months, when the bulk of the WoW populations reach max level, we will see what they are made of. People are having too much fun right now to notice the problems in the game. Sound familiar? Yeah, EQ is like that. When its a blast, you dont notice your little inadequacies or the stupid little bugs and balance issues. When your having fun, you dont care about raiders/non-raiders, their gear, their encounters, etc. <br />
<br />
The problems begin when people start seeing that wall. When the content gets old and tired. When that same BP you been wearing for 6 months starts to look like **** compared to the stuff &quot;The Next Guy&quot; has. Anyone who thinks WoW isnt going to suffer from the EXACT same issues that EQ has is not looking at things objectively at all. <br />
<br />
A lot hinges on how Blizzard handles the end game, how they handle class balance, gear, raids, etc. If that proves to be as much fun as EQ, heck I might switch over myself. But I am betting there will be some growing pains in there. Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Did you read the opening post? Come on......<br />
In case you missed the point of my post, Mr Rocket Scientist, I was DISAGREEING with it, and trying to explain why. <br />
<br />
But then, I suppose if a thread was titled &quot;Run outside and jump off a bridge&quot;, you would do it!<br />

Gotta love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ1 and EQ2 will be around for a long time.<br />
<br />
UO is still around, no? EQ1, AO, SB, DAoC, WoW, EQ2, et al, haven't killed it yet. No reason to think EQ1 will go away any time soon either. Server consolidation due to attrition, sure, but it'll be here for several years to come. It's the pioneer of the genre, and the most successful of its kind to date (save L1 maybe).<br />
<br />
Though I've moved on, still glad EQ is providing others with the same fun it afforded me for several years. <br />

No one game is &quot;better&quot; than the other (completely subjective at best). They just appeal to different types of gamers / play styles. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Once I actually played Wow, the wow fanboys stopped bothering me. Maybe it was too much hype, but what I saw was just a barebones basic mmorpg with kunark era graphics. It was kind of fun but pretty generic and nothing to get worked up about.<br />
<br />
Don't let the high sales figures fool you, that is mostly just Blizzard fans, and name recognition. If Grand Theft Auto made an mmorpg it would sell even more copies than World of Warcraft.  <br />
<br />
EQ2 on the other hand, is close to being a work of art, it's a beautifully designed game with a critical flaw: ridiculously high system requirements.<br />
<br />
So for the forseeable future, EQ1 will survive and I'll still be happy there. :)<br />
<br />
I also prefer the way EQ1 seems to have one foot, or even just a few toes, in the world of text MUDs, which the new games don't. That to me is a large part of its long life, it helps friends stay friends over time because the emphasis is primarily on cummunication in  EQ1.</div></div><hr />

Well, I hardly think thats the case, I cant say for the vast population of WoW, but I know for one, Valgoth, is a extraordinarily talented musician, and is always a very articulated, talented and colorful poster. For myself (an EQ and WoW player) I have a B.S. in Biology with a Minor in Physics, Chemistry and Calculus...I also hold a B.S. in Nursing, I am the night supervisor of a 15 bed ER, serve as a Haz-Mat team member for the county in case of disasters and I am working on my Critical Care Transport RN Paramedic liscence. And, most importantly to me, I am the proud father of a 15 month old daughter.<br />
I didnt graduate Magna Cume Laude, but I am hardly a dummy.<br />
WoW isnt EQ for dummies.<br />
<br />
What WoW is, is a change of pace, a colorful world related the long standing Warcraft strategy games, which has a full, rich, colorful history....sure it has its growing pains, but considering, it does quite well.<br />
What EQ is, is the old guard, been around a bit, a bit battle weary, but still fun, its history is a bit discolored in some places, but you have lots of gems to uncover, and it has just as huge and equally rabid fan base as WoW does.<br />
Don't discount either game, both have their places, and are equally enjoyable, if in different ways.</div></div><hr />

LOL I dont think he was referring to the intelligence level of the people playing the game, I think he was referring to the game mechanics itself. WoW seems to lead you by the hand through whatever you choose to do, be it a quest, tradeskill, or just killing stuff. EQ on the other hand, often didnt give you much in the way of definite things to do in order to acomplish stuff. It requires a bit more intuition. <br />
<br />
Not saying I agree with this theory. I havent played WoW yet, and EQ has been pretty much &quot;hand holding&quot; people more and more since PoP. Pre-PoP, though, it definitely took time to solve things, and often wasnt even close to fair. I dont know how much stuff I lost in forges trying to learn smithing, used to be if you hit combine, and the recipe wsa wrong, it just ate your stuff (using that as an example). Now, of course, you can look up many of the recipes inside the TS item your using itself. <br />

<br />
I wouldnt call it intuition, seemed more like patience (and a lot of it preferably) to me when I was playing. Most people playing EQ or WoW never figure out everything by themselves. They are either helped along by visiting places like this or just tagging along with guildmates that have done it. And thats despite neither of these games being anywhere close to mentally challenging. But on the other hand I dont think EQ or WoW would be quite as popular if they were too challenging in that way. Most people enjoy helping each other.<br />
<br />
PS. In WoW the challenge is there if you want it since all zones and instances (even if you are soloing) are accessible from level 1 onwards. So if anyone think they can handle more than the rest of us they can just go try hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Now that NPCs don't (normally) eat your turn-ins, I'd be more tempted to try and figure stuff out myself. That was probably one of the biggest flaws of the early game (intentional or not).<br />
<br />
The main reason I started researching quests is that I didn't want weeks of work wasted by turning something into the wrong NPC - or essentially wasted if end result turned out to not have been worth the effort, or not worth equipping.</div></div><hr />
