<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How to be a Shaman and get in the most uber guild on your Server!<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you slow mobs when they reach 25%. Before hand it's a waste of mana and the clerics of the uber guilds will just complain that your making them heal less, but you want to slow at 25% to show the guild your paying attention and giving it your all. Make sure you call slow &gt; 10 times too so everyone knows you slowed the named mob.<br />
2. When someone asks you to mgb fo7th or sta make sure you go afk for a few mins and come back say &quot;oh sorry I missed your tell I'll mgb fo7th or sta&quot;.<br />
3. Take the initive to mgb cha if nobody else has, bards will love you for this and you will get there vote!<br />
4. If you ever group with the guild leader make sure if they talking about the guild and they mention the GL you ask who is the guild leader?<br />
5. Always compliment the raid leaders strat. Sucking up to the raid leader is the best way to go.<br />
6. Show the guild you know how to play a shaman when someone needs a cure make sure you ANNOUNCE your curing the person. Spam it if you have to don't let other people cast it.<br />
7. If the guild tells you to slow the mob before the mob reaches 25%, then you will want to get bor and cast slow the minute you don't get x mob out of range message. Slow the mob before it reaches camp and show them who is the best shaman!<br />
8. Make sure to request a rez often and in all channels when you have to use rule 7. This will get you your cleric vote!<br />
9. Make your pet so you can help balance the push on mobs. Also get the spirit call aa and always go to the back of a mob and cast it to help push mobs up walls, so the melee can hit the mob easier and love you for this. Melee class's now have your vote cheer!<br />
10. Always rabid bear on mobs and show those melee how a shaman is the greatest melee class of all for 5 mins!<br />
11. Best of all make sure you have 50% of the guild being your friends because if you play this way you have no chance in getting in an uber guild because you SUCK!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes this is meant as humor for those that can't take a joke at all about people that play shamans.  This is all based on things I have seen happen from a variety of different players not just shamans.<br />

<br />
Whats the point of this? Shaman suck? if so allow me to be the first to watch your uber guild raid POP without one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know how hard unscheduled patch can weight on people's mind. Feel for you mate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well if it was written with humor in mind, it leaves a bit to be desired.<br />
  Two thumbs down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't worry, Milanaz, I'm sure you'll do better on your next raid.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Omg people, this person is making a joke, get over yourselves, reply with a nice comment or not at all. 'OMG OMG someone said something bad about shamans, I might just cry now'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You need to work on your comedic method</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you actually read the replies?  People are allowed to not find it funny...  That's different than crying about shaman bashing. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey that guy totally described my play style...I got mad skills!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeesh, some of you need to lighten up a bit.<br />
<br />
For the record it made me laugh aloud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh he forgot to add one special item of skills.<br />
<br />
12. When your slow wont land and your guilds taking beating just cast gate and hit /q soon as you finish gating. That way it looks like you LD during fight. You will feel much love from your guild for your quick thinking and saving your own ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think this post just had the wrong title.  If he'd have called it &quot;Stupid Shaman Raiders&quot; it woulda made a lot more sense as a &quot;things not to do while on a raid&quot; post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Milanaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Landragoran is right I should of changed the title to what you said.  Title was an inside joke for guildies, but wouldn't of made sense for the rest.  Changing it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love this post.<br />

The uberguilds just do not have the right criteria for applicants. People who are total newbs not only buy Ebayed characters, but in fact it is just as easy if not easier to just powerlevel a character up to 65 and have zero clue what you are doing, twink him out in some bazaar equip with $100 U.S. in platinum, and then become &quot;uber&quot; overnight.<br />
<br />
I see people who I have levelled alts with get into &quot;uberguilds&quot; for this reason, its pretty sickening, and I just know they will slow too early or too late or just sit on their ass and beg for phat lewts, just disturbing.<br />
<br />
Anyways I have also compiled the way to become uber for a cleric, as it is much easier!!!<br />
<br />
1. Create darkelf female cleric, with name &quot;hottieness&quot; or &quot;sweetass.&quot; be sure to close every sentence with ';)' or 'hun'.<br />
2. Level to 65. This is quite easy, just spam &quot;xx cleric lfg&quot; in plane of knowledge. When you get a group, ask who main tank is. Heal that person at 30% health. All other group members will heal themselves, regardless of how low on hp they get, dont worry about them.<br />
NOTE: At level 44, be sure to scribe Spell: Complete Heal!<br />
3. Once level 65, send random tells to uberguild Guild_leader01. Be sure to remember rule #1 and always use winky faces and close with 'hun' or 'baby'!!<br />
4. Get Exarch title right away. Fastest way I have found is spending 24 aa points by spending them in the most worthless abilities (but cheapest!) clerics can get. Nobody can see your crappy choices, but the Exarch sure does show!<br />
5. Repeat step 3 with guild officers.<br />
6. Apply to guild.<br />
7. whenever main tank dies, say &quot;oopsie ;) hun&quot;<br />
8. Grats on becoming uber cleric!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
