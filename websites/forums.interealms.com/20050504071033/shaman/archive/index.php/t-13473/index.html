<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urssus da Greenbottom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I installed windowsXP yesterday, somewhat to my regret.  As soon as the installation was done I recieved an error message when trying to run the eq patcher: &quot;The procedure entry point DdEntry12 could not be located in the dynamic link library DDRAW.dll.&quot;  Well, that wasn't too much of a surprise, every time I've reinstalled one version of windows or another I've recieved an error message about ddraw.dll.  Every time I've been able to fix it by redownloading/reinstalling video card drivers or directx.  Now I've done both, to no avail.  Now either directx9 or my video card drivers have messed with some of windowsXP's files, because I'm getting a bunch more error messages when I try to do other stuff.  I think I'll reinstall XP to get rid of these latter problems, but I'll still have &quot;The procedure entry point DdEntry12 could not be located in the dynamic link library DDRAW.dll.&quot;   ...Sigh...  Any advice?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's usually a very good idea to back up all important data and then formatting the ddrive when u plan to install the OS.<br />
Upgrading usually f**** things up badly clean installs are the way to go.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya i will run xp on my new 3.06 ghz when i finish making it this summer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just had to restore to an earlier date because DX9 was causing some major problems.   A game I bought recently put dx9 on my computer.  For some, dx9 and XP works great, as on my other computer.  For others, as with this one..all programs hate dx9...EQ played ok with it.  BTW...SOE is not currently recommending you upgrade to dx9.  Not supporting it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might depend which video card you have whether or not you should update to DX9.  Radeon 9700 pro I'm using supports DX9 calls fully and that + Win XP + EQ and/or any other game I've tried = flawless execution.  Video hardware that isn't 100% DX9 compatible is gonna cause problems.</div></div><hr />
