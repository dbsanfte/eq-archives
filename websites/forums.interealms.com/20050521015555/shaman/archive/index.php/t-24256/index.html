<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I got a Tainted Heartstone - a great improvement for my Charm slot. Except for the little detail that this charm requires me to learn about 10 uncommon languages:<br />
*Orcish <br />
*Old Erudian <br />
*Faerie <br />
*Dragon <br />
*Elder Dragon <br />
*Combine <br />
*Elder Elvish <br />
*Elder Tier'Dal <br />
*Goblin <br />
*Gnoll<br />
<br />
I know that I can learn them from my guildmaster (except that I only have skill points to get 2 langauges to 100), and from other players, but I think it could be more fun to learn them from real orcs, gnolls. etc.<br />
So the question is whether there are any NPC's I can go and hail or otherwise get to talk, and learn some of the languages that way?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best thing to do is to get a friend and train a few language skills to around 20 or so, do 5 each so you can both benefit....now the way language training works is that you cant learn more than one point higher than your teachers skill (well last time I did this trick, which was when Luclin was new).<br />
By this you can each train the other to 21, then to 22 etc....make a hot key to spam languages 4 or 5 lines of full text, the more the better, and spam it away, give it a few hours and your maxed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah under your options when you right click on a window you can choose what language to speak in, and choose always speak in that window..works like a charm, taught my SK barbarian and he taught me troll just yesterday.</div></div><hr />

I can only go from my experiences , and prior to maxing theives my charm was only at 66hp/66mana .<br />
<br />
Now maybe its a case of me not unequipping the item , then re-equiping it , i couldnt be sure . But I do know that when I learnt theives and re-equipped item it jumped to 72hp/72mana<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway , was the easiest way of gaining 72 hp/mana and a splash of saves ever :)</div></div><hr />

If the charm does not get full stats after maxing the first 10 languages, I will try thieves cant and see whether it helps.<br />

What is dark speech and who can teach me that if I also need it for the charm?<br />

Dark speech is, of course, known by all Dark races..IE evils...Iksar, Dark Elves, Trolls of note, and I am sure that the others do too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dewya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tried skilling up in my languages awhile back. I had to change the language in each chat window I had open at the time to the language I was learning (ie. all chat windows to dark speech). Maybe it was overkill, but it worked. I think it also helps to have an Intelligence buff to skill up faster.<br />
<br />
I also noticed my Ogre skill has gone up a couple levels though I haven't trained in it (had 1 point to begin with). I thought it might be that I'm learning the language from the death messages while killing Ogres? My chat windows were set to common at the time. Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
/lang will tell you what language you are speaking. /lang # will pick a language (I believe for all your chat windows at once).<br />
<br />
Dark Speech and Thieves Cant are required to max the heartstone (I have done this on two characters now). You can do all the languages in under 8 hours if you have a partner. You could probably do it in much less with two people AFK who ran some kind of key macroing, but I really don't recommend that, it seems like it would be pretty easy to detect if they wanted to. <br />
<br />
My language hotkey tends to be 5 lines of 20-30 characters. I make them readable sentences so I can tell at a glance whether I am getting better. If you have each character do a different language when possible it can speed things up if one is master.<br />
<br />
Anyway, rambled on enough, luck with the languages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Language skill-ups come with lines of text, not characters, so you really don't need more than one character per line.<br />

INT does seem to be the skill-up stat, as INT casters learn languages faster than other classes.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Leap-Frog Method explanation cut from the language learning guide on my guild's website<br />
<br />
3. The Leap-frog method. <br />
This method can be used with a friend if neither of you have high skill in the language you want to know. <br />
<br />
Group with a friend and teach them what language you know by spamming them (they can learn up to 2 skill points higher than yours). Then they spam you until you are higher and you repeat the process <br />
<br />
To switch languages with hotkeys, write the line &quot;/language x&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the number of the language you want to switch to.</div></div><hr />

do that for all the languages, have a friend do it, get in a group and watch a movie or something while spamming. <br />
<br />
btw I have had success teaching MYSELF languages gaining a skill up in each then zoning and trying again,  but you still have to be in a group to learn a language at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Using a macro spam key in group chat, and 2 boxing, I taught and learned all the required languages in less than 2 hrs.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed in the past, and helped out here is this:<br />
<br />
For example Zammy has a skill of 1 in orc and Fizgurd has a skill of 90 in orc.  Both chars spamming the same language hotkey will raise skill faster due to the fact that even though Zammy is at skill 1, he teaches himself in group chat.  I've tested this numerous times by being in a group and being the only one spamming a language and watching my own skill increase with no one else talking.<br />
<br />
So by spamming the same language with all the chars in the group increase the rapidity of skill increases some ammount.  I don't know if it doubles, triples, quadruples, etc. with each additional person in the group, but it's a definite increase over just one person spamming the language.<br />
<br />
-- EDIT-- Yeesh, helps if I read previous posts sometimes without just skimming them.  Saves flapping my gums for no reason ~laughs~<br />
<br />
Safe travels all, and happy language spamming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Leibeast I believe I know the answer to that one. Language skills max at a level of 100. The text you are trying to read can be coded to be trivial at over a skill of 300 now. Try clicking on the text several times to see if you can get a good &quot;read&quot; on the text. If you are real interested in deciphering the text you can fall back on the old brute force method characters used to use before anyone mastered all the languages. If the text is above your skill level to read each time you click on it you will get a slightly diffrent translation. Just keep clicking the text and after a while it will start to make sense from the bits and pieces that are translated correctly.  If you click on the text repetedly and get the exact same translation every time it probably is a bug or &quot;feature&quot;. Hope this helps. Good huntin'. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
while that will teach you 2 languages at once, you are going a bit slower because each time you hit the hotkey you are only spamming 2 lines of text. you may as well just change your default langauge to the one you want to learn/teach and spam 5 lines of text at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">um I have a page with around 25 languages on it<br />
just rotate through all the languages, yes its slower for teaching individual languages but since everyone involved is spamming they all start to climb fairly fast</div></div><hr />

OH! well that splains!<br />
<br />
funny how we get master title at 100...when some cap at 300...huh?<br />
<br />
i guess its time to spam elder tier dahl and elder dragon till they hit 300!<br />
<br />
i just won a roll on the language charm, and its SWEET! so having those 2 maxxed will mean a lot=) &lt;thought they were...so glad to know the charm can actually eb BETTER!  &lt;SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN I KNEW there was a reason to learn all of the obscure languages&gt;<br />
<br />
tried lookin it up...and could not find info on languages as specific as you gave me so thanks!!<br />

- The maximum language skill level is 100. <br />
- You do not need to invest a skill point to start to learn a language. <br />
- Additional languages start to become available to you at your guild trainer as you move up in levels. <br />

just saw this while looking for more info..apparently the skill cap is still 100?<br />

i am wondering how to check the max levels of languages (some are supposed to cap at over 100) like elder tier dahl and elder dragon...would be nice to max out my skills over 100 , and get my new shiny charm maxxed as well. right now i stand at 100 skill on (master according to the listing on my skills window) and...still see those 2 as gibberish when spoken to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont want to spam for an hour to find out that im maxxed already...unless im teaching someone else (thats not something that i get a chance to do much with those 2 languages) <br />
<br />
it would be very cool to know where to aim, =)<br />
<br />
stilll it could just be another *feature* as suggested earlier<br />

looking forward to spamming on ignore !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As far as I know the maximum skill you can achieve for any language is still 100.  But the programers have the ability to set the trivial level far higher than anyone can achieve. Like in smithing even with a skill of 250 there are many recipes with trivials higher than can be reached.  With languages the diffrence between your skill level and the set trivial determines how much of the message will be gibberish. The true test is to repetedly click the message, if it changes it's just set higher than you can achieve. If it stays the same and you're at a skill of 100 it's bugged and ya should send in a /bug report. Hope this helps, good translating. :)</div></div><hr />

Odd thing... My husband can read the elder dragon at the same level as mine (100) and we are both vah shir...he a BST and i a shammy.<br />

<br />
after thought....<br />
<br />
they still have elder tier'dal listed as such...and dark speach...<br />
and elder elvish...<br />
<br />
but no elder dark elvish *as a substitute for elder tier'dal*<br />
<br />
so....like i said, curious!<br />
<br />
thanks !<br />

My message came off more terse than I intended, I apologize.<br />
I understand what you are saying.  It's a matter of a single thing haveing multiple names in game, like whet you zone into Eye of Solosek you are listed in being SolA on any /who list.  A similar thing happens with &quot;the Hole&quot; and &quot;The Ruins of Old Paineel&quot;.  Still you cannot /lang 26 in game, you get an error.  So adding it to the list, which you did, is incorrect.<br />
<br />
And yes the list was one I posted, but you did type #26 Dalrk Elvish, that is what I was taking issue with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhh so=)<br />
<br />
yes i did number it....<br />
<br />
just to be clear i admit, i threw that number on..<br />
<br />
i didnt question the 26, because when i tried doing /lang5 i didnt get the same language you have listed for that number. thats also why i said that i thought the numbers had no real significance.<br />
<br />
i figgured mebbe it had to do with the order you learned them rather than on the significance of the language being in fact #5...etc...<br />
<br />
i do tend to be aloof on small details tho...so sorry if i somehow offended you in the process....<br />
