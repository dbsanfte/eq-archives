<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm getting kinda tired of his smart alek comments so I would like to change it. How do I change what he says when I tell him to guard or something other then making a macro button? I checked the files in the EQ folder but didn't recognize anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, what the pet says is hard coded by Verant.  Necro's can be ventriloquists with their pets but to tell the truth, I've never heard one of them do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played my Shadowknight last night for a bit.<br />
<br />
I got him a sentient axe just so I can voice graft with it.<br />
<br />
I had the paladin in my group crying she was laughing so hard.<br />
<br />
Verant should have more fun spells.  It is a shame noone would use them but me But what the hell.<br />
<br />
Of course I use Vision all the time. Fella got feared and died in Kith last night. So I visioned his corpse and coul tell where he was by landmarks. Easy CR there no necro needed. I ride the eyes of pullers. I ride monsters eyes and scout out places. Hell for giggles I look through Mutts eyes now and again to see where the heck he goes sometimes in chardok.<br />
<br />
We have alot of useless spells that I use often.<br />

<br />
Specifically, I would like to change how in Chardok, my pet likes to say, <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey buddy, I think I saw a squirrel or something, so I'm gonna run off into a wall somewhere you can't find me and become useless, k?  I don't care if you said /pet guard here, I need some time for me.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't tried it but there's the &quot;eqstr_en.txt&quot; file in the EQ directory.<br />
<br />
It contains a bunch of in-game responses.  They look tailorable to me, I just haven't done it.  I'll give it a shot when I get home, today, and see if I can manage to obscenely tweak it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what is the range on vision? sounds impressive if you can use it on someone's corpse when you can't even see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PC's - just have to have them targeted and be in the same zone. <br />
<br />
NPC's - line of sight.<br />
<br />
I use that spell alot.</div></div><hr />

holy useful, batman! damn i need to go to oasis now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tend to have my vision get *stuck* somehow when I'm riding a puller and they get too far off.  It just plops my PoV down and I'm left staring at a landscape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tantobourne, I tried altering that file and it definitely worked: I changed the response the pet gives when you tell it to stop taunting and it showed up in-game. Unfortunately, the patcher overwrites this file each time, so you have to copy in your custom file after the patcher has done its job. Perhaps there's a way to get around having to do this every time EQ is launched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I changed some stuff in the eqstr_en.txt file, then logged on and asked people if they could hear what my pet was saying, but nay, all they hear is the default. I saw a beastlord change it, and everytime his pet attacked, it would say &quot;Thundercat's, HOOOO!&quot;. Kinda strange, I can't figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yeah, it would make sense it would only be on your end since it's just your local text file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit:  nm, my question was answered while i posted my question :o</div></div><hr />

Snoww,<br />
<br />
How did you target a lost corpse to cast on it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Barm - I've done this when grouped with the person who died at the time they died.  You can still target them (their corpse) as long as you were in the zone when they died, haven't left it since, they were bound elsewhere, and they haven't zoned back in yet.  Used this to find a friend's body at the bottom of the OOT once...luckily it was within sight of recognizable land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love finding stuff like this, even after playing for two years. :)<br />
<br />
Since posting the question, I remember that I always carry a chipped bone rod around which would if they zone back in.<br />

I've gotten some GREAT SS's from the point of view of Ice Giants, Lady Vox, you name it.  I've used it to coordinated CR's in FEar that were close to Terror.  LOVE that spell!</div></div><hr />
