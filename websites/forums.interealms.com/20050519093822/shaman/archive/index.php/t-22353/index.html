<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, here I am, fishing on Lucy just to pass the time, and I look at our spells from level 66 - 70. Here's what I find.<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay - Reduces poison and Disease resist by 55 each. It's resistable, but has a -100 adjustment. Thankfully it will stack with Malos. Did I mention that we get another disease debuff two levels later (no details available)<br />
<br />
Obkin's Mending - It's a 140 HP upgrade from Daluda's, for 72 more mana. Let that sink in. We get ONE direct heal in OOW, and it's Daluda's  with a Healing tacked on.<br />
<br />
A new root - -30 resist check, but... a new root? WHO CARES?<br />
<br />
Obkin's Rain of Venom - Not a rain spell (currently), it's a poison nuke that's 30 damage LESS and 200 mana MORE than the poison nuke we're slated to get at level 66, two levels prior.<br />
<br />
Breath of Wanvu - 40 damage more per tick than Breath of Ultor, same mana cost just about, but... It's a 2.6 minute-long disease DoT. Slated for level 69.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity - Our level 70 Q upgrade, it's same duration, 12 more mana, and is +30 HP per wave. Granted, it's an upgrade, but... Well, I just don't feel inspired!<br />
<br />
Talisman of Wanvu, 200 more HP and +10 Str / dex over Seventh.<br />
<br />
I know, I know, &quot;Wait and see&quot;, but I can't help but notices that they're not even trying!<br />
<br />
And it's also very clear to be that Al'Kabor has taught a Shaman how to make spells, and that Shaman's name is Obkin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of those are still just copy-paste from the lvl 61-65 PoP spells plus some added percentage to their effect and mana cost. It's the same for the other classes.<br />
I expect those to change a lot until OOW goes live.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">still no new canni ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll worry about OoW spells when SOE makes them non NO DROP.  I don't see myself obtaining LVL 70 spells w/o an ubah trying to sell it in the bazaar.  But then again, I don't even have all of my 65s yet either :/<br />
<br />
Spraggon<br />
Bristlebane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes at the moment they do suck, though some i sure will change  though like the new q, with change to god spell god q is 630 a tick, so i think the new god one will be higher :)<br />
<br />
as for the dots well they changed the god one after we complain hard about it.. but i will assume that be after release. <br />
<br />
direct heal and dd are still woeful. the rain will likely get turned into a rain spell (just checked comes up rain ae spell on lucy) but as other with rain others (druid) get 1100 ones at level 66 makes ours look pathetic.<br />
<br />
they not very inspiring. but hopefully with all our complaints they`ll change them some.. they have re added % modifers to buffs, though i for see not enough buff slot/gems to be able to use all.<br />
<br />
some nice things but mainly very disappointing so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they not very inspiring. but hopefully with all our complaints they`ll change them some.. they have re added % modifers to buffs<br />
<br />
Theres only one thing that bothers me about these % numbers so far; they are all the same.  Take, for instance:<br />
Ancestral Strength (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5404&amp;source=Test)  Shaman spell, level 68.  5% Damage increase.<br />
<br />
Lion's Strength (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5350&amp;source=Test)  Druid spell, level 67  5% damage increase.<br />
<br />
So, a level earlier than shaman druids get a 5% increase to damage mods.  The kicker is, (besides getting it before shaman) that the druid version costs 10 less mana and casts in 2.5 secs as opposed to the shaman cast time of 6 secs.  King of buffs?  Hmmm<br />
<br />
And then there is just the nit-picky things.  For isntance, our level 70 group HP buff is called Talisman of Wan-somethingorother.  Id really prefer it to be called Focus of whatchamacallit, just because every HP buff since Velious and 60+ has been called Focus.  On the same note, the Beastlord level 67 HP buff spell is called Focus of Aulin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5529&amp;source=Test) and its just a straight HP buff simmilar to what shaman had pre-60.  Tell ya what SOE, just to keep things consistant, change the shaman HP buff to Focus of whatever and the beastlord spell to Talisman of Aulin.  I believe that Focus, in all its forms (even the names) should be kept by shaman only.  The shaman class has given the best its got to the Beastlord class...let us keep Focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes i pointed that one out on a different post its rediculas that a druid would get a better spell before shaman, (which why i think rytan is a druid)  though prehaps the % will be increased and the level reduced, but seeing the incompetance of soe devs so far i not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
and your right these very basic and obvoius mistakes/bad naming even at the early stages give me little confidence in soe. but then i told poeple not to buy God (least not straight away):) nobody much listen to me then:)  it likely the very bad take up of oow that lead to the recent we do care honest  (great they pre ordering again lets stop now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rytan said he would be looking into updating Bear Form, I'm still anxiously waiting on that.

Im guessing these types of spells have not been developed yet and are still in the early stages of brainstorming.  I think they would implement these types of spells a few months after the release and repeated patches of OoW; when everything is stable.</div></div><hr />

While I'm sure you're disgruntled from GoD (where berserkers were copy-pasted from the warrior class but never finished), the OoW spells are very obviously still a work in progress (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=SHM&amp;source=Test), not complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He isnt there to innovate. If he was any good at it. He would be on one fo the new games.<br />
<br />
He is manning the ship in tried and true waters. Not breaking new locales. <br />
<br />
Therefore slow and steady wins the race. There will be rote 10-20% increases in the staid spell lines we already have. and maybe if somone can slip it by him a new idea that is stolen from Poe or some other game. <br />
<br />
Not the Focus line. And all the other buffs that are increasing combat effects now. They are all copied to all the classes that can Str buff really. Plus we will have the combat effects but with no stat boosts. So people who are not maxed stats will need to get gear to upgrade the needed stats now instead of a quick buff from a shaman. Then they can get the new combat effect buffs. <br />
<br />
If they were going to be innovative. Make something like Focus but have the stats clustered so that Focus is the true meele buff for long term and Avatar is the Mega-buff it is supposed to be. Something like for focus. + 65 to all physical stats. Yeah including charisma. and stamina. Then add the Combat effects like +7% strikethrough, dodge and stun resistance.  Make it last 1 hour and 30 mintues base. Then make avatar The mega buff it is supposed to be. + 10% strikethrough Dodge Stun resistance + 150 attack and + 5 Main hand damage bonus. Lasting 30 minutes base.<br />
<br />
Then for damage a line of Per dot tick Mana usage dots. Like curse line with curse counters. 5 tick duration. 12 second recast delay. Easily 1000 per tick. But for a considerable amount of overall mana if it runs full course. Like 200 mana a tick. <br />
<br />
For a new nuke line I still reccomend an upgraded Rain With the silly 20% resist rule removed. <br />
<br />
For a new heal a Good fast single target heal of course. Mana expensive though. Around 2K base. Along with the upgrades to Quesance line. And the removal of the C heal line for shaman and a replacement given of a Rain heal. Same rules as rains. 3 Waves of 700 healed on a single target. Or 2 rains of 700 each to 2 targets. Crittable and Healing AA and focusable. Then for the upgrade to God make it Total of 4800 hps healed with 4 total targets. Or 1200 a tick healed per wave per hit.<br />
<br />
Then I would give shaman a No XP res spell. Based upon calling the spirit back to the body. And druids the same thing based upon reincarnation. Make shamans summon a spirit form of a human or whatever for a bit and Druids some animal form from the local texture file.<br />
<br />
To clerics a Magic based Holy Dot. Steal exact line from shaman disease dots. Make it magic and there you go. Clerics and root rot solo when they cant get a group.<br />
<br />
Add to all this the massive AA lists. With everything under the sun purchaseable through incremental AA buys. (Check out Blazz's Post on how to balance EQ.<br />
<br />
Then if the content was at all suited for the players Start closing the gap tweeen the Uber raider gear and the Non raider (I mean really PoP is three expansions old once OOW comes out.. Shouldnt The gear reflect the game now. Or is old content like Quarm too good for the non raiders? (yeah incenderary sorry I am feeling ornery :))<br />
<br />

Everyones saying these spells are obviously not finished etc.<br />
Wasnt OoW supposed to be released around this time ?.<br />
Wasnt it put back to iron out some of the bugs in the game as it is without introducing more problems ?<br />
If so who here is like me and thinks that the spells are all done and dusted and ready to go live ?<br />
I find it incredibly hard to believe that SoE were going to release this expansion even though none of the spells were ready.<br />

<br />
Well, I believe that Rytan would have released the current spell set as finalized.  The last 2 expansions have shown that 90% of the spells went live as they appeared in Lucy months before the expasion was released.  <br />
<br />
As to why they pushed the expansion back I hold up a single US dollar as the reason why.  The outrage that many people expressed on the cluster**** that was GoD hit them where it hurts: the wallet.  I can only imagine that sales of GoD were among the worst (not including LoY) that they have experienced to date.  The people said that they wouldnt buy another crap expansion released 3 months after the last crap expansion, so the release was pushed back.<br />
<br />
And its working.  The uproar from the GoD release is dying down.  A few tweaks here, an adjustment there and the masses sit back in their seats and grab their keyboards again.  More and more people are looking to OOW as a fix for all the problems that their class (not only shaman) is suffering in GoD and will buy the expansion.  Sadly, I fear that many will be unsatisfied, but only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry folks! I know that your current spells aren't that hot and are outdone by druids and Paladins, but that's because we have a real treat for Shaman! Look forward to your spells being able to &quot;chain lightning&quot; through mobs and players. We're not sure when (or even if) we can get this crazy idea to work, but when we do, boy you're in for a treat!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">of course the best way to make sure things are changed is to not pre order the expansion and only buy it if it is worth the money.  but we have to get that message to other classes aswell.</div></div><hr />

ps, Speaking of which, the Healing Boon AAs from OOW will allow the ability to crit a tic of an HoT, or the HoT version of Gift, so that's just the effect of having an extra tic thrown in. Nothing we can depend on consistantly, like an HoT version of Adept. <br />
<br />
Although if we can somehow get it up to a 15% chance to crit, and are doing 6 tics with scrm, that's going to average out to (roughly) one crit tic per cast, so that's like getting an extra tic thrown in with every cast. Sort of. But not exactly.<br />
<br />
However, if we only get around a 9 or 10% chance to crit (like the gift AAs), that's going to be like one extra tic worth of healing about once every two casts (roughly, on average). Kind of sucky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Yes, I believe that is why it is so good.  How many people on this site actually have the spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Its not an ancient spell. It's probably one of the most common GoD shaman spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Personally I think it SHOULD have been the ancient and canni should have been the normal one...  But I do not mind -- Trusher is such a good spell that it lets us sort of be healers again...  I know I was healing in earth pretty well with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Trushar kicks ass my friend, I love it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Therefore slow and steady wins the race. <br />
<br />
Oh the irony...<br />
<br />
The stupid thing is I will be buying this expansion.  Not because I feel it will be fantastic, but mostly because my friends will be buying it and if I don't I will be doing pickup groups until I do.  The prospect of that doesn't thrill me I can tell you that.<br />
<br />
I am still hoping that they do something at least semi interesting with our spell line up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ok, because of my feelings towards Gates of Discord I haven't looked into it very much.  I thought that the HoT was an ancient, or at least difficult to acquire.  What all is involved in getting it?  I may have to actually buy Gates of Discord someday if this spell doesn't require a raid to acquire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I never got any spells until I was actually flagged for KT, but this is by far the most common. It can be aquired easily with one group (once you are kt flagged). They are so common that most of the alts in our guild have this rune already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Ok, so how tough is getting flagged for KT?  To put my position in perspective, I'm not in a guild, I have a few friends that range from 61-65 (maybe 1-2 groups if we are all on at once, which unless we all go on vacation from work at once, probably won't happen).  Other than that, anything else would have to be pickup.  I play from about 12:30 am - 3:30 am est Sunday-Friday.  I'm not flagged for anything PoP.  <br />
<br />
Knowing that information, do you see this or any other spell from Gates of Discord ever being a possibility for me?</div></div><hr />

The description made me laugh a bit, maybe they have used it before but not that I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Read all 3, it's pretty funny :)</div></div><hr />
