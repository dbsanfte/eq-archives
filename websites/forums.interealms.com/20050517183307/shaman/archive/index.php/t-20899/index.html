<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was pledging to join a new guild last night and I went on a TT raid in PoN B with them as a recruit.<br />
<br />
I had already done the PoN Maze a long time ago with my old guild.  I was able to zone into PoN B fine. ( first time ever in PoN zone )  We proceeded to kill TT and I then zoned out after guild said gratz to all who needed flag had flag now gotten flag.  <br />
<br />
I never hailed anybody or anything after kill.  Does this mean I need to do it again?<br />
<br />
Like I said.  Old guild I was in did not raid much so I am really a newb to raiding,  I know to be quite and do as I am told.<br />
<br />
Got Guild invite last night for new guild (after raid in PoT) who did raid but I still think I messed up. (Woot to me for new guild invite)<br />
<br />
Can anyone clarify for me?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much all the flags require you to hail something after the kill.... For the maze I seem to remember hailing Telin who spawns after you Kill the named.<br />
<br />
The only exceptions are the Sol ro tower flags that you get by clicking the pots that send you out of the towers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Figured as much....... :-/<br />
<br />
I am soooo stupid some times.<br />
<br />
Oh well.... got guild invite and had fun.  Another AA would have been icing on the cake.  Oh well I guess.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.<br />

<br />
Most PoP boss mobs spawn a Planar Projection (PP) upon death. You must hail this to get the flag, but don't do so until you are told to (or you see someone else has) - they despawn some time after the first hail so best to wait for everyone to be rezzed first.<br />
<br />
There are exceptions (MB - hail the gnome. Sol Ro as above) but this is the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only way to avoid mistakes like that is to ask whenever you are unsure. Speaking for myself I want recruits and new members to ask questions, lots of them.<br />
<br />
It shows you are not afraid to admit you do not know everything, it shows you are willing to learn new things and most importantly it shows you want to become a better/more knowledgeable player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think members wanting recruits to ask any and all questions they have is pretty universal Murt.  Whenever I see apps being too quiet I always send 'em a few tells and tell them to speak up.  <br />
<br />
Raiding is unlike anything else in EQ, and asking questions is a necessity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn man, if I had known that you weren't sure about it I would have told you what to do. <br />
<br />
Ask any questions you need to. Always. Don't worry about bothering us, that's why we're there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh well will get again  I'm sure.  This guild looks to be awesome.  Thanks for post Kraaga.  Gratz again on nice face that dropped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Believe me... when new to raids, stupid questions are not so stupid. What're the differences between a RT, a TM, a MA, a SA and a MT? How do you avoid AE Rampage? Why/when do warrior needs CHA? What's the FA dance card? When do I get to use the pack? And so on...<br />
<br />
Find another shaman in that guild, one that has been raiding with them for a while (because all guild raid differently, so what's done one way in one may be done another way in another), and ask him question. And make sure you're in all the channels you should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Really, it's not just your fault.  Not sure by reading your text, but for people raiding with the guild for the first time, it should be told to everyone to make sure you hail the projection to get your flag.  I'm not talking about going through each person to make sure they hailed, I'm talking about the raid leader or officer or whomever says in raid chat to &quot;make sure you have hailed the projection&quot;.  Especially if you have new recruits on their first raids.  <br />
<br />
Oh, since you haven't really ever raided before, and didn't know much about the projection, here is some more advice.  It prob doesn't matter much depending on how far your guild has actually progressed, however, ONLY HAIL THE PROJECTION ONCE.  Make sure before you do it, you have it targeted, and you are close and hail it once.  I say this because every time that it's hailed, it has a set number of flags it gives out, not based on players, but based on hails.  So, if it was supposed to give out 36 flags and you hailed it 10 times, then it would only give out a total of 26 other flags for everyone else.  This might not seem like a big deal right now, but whe you get into places where it only gives out a small number of flags compared to how many people you have, then it will be a big deal.  Also, sometimes you get yellow text with actual character flags when you hail.  Sometimes you get white text and what might not seem like a flag, but you did get one.  I suggest that you get close enough to hail, hail the person, then back off a sec and see if they said anything to you.  Every flagging mob will say something to you once you hail it if you are close enough.  If you get some form of text, then you got the flag, no matter the color.  This is pretty evident when you do things like Hall of Honor trials where the text they give you is white, not the normal yellow color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the input guys.  The guild may have said to hail him.  Beats me.  I may have missed it due to me talking with an officer regarding joining up with Guild.  Its no biggie really.  Live and learn I say.  For me it just will go under Murphy's Law.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
