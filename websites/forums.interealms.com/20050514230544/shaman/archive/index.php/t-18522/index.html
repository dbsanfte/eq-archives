They removed this penalty about a year ago.  You can aggro kite with dots and do full damage as a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fargonstuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is this the same for shammy?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fargonstuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sweet so let me get this straight... a necro and shammy can both snare a mob, and dot it and run in circles till it dies? With no DPS penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">correct</div></div><hr />

You can find more answers here I think:<br />

Anyway, necro gets root really late-- at level 34.<br />
<br />
However, you do get Hungry Earth (undead root) at level 16.<br />
<br />
Also, eventually, even though you start getting root later than shamans do, you end up getting your best roots before shamans do.</div></div><hr />

But look, don't be wasting your time on these n00bs anymore. Hightail it quick like over to the Necro boards and get in on da real low-low.<br />
<br />
You be like The Jefferson's man - movin on up! P}{4T L3wtz, Mad Playa Skillz and more Wood Elf honies than The Quon. Respect.<br />

Necromancers have almost as many roots as Shamans have. They get our 3 min root and our faster casting 1 min root. Both of those roots on both classes are level 60+ spells. Shamans however, get an AA (manaless) root that knocksback, is a DR root instead of MR, and can last a maximum of 2 minutes. I don't think Necromancers get any AA roots. And to make clearer, Shaman snare is an item(Not spell) that casts only for certain races.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Appearantly, I'm the only shaman who didn't get snare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Trolls get a snare necklace, the rest of us hire a gimp to snare for us with promises of phat lewtz... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Snare neck doesn't work so hot for aggro kiting since it has a 5 sec cast time and only lasts 36 secs.  Necro snare casts faster lasts a hell of a lot longer, a lot of their dots cast faster too. Plus they have the advantage of passive mana regen with lich.<br />
<br />
I do much better with root rotting. Of course until you get the curse dots, Ultor, Saryrn,  dots tend to break root too. <br />
<br />
Best bet is for me is to slow the mob, cast my dots, take the beating, root, back off heal dog. Repeat as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OMG that was good faern :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have that snare item, and I have to say, its only use is in dungeons to keep a mob from running.  I just don't see how anyone can use it to aggro kite with.  It takes forever for it to cast, gets resisted pretty easily, and on a mob with full hps, I almost don't think it even slows him down any. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion though, but if you want one, you gotta be a Innorruk(sp) follower.  Definately not a make or break item for shaman.  Nothing like the JBB or the Fungi Tunic was for me in the early levels.<br />
