<br />
If true, they refunding points or what?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No we still got spirit call, its just that there is now a spirit call 4 and 5, which has an effect of summoning 2 different wolves I think.</div></div><hr />
