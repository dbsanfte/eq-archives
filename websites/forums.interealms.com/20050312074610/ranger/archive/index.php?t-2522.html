<br />
Ive been trying to decide between Ranger and Paladin.  I like Paladins for the nobility and fire swords, but Archery has always been my favorite weapon in other games.  <br />
<br />
Since archery doesn't seem to be an option to use over swords until 60 is wanting to be a ranger for bows and arrows a bad way to look at the class? Granted they have some nice skills and abilities but if your not gonna get to 60 with a ranger, archery isn't really viable is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryce</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a Ranger because of the archery aspect.  I'm currently lvl 40 and my big goals are 51 for double bow damage, 55 for trueshot discipline and 60 then I plan on working on AAXP for things like Endless Quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeril of Veeshan</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason archery isn't viable to most people as a skill before 60 is because they don't focus on it.  If you give up your nice melee stuff for +dex gear and pass on expensive weapons and armor and save your money up for a DN bow or one of similar quality, then archery will surprise you with it's combat effectiveness.  But the common assumption in EQ is that it's a secondary skill, and that's how the treat it.  <br />
That being said, there's a serious lack of good dex stuff and good bows out there for lower level rangers.  But especially starting at 51 (double damage on non-rooted, non-moving mobs) it truly does become a viable alternative to melee fighting in over 80% of your encounters.</div></div><hr />

The reason archery isn't viable to most people as a skill before 60 is because they don't focus on it.<br />
<br />
Even with high dexterity, archery is not viable in most situations. I run 150 Dex unbuffed in most situations and easily can break 200. The problem isn't this stat. It is easy to get it high, even without Shaman buffs, without making hudge sacrafices to other things like HP or AC. The problem is how exp groups are and how zones are designed.<br />
<br />
Should I actually go into a zone, put up LFG then shout/auction/ooc/whatever for a group - I'll have a lot easier time getting a group as a light tank who buffs, snares and nukes than as a funky archer type.<br />
<br />
As for zones, it is kinda hard to use a bow when you are in cramped spaces. Bows cannot be used at melee range, which nullifies the skill everywhere that you have cramped spaces without much room to maneuver around. There are also line of sight issues which continue to plague this skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valencia</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if archery is the only overriding reason for you to be a ranger over a paladin, then you probably want to be a paladin.  For the most part, bows are used the same (i.e pulling mobs) for both classes until rangers get trueshot disc at 55.  Other than the trueshot disc, the only real difference is that rangers get crit shots with archery -- which don't amount to that much more damage pre-50.  Granted a ranger can bow-kite mobs much better using snare, most rangers prefer to solo using fear-kiting methods.<br />
<br />
The things that sold me on a ranger vs paladin are dual-wield, SoW, and tracking -- and I have no regrets whatsoever.  I prefer to be more of an offensive fighter vs a defensive one.  On the flip side, paladins get better AC, Hitpoints, heal spells (and rez later on), LoH, and spells/weapons geared towards undead mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainkng</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play both classes and as far as archery goes - Rangers own.<br />
<br />
Like Valencia said, with track and snare alone we make better use of this skill than any other class.<br />
<br />
Then add in our crits and bonuses post 50 and it seems pretty clear which class to pick.   ;) <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spidaaa</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would definately advise to go with a ranger, dual wield is really nice it hink,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offense or Defense?<br />
<br />
Altough we have some healing and buffs from our Druid parent, we deal damage via Dual Weild and Archery, and Paladins take it via better Armor, buffs and shield use.<br />
<br />
The higher you get the more you are going to outdamage a Paladin, and the more he is going to out tank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maed</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually we tank just as good as paladins at 60 IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to be too sassy, but how do you justify that?<br />
<br />
The Paladin, should have more AC per piece of Armor, more HP, a Shield and self buffs that favor defense.<br />
<br />
If you have a cleric casting CH, more HP is more efficient.<br />
<br />
I am not saying the ranger can't tank, but the ranger would have to have something (like a huge increase in defensive skills) to compensate for the obvious Paladin advantages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maed</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theyre armor would have the same AC because we both can use pretty much the same items at that lvl. they would get a little more HPs from being a paladin but our and their equip at that lvl have the same amount of HPs. we can also keep aggro off anyone and exp mobs at that lvl wouldnt be hard enough to make a cleric go oom because of a few HPs diff. in exp groups paladins and rangers tank almost the same with uber gear and on big mobs, neither can tank because they dont have defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am level 60 without AM 1 2 or 3.<br />
I use a Velium Recurved Bow 30/39.<br />
I have a fleeting quiver.<br />
I have fletching at 175 (but use summoned arrows due to the cost of using a quiver full of silver arrows).<br />
<br />
Archery sucks, it is nice to gasp at critical hits, but I score a little over double DPS with my melee versus a non trueshot fight. Unless you are willing to invest ~48 AAXP points then Archery is simply a waste of melee time.<br />
<br />
theyre armor would have the same AC because we both can use pretty much the same items at that lvl. they would get a little more HPs from being a paladin but our and their equip at that lvl have the same amount of HPs. we can also keep aggro off anyone and exp mobs at that lvl wouldnt be hard enough to make a cleric go oom because of a few HPs diff. in exp groups paladins and rangers tank almost the same with uber gear and on big mobs, neither can tank because they dont have defensive.<br />
<br />
Not even close to similar tanking abilities, the AC on our &quot;uber gear&quot; is not even in the same league, not to mention the fact that natural Defence &gt; AC from armor. Paladins in my guild are often substituted for warriors, they have the hitpoints to stay alive long enough for a CH chain to be effective on them and once a warriors /defensive discipline expires they are almost on par, except that the pally's can hold aggro a hair better with stuns, flash of light etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Bearing all that in mind, I would never even consider trading my ranger for any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elessar Elfstone</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on what situation you are talking about when comparing the damage taking abilities of Ranger vs Paladin.<br />
<br />
In exp groups and low dmg output mobs, Rangers are equal to Paladins, thats not hard to see. With our aggro abilities, Clerics dont have to worry about casting CH just a shade earlier because of our slighty lower hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm, paladins are a plate class, and their AC is about 100-200 higher than a ranger at level 60.  They also end up with hundreds more HPs, not 'a little'.  I group with a 58 pally friend on occasion, and the only thing that could make him lose aggro on a mob would be naughtiness on my part.  The difference between a well-played pally and a n00b is pretty major.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maed</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">plate and chain have nothin to do with the AC of the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shrug It all depends on the paladin.  I have more hp/ac than most of the Crusaders on my server, and when you couple that with vastly superior ability to acquire and maintain aggro, there shouldn't be any question about which of the two classes to use as a tank in an xp group.  Add to that the fact that we do significantly more damage, and there's even less reason to choose a paladin over a ranger.<br />
<br />
Go with the ranger, you'll enjoy it more than a paladin at high lvls.  Tho I have to admit to being a bit biased towards rangers :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiluvas</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think arrows are a great form of damage, even pre-50.  I'm only 28 and I use arrows in almost every fight.  I solo quite a bit, and with root/snare and bow kiting, it allows me to do &quot;free&quot; damage(not getting hit), almost taking them down to 50% health before root wears off.  Then I run in and melee it to death.  It might not be as effecient, but it cuts down on my downtime.  Downtime solo to me is death, nothing more boring, especially now that you can't alt-tab out of the game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannus Vidar</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try both up to 18 or so and see what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pal</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it was said before,Archery is a secondary skill,and there are just too many situations that wont let u use it,its still useless.How do you stop a bow shooting Ranger? Stand on a small hill. lol Besides,a well played non epic Paladin at 51 will outdamage a non epic Ranger at the same lvl. Thats with both not being Uber. As for playing them both to lvl 18,most people would go with the Paladin as they have Lay On Hands at lvl 1,can wear plate at lvl 1,and Paladin stuff is super cheap at least up to lower 50's lvl. Plus,a Ranger dont get duel weild until 18 I think.A Paladin can buy  a FBSS and with his haste spell has a Rangers epic haste,all for 3k at most maybe? Deepwater stuff for a Pally is dirt cheap,cheaper than Tolans even. As far as a Ranger peeling mobs off of a Caster,Paladin can do it just as easy if not easier. They have stun that really gets aggro,I know I have played both to lvl 54 and my Paladin could peel easily as good as the Ranger...but a Pallies root doesnt break mez.  A Paladin at 51 will be able to do awesome damage with a 2 hander which he could get a Arbitors Combine Greatsword for 1k and stay real close to a Rangers damage.Also, people say that a Paladins rez suks and people will get a Cleric rez,thats fine but for most of us that dont have the time to look for one,or none in zone, the Pally in your grp can restore most of your exp lost. Just get you some Jboots and sow aint that great as if they can usually outrun Jboots they usually can sow,but how many times would you have lived if you woulda had LOH? I could go on and on but I wont,if you want a challenge play a Ranger.I think it takes a good player to play one for the most part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the exception of BP and Shield/weapons, <br />
High end paladins and Rangers will be wearing virtually the same armor.  [Note] this is post sleepers.<br />
<br />
as to them having vastly more HP's... they get about 200 more from their age old HP bump, cause the knights complained that rangers had  as much AC as them... and they have an HP bump at 51 which we do not get... <br />
Of course one would have to asume that the paladin in question made correct choices in their gear set, which does not hold true for all cases.  <br />
<br />
The only aspect in which they have more HP is when it is a contest of self-buffs.  Other wise smart equiping will win out in the end.<br />
<br />
and on to the orginal topic~<br />
<br />
Paladin's and Ranger's are both very good classes.<br />
<br />
Paladin: Group heal, medium melee damage, Stun, good single shot healing, LOH, Anti-lich(as i call it), Self haste(25%), Rez, possibly best non-warrior tank for staying power.<br />
<br />
Ranger: Medium-low Healing potention, Good regen, High melee damage, Viable long range damage(at 60 w/AA), Best nuker of hybrids, SoW/Wolf form, ATK buffs!, Best agro management class.  <br />
<br />
but in the end you have to decide for yourself.</div></div><hr />

why? cause we can nuke them and run/hide and regen *g* how do ya like them apples? 54ran me &gt; 58 pally who got chloroblasted twice ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ashenshugar</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bow kiting is not really an option till the 50 levels although most rangers toy with it before then. I bow kited blues just to keep my archery skill maxed each level. What basically sucks though is this: Level 60 ranger with light velium bow and magic archery buff (read falcon eye) misses 3 out of 6 shots from 15 feet away....broken archery engine/los issues = big pita. <br />
<br />
Lvl 60 ranger, 30/40 bow, summoned arrows:<br />
low hit: 1 ;p<br />
avg hit: 60 to 80<br />
avg non-tshot crit: 148<br />
best non-tshot crit: 238<br />
best tshot crit: 738<br />
<br />
Until verant fixes the archery los issues archery is a seconday skill except for high-level raid situations. Obviously the AM skills change that, but I haven't found out yet :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive only been playing since january, and have managed to get up to level 38.. using a trueshot bow, but 90% of the time i have my Grail of Justice in my ranged slot instead &lt;sigh&gt; i do think archery, if only for rangers, should be improved pre-aaxp</div></div><hr />

Pathing is another major flaw in the skill, if anyone is in front of you you can't hit your target even if your 200 feet away and a gnome is standing in your way of  dragon. <br />
<br />
Yet I do love my bow when I get a chance to use it, mostly on raids useing /disc to keep the clerics from haveing to heal me right from the start. Other then that it is pretty much a waste of melee time, Verant should fix this, will they ? I doubt it very much , I think that somewhere down the line rangers should get to choose what they want to be their primary melee bow or sword and have a path of develoment that would enhance that skill, makeing rangers a unique class and not just considered another hybird.</div></div><hr />
