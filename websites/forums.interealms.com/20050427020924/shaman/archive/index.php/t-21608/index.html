<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>loobusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya , <br />
Although my Troll SK is lvl 56 I am having a blast powerleveling (2boxing) a barb shaman. I just went from lvl 14 to 27 in about 7 hours in Unrest, with no downtime. I was wondering if anybody more experienced in powerleveling using the Shadowknight Feign Death technique knew any good spots to level after lvl 28? anywhere with steady spawns and ease of pulling ,also prefferably bumped up experience modified zones would be appreciated. Anybody who would like to share some info is welcome.<br />
Many thanks !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exp mods are really nice.  2 months ago I would have recommended Gunthak harbor without hesitation; since the exp mod was bumped up a bit and a PoK stone was added the population has exploded (at least on my server) and its a bit harder to find a quiet spot to work in.  While before it was rare to see more than 3 people in the zone at any one time it now has more than 20 people at prime time.  Find a quiet spot there and go to town.  That should take you from about 28ish to about 38ish, when the exp goes from 2 or 3% per kill to 1% every 2 kills or so.<br />
<br />
After that, run over to Dulak..takes you to 45ish really fast.  If not there, then try Nurga.  Good exp mod, cash, and exp.</div></div><hr />

Playing two characters at once either on two separate computers or on one computer with two instances of EverQuest running.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thats why you use the lowest level snare as possible.<br />

Mid 30s+ SolB works great too.</div></div><hr />
