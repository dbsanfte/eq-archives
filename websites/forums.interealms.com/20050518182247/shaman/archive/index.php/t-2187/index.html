<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there much demand for any tradeskills?  I mean, Ive played off and on for 1.5 years...had a high level rogue, used poison for my own amusement.<br />
<br />
Now I have a shaman...up to level 14, casual player.  I did a search for tradeskills, and came up with some &quot;specific&quot; information...but Im wanting the &quot;big&quot; picture.<br />
<br />
Ive seen MANY more twinks since I played 9 months ago...why the hell would anyone want crafted armor when they can just twink out?<br />
<br />
Im just trying to find something fun to do besides kill mobs...then again...I want to have a positive impact on the community..and ummm...my pocketbook.<br />

I would definately recommend learning Tailoring at an early age and then USING all those pelts and threads you get to increase your skill.  I believe that you CAN make a profit tailoring at low levels (below 90) since 10-slot handmade backpacks are still in demand, and the MOBs that drop the raw materials are all within your reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lalorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No Sir there is not.  I am a master Smith, Brewer, Alchemist, fishing and tailor.  All take not much time but tailoring and not a single one has added to my poket book but Alchemy and only due to SOW potions.  There is no dening it there are some nice items out there but the time and effort you spend making them does not compute.  Some are fun and it is nice to have them if you need them but it is Truley a waste of time.  Jewlery is IMO the only one you can make good money at.  If I'm wrong please let me know.,<br />

One of my alts is working on the Shawl series. (Thurgadin-tm). Getting to 128 in pottery takes an hour. Brewing is quite similar.<br />
<br />
Tailoring and Tinkering (racial specific) are pains.<br />
<br />
BUT - there are some NICE items to be sold if you can collect all the parts. (Cough Artic Wyvern cough) and have a decent enough skill.<br />
<br />
I think it depends on your play style to an extent. If a casual day is VP clearing followed by a few Dragon slayings and Tormax then tradeskills probably aren't worth it time vs reward.<br />
<br />
For a semi-casual / semi-serious player like me, in a microscopic sized guild (Bracer of Benevolence fight took nearly all of us :)=) trade skills are a way to obtain a few items I couldn't get otherwise.<br />
<br />
IMO Tailoring at higher levels (&gt; 200) is worth it. Oh and have you seen the new Bow made by fletchers? 32 / 38 with a ton of stats.<br />
<br />
Alchemy imo is NOT worth the XK plat. ESPECIALLY with the new gate potions. (Pottery skill, same as the Thurg gate potion)  Time + Money v Reward is a joke insofar as Alchemy is concerned. Get to 62 (For 95% success rate) or so for SoW potions and spend your money elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I posted a response to a similar question in the alchemy section.  Someone asked which tradeskill in which to specialize.  My response was smithing or pottery.<br />
<br />
Alchemy can't be specialized, tailoring is an utter nightmare since materials for every single combine must be gathered (I'm at 155 and I have little interest in going high), brewing and cooking don't have much to offer as yet, jewelcraft will always be dominated by enchanters since only they can enchant the metal, and fletching is much the same with rangers (not to mention a small market).<br />
<br />
Tailoring is a good skill, and it's rare to find someone with a really high tailoring skill, but it does take a mashochist to get tailoring past 158.<br />
<br />
So, I would say smithing or pottery since both of those skills just got major upgrades and have some VERY nice items now.  The bad news is that you are very limited on time.  Right now (6/3/02) you can get up to 168 with banded fairly cheaply.  Fine plate will take you up to 205 or 225 (don't remember).  Unfortunately, I believe the patch on (6/5/02) is rumored to have some smithing nerfs.  I believe the trivials are about to be lowered substantially on banded and fine plate.  That will make it a lot harder to get the skills up.  I hope the rumor is wrong, but I don't think it is.<br />
<br />
So, yes, there is a market for high end pottery and high end smithing-but we are talking in the 250 skill range, and items very difficult to make.  Some of the spiritstones are going for 15kpp a pop.  I'm sure that the new crafted armors with 50+ac may do the same.<br />

<br />
Well there you go - I said BELOW SKILL 90 tailoring could be profitable.  You're a master, that's above 90.<br />
<br />
If you tailor as you level, and always hunt mobs that drop tailoring supplies, advancing to skill 80+ costs you nothing.  You can buy or kill for HQ bear pelts in the 50pp range and sell the backpacks for 90-100pp.  That's a profit.<br />
<br />
You go above 80+ and you have to start paying for supplies.</div></div><hr />
