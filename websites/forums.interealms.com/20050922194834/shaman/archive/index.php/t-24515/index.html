<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried a few tradeskills during my closed beta stint, but I never got around to Alchemy. So I'm curious whether those who do practice alchemy find it has utility or not. <br />
<br />
I think at the root of the Alchemy problem is and has always been stacking. The benefits of drinking a potion have always been weak compared to substitutes, and unable to stack for any benefit. Therefore, most potions were worthless in a raid scenario, and rarely useful in a group scenario. Now I see on Thottbot some quite powerful potions, and wonder if stacking is still an issue impeding utility of potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of my regular groupmembers does alchemy and we all love having A nice reserve of mana/heal potions when you need that little extra. I'm very appreciative of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My mage (level 25) does the Herbalist/Alchemist gig, Penny.  Without alchemy he would have a tougher time of it.<br />
<br />
Whenever he's in &quot;fighting mode (i.e. not just running around), he has  stamina (+ 100ish HP), AC (+50ish), and Intellect (+200ish mana) potions up (they last for an hour each) - the AC potion stacks with his personal AC buff.  He also keeps a stack each of mana replenish/heal potions on his quick bar.  He also keeps my level 25 Hunter in potions by emailing him stacks of the AC and Stamina potions.<br />
<br />
He doesn't need the underwater breathing potion (undead don't breath, but he has actually sold a few of them to folks in need (selling potions is normally not a money maker).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive been thinking about doing the alchemy/herbalism tradeskills for the mana/hp potions. Figure they will come in handy when soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I worked on herbalism/alchemy but it was only during the stress test.  I know at level 20 as a warlock, alchemy was very useful for soloing and grouping.  Since generally my pet tanked and warlocks get a spell that creates a heal stone I would imagine alchemy would be even more useful for other classes soloing.  The buff potions are very nice and stacked with all of my self buffs.  The heal potions are good for getting out of a jam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also found them extremely usefull during the stress test. Especially the mana, hp, regen, + hp buffs and many others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found that virtually all of the tradeskills I've tried (alchemy, tailoring, enchanting and blacksmithing) have provided me with tangible benefits by the time I reached L10.  That's impressive in my opinion.  I use alchemy a ton on my mage as well- he will be mailing potions by the stack to my other toons in short order in retail, have no doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I heard Mages have had their invisibility spell removed, meaning that invisibility potions will be in extremely high demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I worked with Alchemy.  Heres another thing about alchemy you may fight interesting:<br />
<br />
Of all the magic damage types (Frost, Fire, Arcane, Shadow, and Holy)  only ARCANE has a VERY limited number of spells that grant that resistance.<br />
<br />
I think the only class that has a resistance to Arcane magic spell is the Paladin, and it's an Aura (only one aura up at a time, it's really limited).<br />
<br />
Only ALCHEMY has potions that raise arcane resistance (Potions that grant to ALL resistances for a short period of time)<br />
<br />
This also makes it invaluable for PVP (the duration is pretty short on it)<br />
<br />
I prefered skinning/leatherworking with my hunter, more.  Skinning was MUCH easier to level up.  No hunting for herbs or mines, beasts that you can skin are all over.<br />
<br />
With herbalism, i found myself running into TONS of herbs that i couldn't gather because of skill limitations.  They are not all over, and unless you set aside quite a bit of time to skill up (or constantly go out of your way every time you can) it's a little tedious.<br />
<br />
Worthwhile, but tedious all the same.  :)    Alchemy is INCREDIBLY valuable also because a LOT of potions you make in alchemy are used by leatherworkers, and lets just say I would PAY ANY AMOUNT FOR SHADOW OIL! I can't find ANYONE selling that stuff.  There needs to be more alchemists. :D<br />
