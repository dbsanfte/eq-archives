<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whiskerz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I have noticed that Totemic armor can't be worn by Vah Shir is there any other armor quests I can do to get some decent armor??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Huh?  Are you sure it can't be worn by Vah Shir?  If you're looking at online descriptions they were probably formulated before Vah Shir existed.<br />
<br />
However, totemic is a waste of time in this day and age.  Get Ry'Gorr, about the same cost but better armor, or save up and get some Jaundiced Bone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Vah Shir I can testify that totemic can indeed be worn by us. I wore the helmet in my younger days. Probably used the boots too, but my memory isn't that great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Whiskerz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK thanx alot  will look into the Ry'Gorr  I am only lvl 32 can I get that yet?  Where can I find info on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bleh on JB armor. Mix and match your armor with things that grant you the best amounts of AC/HP and then Wis/Resists for your money.<br />
<br />
As to where the information is located, why in the bazaar of course. (If you don't have SoL yet, you may as well not even be playing this game. The bazaar is more then worth the box price.) Besides, who has never heard of Allakhazams?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We Vah Shir can wear Totemic, here is a screenshot of my younger self, with a full set of Totemic armour.<br />

Whilst I would agree with other posters that there are better armours available in the bazaar, probably for less than the cost of the Dufrenite, I would encourage you to do the quests if you want to. I enjoyed them immensely, and felt a great sense of achievement in having a full set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wore full banded once. Then full totemic. Then full rune etched. Then (almost) full wolf callers. Now I'm working on scaled avatar's - got the arms so far.</div></div><hr />
