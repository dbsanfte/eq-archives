Looks like some of these zones are dungeons/troll cities.<br />
<br />
Mmmmmm killing trolls for xp, sounds fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is the gateway to the lair of the Broken Skull Clan. It serves as the home for the newly recruited clan members and temporary housing for anyone that the clan trusts just enough not to kill outright. <br />
<br />
Gulf of Gunthak - leads to Dulak Harbor  which is home for the newly recruited clan members?   Faction based on Broken Skull Clan but another starter city?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Dulak's Harbor lies in a vast cavern beneath the rocky island. The troll marauders have built their dark, rough town along the calm shores of the harbor. Most of the expected amenities are available here, if you're a member of Clan Broken Skull. Taverns, crew quarters, stores, docks, and shipyards fill the city. Rails can be seen in parts of the city, and following them one way could lead an adventurer to the refinery and the nearby smiths. Luggalds guard the temple, the most unusual and unpleasant building in town. Anyone foolish enough to get close to the temple is engulfed by the palpable fear and hate that seep from within. <br />
<br />
Starter city?    &quot;if you're a member of Clan Broken Skull.&quot;   How else can you be a member without a starter city.    &quot;Anyone foolish enough to get close to the temple is engulfed by the palpable fear and hate that seep from within.&quot;  Hate and Fear is Inny and CT ... woot temples.   Plus if this is the new starter city  for Trolls it would explain why it only goes to lvl 60.   <br />
<br />
Time will tell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like I didn't hate the existing boat rides enough already - they apparently have added new ones.  Whee.  I really hope there's a pok portal installed at release!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yay more trolls to kill :D<br />
<br />
The screen shots look very atmospheric, I hope the zones live up to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I play an expansion purely for eye candy... Very nice.<br />
<br />
And heck, just the concept of troll pirates and catfish-men sounds nice.</div></div><hr />

Ever try doing Kael quests on a weekend?<br />
<br />
me: &quot;Whaddaya mean the questgiver is on a 8 hour respawn??&quot;<br />
GM: &quot;yup.&quot;<br />
me: &quot;A horde on newB's just took it out and don't understand that this mob is essential to the 20 week long Plane of Spoons key.&quot; <br />
GM: &quot;ahh.&quot;<br />
me: &quot;Can I at least get a respawn to facilitate the process a bit before I need to have my chair surgically removed because I have been sitting for 20 weeks?&quot;<br />
GM: &quot;umm, nope.&quot;</div></div><hr />
