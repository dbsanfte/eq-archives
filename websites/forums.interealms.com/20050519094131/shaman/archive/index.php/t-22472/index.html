<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfawx Bertie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dilemma<br />
<br />
I have my Shaman at level 50 now and I am thinking about creating a soloing partner for him but I am having a real hard time deciding what to choose.<br />
<br />
I basically want the best combination for taking out big mobs solo. Being able to stop the running, gating and chealing mobs is very important so Monk is out of the question because they cannot stop any of those mob abilities. Also, the abilty to snap aggro away from Shaman is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Current shortlist<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight<br />
Necromancer<br />
<br />
Are these the only two viable options? <br />
<br />
Has anyone got any other ideas on what would make a great partner for a Shaman?</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) Shamans can stop runners.<br />
<br />
b) Chealing mobs isn't really that big of an issue.  If you can handle the mob 1x, you can handle him 2x.  :)<br />
<br />
c) Gating mobs - I can't think of a named mob where gating is the reason I can or can't solo him.<br />
<br />
I'd be more worried about <br />
a) Mobs that Summon <br />
b) Mobs that hit for a TON<br />
<br />
Paladin or SK would be my choice. Warrior might be nice as well.</div></div><hr />

My shaman spends a lot of his time duoing with an SK and he seems to pretty much fit the bill for everything you would want in a partner.<br />

PS<br />
Why do people who 2 box when they have 2 char on still call it soloing :)Always tickled me that 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are other good choices, but those are the two winners.

<br />
The method I generally use if I pull a known gater is I don't root or snare the mob but take him down quick.  They usually won't gate if they're in flee mode... the minute I root or snare them --- boom, they start casting the gate spell.  So... don't root or snare 'em.  I generally break out a nuke and make sure I've got my biggest DoT on them as they're fleeing... kill 'em before they get to far.<br />
<br />
Of course this doesn't always work, but it can.  I use it in Tactics all the time on those damn gate-happy Oracles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wizz<br />
Mage<br />
Necro<br />
Warr<br />
SK<br />
Monk.<br />
<br />
My favorite is the SK.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Snare is Important when duoing, and you dont have time to swap in weapons so that kinda cuts out the warr.<br />
<br />
Rangers cant tank.<br />
<br />
Monks get huge dmg spikes and the one serious flaw in shaman healing is time to cast. Having the ability to lifetap of run out of range while snared is useful.<br />
<br />
Necro's are almost as busy and shamans with the amount of spells they cast.<br />
<br />
Pets cant tank above pop lvl 1.<br />
Wizzies break root.<br />
<br />
Phew.<br />
<br />
I like my sk best.<br />
<br />
FD means you can duo in solro and other high xp places.<br />
<br />
Snare means malos/time snare to land just after/slow can usually be achived before the mob hits camp.<br />
Pet/Pet.<br />
<br />
Shaman lays three dots on the mob, Q to sk, fear fear whilst autocanni script runs (canni4 *5)<br />
<br />
The thing with the sk/sham duo is they dont have great burst dmg. They just have great sustained dps.<br />
<br />
Sham dots and sk mana taps mean i can sustain very decent long term dps. Therefore its better agains long fights not short fights.<br />
<br />
IE whilst its fun, we are being designed out of the game 8)<br />
<br />
Having one of you duo partner with FD is a life saver. Cause when the **** hits the fan, FD one char and concentrate on saving the other means you usually get out alive.<br />
<br />
Trying to run two chars to the zone makes both dead and you usually train someones arse.<br />
<br />
Best fun duo was probably necro/mage under 60. But they are seriously gimped once fear no longer works.<br />
<br />
Post 60 SK Sham is just fun. But beware that you tend to develope a slow steady rote to playing, layering up dots, strategiacally placing pets for rear access, planing spawn locations ahead that many more recent players of the &quot;boom boom its dead, now i can med&quot; variety get frustrated with 8)<br />

Laters all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I play the decreasingly popular shm/monk duo.  Shaman is at 3000+ hps and 4100+ mana, while the monk will be approaching 4k hps with a few more AAs (ND3 and PE).  Shaman has 150ish AAs, while monk is pushin 90.<br />
<br />
I guess I could put it this way --- damn near any non-pure-caster can tank decently with all their defensive AAs.  Hell, my shaman can solo in Tactics, straight up tanking a slowed mob and keeping Q on him with little concern and he only has LR5 (currently working on ID5).  So if a shaman can do it... well even a monk with their vaunted mitigation nerf can do it.  In fact, mine does it all the time.  He's got LR2 and that's it... on the rare double pulls, he will successfully tank 2 Tactics mobs at once with merely a Q on him..  sometimes throwing a Tnarg's to recover from spike damage.  But it's not like it isn't manageable.  I end those fights with plenty of health and mana.<br />
<br />
Yes, level and AA and gear makes a difference...  I won't lie.  But eventually, you'll have that, so in the end, whether you have a SK or pally or monk or whatever --- you'll be able to do what you wanna do.  The monk does some nice DPS while providing slightly less tanking ability, but then again a monk can mend for over 2000 hps ever few mins or so.  A monk has some nice discs that can come in real handy.  On those rare double pulls, I nail my auto-riposte disc and proceed to lay the absolute smack-down on 2 mobs at once for about 15 secs.  Surprisingly, the monk keeps decent agro once the mob is past 80% health or so...   not like I have a ton of mana left after I malos, slow, cripple and throw a Q on the monkie, but I can usuallyl throw a DoT or 2 and not worry 'bout losin agro.  If I do.. the monk has it back in no time.  Monks do nice DPS that the mob doesn't ignore.  Even tanking and with a weak 2-hander, I exceed 100 DPS.<br />
<br />
On top of that, dungeon crawling is a blast with a monk simply for lull and FD...  there's not much I can't split and quickly with those 2 monk tools.  When the ****e hits the fan I can at least FD the monk and gate the shaman.  There's no zone I can't get out of with my monk using fast sprinting, FD, mend, regen and lull.... monks don't get stuck.  :)<br />
<br />
The combo does have it's limitations... I crave snare and stun...  I wish the monk could taunt just a little better but not a huge issue...  but other than that, it's a fun combo.<br />
<br />
What's great about the combo is when I 2-box in a full group...  I don't have to worry 'bout my shaman duties AND tanking...  and the monk is always welcome for his pulling and DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Paladin is my favorite choice. Paladin can stun to take aggro and help on resisted slow plus he can heal a bit extra to help your healing when you need to debuff or or slow...<br />
<br />
SK's are also good for a lot of reasons, they can help heal themselves, can feign-pull and lots of nice stuff.<br />
<br />
Warrior is good but lacks a bit of utility you find in SKs and Paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Runners up:<br />
BL - Great DPS little healing needed<br />
Zerker - with their stun AND snare capabilities they make a fun addition to duo with but it's probably hard to two box with them (that and they can go down as fast as a ranger)<br />
<br />
Favourite:<br />
SK - Shaman/SK combo is deadly  Take the Tank with the most utility and the Support class with the best utility and you have an AWESOME combonation.  Each has cababilities that mask the others weekness.  An Sk's taps aren't enough to heal him and a Shaman is on the low end of the healers (pre-torpor, Q, etc., get a CHeal last), but together it works great.  You have Snare, Root, FD for Crowd control.  A good SK knows how to keep agro. hint: cast Clinging Darkness twice on incoming and the mob is yours for the fight in most cases. Neither has great DPS, but together they can do alot of damage.  Don't be fooled by the big HT's you see put out an SK's sustained DPS isn't great.  Two Pets - yes the SK pet is very green but it's still the most mana efficient Dot your Sk will get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Windham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like Rangers. They can tank giants in BoT with only Q on them as well. I usually do the tanking and they do the bowing in most cases.<br />
<br />
As for gaters and runners, things don't run when there's a friend of their's near 'em and things don't gate if you fight them within a range of about 150 to their bind (200 range is normal casting distance and 60 is normal buffing AE).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm doing a monk myself. I really enjoy the class. He's only 36 atm so I still have some work to do. I bought him 2 velium inlaid claws for when he hits 60, only 10k each 17/20 with 80hp's. <br />
<br />
I was also reading that the ac soft cap and midigation for the monk are finally being looked into so I am hopeful.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like the sk a lot but I just don't want to deal with a caster/hybrid. I also did a necro as well. It worked out fine but not for me. I've tried the bl too but I found if the mob was a few levels higher then the bl pet, the pet procs were almost useless and again, another caster/hybrid with the same spells that I already have.<br />
<br />
My vote goes for monk for the fun factor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a baby (level 55) SK that I dont PL, but am working up slowly so I can really get a feel for the class...paladins offer stackable hp buffs for us, but overall the SK has tons more utility, corpse summons when you get too fruity, pet pulls/FD pulls, snare, and you really really have to work to get aggro from a SK, toss 3 Clinging Darkness on a mob and its yours lol. The paladin offers the stackable buffs (never bad), rezzes (again never bad) and some spot heals if your in trouble.<br />
I also have a rogue that I tool around with and duo with a lot, but as I climb up the ladder in levels, AA and content, he gets less viable, as me tanking and him backstabbing gets hard to control.<br />
Overall a good plate class cant be beat.</div></div><hr />

I did search and decided to post anyway for some fresh input - glad I did, lots of cool information to read. :)<br />
<br />
Okay, I'll be the first: If you take a partner, you're no longer soloing.<br />
<br />
Soloing as in nobody else in the group except for other characters I control. Playing the game by myself as opposed to playing with other human beings.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
Seems like SK, Ranger and Pally all have great qualities. It is really hard to decide what to do actually.<br />
<br />
Pally - Tank, Stun and Rez<br />
SK - Tank, Snare and FD<br />
Ranger -  Tank and Track</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rangers cant tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rocks to that.  I have a 57 ranger on my second account.  He can tank Kriegers in BoT with no problems.  Fully buffed he has only about 4.5K hp.  If I can slow it the 57 ranger can tank it.  Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">tough question,  It's all situational with what your goals are I would presume.  I tend to use my 65 monk or another 65 necro. Both with FD, makes pulling named easier, although the necro at times is better at it with snare. If the mob summons, then i go with the monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pally - Tank, Stun and Rez<br />

<br />
Hmm, Rangers dont have Snare now?  Odd figureing a Rangers snare is better then a SK (slower move, longer duration, no DoT that breaks mes).<br />
<br />
Oh, and Rangers can tank.  A Elem geared ranger can tank any non-elem zone, most of Earth and the db side of Water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But an equivelently geared plate tank will tank significantly better.<br />
<br />
Hell with enough healing power a chanter can tank.<br />
<br />
Doesnt make it effective though.<br />
<br />
In SolRo Once the mob is slowed I dont need to heal my SK.<br />
<br />
This means I can go into a dot/dot/dot Q then autocanni button cycle and know that at the end of it my sk will still be alive not raped by a set of lucky hits.<br />
<br />
And i have also regenned all the mana expended during the fight slowing and healing.<br />
<br />
Making it a continuous pull stream as fast as i can kill them.<br />
<br />
I doubt I could do that with a non plate tank. Unless of course they were very nicely geared.<br />
<br />
Sheet my sk is still sub 100 in aa's and hasnt got all his defensives, just working on LR now. I have duoud there with a very well equiped monk and he tanks better, but he is also 5 years worth of work, very very nice gear and 500odd aa's.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
If you want to build a good fun duo set, plate tanks are easier.<br />
<br />
But the wonderfull thing about this is that everyone has an opinion. Mine is just one of having experimented with a number of combinations over the past few years and finding the one I enjoy the most.<br />

Tanking below your level isn't really tanking. Practially every class can make that claim.</div></div><hr />

Infact I think it is the strongest and most well rounded duo in the game with any two classes.<br />
The buffs stack perfectly.  You can still crank out some DoT damage, cause the Paladin can hold aggro so well.  Stun works great to stop runners and gaters.  Paladin can tank very well.  Quick group healing and emergency LoH.  <br />
<br />
All this, and you get a decent rez if things go bad in some backwoods zone where you can never find a cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Best soloing partner for Shaman?<br />
<br />
None, because if you have a partner, you're no longer soloing!  GUFAAAAW!<br />
<br />
I have fond memories of duoing with a necromancer while leveling up.  I'd say how good it is depends on how moronic or smart your partner is.  There's a large variance these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sladeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you're &quot;creating&quot; a solo partner as in for 2boxing it probably would be best to go with a melee class like the SK or monk.<br />
<br />
But if you're duoing with someone else there's really no other class that can compare to the necromancer.  For exp necros are killing machines.  For taking named mobs it's only a matter of you landing slow.  In some cases I think a good necro that's firing on all cylinders is almost as good as having a full group.  With FD they should practically never die and they can summon corpse and 93% rez if anybody does.<br />
<br />
If you're still not sure take a look at their spell list on Lucy and check out their AA tree.  The only problem is finding a necro that's willing to share the loot.   :D</div></div><hr />
