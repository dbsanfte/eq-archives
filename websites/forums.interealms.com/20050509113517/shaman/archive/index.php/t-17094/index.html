I use it without fail every single time we're in Plane of Water, and so do almost all of our shaman as well.<br />

Call me stupid but I find it annoying to be unable to tell when I'm sitting or not. I dont use hotkeys for sitting/standing, I use Ctrl-S. There's absolutely no way for me to tell if I'm sitting or standing and it becomes a pain in the ass. Its just not worth it for 2 points of regen and, what, 50 mana?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, I often use bear form when I can't use my lizard.  Why not?  When in bear form, I just make sure I have the page up that shows whether I'm standing or sitting, as I use ctrl-S to stand and sit also.  It's pretty easy to tell anyway:  if I can't move, I'm sitting. [grin]<br />

<br />
Naagruz, I must disagree.  I am a fashionable cat [at least I want to be], and it galls me to have my lip hanging down when in bear form.  Maybe trolls aren't as as concerned about appearance, but this kitty likes to appear at her best when slaughtering.  And if you aren't using bear form, why do you care what it looks like?   :p</div></div><hr />

Once i got canni4 i stopped sitting entirely, and once i got torpor i only sit if i'm in about to camp out or if i'm memming a spell.  Saying that, the only time i use bearform is if i'm tradeskilling as 2 points of regen a tick and 10 wis doesnt do much anything for me any other time.  So i dont care if bearform animation is a bear in a pink tutu; i'd MUCH rather they fix other issues rather than give us a bear form animation.</div></div><hr />

I don't use it all that often, but for some situations it's handy. Using it whilst pulling in LDoN means I don't have to call an incoming cos they can see a white meteor barrelling down the hallway at them for starters :)  The wis isn't all that useful really, never run low enough to make it count, but the regen all adds up and anyway us bears gotta do our bit to annoy the casters by blocking out their view, right? ;)</div></div><hr />

Then when a bear stops moving, I stop with it.  Get my targets and attack out of nowhere.  Its great, plus you blend in with the white of the snow :).<br />

<br />
 Personally, I make everything I use even semi-often into a hotkey, and use the bank-switching feature (SHIFT+number) to switch banks.  I only have 5 banks of hotkeys filled, and many of them were leftover from teaching languages many years ago.  I have a macro button specifically for &quot;/sit off&quot;, as well as the normal toggling sit/stand button (I usually just type &quot;/sit off&quot; into the chat window though, if I need to make sure I am standing).<br />
<br />
I cast shrink on myself in bearform and I get back the &quot;raising/lowering&quot; of my view when I sit/stand in first person view, although the bear model doesn't actually change in 3rd person view.  If I dont shrink myself in bearform, others usually bug me until I do it anyway, so I always just cast shrink right after bearform. <br />
<br />
One advantage of bearform that I like is that it is much easier for others to determine if I am being hit, as long as they have their sound turned on.   If they hear the bear repeatedly making his &quot;being hit&quot; roar, they know I am in trouble and not just cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
Bearform also gives the added advantages of being able to look through walls, and to squeeze between players and NPCs that I normally wouldn't fit inbetween.<br />
<br />
Bearform also activates my charm that only works if I am in illusion form :) <br />
<br />
And last, and probably most important, bearform hides the fact that my current armor set looks like a clown suit :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why did I use bearform?<br />
<br />
For the whopping 10 WIS and 2HP/tick? Um, not for a looong time.<br />
<br />
I used it because it's a unique feature of the class and the cute face was adorable. NPC bears either had the long nose (polars) or the gimp lip. It was fun to be a cute bear.<br />
<br />
Do you need a reason other than &quot;it's fun&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I stopped using Bear Form in most zones when I bought a lizard. Bear Form is also a bad idea for large race Shaman in LDoN, since Slam is our only way to stun/interupt casters (other than pet bashing, which we can't &quot;time&quot; to the casters spell). <br />
<br />
Also, I never sit. Ever. I cannot remember the last time I sat, other than to mem spells. I generally melee (if there is room around the mob) while I canni, just to add a little extra damage and get some HPs back from the Lifetap aug I bought. I canni non-stop while I melee, in general. Even if I am not meleeing, and not canning, I do not sit. Sitting is a bad bad habitto get into. As you get higher level, it will become a REAL problem. Especially if a cornered mob you have slowed decides to come charge you the instant you sit. Your guildies won't appriciate it, and the excuse &quot;sorry, habit&quot; isn't gonna make it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You think you got problems.<br />
These days when I cast bearform it gives me polar bear body, brown bear head, except for snout which is polar bear. Weird! (and why?)<br />
<br />
The reasons I use bearform are <br />
1. On PvP server, it is a good idea to hide your visible gear graphics - i.e. not let everyone know whether or not you have your epic, for example<br />
2. On a PvP server, it is sometimes good to underplay your level, so brown bearform can get people off guard<br />
3.If I'm not melee-ing against casters (no slam with bearform) the +wis and +regen don't do any harm<br />
<br />
Reasons i don't use bearform<br />
1. In mass PvP (i.e. more than 12 people) shaman are 1 of the very first classes targetted. Nothing says &quot;kill me&quot; like a big white fat polar bear<br />
2. In PvP (or PvE) against casters, slam is very important</div></div><hr />

You sit? why? for CC I can understand but surely you know you just hit CTRL-S and you will be standing by the time you get hit or root the mob.<br />

<br />
Yep, you're not the only one - it happens to me too.<br />
<br />
I don't often use bearform - mostly only for fun, to demonstrate shaman ice skating.(*)<br />
<br />
2hp a tick isn't a lot, and I'm currently wis capped until I work on Planar Power. The main reason I would use it other than fun is that you don't see a change in view when you briefly mem a spell. I use bear form in PoWater especially sometimes because of this - when you're swimming and sit, you sit down briefly, then appear to stand up due to the swimming motions, even if you're still sat down. This annoys me, but goes away with bear form.<br />
<br />
Some people don't like the fact you can't see whether you're sitting or standing, but for me, that's the main reason I'll use it!<br />
<br />
However, for the most part, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits - you can't use it while mounted, it takes up a buff slot, it's large and gets in the way even when shrunk.<br />
<br />
(*) For those who don't know how to shaman ice skate - find a largish level area, cast bear form, and crouch. Move around crouched, and you appear to skate - take off crouch briefly from time to time to add to the effect. :)</div></div><hr />

One day I'll get around to it, but for now it's nice for groupmates sanity to not think a polar bear jumped in behind them in the EF dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as not knowing if you're sitting, I keep pretty good mental track, and I use the left and right arrow keys to &quot;rock&quot; back and forth a bit if I'm not sure.  Also, usually the SIT/STAND button in my Actions window is visible and that'll tell me.  I enjoy not bopping up and down when cannidancing, although to tell the truth since getting Canni V I don't really sit down much at all.</div></div><hr />

I do not need the 10 wisdom, I do not need the 2 regen, and the vast majority of the time I do not sit.<br />
<br />
I just like bearform.  When I got in the habit my armor looked a complete mess (PoHate + PoG + misc + no dye), but fashion alone did not make me like bearform.  I am not fond of stand/sit graphics, but that really didn't make a difference.  <br />
<br />
I think one of the things that made me really appreciate bearform was the visibility.  Yes, my server is blue, and if you are leading a raid, or even officer/assist leading a raid then it doesn't hurt to have a HUGE WHITE ARSE so that people know to stay behind you, or not to fall behind the rest of the group depending where you stand.<br />
<br />
It also cuts down on the tells for buffs when I am dead.  Polar bear corpse is pretty darn obvious :p</div></div><hr />

Easy to fix. Just make hotkeys for your spells that always start with the line:  /sit off<br />

The extra wis is nothing for me, I max without any mind buffs anyhow.  The regen, well, isn't worth it in my opinion.  It's a whole points every tick.  2 points isn't gonna do much.

And if you've never noticed, bearform + 2 shots of shrink = ability see thru walls.  Wanna know what's around the corner in LDoN?  Press your face against the wall.  BTW, that's also true if you sit on a horse and shrink yourself twice too.<br />
