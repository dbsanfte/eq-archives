<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not played or looked at anythign for EQ for around 3 months now so I dont know if this is old news or not?<br />
<br />
But I was looking at the spells on Allakhazam's and saw that they now list spells for all classes up to lvl70.<br />
<br />
I see that we get a new Dog Dog at lvl66 and we now have a Dam Mod for 5% at lvl68 but Druids get the same spell at lvl67 - Odd?<br />
<br />
We get a spell for the chance to avoid melee by 7% But I dont see any Agi along with this buff? So does that mean we will be casting Agi and then the new Spell taking up a much needed buff slot?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think anyone casts the current agi on raids/groups anymore, so we shouldn't need to cast 2 of them.  BUT this new one will requre a new buff slot, but SoE has said they are thinking about adding more buff slots...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't bother casting Agility in the first place, it's not worth it now and it'll most likely not be worth it after OoW unless they add in some new modifiers on how stats benefit you. <br />
<br />
The new +7% to avoidance should be worth it though. Taking up an exta buff slot sucks but at least new buff slots can be added via AA. (I'd rather they just increase buff slots regardelss)<br />
<br />
Nothing has been finalized with the spells though. We still have several up there that are called Omens:Spell01 which are carbon copies of old spells. Either they'll be upgraded before OoW goes live or be taken out completely and &quot;maybe&quot; hopefully replaced with something nice and new rather than just another upgrade.<br />
<br />
But don't hold your breath.</div></div><hr />

Yah no kidding, they should up it to 20 for everyone and then allow people with 1000aa's to buy more if they want em. Even in exp groups I'm maxed all the time and last night had to keep yelling at the pally to click off something so I could land Q on him. If I had had my cleric in the ldon I would have let the mobs debuff him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I still cast Wrulan just like I cast Diaku, but that's because I am a perfectionist :) Right after I cast them, I /gsay &quot;Feel free to remove useless group buffs at will&quot; and let melees decide which buffs they consider useless. Of course, FA makes the whole thing rather pointless even if your groupmates' stats are not maxed, but oh well.<br />

Would you happen to have a link to this proposed [edit: OOW] AA? I must have missed it - all I have seen on the boards so far has been complaining about SOE being silent on [edit: OOW] AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OoW you mean? Or Worlds of Warcraft?</div></div><hr />

Oops! Changed &quot;WOW&quot; to &quot;OoW&quot; above :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also really want to know how we will be getting these new spells?<br />
<br />
I liked the way for the most part they Did PoP spells. I just hope we can go and buy the new pet spell?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I woudn't know where to look. It was a while ago and wasn't part of an actual list rather they had mentioned they would be letting the buff bar be increased via AA. No word on how many AA's  it would be.<br />
<br />
Given that they had mentioned it leads me to believe they will go ahead with it. There's no reason not to let it be increased when 15 slots isn't enough especially with new useful buffs under way.<br />
<br />
As for buffing Agility, be warned I know a lot of melees who won't take off buffs regardless of how useless they are. I gave up telling Shamans on my raids not to buff Agility because some people just don't want to believe it's as useless as so many parses have proven. I lost count of how many times I've had to send a direct tell to a melee that he has to click off Agility so my Q will heal him.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, I guess we will have to wait a bit longer...<br />

<br />
That's just natural selection in action :)<br />
<br />
Edit: It is actually worse when you find yourself on the other side of the buff. I have been tempted to hit Disband more than once when my Monk was pulling and the Druid kept reapplying group DS after being told three times not to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They sure do put a lot of thought into the new spells don't they?<br />
<br />
Focus increase 163 hp 29%<br />
9 increase 187 hp 30%<br />
Symbol increase 275 hp 30%<br />
Brell's increase 100hp 28%<br />
<br />
30 second spell creation, copy, paste, add dumb new name, increase 30% and done. <br />
<br />
I've seen more creativity from microsoft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dark, if it makes you feel better, not everything is a 30% increase.  Consider:<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Poison DoT upgrade--30%<br />
Magic DoT upgrade--30%<br />
<br />
Necro:<br />
Poison DoT upgrade--30%<br />
Magic DoT upgrade--56%<br />
Magic DoT upgrade (ancient)--86%<br />
<br />
Not everyone is getting flat 30% upgrades!  Doesn't that make you feel better?  :)<br />

<br />
They must be run out of ideas for new AA. this one is a horrible idea.<br />
<br />
How about add some more spell gem slot via AA?? I think this should be more useful instead.<br />
