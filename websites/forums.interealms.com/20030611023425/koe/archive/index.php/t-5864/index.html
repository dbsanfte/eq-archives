<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It was 6 months ago that innocent blood was shed on a bright September 11.<br />
A day none will forget.<br />
A day where the greatness of a nation was put to a horrible test.<br />
From the ashes, and infamy of that day a terrible resolve was born in the hearts and souls of the Greatest nation on earth. A resolve to make the planet a safer place for our children, our mothers fathers sisters and brothers.<br />
<br />
I am proud to be a Canadian, and I am equally proud to have a neighbour to the South called the United States of America. I have not forgotten your sacrifice my friends, and take pride in the way that your nation responded to these acts of barbarism. Somewhere in a basement dark and dank where insidious plans are laid there sits a group of terrorists quaking with fear, with the profound knowledge that America and her allies are coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
/salute America</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;September 11 was not the beginning of global terror, but it was the beginning of the world's concerted response.  History will know that day not only as a day of tragedy, but as a day of decision, when the civilized world was stirred to anger and to action.  And the terrorists will remember September 11 as the day their reckoning began.&quot; - President Bush today<br />
<br />
I know for me at least, seeing the outpouring of support from around the world, including our great friends to our North, Canada, has really made me feel secure and comforted in knowing that we are not alone in this.<br />
<br />
God bless the USA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As half a year goes by since the attack, one is beckoned to remember those that have given their lives making this, not only country, but continent, the best in the world.  The two nations that have sat besides each other for over 200 years have countless amounts of good intentioned souls to help out in times like these.<br />
<br />
The prayers and thanks continue from this U.S. Citizen to all those deserving and needing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My thoughts and prayers remain with those in the field, carrying the fight to our enemies, as well as those who carry the burden of the deaths and tragedy of that day.<br />
<br />
I doubt this war will ever truly be over, but I am damn proud that we are now fighting it openly, with power and conviction.<br />
<br />
I think of a sky filled with fighters, bombers and helicopters, and swarms of men carrying rifles and grenades, of 1000 pieces of artillery pounding away.<br />
<br />
To Osama, and all people like him - we are coming for you, and judgement will be harsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am still teared when it comes to the thoughts of 9/11. Every day I am at work I am reminded because new processes that come up at least every month.<br />
<br />
Maybe just maybe one day we can truely be free again.</div></div><hr />
