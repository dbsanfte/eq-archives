<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have yet to buy LDoN, but am going to do so fairly soon. I do have a pretty dumb question though.<br />
When you gather your points, and then decide to purchase a bonus for your equipment (ex. tunic), does that bonus apply only to the tunic you own at that time? Or, when you upgrade your tunic (from polished tin mail, to tae ew for ex), will that bonus you purchased carry forward.<br />
No clue if that made any sense, hopefully someone can understand this )<br />

<br />
An augmentation boost only one item, not the slot.<br />
So if you augment your BP and change it later, you lose the benefit of the augmentation (as you don't use anymore your old bp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats what I kinda figured.<br />
So I guess you should be fairly content with your current gear before plugging mass points into upgrading your prophets robe or whatever. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The upside of LDoN equipment it that it allows many people to buy high quality equipment with adventure points that they would never otherwise own.  The down side is that it’s all no drop.  So yes, you should be very careful about what equipment you buy.  That’s why I feel LDoN is not as good an expansion for lower level characters as it is for 60 plus characters.  If you’re a lower level character saving points for mid level LDoN armor, those points are almost wasted because all you can do is trash that armor if you get better.  And if you later save points for the high-end armor for your class you have to start saving points from scratch.  Still, the adventures are fun and you get good experience, decent cash and often upgrade equipment that drops from named mobs.  So it’s not such a bad deal.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that if you add an augmentation to a tradable piece of equipment that items becomes no drop.  You can buy something to remove the augmentation, but the augmentation will be destroyed in the process.  So if you win a roll on a nice augmentation that drops during an adventure, such as +6 to stamina, be sure to place it in an item you plan to keep for a long time.</div></div><hr />
