This is what i used to get quite a lot.<br />
Was told that its apparently Windows (XP esp bad ) leaking memory.<br />
No one really seemed to know an easy solution to this so i reinstalled Windows and now seems to be working fine.<br />
Sorry i know this isnt helpful if youve got a ****load of stuff on your pc but i run EQ off of its own hard drive so i only had to reinstall that drive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was getting that a lot when I would be running two accounts. I dropped in another 512 stick a couple months ago and havent seen the message since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now I have another problem. I got another stick of ram, and whenever I try logging in both chars my computer reboots. This seems more likely to happen if my computer has been on for a while. I took out the second ram and it still does this. <br />
<br />
Could my videocard be overheating? It feels warmer than usual (I think). What can I do to prevent this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On a side note, I'm running the two accounts on seperate hard drives, since that was suggested on this forum. Don't know if that would effect this though.<br />
<br />
I really hate that my computer seems that it should be able to handle both at once, but after a bit will shutdown/restart. Ugh... Help please.</div></div><hr />
