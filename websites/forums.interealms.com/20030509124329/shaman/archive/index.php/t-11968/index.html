<br />
Here's the story on the site:<br />
<br />
New, was created like... yesterday.. and there's a few of us behind it trying to make it one of the more popular and more used websites.   The forums are a large part of the site (like this one).  You'll see a lot of single digits in the views posts and topics because it was just made.  Let's get some participation!<br />
<br />
The site is in the making, so not everything is up yet, but expect it to be soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I liked the laxative advert at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
But I can't help thinking more fruit would help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Registered Users: Lenine, Redspeed, Rellix<br />

Once i saw that i left and i will never return again.<br />

Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This isn't just a place to screw around and waste time.  If you take the time and look around you'll see that Lenine put a LOT of time into setting this up and making it available to the shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no point getting hung up on names and such. Looks like it has potential , has a easy to navigate layout , the PoV guide was nice , id like to see alot more of those for PoP/shamans friendly zones.<br />
<br />
Definetly potential, would be nice to have a fresh breathing place to gain info from, the current shaman friendly deposits of info a lil stale imho.<br />
<br />
Good luck , keep us updated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thx litgruv~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">By the way there tigers, you probably didn't mean to have the admin section viewable by all.<br />
<br />
You might've, but I can't imagine why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what admin section? :confused:<br />
<br />
http://www.vgnation.net/cgi-bin/news/coranto.cgi is for the news but requires a password to view / modify and the board ones might be viewable I don't know but you still need a password/user to login as an admin session to modify them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just a suggestion. make a login link for yourself and your other admins, and make the admin navigation only be seen by those that are logged in as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okay, call me crazy, but what am I looking at?  The link in the first post takes me to a funkified picture of Mith Marr with the only visible links adjusting for resolution or taking you to the counter.  The boards link in another post here asks for login info and doesn't give a way to just get to the board index.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Ahh, I clicked the resolution change link to get to the site.  That's what I get for not knowing my resolution on this PC, it seems :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Or you could visit Shaman of Justice... www.planeteq.com/shaman<br />
<br />
Sure, I dont have a propor, paid url, or a snazzy php system, but it's functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nevermind again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been looking over it, So far I've seen only a couple of things live:<br />
<br />
News - A bunch of comments made out to look like news<br />

Again, I point people to Shaman of Justice (www.planeteq.com/shaman) since this is clearly not finished, and lacking somewhat in content, and currently the main Crucible website is down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, and why is it called Crackpipe? Implying somehow that shaman are all druggies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok,<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not trying to compete with the Crucible or your site or anything. Rellix posted this on his own free will to let you know about the site. I do not want to take away visitor's time from browsing these forums or your website.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not intent to have forums and just intended to put a website where i can write some guides and put them up. I put up the forum because instead of bothering to write my own php indexing system i could just use the forum to index them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then people asked me to make it a real forum so I did just such.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am trying to make a different kind of website from the crucible or yours so don't worry about competition man.<br />
<br />
<br />
What i am trying to do on mine is give a USER opinion on things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Torpor<br />
 Increase HP by 300 per tick (x4), Decrease Movement by 100%, Decrease Attack Speed by 30%<br />
 Alt<br />
 200<br />
 Drop<br />
 Old<br />
 Yes<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what 99% of shaman's want to see when they go to a website. I am trying to cater to the other 1 %. I am going to include WHERE this drops. I will include maps of the area. I will include pictures i took of myself killing these. I will include the reccomended group makeup for these areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you see more that I do not want to be your enemy. Your website is great no one can doubt that, and mine is nothing more than a layout and a few scripts but I am not saying it is anything more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also what rellix said was meant as a joke. I hope this clears up your misunderstanding between us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh and yes sorry about he only 1 content of my site being a broken link  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
I forgot to upload the updated sidebar, if you wish you should be able to go to it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another example of what i am trying to do can be found at<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.vgnation.net/talk/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=15&amp;t=25&amp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I am pretty knowledgable on these zones and will write guides for these 2 zones (including maps and stuff) within the week so stay tuned <br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : Postponing this to 2 weeks. I'm trying to make qualit guides and I would really like to add more items to the PoV guide first as it is the most popular zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things going to be added to POV <br />
<br />
<br />
1) More indepth MOB info<br />
2) More indepth loot info with pictures<br />
3) Design upgrade to follow a set template, and possibly include designed pics that will go with the MB style<br />
4) I want to integrate this board more with the website, so they will look alot more similar as i include more EQ style pics. Don't worry I wont ruin this beautiful skin <br />
<br />
<br />
Also please note, this section is not only for guides written by me. It is a 'guide' section similar to the one at monkly-business so please PM or e-mail me your guide. Or just open a topic and post it! Please avoid posting other people's work withot them knowing, and taking credit for their work as their own.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Browsing! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At first my name for the website was just a dumb name suggested by someone in the channel, but now reflecting on it, it is the idea i wanted for the site. I want people to look at the site and keep coming back and rereading the guide as other users input their information, hence crack'pipe'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this clears up any misunderstandings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i bookedmArked them BOTH , there is always going to be thigns one person misses that another picks up., Bolth look good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really appreciate feedback so I ask you<br />
<br />
Splash - The annoying pre-index page with resolution options<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you find this annoying? Does it take too long to load? What else would you suggest i do to allow users to go to the appopriate resolution page. As you can see, there are 2. I myself use 1280x1024 and could never go smaller, yet most users use 1024 x 768, so i see this as a dilemma and that is the only solution i could come to.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure i could find a javascript to auto-redirect users but I find these are buggy , and do not often work on every type of browser.<br />
<br />
News - A bunch of comments made out to look like news<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the miscommunication on my part. This was supposed to be updates and news, and i will change this now. I try to put a post everytime i update something, so what else should i do to stop them looking like comments but rather news and updates. This is my first time constructing a website and I could use your input as a seasoned webmaster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forums - Why? we have these forums<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said in a previous post, my forums are not the same kind of forums as they are here. They are presently layed out that way, but I will be changing this in the future. When I have done this I am sure your opinion will change.<br />
<br />

All the not up yet's are place holders. When I constructed this layout i wanted to preview what it would look like when I had the website up and running. I was planning to put some cool stuff in shady info like info about EQ windows and some various tips and tricks to everquest. I may not have picked the best title but then again this is just a place holder. I also showed that to the general public because this website is still in its beta stages. Eventually within a few months, I intend to make the website run off the IB's users and that admin panel would come in. It is available now as a simple placeholder, I am still working on the layout and when i look at it i want to make sure everything is looking good with all possibly environments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ok, I wasnt actually trying to have a go or anything, just asking what things are. I thought I'd be constructivly criticising, but I've ended up destructingly being critisising you. I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
In my opinion though, you should have waited until you had the content there before anouncing it :)<br />
<br />
I dislike the splash indexes just because, even though they are in their own way funtional, and useful. I also use the larger resolution, but I also like to get to the website quickly.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks Buphie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Extremely impressive for your first attempt!<br />
<br />
That said, put forth my meager knowledge of what people like on a webpage :)<br />
<br />
1. splash screen...I have never met a person that liked them or wouldn't remove them given the chance. Granted, a user could simply link to the actual page like I did :)<br />
<br />
2. The name. At first, I didn't like it very much, but after your explaination, I dig it. &lt;---used &quot;dig it&quot; to appear young but probably had the opposite effect :(<br />
<br />
3. Love the style you did your forum in. It is very pleasing to the eye. My co-worker and I both agree that it is better than most we have seen.<br />
<br />
4. I think the latest post thing can be removed because that is what the marked as read button is for :)<br />
<br />
But as you can tell, the above is just my opinion and your skills obviously exceed mine. I manage my gimp guild page at http://sovereigncircle.org<br />
You are welcome to check it out and brush my suggestions aside :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like the page posted by Fuudce more.<br />
<br />
The Crackpipe, has too many pictures, and takes forever to load on dial-up; for me at least.<br />
<br />
Why do you have a hard on for mith marr? A broken up picture of him is not needed everywhere...<br />
and the splash page is also useless in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like you're concentrating more on having your site look the coolest, than offering useful info.<br />
<br />
Where as the fuudce site loads up quicker, and has easy to see info right off the bat.<br />
<br />
But fuudce's site also has problems, the alchemy guide wouldn't load up for me at all.<br />
<br />
And you should use alternating color's in your table.<br />
<br />
something like this (example taken from a bard song list)<br />

The Crackpipe is a shell, a layout with some scripts nothing more at this time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My 2 cents<br />
<br />
When I hear of a site called &quot;Crackpipe&quot; I immediately think it's put together by 15 year olds who want to look cool. It's hard for me to take a name like that seriously.<br />
<br />
I like the look of it, but I think you can accomplish the same slickness of its appearance with smaller graphics. Remember, YOU may have the latest and greatest computer equipment, but 75+% of users out there are Joe Six-pack. They don't. They see something that takes more than 10 seconds to load, they're gone.<br />
<br />
I think the additional info you say you're going to provide on drops is a good idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing how that goes. I don't know how much you're going to allow for allow for user input, but PLEASE don't let your site turn into another Everlore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The crackpipe?<br />
<br />
Just based on that alone, I'll never visit the site again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Lose the name.<br />
<br />
I don't often use drug terms even in casual play, I like the term brain candy instead.  Once you bury a family member who has been lost to drugs it becomes harder to see the morbid humor as harmless.  Calling KEI Crack ingame is one thing but using a drug term as the official name of a site is another.<br />

I myself use 1280x1024 and could never go smaller, yet most users use 1024 x 768, so i see this as a dilemma and that is the only solution i could come to.<br />
<br />
www.htmlgoodies.com I think has a way you can do the resolution checks in HTML.  Those are preferable to a splash screen from a design point of view because people do not want to walk through doors to get to the content, they want to click and be there already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My 2 cents<br />
<br />
When I hear of a site called &quot;Crackpipe&quot; I immediately think it's put together by 15 year olds who want to look cool. It's hard for me to take a name like that seriously.<br />
<br />
I like the look of it, but I think you can accomplish the same slickness of its appearance with smaller graphics. Remember, YOU may have the latest and greatest computer equipment, but 75+% of users out there are Joe Six-pack. They don't. They see something that takes more than 10 seconds to load, they're gone.<br />
<br />
I think the additional info you say you're going to provide on drops is a good idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing how that goes. I don't know how much you're going to allow for allow for user input, but PLEASE don't let your site turn into another Everlore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hum, <br />
<br />
<br />
I am running a Pentium 3 550mhz with a geforce 4 ti 4200 and 640 mb ram and I do not have any problems with the site even while running eq, photoshop, ftp prog, html prog, aim,aol, yahoo, icq and a few IE windows. My system if by no way top end today, and can barely run EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, the negative comments like Landragoran's do not really bother me. This is the internet and I do not know any of you. If you hate me, great. I am going to rename the site because even though some people have liked it, it does not describe the site in any way.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I am not posting on this thread to get attention in anyway, because I honestly doubt most of you care what I am saying. I can get attention irl by running around naked if i wanted to  :eek:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sheesh, it's like the undesirables of the serverwide.crucible channel are making their own site. More powa to them, means less inane comments on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please direct me to 1 dumb comment I have made on the board  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I do not h8 you sir.  You merely annoy me with your spam, stupid comments, and idiot attention-getting tactics.  I don't feel strongly enough about it for hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">All 3 can be remedied by typing either 1 of 2 things<br />
<br />
<br />
/leave serverwide.crucible:crucible<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/ignore karana.lenine<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, you oculd have saved time by typing the second one, and not even bothered to post here. It would have used up less effort and keypresses  :D  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Few points, please try to see these as constructive, I'm not a web designer by trade, but I am a designer who knows one or two rules about web design.<br />
<br />
- Why do you have a random PoV link in your main menu?<br />
<br />
- Lose the splash page.  Telling people if they have a problem with it to just save a link directly is just going to annoy people, did you make the page for their convinience or for yours?<br />
<br />
- Link back to splash page, one word, WHY?<br />
<br />
- Lose the name, people are just going to think you're some kid who's just learned HTML with a name like that.<br />
<br />
- Design a page that works in all resolutions.<br />
<br />
- Try to avoid fixed page sizes, design a site that looks good no matter what shape your browser window is (within reason of course).<br />
<br />
- Reduce download time, resist the temptation to fill your page with loads of images.<br />
<br />
- Don't use Photoshop's crap image effects, they're not big or clever.<br />
<br />
- Lose the hits counter, quality speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
- PHP looks bad unless it's done properly.<br />
<br />
- Never 'EVER' annouce a page until it's complete.  Most people will look at your page once and never look at it again in it's current condition.<br />
<br />
- Offer something you can't get elsewhere. Why say your site's forum is a large part of the site, when we have a far superior and far more established one right here?<br />
<br />
- In depth spell lists are hard to come by, perhaps you want to develop that.<br />
<br />
- Quests, another area which could be developed into something which is hard to come by.<br />
<br />
- Don't steal EZboards smileys, they'll sue you.<br />
<br />
- A few rules, keep it SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE and USEFUL.  Never chose style over content, and be objective with your work.  I'm guessing, but the site you have up currently was the first design you thought of right?<br />
<br />
A typical example of how not to do a site is here:<br />
http://www.eqbastards.harlo-online.com/main.html<br />
<br />
I made this myself in a less patient day.  On the surface it seems OK, then a few fundemental flaws creep in.  You can't read the text easily and there's no room for content without spoiling the design layout.  If I'd taken the time to sit down and draw out the site on some paper I'd have realised it was doomed from the start.  Learn from your mistakes, and mine if you like.<br />
<br />
- This site is your new bible, read every word of it.<br />
