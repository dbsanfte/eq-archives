<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone posted on alla that Canni II is now purchaseable of Hatem in the Abysmal Sea for 13pp...  Haven't yet gone all the way down there to prove it, but I did check the bazaar and sure enought some a-hole had 10 copies on his mule for 2k each, so I'm thinking it's true  :D.<br />
<br />
First, prospective healing upgrades for the big folk, now fixing one of the only real problems with the lower level game (it was generally agreed that that quest was stupid hard for the level range)...  I am almost ready to applaud SOE!  <br />
<br />
almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmmm, I'm not sure how I feel about this one. Doing the quest for Cannibalize II was one of the more hair-raising quests I did in my 40's....and I saw 4 new zones. Geez, hunting the yun shaman frog kept me on the edge of my seat for almost two hours. The Trakanon's Teeth zone was the spookiest one I had ever been in, and all the wierd sounds there just added to it. Having the McMerin's Feast scroll show up in my inventory after the turnin was a memorable experience. Ah, well, these kids today....why, in my day in Halas we had to walk to school in the snow uphill both ways with just breadbags on our feet  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Canni II wasn't much of an upgrade, I didn't bother questing it on my 2nd (current) Shammy.  Canni III comes fast enough I guess, and that isn't exactly a GREAT upgrade either with todays gear and HPs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agreed karaab.  Just found out for myself and bought 10 copies.  Setting them at 15pp in the bazaar to bring down the prices of all the dang hawks =)</div></div><hr />

That's pretty darned cool of ya, Ceno. /salute :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I've been doing too, already sold quite a few. I figure, if the gougers jack the price back up... I just go get more :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sold 153 copies so far.  I didn't know there were 153 shaman in range to buy that damn spell on my server...<br />
<br />
The funny thing is some of the hawks are trying to buy me out and re-sell high again, and I just go get more =P.<br />
<br />
Every two hours or so my trader is empty again, and I just go re-fill him.  Plus whenever I'm near my comp I do an /OOC &quot;Rejoice young shaman, Cannibalize II is now purchaseable by a vendor in GoD for only 12.5pp!  No more long questing for you!  If by chance you don't have GoD yet, I threw a few up on my vendor for ya!  (Please do not buy anything off those dang hawks trying to cheat you out of 1-2k for a spell that is now 12.5pp)&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's nice that it's readily available now, but completing that quest was one of the highlights of my young shaman career.  Granted, I got it like one level before Cann3, but it still made me proud.  I still can't believe they changed the name from McMerin's Feast though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, i agree that the quest was definently a proud thing to complete eventually, but this is good also in a way.  If you get Canni II at level 39, like I did, then it does make regenning mana significantly faster.<br />
<br />
Glad to see people buying/re-selling to lower the price.  And if you only sell to hawks, then hey, free money for you. :D  <br />
<br />
Keep up the good work. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hawks make me happy when they buy my stuff. nothing like blowing your last couple k on sow pots and someone decides to buy every single one in the baz and mark them up to 120per. I took all the cash and made a fresh batch that sold out fast at 100per.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bah... i read this today, when i died 3 times in KC last weekend getting the last piece for hand in :\<br />
<br />
Do i get to tell stories about walking to school in the snow up hill both ways now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nope, only people that can identify at least 5 mobs in at least 5 1 - 35 zones purely from the sounds they make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Now if Primal Essense were just more readily available the world would be a better place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Careful what you wish for. I get gimp gear int casters asking for it to max their stamina. I tell em I deleted it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I still want it.  I could speed up my buffing a TON by having this.<br />
<br />
The fact that it ONLY drops off ONE stinkin' mob is really crazy - and the level of that mob is such that you don't have access to even TRY for this spell until mid to upper 50's is just crazy.<br />
<br />
I've seen this spell for sale exactly TWICE in the last 6 months . . . for 30k.  That's right, I could buy Q *twice* for that price.  Provided I had the money in the first place.  I don't.  My Shaman is my main, and he ain't rich by any means.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
It sucks that this spell will be trivial by the time I can afford it or get the drop.</div></div><hr />
