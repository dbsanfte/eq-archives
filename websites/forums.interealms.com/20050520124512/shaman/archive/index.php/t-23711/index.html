<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once I did, I kept crashing upon selecting my character and logging into the world.  Had to &quot;cough&quot;drive to a friends house and log in there to move to a different zone&quot;cough&quot; to get to a less crowded zone to turn them off.  My old system is the equivalent of a Pentium 1 with a Geforce 4 card.  Really freaking old.  You'll also want water turned off as well imo.  Turn on shadows at your own peril unless one of you computer gurus can figure out a fix for it.</div></div><hr />

OR, you could have opened your eqclient.ini file, found the SHADOWS line, and changed it from 1 to 0.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Shadows just kill me, as do large expanses of water :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have played, and likely will always play with all that crap off....no spell efects, no shadows, no sky, etc...I have a fairly high end machine that easily plays Doom 3 and Far Cry, MoH, Battlefield, etc...I play those games if I want graphics. EQ is simply not designed to be a graphic intensive game, I think its the wrong idea to patch and repatch a graphics engine that was old when it was used at EQ's launch.<br />
A straight up redesign and patch in entirety of the engine for all users, designed to be more friendly to lower end machines,  have less memory leak problems, and have full use of Dx 9 would be better than its current form.</div></div><hr />

The Geforce 5xxx line isn't 100% dx9 compliant :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a 2.8gig, 1gig RAM and an ATI 9600 pro and the shadow feature was bogging my system down. I'm hoping its just due to the patching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shadows kill me, but then I have an older system (1.3GHz AMD 1300+, 512 MB RAM, GeForce 4 MX I think with 64 MB).  Wasn't real impressed anyways.<br />

A guildmate turned them on and ended up burning out his video card.  Literally.  He described it as &quot;one of the copper diode looking things was glowing red and smoknig.&quot;  He says his card was &quot;less than 6 months old&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a 2G Athalon, 1GB, and GeForce 4200 TI.  Shadows work great and I really like them.  Adds a much greater sense of emersion than I would have thought :-)</div></div><hr />

How quaint, the box I'm looking at claims that they're the first &quot;Fully dx9 compliant CPUs.&quot;<br />

Go go nVidia marketing!  Bastards.</div></div><hr />
