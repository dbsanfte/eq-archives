<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friends and I have freed the Dark Elf (war/mnk/rog vengeance II bracer), the iksar(hybrid FT1 earring) and the Sarnak (FT2 priest shoulders) from Droga on the Solusek Ro server.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, this is the first freeing of the slaves since LDoN (on my server) and we don't plan on doing it again for a while.<br />
<br />
The mantle is wonderful for those of us who went ally giants/tormax and don't want to swap back for the Coldain shawl.<br />
<br />
Slaves go back to Droga as of the next patch, which they have not announced as of the time of this writing.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The slaves will stay up after a patch.  The only reason they wouldn't is if they actually mess with Droga in the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has freed both the HIE and the DE, and they went back into Droga after a patch.  This was sometime in early August, I believe, that we freed them; I think they were back in Droga as early as a week later?  Something like that.  It kinda sucks, because we're a rather small guild, and it took pretty much full guild participation (well, didn't NEED full participation, but were able to free two slaves in two hours that way /shrug) to complete the event, and now we're stuck with casters that were unable to complete the quest because they didn't have the drops yet, and now we'd have to free them again.<br />
<br />
Since the interest in this quest from the rest of the population on Prexus appears to be approximately zero, I guess it's no great loss to the community, and so SoE likely doesn't care. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would very much like the FT2 mantle too and my ranger could use the earring for sure. So if anyone on Quellious is interested too lets team up and free some of those prisoners.<br />
<br />
Droga has been almost deserted since LDoN though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darshad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know the High Elf and the Dark Elf have been freed on Brell - as I just completed the FT2 neck piece for my Wizard on Friday - I'm still collecting the Ice Fetishes for the shoulder piece for my Shaman and hope to get hte last two I need sometime this week(I already have the staff and one of the fetishes)<br />
<br />
They are some nice items from these quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The fact that the item for priests is shoulder slot is a slap in the face, imho.  Hello, Eighth Shawl?  Yes, I realize not everyone has it, but it's probably in the top 5 for most common flowing thought items.</div></div><hr />
