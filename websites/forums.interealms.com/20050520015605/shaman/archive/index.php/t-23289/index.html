<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious if anyone knew of a way to target someone else's pet. Now I know if your in a group hit f(X) twice to target pet, I am talking about out of group. I didn't think there was... but theres lots of stuff I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/target petname<br />
<br />
Works.  Probably not exactly what you wanted though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The first time you hit the f# key you target the player..second time on same key is target their pet :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In addition to the /target, you can also click on it :)  Try assisting the pet owner also, many times they have it targetted.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that target nearest pc / cycle nearest pc's works with pets though but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone know of a way to determine to whom a pet belongs?  On raids, I frequently have a rogue pet and no one will own up to it.  (At which point we just invis all the mages and lose dps).<br />

Didnt you used to be able to ask the pet who their master was, and he would tell you? Or was that only the pet owners who could ask. Never played a true pet class so I dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whenever someone wants a buff on their pet in a raid, I ask em to target their pet and send me a tell.  Simple to /rt and /assist right to the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you very much piwacket, I did say that though.<br />
<br />
 Now I know if your in a group hit f(X) twice to target pet,<br />
<br />
I normally /target petname I was hoping there could be something I could save as a hotkey. Pets change names though :( Oh well. Help is always appreciated :). I was hopeing there was some secret command /target &lt;pc&gt; &lt;secret pet targeting trick&gt;<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
in case anyone was curious why I was wondering I was pl a 2boxing necro partner I have a hotkey that I change to the pet's name, but 1. it's a pain to change it all the time(ok not too bad). 2. I found having my necro boxer charming a mob is soooo much better(especially with malosiment) and it's tough to distinguish between foe or ally when they are going toe to toe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't tell you how many times I've dropped a Q on my freaking dog, when I hit F1 but already had myself targeted. I've now gone to hitting ESC, F1. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How about using Tab? Targets you then your previous target if you hit it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't have Q yet, but I made a hotkey for torpor. I too have casted torpor on my pet more times then I'd like.<br />

/targ splendi<br />
/pause 1<br />
/cast 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do you targe a beastlord's pet?  <br />
<br />
I've tried actually putting the full name into the /target command but it doesn't switch to the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I haven't tried this yet, but can you<br />
/target &lt;user name&gt;_ward<br />
<br />
when I go to target a corpse or a specific mob I normally do /target a_ske<br />
or /target a_fierc</div></div><hr />

<br />
If im going to hit myself with a heal, or a heal of some sort, I just hit the Tab key to cycle my last target and myself, and imusually on the mob, so tab is back on me, and thenheal. Anyways, I think TAB is to cycle last 2 targets, it's the default setting heh.<br />
<br />
Didn't know about using FX,FX to target a pet in a group... always clicked the green line instead.. fx,fx is going to make life easier..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks BigBad !  i'll give it a try next time I need to target a bst's pet and remember :-) :-)</div></div><hr />
