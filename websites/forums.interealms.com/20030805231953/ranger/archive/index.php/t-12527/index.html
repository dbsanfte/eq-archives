<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Unfortunately, greed seems to be the motivating factor for a lot of the &quot;high-end&quot; gamers I've run across lately. Try going to Rathe some time and lurk....or better yet check who's in the zone. <br />
  Chances are you'll see half the people there are /anon level 50+ folks and the others are 30-40's scrambling to get the few meager spawns that happen to squeek by the dr00d quad-kiting hg's or the level 60 necro and pet who have decided to camp the hill top....all in the name of  &quot;phat l3wtz&quot;. <br />
  Chances are you'll also hear one or two complaints from the younger players... followed by a highbie addressing them as &quot;whiners&quot; or just telling them to &quot;take it to tells.&quot;<br />
  Yes, it's neat that you CAN quad kite giants. No, I don't respect you for it, because when there are too many people in the zone for the numbers that spawn....you are being greedy to snag 4 for yourself.  <br />
When you DO manage to pull one, chances are you'll see sparkly skittles fly from his butt and he'll suddenly decide he hates the highbie who just grenuked him a lot more than he does you. I think this says something more about the highbies personality than the damage he just did :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are better places to farm than the Rathe Mountains, if someone wants to farm, so that makes them greedy and, at least, unimaginative.<br />
<br />
And while I have nothing against quad-kiting, I do have something against people who do it when there aren't enough spawns. That's just rude. Go root-dot something or leave. If you can quad, you can port.<br />
<br />
Greedy, stupid and rude... all in one zone. It's not always like that. At least you won't do the same thing, and that's bound to make someone else's game more fun. Maybe that will take the sting out of greedy, stupid, and rude (sounds like dwarves SnowWhite rejected, heh).</div></div><hr />
