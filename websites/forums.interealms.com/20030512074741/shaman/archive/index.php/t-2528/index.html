<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like has been stated time and again.  In the 40's forget about DL.  It is like lambs to the slaughter in that zone.  The lag is terrible and the crowds are ungodly.  However there is a nice quiet spot to level from 40-50 or so if you really push it.  I am talking about Echo Caverns underbulks and other assorted pests.  They are super easy to fight if you are duoing and only slightly more challenging when soloing.  As a duo I can clear most of the bugs and bulks before the next repop starts.  The loot is pretty decent as well.  The underbulks drop a nice throwing item that you can either sell to rogues or sell to a vendor for 3pp.  And the stonegrabbers drop anywhere from 4pp-8pp and change.  Not a bad place to spend your 40's if you don't like the idiots that inhabit DL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Someone showed me this place when I was 48 and told me that I could get to 51 here.  I was with a group that day and things moved pretty fast.  Since then, I've soloed there off and on.  The experience goes slow or fast depending on where I am at (either the 4 underbulk spawn or the room with 6 underbulk/stonegrabber/fungal fiend spawn).  I've found my level 50 pet is better than the previous one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep same here i went through 47 in like 3 days doing the 4 underbulk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">echo rocks.  but seems to be camped as of late..... think ya people spread the work too much.... but birds in TD is a great change of pace too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cidisius Skyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do understand the constant gripes about DL but I have no problem with it. I generally play at night when few people are on and since the new zone Jagged Pine is around it has taken a small portion of DL's traffic away. I've tried the usual spots, Echo, EW, GD, etc.. yet I still seem to enjoy DL the most because it's simply easy exp without the worry of aggro as you generally have when soloing. If you get a chance you should try DL at night, you might even enjoy it. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />
