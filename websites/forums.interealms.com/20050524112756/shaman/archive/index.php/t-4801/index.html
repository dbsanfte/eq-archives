<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya Crucible people,<br />
<br />
As a level 56 wannabe-oracle I've finally managed to get together a large amount of cash..in this case about 9k..which is the largest amount of money I've had since I was level 40 and trying to buy a regen breastplate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, My aim is to fill up my spellbook.  On my server BoN is going for 7500+ pp, Tigirs is for sale at 25k, and Malo and Topor haven't been up for sale for the past month or so that I've been watching.<br />
<br />
Is BoN worth the trouble vs. Ebolt? Should I skip in in favor of a pony for mana/regen?<br />
<br />
I can't believe I'm actually considering skipping this spell..but paying 7500 for a spell who's usefulness will only last 2 or 3 levels seems pretty pricey.<br />
<br />
help?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know if I'd pay 7500p for BoN.  I found it for 1500 in the bazaar and I did pay that much for it.<br />
<br />
The usefulness of the horse is fading with recent patches, and my guess is that the no-Luclin-models thing will be nerfed soon.  About the only benefit left for a shaman will be no-aggro medding in outdoor zones, offset by not being able to duck out of spells and being forced to click off the horse every time you move.  I wouldn't buy a horse if I was making the decision today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes...but I'm kinda stuck for alternatives atm...<br />
<br />
It seems kinda dumb to keep this cash in the bank just sitting there, damn Bazaar bankers don't pay interest.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally wouldn't buy either spell. Get a group together and go do Juggs/Reets in Seb or Guardian Wurms in Skyfire. If you camp em, you will get both spells and probably a ton of other items too. It really isn't that hard.<br />
<br />
If you do buy BoN, I'd say 5k is a fair price. There is no way in hell I would pay more then 2k for Tigir's though, it's just a toy and really isn't very useful. I would just xp off mobs that drop these spells and let your guild know you are looking for them.<br />
<br />
EDIT - Yes, Bane of Nife totally rules. If you get an extended affliction item it will do over 2k of damage in 42 secs. I use this DoT more than any other and highly recommend getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get a juggs group. Be surprised if it didn't drop first or second try these days.<br />
<br />
Bane is good for the rest of your career. It's a great spell, but i would hesitate to pay 7k for it. At 56 if you fight mostly outdoors, a horse is probably a better investment.<br />
<br />
Also, do the coldain wristguard quest for affliction boost. E-bolt will seem like a pretty damn good spell then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">THIS is why I check out these boards every day..real hard-core player advice.  <br />
<br />
I actually sent a /tell offering 5k for the spell last night...but the seller ignored me.  People seem to think we shammy's are loaded.<br />
<br />
Thank you for steering me in the right direction..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i payed 4k for my bane....i would do it again, actually i would pay up to 6k if i couldn't get a juggs groups together.<br />
<br />
anyway, just wanted to reply to blackdust who is saying tigir's insects is worthless..what the hell are you thinking.  i payed 5k for the spell and have been gotten a lot of use out of it. i not only save the chanters, but can sometimes save my whole group with that spell.  it is the easiest way to earn agro of a lot of mobs at one time, and they come at you slowed so they wont eat you up.  i have this spell up in any (seb/hs) group situation. (i would much rather eat a harm touch or 2 then let the enchanter or druid eat it. this also makes root parking insainly easier.)<br />
<br />
it is importaint to note that during all the times i have done juggs i have only seen tigir's drop one time.  i have seen bane drop a few times.  maybe i am lucky or maybe not, but if i had it to do all over again i would have bought both spells the second i lvled + could mem them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">two days at juggs farming sinews i got two extra banes to sell, and one torpor. oh, 1 tirgirs and 1 pox as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No way I'd pay 7k for Bane.<br />
<br />
It's more common than that.  It's just a dot, big deal<br />
<br />
I disagree with Blacklace about Tigirs.  While not worth 25k either, Tigirs owns.  Many situations where that spell buys just enough time for folks to channel off stuns, roots and mezzes.<br />
<br />
It helps control multi mob combats just a bit faster, and that's the most dangerous part of all fights - getting control at the beginning.<br />
<br />
The thing that stinks is it's not pbae.  It ought to be, imho.  <br />
<br />
4 mob cap is lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like Bane.  When the MT pulls too much and dies in an exp group before I can slow it (resists ... so many freaking resist) then cast bane to get and keep aggro.  This way it isn't beating on my party and the rogue can plug away while the tank gets ressed back.  Nothing I love more than being the back up tank for a group and watching the disbelief.  Granted ... I'm gunna get tooled if I STILL can't land a slow, but its very exciting.  Bane is as good as a taunt button.  If I want to do low aggro damage, I'll load pox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use Bane constantly in exp groups and when soloing. Its a great spell. I dont use Tigirs all that often. Bane and Tigirs I have seen drop every time I have done juggs since the drops were fixed. If you go hunt juggs for a few nights there is a very good and real chance you will get them. <br />
<br />
Pox, Torpor and Malo are altogether another story. They are still rare as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless we can get an AOE baby Malo to go with Tigir's it's not all that useful.  I tend to just see everything resist it all the time.<br />
I really enjoy Bane though.<br />
<br />
However, drop rates on Bane and Tigirs are WAY up, prices should come down.  Work on getting the Juggs group together.  Save the money for Torpor or Malo, you'll need it for that.<br />
But maybe you'll be lucky down there in Juggs and get 'em to drop.  Then you'll be like me looking at the 25k in your bank you've saved up and not know what to do with it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd never pay that much for bane or tirgirs.  We do Juggs at this point with 4-6 people for a couple hours and usually get at least 1 copy of each.   When I am running the spell mule, I have sold them for as low as 1k each.<br />
<br />
They aren't rare like they used to be.  Back in decemeber I made a straight trade of tirgirs for malo.  Then the spell drops were quite noticeably upgraded on that set of spells.  Tell the guy who is trying to sell tirgirs for 25k that he is living in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BoN is the one damage spell that's almost always memmed. 2k damage in under a minute (with the coldain bracer) is nothing to sneeze at. Dunno if I'd pay for it, it's pretty common these days off of juggs. I did get a tell recently from someone asking what BoN was worth (they'd gotten 2 extra copies off of juggs) and I told them 5k was reasonable imo. <br />
<br />
I'm also a charter member of the &quot;I love Tigir's&quot; society. Admittedly it gets resisted quite often, but it never seems to agro a mob when resisted so I can live with that. Drop it on a tank coming back with a big pull and it helps to space out the mobs a bit. Any that don't resist are going to come over and start beating on you which makes it easier for the enchanter since all the mobs aren't stacked on top of each other beating on the main tank. It causes enough agro that even if the cleric has to CH early those mobs won't be beating on him. It gives the enchanter options, he knows that he can either start mezzing 50% slowed mobs that are beating on me while I Tugur the rest of the pull or he can safely ignore the ones beating on me and start mezzing the rest of the train if the melees look to be getting overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
Play around with this spell before you relegate it to the back of the spellbook, but I wouldn't pay too much for it. It's also reasonably common off of jugs, with maybe 1/2 the drop rate of BoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Bane of Horse? &quot;<br />
<br />
dude i was like wow is that a new spell??? then i realized it's a typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Firstly, don't get too attached to the way horses are now.  They're bugged in favor of the player and Verant is always quick to fix THOSE kinds of bugs.  Do you really think that they'll leave a bug in that allows you to buy a 9K horse and run around like the 56K one?<br />
<br />
Tigger's Insects.....   The only time I mem this is when I'm going to a trap in DN or know I'm gonna get Zerged by lots of low level mobs in a zone (which is not very often at all).  You could find other things to spend your money on that would help you much more.<br />
<br />
Bane.....  GREAT spell.  I got mine in the Library and was surprised at how much difficulty other Shammy's have in getting one for themselves.  If you don't have the epic, you gotta use SOME DoT to stop the mob's regen, and this is a great one to do it with.  Besides, when I cast it, I like yelling &quot;BANE to you!&quot;</div></div><hr />
