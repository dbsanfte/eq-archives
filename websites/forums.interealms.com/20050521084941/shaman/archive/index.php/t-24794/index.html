<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know we still have issues as a class,but I'm starting to really see some hope. A year ago when I quit I couldnt progress farther than where I was due to PoP flags (I'm a casual player). Quiessence was a huge disappointment ie same as torpor without snare. Our dots were just about useless in groups due to duration. Now for casual players like me we have LDoN were I can get really nice upgrades the chest peice 60+ac would rule with 55hp/15mana with augs 1 and 2 added together and 5hp per tick aug. Quiessence heals for 420 per tick for 280 mana AND there are even better HoT spells available (prolly be another year for me to get them but still the possibility to improve is there). Now we have curses . Our dps still not good but at least its alot better than it was. Plus we have a 7% damage voidance buff at 68 which is pretty nice. I think SoE has done alot to fix our class. To bad I gave up playing for a full year I've got alot of catching up to do. As I see it here are some of the issues we still have.<br />
<br />
Issues:<br />
Need new canni spell aa's to make canni 5 faster refresh<br />

Quies was huge, cause I could cast it on other people than myself to heal them. I used to duo with a monk in Sol Ro's Tower, and Quies prettymuch kept him up on the slowed sentries, even at only 300hp per tick. I just don't get how you could have been dissappointed with this spell when you got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have got to be ****ting me<br />
i think you said what everyone else was thinking....that spell went into the shaman books as game changed in most peoples minds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/nod Grizlor...  Quies was a HUGE upgrade given the way it shed the previous restrictions/penalties of Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">and that was really before they changed it recently to be an actual hps upgrade over torpor too.  In it's old version, Q was pretty awesome by itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">torpor=that spell I dig out when the chanter/druid pet needs to be snared for a deliberate charm break to resnare/redebuff...oh yeah and to heal ME up after cani.<br />
Q, the spell that MADE me get QB2 and SCRM, forget longer sow, forget less castings of focus, Q gets cast Constantly and as amazing as torpor was Q truly changed the game.<br />
<br />
dog dog really likes gnoll hide lariats and serated bone dirks<br />
<br />
I dont know what else to say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I found Quiescence dissapointing too. I guess it was the fact that it came in an expansion where a mob could do more dmg in one round than Q healed in total, which made me less thrilled by the advantages it did have. but hey it was real handy against fully-slowable mobs sure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Amen, lol...Quiescence is THE reason I have SCRM and QB1/Wicked Bone Atlatl, and also the reason i will not upgrade the atlatl until I get QB2 or another Mithaniel-style focus effect item.  If not for Q extension, I'd have put SCRM and QB way down on the list of priorities for AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah, besides duoing Quiessence just blew back in the day. Was a slap in the face and one of the reasons why I quit. I was so pissed to find out pre pop that we were getting a new torpor that healed for the same.</div></div><hr />

You dont have to keep playing just because there are some EQ-nuts that refuse to admit anything is wrong with EQ. You could go to other games like say....ohh....WoW....which is made for people to have fun instead of the lame boring game that EQ has turned out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wasn't flagged for anything back when I got the new quiesence, and I was able to main heal just about anywhere in PoP or any other expansion. If you think quie sucked you either didn't have it or you are a moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It didn't suck compared to Torpor. It sucked compared to what it is now. If you think the new Q isn't anybetter than the old your your crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I came back to EQ last September (2003) and rerolled a shaman.  I levelled from 1 to 70 on the most efficient content possible and did the first 65 levels and 200 AAs without a guild.  With those facts in mind and disregarding my current situation, I can say without hesitation that Q was easily our best Pop spell.<br />
<br />
Nihils was easily our best GoD spell.<br />
<br />
And SpiritViel is easily our best OoW spell.  I am not sure what that says about the shaman class though if I think fixed duration invis is our best OoW spell, but it doesnt change the value of Q for its era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was far from 'uber' when I scribed quies, maybe around 3k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
I used to duo in plane of Valor with a shadowknight at level 60 while trying to get AAs for Canni5, and all I had was Chloroblast and Kragg's (and Torpor). I had only torpor for a long time, until I joined a raiding guild in May of 03. I think I got Quies around July, and it was incredible. At the time it was a significant upgrade to my ability to sustain the life of other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And SpiritViel is easily our best OoW spell.

<br />
<br />
Hehe... When can I quit laughing?<br />
<br />
Fixed Duration invis is nice, but the best OoW spell?<br />
<br />
When I think of the best OoW Shaman spells:<br />
<br />
1. Vindictive Spirit<br />
2. Spiritual Serenity<br />
3. Champion<br />
4. Ancient Wilslik's Mending<br />
5. Spirit Veil<br />
<br />
Of those 5 spells, I would say Vindictive Spirit and Champion have changed my play style much more than any of the other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really like the new rain spell, new canni, and new fast heal. Rain spell makes my burst dps go way up, I haven't had a canni upgrade since canni4, and I'm still blasting tnargs away to keep my groups alive. I haven't seen any of the 70 spells in action but they look very nice. I have to admit though, that fixed duration invis is pretty awesome considering the only times I die are when invis drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Those spells are ok, but I like Spirit Veil better.  Sue me.  And yes, I have them all except the Ancient heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I personally felt that Tnargs was a better upgrade at the time than Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think I loaded Tnargs 2 or 3 times.  After I started nodding off between cast I decided I would rather be a shaman than a cleric and to blast heals and make mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, if you check eqrankins i am about midline for hp/mana/ac while i am in the upper 1/4 or so for AAs.  in terms of where i rank on my server i am about 30th in terms of HP and 5-6th in terms of AAs.   so i am no where near far ahead of the pack. i am not even time flagged as of yet.  when i got quies, pop had been around for a long time and my guild was working on teir 1 pop, ssra and other luclin boss mobs (mostly  farming NToV at that point.)  so, like, i am not so far ahead as you may think.<br />

Kurth, I actually diddnt say that first sentance about Grizlor someone else did, I just managed to screw up the quote.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with it, besides its easy enough to just click on gear within his magelo to see what he currently has. How does this make me an idiot?  Guess I will never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Someone needs to work on reading skills, Wakonda didn't make the post on Grizlor's Magelo, Spiritblood made that quote.   And it's not something new from Grizlor, since he's had that profile for ages now.  <br />
<br />
For the record, Quiescence is one of the best spells I've had the pleasure of using as a Shaman.   Over time it's lost a bit of the shine in groups and raids since every other HoT overwrites/bounces it.   I've given up trying to cast it on raids due to MGB Wood.  <br />
<br />
As to the other spells, not whining but this is still a matter of the &quot;Have's ~vs~ the Have nots&quot;.   I only have 2 OoW spells though not from lack of trying (4 hours last night of WoS camp for example - multiple runes drop but my dice failed me again).   <br />
<br />
Shrug.  Guess its better than back in the &quot;good ol days&quot; when spells were completely outside of reason to buy (100K then equals 1millionK today) or dropped off uber camped mobs in uber camped zone(s).   At least I can get pick up or group camps in multiple OoW zones to try for runes ... I just need to get better Dice.   /pst on cost of loaded dice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Never used a macro in my life, but I'd consider doing so if I could load my dice for the rune rolls and keep the others in the group from knowing it, lol.</div></div><hr />

You still dont have the spell. Whether it is because it is exceedingly expensive or rare doesnt really matter. Because one thing is for sure every single encounter for your level will be &quot;balanced&quot; against people having all the needed spells. I've said it before and I will say it again &quot;balancing encounters based on rare dropped spells is just dumb&quot;.<br />
<br />
Make spells a lot more available and THEN base encounters based on people having the spells. It will be a lot more fun and enjoyable for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Errr.. i probably do have them confused.  Which ever one was that 1975 10 second heal is the piece of crap i never bothered with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
totally possable<br />
<br />
Errr.. i probably do have them confused. Which ever one was that 1975 10 second heal is the piece of crap i never bothered with. <br />
<br />
Kragg's Mending is the 2k 10 second 75% CH we get at level 58.<br />
Tnarg's Mending is the 1300 quick heal we get at level 62.<br />
<br />
the 2k 10 second heal was a great way to heal after canni v if you didn't have any of the torpor line of spells.  it was also a nice grouping tool even post 60 until we get our semi decent quick heals at level 62.  to be honest i used the 10 second heal until i got my healing AAs at which point the quick heal became more of a viable option for several reasons...<br />
<br />
can you remember/imagine being level 58-62 and trying to heal people with Chloroblast, a 428 point heal?  most shaman i know, who were of level at the time, rejoyced the day we got that 10 second heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">can you remember/imagine being level 58-62 and trying to heal people with Chloroblast, a 428 point heal?  most shaman i know, who were of level at the time, rejoyced the day we got that 10 second heal.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those shamans, just recently in my low 60's.  That 10 second 2k heal is a godsend compared to what I had.  Partly because I don't have 10k plat to spend on torpor that will be replaced with Q in less then a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You do realize though that if Shaman healing wasnt nerfed to 47% in PoP that you would have got Etheral Light about level 62 though?<br />
<br />
Also would have had Divine Light about 58.<br />
<br />
Following the old pattern you would have got the Cleric heals 1 spell level later which was then nerfed to give Shaman 47% ;)<br />
<br />
Would you rather a 1600 4.7 second patch heal that is effected by aa and foci or a 1925 10 second heal that is not.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind Clerics get a 5% healing bonus applied to their heal spells because they used to share the same spells with Druids and Shaman so that 47% number really isnt true either (really 45% I think after accounting for their bonus) ;)<br />
<br />
People don't seem to realize this 47% number only came into being 10 levels ago.<br />
<br />
Now do get me wrong I think Shaman having Cleric heals 1 spell level down now might be too much.<br />
However they nerfed our healing, our slows and our mana regen has not kept pace with the other classes.<br />
<br />
When you add the DPS increases for shorter fights the net effect is:<br />
<br />
I need to heal more because mobs hit harder, I need to heal more because I slow for less, I need to heal more because my heals have not kept pace, and my mana regen hasnt kept pace to help me overcome the now increased mana I need to spend healing.<br />
<br />
Somehow I just dont find the healling we are saddled with fair or sufficent when you look at the big picture. ;)</div></div><hr />
