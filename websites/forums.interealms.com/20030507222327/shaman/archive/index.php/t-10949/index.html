<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say that between the 3 I would go for the Goranga Idol followed by the Combat Manual; hit points &gt;ac&gt;wis just make that a mantra or a hot key and it works out fine...I recently started peeling off slots to get my hit point total higher as I get closer and closer to 60 and cann V (not that torpor is close by any means /sigh).<br />
Its really a tough call though, you will get more raw hit points from the goranga and the 3 stamina it gives (something like 34 total at my level) but the extra 15 mana on the Combat Manual might make it attractive to some.<br />
The goranga has the honor of being cheap (free if your exp grinding in ME) while the combat manual/magic manual require Hobgoblin Surprise (a 250plat in vestment on Karana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, go for the goranga idol.<br />
On my server you can get them for 50pp, the hobgob surprise is gonna cost a lot more then th at.<br />
and you get more AC, and more HP. it's not like theres that much mana on the manuals, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went with the Magic Manual for all three of my priests. It's ridiculously easy (tedious, but easy). I picked up the Hobgoblin Surprise in the bazaar for 75p each (on Veeshan).<br />
<br />
Although I'll agree for a battle Shaman the Combat Manual is also a good choice. I went with the Magic Manual for my Shaman to make up for some WIS I lost during some recent AC/HP gear upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snatzie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the input.  What is the formula for STA to HP?  Is there a good guide?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sta to hp varies per level and class<br />
I don't know of a guide, I think for shamans it is 3 hp per sta..something like that? But, like I said, it varies a lot per level.<br />
take a piece of sta gear and take it off and see for yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's all level based.  At level 60 it's 3hp/sta.  Not sure on the exact formula though.  For warriors it's 6hp/sta at 60.<br />
<br />
You're probably close enough to just round it up, you'll get there eventually.</div></div><hr />
