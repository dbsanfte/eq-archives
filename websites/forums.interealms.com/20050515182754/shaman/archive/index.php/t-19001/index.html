They should make it a &quot;BotB server&quot;. Copy the best player of a each class per server over and make them go at it. You would only be able to kill others of your class and not affect anyone else with your spells. <br />
<br />
If you die, you are out. Winner gets a title.</div></div><hr />

A doorstop doesnt use very large amounts of bandwidth...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Giac that is an interesting idea. I personally detest PvP, but I imagine those that enjoy it would get a lot of fun from your idea.<br />
<br />
Copy say the 10 best geared of each class and each server to it and use the rule you suggested and it would be great fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or they could create a server with 20-30 hour time cap, and possibly lure back some of the customers who gave up EQ because of the huge time investment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ludwiig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, back when they did the serverwide botb my buddy fought another shaman for about 90 minutes (both had torpor), even after GMs deleted their fungis and snared them.  He lost (for which he was thankful), but the other guy was so burnt that next round he went down like a rock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true. after destryoing eachothers pets it would be test to see who could out melee the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you guys actually remember the BotB?<br />
<br />
Pets, Epic and melee worked back then and they would work today as well. If your pet dies, you can summon another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a moment I am going to act like it isn't...  How would you get money to make the items?  How would you farm for Tailoring?  If they just gave all the items to people, then everyone could max every skill in 60 days.  It's just a matter of who's got free time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, had to throw that out as the &quot;just in case&quot; as your post didn't sound sarcastic enough to take it as a joke without fail.<br />
<br />
If it was a joke, it WAS funny...  until I butchered it by being a Virgo... sorry.</div></div><hr />

If there are no mobs, how do you get money for tradeskills?  And how are you supposed to raise skills that require dropped components?  Tailoring and smithing would stop in the low 100's.  Fletching and brewing you can take up to GM just off dropped components.  Baking you can do up until 198ish I think, then you need at least vegetables and brownie parts.  Pottery you can GM off of bought components, but without imbues you can only get it to 190's I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you can do Baking to over 200 (but not much more) using Storm Salmon (fished from Plane of Storms) and a Jug of Sauces (storebought).</div></div><hr />
