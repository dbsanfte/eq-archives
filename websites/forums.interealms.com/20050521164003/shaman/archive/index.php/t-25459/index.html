<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking of doing this soon but from what i've been hearing the strat of using a bard to group DA just before the AE hits will not work as the AE fires every couple of seconds till every member of the group has it, can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
If its true then I would guess a group would have to do the whole trial with the DoT on. If so what sort of group set up would be best? For a tank I have a few available to me, the main one i group with has somewhere in the region of 10.5-11k HP unbuffed so I don't think that'll be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i only did it pre-patch, but i guess the group needed nowadays consists of a beefy tank, a cleric with very good gear, rest melee-dps, maybe a knight for offtanking.<br />
<br />
casters are a bit more disadvantaged in the new form than melees imo -&gt; melee-dps is the trick.<br />
<br />
but thats only my theretical view, will try it out some day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finally got around to trying this for the first time the other day. Bard, Necro, Warrior, Cleric, Ranger, and myself. They were all Time or higher geared (except ranger, was unguilded, not sure of his gear). Bard mezzed, couldn't do much else though. We didn't have enough dps, didn't get past the first wave, last mob was at 20% though, so we were close. The dot is like 3k hps and 3500 mana, I didn't run lom until we failed, was going to pop channeling whenever I ran out of mana, but that never happened cause we failed early. All in all, it's not too difficult a trial in my opinion (of course we didn't get to the named, but I can't imagine it being that hard), maybe if we had rogue instead of necro we could have won perhaps.<br />
<br />
But to answer your question, I'd say Warrior, Cleric, Rogue x2, Bard, and you. Would be plenty of melee dps, use bard to mez the others, you get them all debuffed and slowed asap, then toss on nukes (I wouldn't dot, the mobs don't have that much hp and you would only see a few ticks in). Could switch in a knight for a rogue for offtanking maybe.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I only did this once, just my limited observations, so take my advice with a grain of salt :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that is interesting because I have been told that you can do the opposite as well and go with full blown mana regen.<br />
<br />
Group would look like :<br />
<br />
War, Cleric, Sham, SK, Necro, chanter/bard<br />
<br />
Then make sure to get steel oak, beast crack, mod rods and possibly mana regen potions if you really want to get crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maiviaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done this trial a few times and found that trying to CC is more of a hindrance than a benefit.  Get a solid knight in place of the chanter/bard and have him offtank the 2 soldiers.  The elite guard roots easily with VP or regular root, and can be parked until the other 3 are dead. With a decent tank and offtank (I've succeeded with a ranger offtank,) your options are wide open as to what other classes you bring along. It helps if the group has respectable dps though.  With a war, clr, pal, rog, bard (was only meleeing), and shm, all in time + gear, we were finishing each wave with over a minute to spare.  This tactic might not work for everyone, but I have found it to be much easier, and fun, than CCing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a group with a bard, warrior, rogue, monk, and 2 shamans. Since the AE basically annuls your flowing thought, and you can't sit, Shaman destroys cleric healing over this trial. If you both have TAs all the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My thoughts, assuming OOW spells of course, would be this:<br />
<br />
Beefy Tank, Preferably warrior for AET.<br />
Cleric. Heals and Mark of karn/Righteousness (not familiar on their best reverse DS)<br />
Shaman. Damage, slows, patch heals, etc<br />
Bard. Hp/mana song, DS song<br />
Mage. Circle of Fireskin and Pyrilen Skin(450ds, like 3-6 ticks).<br />
Misc DPS class.<br />
<br />
Simply done, the cleric is going tokeep reverge DS on all mobs, heal, and mage will pop his large DS on the tank, plus normal DS, and bard DS will stack, kicking the tanks ds to somewheres around upper 500's or lower 600's, PER HIT.  Bard can play whichever else may be beneficial as well. Shaman sits back, nukes, dots, debuffs, slows, heals. DPS class what they do naturally.<br />
<br />
Basic idea would be that the trial would be done mostly via DS damage to mobs. Even if everyone has Circle of Fireskin, and bard pumping DS song, average DS on everyone should be around I think 120-180. thats still pretty decent. Lack of melee dps covered up by mobs killing themselves. soon as I can arrange this crew, Im using it to go back in for a belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tried this trials last night. We went in with old info, attempting to RC the AE right off the bat.  Group was Shammy, cleric, warrior, rogue, dro0d and mage.  There was plenty of dps with me dotting/nuking occasionally after slows. The cleric used lower level heals to compensate for the smaller mana pool and smaller tank HP, and I used HoTs for back up. Mana was not an issue for any of us.  We didn't finish because I died freakishly with 1.5 mobs left in the last round and we ran out of time &gt;&lt; We kited if there was too much aggro, and the tank just called to bring the next one in before the other died.  We would have won if I hadn't hit mass canni at the wrong time /hide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mage beefy DS only lasts 4 hits. It's also got a recast of 13 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm still sticking to my theory that 2 shamans to cover all the healing and debuffing would annihilate this trial. You'd need to get conviction before going because of the danger of canni5 and Spiritual Channeling, but There's no way a cleric can even touch our sustained healing when you factor in the 20 per tick drain over a 15 minute event. That's 3000 raw mana right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes, a good knight to offtank 2 mobs is way better than ccing them, because while healing the offtank (shm is definitely sufficient, when the knight has good gear (nope, not qvic+, good average oow gear) you can dot the *** out of them and save lots of time.<br />
<br />
iirc rains and bane worked on them, poison/disease dots failed horribly on them.<br />
<br />
mage in there is a very good idea as well, a pet with good enough focus (ok, mine had qvic focus, not that representative then) is amazing dps in there, even without mage permanuking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">mobs don't hit that hard on a good tank so slow is not always needed if you have good damage shield (aka bard/mage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mezzing in this event is basically a waste of time and mana.  The mobs do not hit hard enough for CC to be worth it.  Replace the bard with a dps / off tank.<br />
<br />
My usual group consists of:<br />
Me<br />
Druid (Main healer)<br />
Tank (War or Pally)<br />
3 other dps (melee preferred)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Simply done, the cleric is going tokeep reverge DS on all mobs, heal, and mage will pop his large DS on the tank, plus normal DS, and bard DS will stack, kicking the tanks ds to somewheres around upper 500's or lower 600's, PER HIT.

<br />
If you're relying on the DS to damage, wouldn't the Shaman's mana be best spent healing, rather than slowing the MoBs, since that would decrease not only the damage done to the tanks, but also the damage done by the Damage Shields?<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay tried this tonight for the first time and it was a sucess.<br />
<br />
Group make up was:<br />
<br />
Warrior (11.1k unbuffed HP tank)<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Druid<br />
Monk<br />
Necromancer<br />
<br />
Just before each wave began i HoTed myself, the cleric and the other OT (monk). On the first wave i used 1.5 clicky pretty early on, AAid on the 3rd wave and 1.5 clicky again on the final 4th wave. The group had clr/dru/shm buffs + C. I maintained Champion on the group throughout and gave the other tanks (monk and warrior) a click of my DS potion ontop of the druids Circle of Nettles. <br />
<br />
At the begining of each wave i slowed all the mobs ASAP without using malos, i got maybe 1-2 resists on 50% of them before slow landed. The MT kept aggro on the commander+another mobwhile the monk and me offtanked the rest. Druid assisted with healing initially but after they were all slowed (30 secs tops) they turned to doing DPS. We had on average 1.5min break between weaves to med and recover. <br />
<br />
All together it seemed like a fairly easy trial, no problems at all. On a side note i think the adjustments to MPG trials made the resists of mobs lower so casters could compete with melee DPS which is why i beleive we won with what seems like a relatively average DPS group.<br />
<br />
edit: I also had JBBP clicky up for a little more DS and sorry for bumping this old thread :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd agree doing CC on the adds is really a bad idea especially with a bard. Don't need to replace the bard just change the strategy. Instead of mezing the bard should be an ae dot, rizlona (over haste), Warsong (regular haste + ds) and Psalm of veeshan (ds and resists). Depending on gear and aa's the bard can be providing 150+ ds for everyone in the group.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it since the patch that changed resists but have done it after they made the ae unavoidable. The biggest thing I can recommend for casters is pick your targets well. The commander/elite seemed alot more resistant when I was doing it. Don't waste your mana on resists just work on a different target or wait.<br />
<br />
I do agree that casters that have mana related abilities or manaless dps are best. Pet classes do well for dps. Mages do well with damage shield and pet. Necros should do well with dots and pet with lich for the mana regen. Enchanters do well with gather mana. Of corse shaman do well with cann v, pained memory and spiritual channeling.<br />
<br />
With the resist changes caster dps should do alot better now too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nuking damage on this trial has always been brutally owned by anything melee, because the manapool hit cuts down the damage potential of casters so much.  Resists were never an issue on the Soldiers, just on the Commanders pretty much, just casters couldn't keep up because that 3500 mana hit up front costs them like 30k+ damage (more for wizards) over the course of the trial, while melee give up nothing.  Casters really get the shaft in Arcana and in Weaponry trials.  I suppose it's a kind of karmic balance for how good a mana bar usually is in timed trials.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I agree with the above posters.  Mezzing is a waste of time &amp; energy, no matter who's doing it.  Slow em all, then just heal off their damage while dealing as much damage to their friends as you can.  GL on belt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am going with Griz on this and supporting the theory that you can replace the cleric with a Shaman and be much better off. Shaman have a HUGE mana advantage over clerics, and now with the group HoT tools we have been given, we are the best choice for healing this trial by FAR. The 2 shaman should communicate about who will malos the commander each wave, and be sure to annouce what is slowed and when they are clicking Epic and Anc Aid, to prevent wasteful redundency on those things. <br />
<br />
I remember once doing this trial pre-nerf, the Cleric didnt know to not sit before a wave and got smoked. I Called him, healed the entire next wave and a half solo, while slowing em all, cleric used divine rez so he got all his mana back, and by the end of wave 3 it was like nothing bad had happened. Lost the roll on the belt though, grr, I am 0-6 on that stupid belt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notice that if noone is sitting the mobs seem to go after casters?  We have melee sit before wave to prevent that.<br />
<br />
I believe that Divine Res no longer works in MPG trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My group make-up usually goes:<br />
<br />
Shaman (me)<br />
Bard<br />
Warrior tank (13k w/ cleric and shammy buffs)<br />
Necro<br />
Rogue<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
If you have a good tank you should be able to heal this trial pretty easily. Also, it's probably better to replace the necro with a melee dps or off-tank for the 2nd commander. Have the bard mez 2 while you beat the other 2 down fast, and you should be fm long before the next wave of mobs come. <br />
<br />

Unless they changed this within the last two days, you still can.<br />
