<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I decide to give PoP tier 1 a try.  It's the first time that I have gone there with this character.  I zone into PoN and find 12 people.  Apparently 2 full groups.  Ok... so I zone into PoI and there are 6 people doing the entrance.  Alrighty then...  so I zone into PoD and its completely EMPTY!  I was the only one in the zone!  What the heck is goin on?  Where is everybody now?  LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">People traditionally go where the loot is.  PoP tier 1 has nothing worth more than a couple hundred plat in the bazaar anymore, and no cash loot.<br />
<br />
They're all in LDoN.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...or in Tier 2, which is open for the masses.</div></div><hr />

You're not nearly cynical enough, Twoflower.<br />
<br />
Tier two is pretty empty too.  PoV doesn't break 20 most nights I've gone LFG there on Rodcet.  Tier 3?  HoH is empty, while Bastion of Thunder is jam packed.  It's no coincidence that BoT has all the cool toys.<br />
<br />
Loot = people.  It's simple reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've zoned my cleric into PoN 3 times the last fortnight to rez friends. Each time the only people in the zone were me and and the corpse. Was starting to wonder if it was just me that people were avoiding...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I moved out of pop before ldon came out for the most part. All of a sudden just got really bored with all the outdoor stuff and my bank account was always empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what servers are you guys on? On zeb tier 1-2 are still very popular.  LDoN is an option, but PoP is much better for XP, and groups usually last alot longer than LDoN.  Also points/loot arent good in ldon before the 60's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pop is still fairly busy in tier 2 and above on torv. Not to hard to get a group though cuz everyones either in ldon or if they 62 and up they in BoT. I personally like to hang out in droga, better loot than pop and its better xp than tier 1 and easier for me to do than tier 2 dou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The same types of people are still out there, however.  A month ago I got dragged to PoD (kicking and screaming) to join a friend in a pickup group - he needed a slower.  <br />
<br />
We were the only 6 people in the zone, and yet the group still sat in the corner of Left Courtyard and single pulled bugs. <br />
<br />
Me:  Lets go romp through the zone, mebbe pull some of the entrance mobs in the castle or the goos or something.<br />
<br />
Them: Nah...lets just wait on repops.<br />
<br />
It was horrible.  After an hour I couldn't take it any more and left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ldon had kill tiers 1, more loot in it, and money for buy spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same thing on Karana. Empty Tier 1 zones, a lukewarm interest in Tier 2 zones, and Tier 3 ... well hell, I've never seen more than 18 people in HOH, and BOT is jam-packed every single day. Drunder is another nice, empty spot ... never seen more than 10 people in that zone (it's one of my favorites for that reason). I have spent less than three hours total (and about two of those hours were spent on open raids) in BOT and I cannot say as though I'm the worse for it. I'd rather have a relatively empty zone with nice, helpful people (HOH or PoTac) than a jam-packed zone (BOT) with the chance for cool toys and rude people. I deal with a$$holes every single day in RL, I don't need to deal with them in Norrath as well. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />
