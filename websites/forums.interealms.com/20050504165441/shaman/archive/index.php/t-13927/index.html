<br />
Keep a DS on the pet - either the mages or the druids (depending on if you are using the Druid or the Shaman to PL). 1 Burst of Flame from the mage per mob.<br />
<br />
Give the pet a Muzzle of Mardu, a Girdle of Magi'Kot, and 2 Fists of Ixiblat (beg from a high level mage, or purchase in bazaar).<br />
<br />
There really isn't a better way to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy use the druid, buff and damage shield the mage pet, sick the pet on mob, mage nukes once (use a small nuke, less mana and all he needs to do is 1pt of damage). Heal pet as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga was good for us.  We did a lot of ae faction in there for chardok, just group the mage with a druid (55 at the time) and let them do all the work while we pulled mass amounts of goblins.  Got the mage from about 26 to 50 (not all was ae, just 35+) while factioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best way to PL a Mage is to have a Monk PL him.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 65 Monk and he PLd my Shaman from 55-62.  <br />
<br />
I have the monk out of group.  Pull mob,<br />
Slow and Dot Mob with Shaman, monk beat the crap out of the mob until he has 4 percent left.  <br />
<br />
Monk FDs, mob attacks the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman's Pet attacks the mob. Turn on auto attack and kill the mob.<br />
<br />
The Shaman gets full exp<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason I dont send in the pet immediately after the monk pulls the mob, I seem to not get as much exp if the dog outdamages my Shaman. <br />
<br />
I did this in POJ/POI and got insane EXP for my shaman.  <br />
<br />
See ya<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mystipul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fastest way to pl a mage:).. (without using silly pet.)..<br />
<br />
have mage mem up an AE spell(low damage prefered).. Depending on the zone and what kind of mobs your pulling.<br />
<br />
Take your 65 SHAMAN.... make a few DS potions, find a friendly druid to throw a DS on you, drink your potion, Run through a field full of hostile mobs... get a nice train of 5 .. 10... 20.. how ever many you can handle.. Have Mage Ae for at least 1 point of damage (low level ae works great).    Sit back and let the DS kill mobs.  Heal yourself from time to time if you need to.  If you get a few run away unfriendlies... have the mage nuke them.  <br />
<br />
PS. Have root up. If baby mage by accident actually gets agro.. Root mob, and stand next to the mob till it kills itself on your Damage shield.<br />
<br />
Note to Shaman: Do not give into the urge to &quot;HIT&quot; any of the mobs. You do damage to them at all .. you will steal the Exp.  Let the DS do all the work.  This is especially fun in Fungus grove... run through a patch of shrooms.... hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">at lvl 40 the only DS method is dangerous, even with virtue and fo7 they get beat down fast.<br />
<br />
The main thing is get KEI, after that, the druid to DS the pet...and hp buff the pet. If the druid has some mana free damage items those are nice to help speed it up, you must do some testing to see how much damage you have to do before you accidently take the exp though.  My mage at 40 I think about 3 bracer clicks PLing with shaman.<br />
Make sure to get the ring bracer and bobble focus items as well.<br />
<br />
Did you get the shovel from temple of sol ro quest yet? gives you a bettter pet up through the 49 ones.<br />
<br />
Casters are never an easy PL :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
*edit* for some reason I thought the poster was starting a mage /boggle I must need sleep<br />
<br />
the shovle only works for the earth pet, there is a torch (fire), stien(water) and broom(air) also. they make them look bigger, and give them more HP/damage output. I *think*<br />
<br />
back to the topic. Id say use the buff the pet and let the mage do 1 damage method. pets should not take any exp if the controler does 1 point on damage now.<br />
<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3191<br />
<br />
this shows all the the mage pet info (for the most part). if you have a high level druid Id say use the earth pet, as its hit points are higher then the others and let the druid DS/hp buff plus add your HP buff. I think the fire pet has a higher DS then what a mage at the appropriate level can cast on it, so you might look into that if a druid is not avaiable however it has about half the HP of the other pets.<br />
<br />
as for places. Id say..<br />
1-20 PC just start on the shadeweaver side and just ds the mage and let him loose<br />
20-35 sola start with the goblins and then move to clockworks, with goblins +aego/virtue you should be fine tanking with the mage with a DS. with clockworks Id move to the pet method.<br />
35+ you can go anywhere, though I would say stick to dungones for the xp bonus (more xp = good) keasora, nurga, CoM, solb all work well.<br />
46+ start with poj then just duo/leech the rest of the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i would do that way: mage get c3,<br />
shaman pull 10 to 15 whit slow,mage mem ae damage spells and pet,now start to damage all the mobs at least to 50 percent,and then shaman whit pet (/pet hold, help) help to finish mobs.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=580518<br />
<br />
repeat  while the mage regain mana,shaman pull another 10 to 15 mobs (whit canni 5 there is little to no downtime),and ready to kill again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PLing a mage essentially consists of healing the pet while it shreds as many low blue mobs as possible.<br />
<br />
Well, if you have a high level DS available to you, then yes, healing the pet may be the fastest way since mobs will be dying quickly. However, absent a DS, it is probably more efficient to keep the agro on the Shaman and let the pet do its thing.<br />
<br />
Using this approach, the Shaman pulls with slow and then just stands there, taking a beating, healing himself and/or rooting as needed, and helping finish the mob once it gets low on health. As long as the Shaman is in melee range and the Mage isn't, the mob will always be attacking the Shaman and not the pet regardless of how much damage the pet does. The Mage can nuke, mana regeneration permitting, to speed things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a mage of level 30 and with c3 on the mage the real key is just to make sure to land malosini(a).  With that on, the mage can nuke reds for full no problem.  I dont even bother with DS's, the ones the mage has at that level last all of about 5 seconds anyway.  Pull with malosinia, slow, then melee with the shaman while mage pet attacks and mage nukes.  You can chain nuke with the mage usually because of the shaman's aggro already.<br />
<br />
If you have a druid helping out though, use rains and ae's and keep a ds up on the shaman while he pulls hordes.</div></div><hr />
