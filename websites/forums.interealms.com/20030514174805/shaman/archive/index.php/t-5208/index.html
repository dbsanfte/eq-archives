<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have wtov dropped gaunts, boots, bracer, and legs to turn into kael.  I'm ally to whatever the hell faction you get + in wtov, but scowls to one of the other two (tormax I'm betting, since I've killed a decent amount of dorfs), since I got attacked while a friend was leading me to the bank.<br />
<br />
I've been told that there's a tormax giant standing next to our quest giver.  What's the best way for me to get my armor instead of getting pasted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only way is to be non kos to tormax. You can't do the armor quests if your kos to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually you can do it kos but it requires some help. You either need someone to train away 2 pretty bad ass mobs or tank them while you compleate the quests. Easiest thing to do tho is grab a dain hit or 2 and you'd be great on tormax faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tomaraya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">can't you just CoH past the tormax mobs, or is that only for certain classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">only for certain classes.<br />
<br />
tmax takes forever to get up unless you get in on some yeli or dain kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">THeres a few ways to raide it, but they tend to be slow (apart from getting hits from dain/yelniak)<br />
<br />
Hand dwarf heads to captain bvellos in the bank<br />
Hand icepaw kobald paws in 4's to the same guy<br />
Do the delivery to mercenaries in WL quest<br />
<br />
Expect about 30+ dorf heads tho from scowl to dubious</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can CoH past the tormax factioned mobs for everyone but shaman. The shaman quest giver is in the side your with what people nicknamed frozen jesus and the guy who drops the orb of the infinite void, both who are on tormax faction.<br />
<br />
As I said if you can managed quickest and easiest way to raise tormax faction is a dain hit. Yelinak works well too. The royal guards in icewell also raise tomax faction if you can get a group to hunt them.</div></div><hr />
