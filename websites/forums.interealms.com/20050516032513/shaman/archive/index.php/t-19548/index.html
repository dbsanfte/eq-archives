<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 20% and can take 4 unrez'd deaths before going back to 64.  I normally start to go back to reg xp when I get down to 16% till I'm back to around 20% again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you think I should leave reg xp on to 20% or go 50/50 as soon as I ding 65? So many questions! hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Zodiax,<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you leave regular xp at full until you get 14%. Then I would go 90% aaxp and 10% regular xp. Just leave it at this. You will slowly amass a great buffer.<br />
<br />
14% should not take too long to get to and will cover a couple of deaths, possibly even three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, depending on where you go at, i would put it about maybe 50/50 till you get at least 5 - 6% into 65 (buffer in case you die and can't get that rez).  Then I would maybe put it at 90/10 until you build yourself up to 20% or so.  I stayed there for a long time, switching bakc and forth between 100/0 and 90/10 until I just one day decided to go for it and left it at 90/10 till i got up around 50%, then I went back to full AAXP.  Then again, part of the reason was cause of the rumor that we will be getting 5 more levels with GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on your play-style.  If you raid a lot, you might not have the time to invest into having a large buffer.  For me, I had a decent mix of raiding and xping, so I had 20% invested into level 65.  Once I hit about 6%, I worked on getting it back to 20%.  Now, since I am raiding a lot more, I doubled it to 40% [ 90% AA / 10% Reg until I had 40% ]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,well, depending on where you go at, i would put it about maybe 50/50 till you get at least 5 - 6% into 65 (buffer in case you die and can't get that rez).

I completely disagree.<br />
Go 100% aa or 100% regular exp.  Doing anything else forces Sony to split exp numbers in half to go to two different exp bars.  What's that mean?  Invariably there will be rounding whenever the exp # is an odd number.  Which digit gets rounded and in which direction?  Is it just the 1's column?  If so, maybe it isn't a big deal, but we're talking about potentially losing a eensy teensy piece of exp on EVERY DAMN occasion  experience is gained.  No thank you.<br />
<br />
I generally go 100% regular until I'm happy with where my bar is, then go 100% AA.  Sometimes I will just set a timer for 30 min and run full exp and then switch back.<br />
<br />
Before GoD info was starting to filter out, I heard a nasty rumour that we might get additional levels, so I filled up my 65 bar completely.  Right now it generally sits 1-2 blues short of being full (depending on how much raiding and dying I've been doing).  When it goes more than 2 blues down, I just go full regular exp for one LDoN adventure, and then turn it back to AA's.<br />
<br />
I don't trust the random number generator string, and I don't trust Sony to round rather large numbers properly without taking shortcuts (truncating instead of rounding up???) that might possibly subtract from the maximum amount of experience I should be getting.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Something to think about anyway.  I am a strong advocate of doing your OWN splitting by switching from 100% in one category and then flipping back and forth as your desires dictate. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been 10(reg)/90(aa) ever since I dinged 65. I'm at 30% reg now. Not sure why I don't turn it 100% aa but I just haven't. I would say that it depends alot on if you've got 65 spells banked yet. I didn't have any when I dinged 65 so I didn't really see any issue with dropping to 64 for a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stronglikeox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I lose 6% per death at 65.  So I try to keep my buffer at 13% so I can eat 2 deaths and keep going (like in LDoN).  I'd suggest doing 100% regular xp until 6% then 90aa/10reg until you're comfortable with the buffer.... and keep in mind eventually you'll need to refresh your buffer even with 96% rezzes, so keep an eye on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I feel cumfy at 30 percent personally. Went 100percnet reg xp until 25 percent and didn't feel it was enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hung around 15% for a long time, then decided to move it up to 30%, so I could eat more deaths.  I haven't really had more than one unressed death at a time in a very long time, but meh, it pays to be prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally I keep a 20% min buffer and go 50-50 if I hit 19%. All it takes is a screwup to miss a res and the buffer becomes important. Especially with PoTime being 65th required to enter it is common sense for me to retain the buffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I dinged 65, I immediately went 80/20 AA/normal exp. I stayed at that raid till I was 40% into 65, and since then I have kept it at 10%. I take a ton of exp deaths, I never care if I get rezzes or not. I'm right now 70% into 65, and still going 10% to normal.<br />
<br />
Being able to die and not care about rezzes is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I aim to keep it around 15-20%, I've never undinged yet. Anything more than that and you've got potential AA points you could be using, sitting there as wothless xp.<br />
<br />
I stay on 100% aa until I get my next target (e.g. current target is LR5, 15AA pts total). When I reach that I will go 100% std xp until my buffer is back up to 20% or so.<br />
<br />
I feel this way I reach each target faster but still have minimal risk of going back to 64. Anytime you split AA/XP you are making to take longer to reach either target so I like to hit one target (aa skill), then the other. Similarly, switching away from AA when you have 2aa unspent say, is a waste. Get the rest of the AA for your next skill, then switch to xp.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course though - I can understand some people may be worried about going back to 64, but I honestly can only think of one time in 6 months that I've not got a rezz, and a couple of times when I've taken 2 deaths in a row (but then both of those times got 2 rezzes right after).<br />
<br />
If you're like Einno and have 360+ AAs then I can understand putting more into regular xp, but for me (120aa) each aa point is still very valuable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sowful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went 100% exp until 25% then switched to 100% AA.  Go back to 100% exp when i hit 15% and get it back to 25%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I spent the longest time on 13-15% regular xp, ie: once it dropped to 12% (through rezzes etc), i'd switch back to 100% xp until it hit 15%.<br />
<br />
I now have my xp maxed out at 100% (although a lot of time its shows as 99%), mainly because I have run out of useful aa, and If SoE were dumb enough to raise the cap with GoD, I wanted level 66 first kill ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did a 90/10 split when I hit 90% but I don't die that often and I'm not in a guild (so very little raiding and it's small scale if I do it).  On the rare occasions that I eat a death with no rez I'll switch to 90/10 again to rebuild my 20% buffer.  If I were in a raiding guild (or any guild that was active with events that cause lots of dying) I would go with a higher buffer and I imagine at some point I'll bump up my regular buffer amount - but right now I'm AA hungry.</div></div><hr />
