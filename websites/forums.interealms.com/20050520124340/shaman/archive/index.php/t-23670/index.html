<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well the final resting place of the person in beta that sent you to Omens, was in PoK up top of the library.  Was a Magus of Discord if I remember correctly.  He wasn't physically in the library but outside of it after you go up the strairs.  But.. that was beta and anything can happen now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">top of the library  <br />
<br />
Did they fix the Lift of Doom ? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On beta he was just outside the main libarary building. <br />
<br />
Go up one of the spiral staircases, then just outside, beside one of the large bridges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">either that or the priest of discord of homecities.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am thinking they have done a reasonable job combining instant-transport with actually traveling. The new Orgin AA will allow players to gate to home city, and then run to the PoD for a port to OoW. A reasonable solution to the &quot;Death Run&quot; that can be found in some Gates situations. While I feel that some of the instant-travel has sort of ruined the &quot;feel&quot; of the game, this double-port deal seems a reasonable compromise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about us Iksar's who have no PoD in our city? Or did they change that recently?<br />

<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Priest of Discord'<br />
Priest of Discord says 'Ah, another who admits that the path to glory and power lies in discord? Have we not always preached the truth?  We are the only ones that can give you passage to the new world of purest Discord.  Should you like to go there, tell me you [wish to go to Discord] and I will grant you passage.  If you wish to [know more] about this travel, I will tell you. And, of course, if you have come to seek the way of Discord in your life, then ask me about your [Tome of Order and Discord].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I wish to know more'<br />
Priest of Discord says 'We have been given a unique magic to pass through realms and we believe it to be the influence of Discord itself granting this gift upon its faithful followers. Only we can send you back and forth to the realm touched by Discord, a world called Kuua. You will find priests on the other side that will send you directly back to me, where your travel originated.  And, if you are of the right ilk, I may be able to grant you [additional information].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what additional information?'<br />
Priest of Discord says 'There is a magic in Kuua that is blessed with the power of Discord itself.  We have found we can use that magic to help those who help us.  If you return three [discordant crystal shards] and a [magic parchment], we will imbue it with our power so you may travel there alone.  Obviously, you must be a master of teleportation yourself -- a wizard or druid, is what I mean.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They changed it. There are Priests of Discord in places where there weren't any before.<br />
And the Origins AA will put you face to face with your guild master in your home city....good luck to any that have ruined their faction :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wonder if lvl 1 toons that turn in their Tome of Discord will be non-KoS in Discord....  Ok, back to reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's in the patch notes. Reading is good, mkay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frooaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well have hailed PoD in hometown of Gukta and tell him I wish to go to Discord ( or whatever he told me to tell him similar to that LOL)<br />
 he says prepare to be sent and casts a spell and then nothing. Is there a lower lvl limit to being transported there or some pre-flagging thing that needs to be done?<br />
<br />
Level 59 currently so thought that would be high enough to go there but its not working for me in my home cities or in a couple other cities I tried just to test it<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How long did you wait? Unlike the LDON teleporters, there's about a 15-20 delay until port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had trouble with this too. I restarted EQ and clicked on the Advance mode and clicked on OoW to download everything for the expansion, after I did that it has ported me everytime. And no, there's no preflags or level requirements (guildy of mine brought their level 56 or so cleric to rez me once).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Iksar have a priest of discord in East Cab.  He is in one of the back buildings next to the 2 iksar that give shamans their armor quest.</div></div><hr />
