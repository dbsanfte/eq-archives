<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried a search and could not find anything.  If there is one, I apologize in advance.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is any information on additional out of the way portals in the OoW zones.<br />
<br />
We accidentally found one in Bloodfields that takes you to right above the Tables camp in RCoD.  What a time saver that has been.<br />
<br />
Have any of you found any others?  I would love to know if there is one that zones you into RS from NC - now that would make my day.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for anything you care to share on this topic.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a cave located partway across the zone on the northern wall just after the bridge.<br />
<br />
There's only one mob in the entire cave, a little piggy that you kill to start an event.   <br />
<br />
Go past him and at the back of the cave there is a pile of rocks.<br />
<br />
Right click on the rocks (it will drop your invis) and you will be ported to a cave about the statue and benches in RCoD.</div></div><hr />
