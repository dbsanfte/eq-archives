I did the DL as always, put them into the EQ map files, and still...missing lava spinners, and the zone tween the camps and still moon (brainfart on name)<br />

Gues it got posted after i had quit... lol so where can i get this please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not sure if this is the problem or not leibeast, if your downloading the map pack for Eq, it may not include the latest once for don...do a seperate download for justt don maps .  I had pretty much the same prob and it fixed it.<br />
<br />
if that doesnt work, try a differnet file to download, someone else may have saved the one they made for a differnt background color skin and it isnt showing up well to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i will try both, i do think i tried DL the individual maps after mappack, but i could not swear on it....so will try again, then also to different files, now i am DL directly into EQ map folder.<br />
<br />

Actually, if someone who as already gone through Mapfiend and selected the best maps for all the zones, including named spawn points, would care to zip them up and send them to me, I'll be happy to host them. It took me like half an hour to actually pick which MPG maps looked best, and I don't have time to do that for every zone.</div></div><hr />
