<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Um, noticed some oddness this morning when I logged on for some fast BoT action.  Was grouped with a 65 warrior with fairly average to low end weapons . . no BoC or anything kewl.  The monk was dragging aggro off him for goodness sake!  Anyway I was the slower and the healer and also had mana for DoTs.  SO I dropped curse, ancient scourge of nife, and bane of nife on a giant right after slowing it.  No aggro, no summon, nothing!  Was really strange so I tossed a heal . . still no summon.  Wierdness.  Usually two 10-poison-counter DoTs ensures me permanent aggro for the rest of the fight!  And that's with a BoC wielding warrior.  If I wait till the mob is half dead, maybe I can land both and get away with it.  But . . . I dunno anyone else noticed this sorta thing?  <br />
If poison counter aggro was stealth fixed, I would be rather happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I chain casted E-Bolt 4 times in PoN on my necro and it didn't phase the werewolf.  Seems dots don't get much aggro anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">More likly summoning is still broken from the patch. Enraging, rampaging and summoning haven't been working right.<br />
<br />
The aggro list is pretty smucked up at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baiyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have noticed this too...also, we couldn't keep mobs off of our rangers and druids last night.  One druid died like 4 times during the raid and wasn't even casting much.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Noticed something similar in ST the other night too. Wasn't getting aggro from slow (even with multiple resist) or from Pox/Breath of Ulthor casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Similar experience in clearing PoG getting to Tunare.  We pulled those annoying little focusers and usually for giggles I load up 8 spell gems of dots and see how many times I can get summoned.  It's basically harmless fun.<br />
<br />
But post-patch we cleared PoG and took down Tunare again.  Got all ready for the focusers, laid on 7 dots.... nothing.  Epic.  nothing.  Redid Bane, Epic, Venom, Plague and every other dot I could dig up.  <br />
<br />
Still nothing.<br />
<br />
Maybe poison dot aggro actually *did* get reduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">seems more likely that aggro is currently fuxored with respect to spells in general.  I hear that critical nukes now basically ensure you will be the MA for the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It seems that the only thing that counts for agro right now is pure damage. Night of the patch my guild did Yelnik (sp?) for the first time and I loaded ever dot I had on it without even getting looked at. My guild tried doing IV last night which is normally a trivial mob to us all of our damage dealing classes were summoned and killed almost immediately. The warriors couldn't hold agro at all. Heals are also a bit screwed up. A Critical heal was a garanteed summon for a cleric. <br />
<br />
Theres also a lot of NPC agro issues. Monklybusiness has a pretty big list on thier front page that my monk bro pointed out to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well...enjoy it while it lasts, but expect it to be changed soon ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nuke agro is wacky, I got summoned and ended up tanking emp till I died.<br />
<br />
For a 223 partially resisted dd (Ice strike, not velium strike).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">By soon do you mean within weeks or the 6 months to a year that Sony seems to use as a definition for the word. <br />
<br />
/ducks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You know, if they only counted DoTs as a sum total of their damage . . . without a poison counter or extra happy-fun DoT aggro . . . I'd be rather happy.  Make em like Necro dots in that respect . . . sheesh.  <br />
<br />
If I could land a ancient scourge and get 2k dmg assigned to me for aggro purposes, I think that would be a lot less aggro than if I had one resist from that particular spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Has anyone noticed any difference in aggro from our DOTS after the emergency patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Numagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DoT aggro seems fixed, we had a quick Dain raid (Thanks SoE for fixing pathing!) and I ended up tanking him the last 20% of the fight after 2 casts of Saryn.</div></div><hr />

The amount of agro Im getting is unbelievable and yet we could duo these things happily pre patch.<br />
Talked to a GM &amp; he said no one  else had mentioned it.......so am I just one unlucky shammy or what ?<br />

not lost again.........just looking around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yah i played today and aggro from Poison DoTs seems . . . if possible . . . worse than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Used to be our nukes gave us little aggro and poison dots were our bane, so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would have to fall into the &quot;dot agro is worse than ever&quot; camp.  I'm seeing dotters being summoned all over the place now.  <br />
<br />
Fortunately, the only DoT I ever bother with anymore is my epic.  For the rest, I'll just velium strike over and over.  Fewer resists, faster damage, and more of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guild tried the Vulak Ring and ANY use of a CH or percentage CH resulted in a summon and death.  This was our first attempt, is this normal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I was maloing, slowing and dotting with Blood of Saryrn in the arena in Plane of Tactics, and I was regularly pulling mobs off of a pretty decently equipped SK.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">That's really surprising.<br />
<br />
Partnering with mage in PoS and I noticed I could lay epic, pox and bane on every critter - pulled aggro from the mage pet (briefly) twice all nite, provided I gave him one tick to get aggro before slowing.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I pulled every one with malo, then slowed after that tick, and cast the dots one after the other.<br />
<br />
Just for the sake of experimentation, I tried crippling instead of bane one fight and tanked until it was dead.  /sigh<br />
<br />
I've found dot damage to still generate a LOT less aggro than before, but this is in a pet group.<br />
<br />
Maybe there's another part of the equation we're missing?  Both our pets were using the lvl 61 mage summoned sword - procs a DD with stun component, I believe? - with 61 mage pet which also casts stun.  From the posts here, it sounds like these pets are taunting off of me easier than PC's?  I love it, but it sounds crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We did yelinak again the other night and this time I got summoned and munched after my second bane. So agro seems higher now to me too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Really odd, one BoN lately and I wind up tankling the rest of the fight unless I root or the tank has some good taunt weapons.<br />
<br />
Of course it's a nice ego boost to amaze my group by living through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">DoT aggro seems fixed, we had a quick Dain raid (Thanks SoE for fixing pathing!) and I ended up tanking him the last 20% of the fight after 2 casts of Saryn.<br />
<br />
How does the new pathing affect the Dain pull?  Can the guards still be split?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Baiyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah I think DoT aggro is worse than before the patches.  After the emergency patch I tried to solo in PoD like I had been before the patches and my puppy could not keep aggro like he could before.  I was getting aggroed after my disease DoT and that has never happened before :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hi ya,<br />
<br />
Just adding some comments ....<br />
<br />
We did HP in SSra last night ....<br />
<br />
Was able to land 4 Breaths of Ulthor, 6 Epics, and 33 Velium Strikes ....<br />
without any aggro, didn't even make Rampage for a change and it was much more fun then healing :)<br />
<br />
No aggro whatso ever .... Although, I tend not to use Poison DoTs in Raid situations in fear of stealing aggro ......<br />
<br />
