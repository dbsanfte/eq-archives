Also I thought that our attempts to ease the burdens of flagging and backflagging in PoP and Gates, along with our new spin on flagging on OoW (A single locked zone - Anguish - with a single group component, a raid component, and the option to replace the raid component with a drop from Anguish), were steps toward correcting the underlying issue.  You probably won't see another EQ expansion with PoP or Gates style progression, and you probably won't see another expansion with more than one or two locked or flagged zones.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;If you want me to lay it out, PoP flagging was an error, we tried to ease it up some with Gates, but that didn't work out as well as we would have liked.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />

<br />
I am shamed to say I read that without any hesitation and fully understood it /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It makes no sense to me. If they thought it was an error, why didn't they correct PoP instead of trying to use GoD as a correction.  Sure they made a few changes but didn't go near far enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoP/GoD forced people to work through content, not immediately arriving at the &quot;best exp areas&quot;/&quot;best loot areas.&quot;<br />
<br />
GoD/PoP weren't problematic because they have locked zones.  There was an undue amount of &quot;bottom feeding&quot; (a player geared far above content forced to go back).  Be it backflagging raids, or endless Tipt/Vxed runs/BiC requirements for Ikkinz access.  Both were changed recently to ease the burden.<br />
<br />
Nobody knows how much &quot;bottom feeding&quot; is required for the anguish enabled guilds to get the anguish-esque raids.  Or for the riftseekers exp group to get to similar exp in missions.  Maybe its 20 missions, maybe its 50.  Luckily this suffering only happens for one guildie.  Which was the only resolution out of GoDs failings.<br />
<br />
In my mind it isn't always the best plan of action to tell people upfront the best gear an expansion has to offer.  Maybe there are 400point items, or 450 point items but unless there is gear which is unlocked when a &quot;raid is finished&quot; there is no fair way to equate those who spend months/years raiding with those spending a week earning mission points.    This may actually happen (which would be good), I didnt earn enough points in beta to know for sure.<br />
<br />
The point is this.  Progression through an expansion isn't bad.  GoD will probably end up being the best expansion in retrospect.  It just wasn't the best for a time guild who had been farming time for 9 months prior to release.  As a 1 group you could work your way towards ikkinz 1 group/primal gear.  As a raid you could move to qvic and beyond.  To date I think the only problem is the bic parts required from rhondo (you should be able to earn the bic up to kodtaz w/o any major raids).  <br />
<br />
Does the 1 group never guilded really expect to see Tacvi/beyond?  I surely hope not.  Just as they wont see the Raid missions in DoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rondo isn't a &quot;major raid&quot;~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well, in my opinion, it really shouldn't be a &quot;flagging&quot; thing. you shouldn't have to be forced to &quot;work through content&quot;.<br />
<br />
Velious, arguably the best expansion, had locked raid zones, and zones that were just plain hard to get to. but once you got to these zones, you could get items that allowed you more convenient access, such as a druid/wizzy port.<br />
<br />
I suppose you could think of the &quot;Tooth&quot; from GD as a key, but you only had to make it there to get it. the locked content were simply locked from lack of exploration.<br />
<br />
it doesn't bother me that sleeper's tomb is locked. it isn't a majority of the expansion's content, unlike GoD and PoP. GoD wouldn't have been so bad if all you had to do is make it to the other side of certain zones.<br />
<br />
personally, I liked the Kunark method of keying. a small quest that would allow you to access a small side zone. HS for example, you could solo the key for entrance. I did it in my 40's and I loved every minute. Sebilis is the same way. VP, the raid zone, was locked, but you could still quest for the key, despite how much, or how little you played. Trak's Tooth was the hardest item to get if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
the point is that they FORCED people to work through content and the content was only workable for the most well-geared of players, and even they had a hard time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem with PoP was that up until then the game was primarily oriented around 6 person groups with raiding as a high end adjunct for people who are into that. With PoP it became join a raid guild or rot. Yes some independents and family guilds found a way to make it work for them, bravo, but really the game became focused on big raiding guilds in a way it had never been before. *That* was the giant screwup of PoP, not just about whether you can get loot fast enough. <br />
<br />
Most players i know who are not in big raid guilds don't play for loot, they played to hang out with their buddies and try to accomplish a little something in game during a few hour session. And it was very hard to accomplish much in an evening in EQ after PoP unless you were in a raid guild.<br />
<br />
When EQ was in it's prime, during the velious/kunark era, I often told friends that one of the reasons the game worked so well is that it accomodated a variety of play styles: soloing, grouping, and some raiding for those into that. PoP tried to force us into a play style that the game designers wanted, it was way too narrow in it's concept of what is fun for its player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Groupable loot from zones with groupable access in PoP was so far in advance of previous expansions.  The average player gained far more from BoT, HoH, PoTactics, CoD than they'd gotten from all of Velious and Luclin combined.  PoP did have far fewer throwaway empty zones, and far less content for non-planar players (since they were locked out and all), but the gains for small-group gamers were immense.<br />
<br />
Think about this a sec.  What uberosity were you collecting in Velious with your one group? afaik, there was Barbed Ringmail from Velks, Kelp caster/monk stuff from SG, and Rygorr mail from EW.  Rarely, you'd find someone who farmed Skyshrine for Guardian/Sentry armor.  Anything else? don't say Thurg armor, casual people avoided Kael, it was a raid zone.  As was Western Wastes, Sleeper's Tomb, PoG, ToV.<br />
<br />
Luclin had even less for casual gamers.  They got Shield of Bane Warding and the Beastlord epic.  Druid farmers got some Grey Flesh stuff to distribute from quadding... um, there was.. Twilight Sea armor? hahahaha<br />
<br />
Perhaps you were dissatisfied based on the greener grass of five zones you couldn't get into, but really, &quot;the little guy&quot; gained tons in PoP.  I was there, I was in it, I did it.  Didn't join a guild until their second wave of GoD flagging.  Without any guild, while working a full time job, I flagged up to Vex Thal, elementals and KodTaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;The average player gained far more from BoT, HoH, PoTactics, CoD&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course all of those zones were inaccessible when PoP came out.  Making them accessible when you reached the appropriate level came after the release of PoP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Without any guild, while working a full time job, I flagged up to Vex Thal, elementals and KodTaz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck with flagging EP's today though.  Flagging changes completely killed the open raids on Innoruuk server at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BoT HoH Tactics and CoD had one-group quests for exp (non-progression) access at release.  Those quests still work to get you in before you're at the threshold level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's sad about the pickup flag raids :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guild back on TT did flagging runs of peeps to get us into PoV/PoS before there was level-based access. That was back when people in PoV found reps before they left your group, because if they didn't, word got out and they didn't get invited back. Ever. You mentioned a desire to go afk, and waited until a couple of others wanted to too, then the whole group took 10, then came back and played for another three hours. Most of the flood of people who got level-based access never had that sort of respect for (or commitment to) the group.<br />
<br />
OMG, I sound like a grumpy old-timer now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">when PoP first came out, before the &quot;level flag&quot; change, the loots were slim to nil for average players who didn't raid.<br />
<br />
most loot in PoP is raid only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It sucked leveling to 61 in PoD (or PoI factory if I was lucky). =\<br />
<br />
Ok, so it was fun sometimes, but mostly boring being in the same two zones/camps...although that's partially my own fault since I HATE PoN. Damn trees and dark...<br />
<br />
I like moving around now. XPing in WoS, RCoD, MPG, PoFire, KT or RSS (if I'm lucky), and soloing in NC and Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally I like the separation of raiders and non raiders.<br />
<br />
As a non-uber I was in pod until 61+, where I eventually got my CoD flag via the quest. Nothing gave me more of a sense of accomplishment to get those CoD groups with &quot;ubers&quot; or see those amazing loots drop. (even bubonian blood was like 1kpp).. I always had a sense of wonderment about what else there must be out there.. and if not this expansion, some expansion later maybe I'll see some of it.. mystique is great apeal.<br />
<br />
Then as a raider I got the crazy rush zoning into bot with only 12-18ppl in there.. leaving orin(sp) etc up because they were too hard to kill.. gave wonderment and accomplishment..<br />
<br />
I got the same wonderment when we took vox down etc.. same wonderment first time in VT/VP..<br />
<br />
but now.. it's not that special.. and it's because casual people complained so much that soe ruined the old expansions.. because no one wants to kill aow for the 100hps ring when there is an attunable with better stats.. basically making all low/mid-tier raiding guilds a joke.. <br />
<br />
Guess my point is I really loved pop. If they put the 5:1 ratio thing in at the beginning. Loot something from higher zones to get access, and not his level ****, I think it's healthy for the game, and makes it much more fun.. and I hope in the future they do have a lot of different tiers to progress through.<br />
<br />
Grind xp to get to higher zone as a means of progression is dumb =b</div></div><hr />
