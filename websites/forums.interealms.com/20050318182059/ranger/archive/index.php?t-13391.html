<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mien</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">55 is a perfect level for the PoD, PoI, and PoN.  Last night I was in PoI and PoN on my 52 Shaman and the group was pretty much all low to mid 50 people.  We did fine and had no deaths or trains at all.  Seems the main thing for these places is to have a slower of some kind.  With a slower in PoN I tank all the time at 59 at not very good gear.</div></div><hr />

Fearkiting is an option, but I doubt it at 55, but viable in a group with a solid healers and slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shyy</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about solo, but it seems from the responses that it would be very difficult. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the input :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoN would be a good place to check out.  The Blood ravens are easily snared and feared, and you can pull them just to the left of the GY and fear them straight out from the wall.  Just make sure you are close enough away that it doesn't aggro some more naked soul waiting for a res.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaid</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not recomend any melee class try to solo these planes if anything at all went wrong you would turn into a bloody mist faster than you could blink. But that being said groups can rake in massive huge amounts of exp at a very good clip in both pon and pod.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevant Faeshadow</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rats in PoD are not really worth it for fearkiting imho.  They hit like trucks for the level, and have too many HP.  I consider most of the new planes 50+ if you know your class at all, and can get 1) a slower, or 2) a warrior.  I can tank there without a slower at 57, but it is rather painful :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolair Strongbo</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kiters are about the only thing that can solo in the planes.<br />
<br />
And slowers, while not always completely required, definately make the exp much quicker and more efficient.</div></div><hr />

Pull with Ensnare, when it got close and far enough away from the others, panic, dot, shoot arrows into its butt.<br />
<br />
Only swung my swords when it stopped runnin at 20% =)<br />
<br />
Never took a lick of damage.<br />

Ended up being crappy xp for the time involved. Went back to bodyguards till 62.</div></div><hr />

PoP is the best place to go for group xp . . . I'm only 55; I'm not gonna try soloing these guys.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you have a slowing weapon, you can try soloing the bodyguards in EW.  Just expect to use a lot of mana on harmony of nature . . .</div></div><hr />
