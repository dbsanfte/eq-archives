<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its been 2 months to the day since my froglok was born on February 24, 2003.  I've never announced level dings and rarely ever try show off my character's accomplishments, but I thought this one might be a bit more special.<br />
<br />
Without any power leveling and only starting out with 10k of equipment I've managed through soloing, duoing, and grouping to achieve the title of Baron in 2 short months of play.  My current equipment is a bit improved due to some nice drops I've won along the way and to the success of my trader in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=658812<br />
<br />
I'd like to introduce my Main Character, and due to my love of the Shaman class, my only character over level 25.<br />
<br />
BARON AZTKIUS FLYBANE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome, Aztkius.<br />
<br />
Just to get it over with, because I know someone will say it eventually...<br />
<br />
As you begin to level up past 53, start to change your gear so that it favors hitpoints over wisdom; this will increase your mana acceleration potential in favor of mana pool.  Work towards the ultimate goal of being able to use Cannibalization (lose 1924 hp for 1080 or so mana) without getting low health agro.  This is probably ~3000 hp self-buffed.<br />
<br />
This goal is not difficult to obtain with today's bazaar prices, and in no way do you have to be uber at all to achieve it.  I'm far far far from uber yet I can reach about 3100 hp self-buffed.  It's tiny compared to other people but I can make do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, definately a nice druid you have there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Corrode</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tell me there was a mistake made in magelo! You didnt put 3 AA points in wisdom did you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice to meet you.  Get ready for a drubbing about your wisdom gear.  Time to get skooled about hp/ac gear.  GEBs, Acrylia tunic, Supple scale armband . . . velium jasper . . . ok nm.  I'm done.  Check out our equipment section to get suggestions and ideas.  <br />
Welcome to the Crucible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In particular, I would:<br />
<br />
1) lose the velium jasper rings -- replace them with almost anything else (even velium fire wedding rings, which are 6ac/65hp and very cheap).<br />
<br />
2) lose the supple scale armband (maybe get a bracelet of fortitude if you can afford one, which i suspect you can based on the fact you have the solstice earing)<br />
<br />
3) lose the GEBs and maybe replace them with barbed dragonscale boots (about the same price, but much better for a shaman)<br />
<br />
4) lose the Acrylia Tunic and replace it with...something.  Not sure what.  If you have alot of money, the Tae Ew Chain Tunic is nice.  If not, something more modest, but definitely something with hp, ac, and some wis.  Maybe a phase spider carapace.  They've come down in price alot lately.<br />
<br />
The rest seems appropriate to your class/level.<br />
<br />
Regarding AA, I strongly suggest you get run speed 3.  It will serve you alot better than the +20 mana you get from innate wis3.<br />
<br />
All that being said, good accomplishment getting up through the levels without powerleveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My advice?  De-level so you can be a Baron leading Vox/Naggy raids.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pleasure to meet all of you and thank you for the excellent advice.<br />
<br />
On the subject of Hit Point Gear...  I'd never really considered it before, but I can see the utility of it now.  Would have been funny the first time I cast CanV without buffs on.  You begin casting Cannibalize V.  You have taken 1924 points of damage.  You’re now dead as a doornail.<br />
<br />
On the subject of Wisdom...  I have to admit here that my character has a dual purpose in that he will be a master craftsman of all trades.  To that end I will ensure that I end up with a 355 wisdom for crafting.  As for Speed 3, I obtained my last 3 AA Exp in two days, so I am not too concerned if I have to stop and pick up 3 more because I am forced to hunt somewhere inside.  I skipped it currently because I am only in outdoor zones and I will be purchasing my 103k drogmor drum soon.<br />
<br />
Also on the topic of Gear...  Many of you have noticed I've only replaced some of the gear I purchased with my original 10k at level 1.  I will still be picking up a full set of crafting wisdom gear, but now my focus for hunting will be more heavily on finding Hit Point gear with accompanying wisdom bonuses.  Plat is not a terrible issue here so I should be able to pick up a good set within the next month.<br />
<br />
Again thank you all for taking the time to enlighten me to some of the possibilities for finishing my Shaman up to level 65.<br />

How is it possible at level 53 and in only two months to generate the kind of plat you needed for all of that equipment and still afford a 103k drogmor &quot;soon&quot;? And in outdoor zones?<br />

well he did say he &quot;started&quot; his character with &quot;only&quot; 10k so you know he got a big bank account.<br />
<br />
now im a newbie here, about 3 1/2 months of playing, am i in the minority for seeing the humor in starting a character with only 10K? is there anyone in this game like me who started the game living battle to battle scrapping for silver to buy a rusty spear as a weapon? lol<br />
<br />
edit: of course we all were completely new at one point i just meant the low level people i see running around now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's intuitve for casters to try and raise wis/int to increase their mana pool, but even ignoring the hp-&gt;mana (cannibalize in shaman case) angle, its still frequently inefficient.<br />
<br />
Wisdom above 200, returns mana at an inferior rate to below. They upped it in SOL but its still not as efficient.<br />
<br />
Adding +MANA frequently will add more mana to your pool than more Wis, if you are living at 200, or 230+.<br />
<br />
You can use magelo to play around with the numbers to fine the right mix if you want to min/max it.<br />
<br />
With that said, its STILL much more important for a canni/lich/modding class to work on HP than mana pool, once the pool is functionally large enough.<br />
<br />
Mana recovery rate dictates pull rate, kill rate, xp rate and surviability in a hostile non-stop crawl.</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes.  He also said that his shaman is his only character over level 25.  I'd just like to know what zones I obviously need to visit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, one last reccomendation.   So far, you're using a spear, and that's GOOD.    Regardless of how good the stats on an Item may be, Having a Non-weapon in your primary hand is just not cool :)<br />
<br />
This includes:  Books, Orbs, Books on Sticks, Torches, Lanterns or anything you can't effectively give a mob a good barshing with.<br />

You're wondering how a person can have that kind of money....   Easy.. he's mentioned 2 Magic words..    &quot;Bazaar Trader&quot; and &quot;Tradeskills&quot;...   <br />
<br />
You can make a LOT of money if you're a smart Bazaar trader and you enjoy tradeskilling....    Posessing a rare Tradeskill  ( For example, on Torvonnilous I knew of only ONE Troll Blacksmith with 250 Skill ) can prove VERY lucrative.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Let me see if I can put into words how my account became wealthy over the last ten months or so.<br />
<br />
First of all I started life in EQ as a Dark Elf Wizard whom I loved playing dearly.  I do remember how awesome it was to finish my full suit of quest newbe armor, and I remember when I got my first drop that had a stat on it: Sensate Reishi Cap with its awesome AC of 3 and Int +1... heh.<br />
<br />
Since then I played a Vah Shir Shaman to 12th with a very good friend of mine who left EQ and has recently returned to the game.  My first shaman was his character's companion, so I refused to play him anymore unless it was with him.<br />
<br />
So, after my wizard dinged 25th I started to wonder what the other character classes had to offer.  I then played a Shadow Knight to 25th, a Druid to 25th, and a Cleric to 11th, but my thoughts still lingered with the fun I had playing a Shaman.<br />
<br />
When LoY was released I saw this as my chance to start a new Shaman.  I played him to 6th in the crater surrounding Shar Vahl, then I continued to 25th duoing and grouping in Paludal.  This time I knew I'd finally found my true calling and have been terribly addicted to the Shaman class ever since.<br />
<br />
Now I’m not a new player to EverQuest, but I am still very new to the advanced concepts of the Shaman class.  To that end I really thank everyone who has been openly pitching in advice.<br />
<br />
Now that covers my playing, but none of what I've been through produces jack for plat, except for the 5 levels I obtained duoing Hill Giants in Rathe.  The revelation of how to make my fortune in EQ came after stopping by the bazaar one day with my wizard about 10 months ago.  I noticed that spider silks and spiderling silks were selling for 5 pp each and bone chips were going for 1 pp each.  Man you should have seen how fast I ran to the local software store after a second copy of EverQuest with visions of plat dancing in my head.  I had finally found a way to avoid spending another two years of game time to achieve the equipment I wanted to have.  But that ended up just being a stepping-stone.  I am a businessman in real life, so after applying a bit of real life experience to my bazaar account, I've managed to amass the small fortune I’d dreamed of having many months ago.<br />
<br />
Bazaar Advice:<br />
<br />
The Bazaar is a fluid beast, so never put all of your money into one type of selling.  Instead try to achieve a balance of trade skill crafted goods, spell research crafted goods, alchemy potions (Blood of the Wolf and Kilva’s Blistering Flesh being two of my personal favorites), items that you’re reselling from others who just wanted to unload them cheep, and items you win via /random 1 1000 while out hunting and raiding.<br />
<br />
Seek out and become acquainted with the crafting community.  Many of them, for a portion of the final sale price, are willing to pitch in and help you to combine crafted items your current trade skills or spell research skills could never craft alone.<br />
<br />
Lastly, remember this is just a game.  Get out and enjoy a taste of real life now and again.  It makes the time you spend playing EverQuest that much sweeter knowing those around you have not been forgotten or ignored.  I mention this after two months of hard-core EQ’ing and personally loosing sight of real life for a short time in the process.<br />
<br />
Wow did I just type all that?  LoL, time to get back to leveling.<br />
<br />
Later All,<br />

 If anyone else is making a character for intents of GM'ing all tradeskills, ignore WIS/INT or make an enchie.<br />
<br />
  Enchie = mind buffs = more wis/int<br />
<br />
  Shaman = melee buffs = more of everything else.<br />
<br />
 All tradeskills were modified to have a melee stat which can take place of WIS/INT, thus making FA one of the greatest buffs possible for doing trades.  140 to each of the main melee stats.  I think there is a single trade which uses AGI, the rest are STR or DEX.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">They made those changes to help non-caster tradeskillers as thier stats tended to be more meele geared then INT/WIS based.  So most tradeskills use the better of the two.  We just happen to be a caster that can get our meele skills up much easier so in most cases it'ld be better idea to buff you stats to the four winds then spending loads on Wis gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong, it isn't all tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Most tradeskills use the highest of int or wis. Some have a third stat. This is regardless of class.<br />
<br />
Fletching and jewelcraft use the highest of int/wis/dex. There were some rumours that dex would be added to tailoring too, but this hasn't happened yet that I know of.<br />
<br />
Smithing uses the highest of int/wis/str.<br />
<br />
High int or wis will help in all tradeskills, melee or caster. High melee stats help in 3. If you're a caster, you're probably still best off looking at maxing your int or wis, depending on class.<br />
<br />
And if you're talking of FA, that's level 65, by the time you reach 65, you would likely be able to afford some low level high int/wis gear and a KEI to reach 255 or higher, even if you don't worry about wis with your normal gear. Until recently, I had some stuff in the bank (an acrylia cloak, chokidai spaulders, jasper rings etc) for tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, the stat determines skill up rate.<br />
<br />
The skill level itself determines success rate - pass/fail on a combine.<br />
<br />
This is according to EQ Traders - from what SoE tradeskills bods have told people, and with various analyses which seem to back it up.</div></div><hr />
