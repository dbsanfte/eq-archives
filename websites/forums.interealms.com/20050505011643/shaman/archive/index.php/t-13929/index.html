** Experience System Change - Grouping **<br />
<br />
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of EverQuest. At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping. There should never be any penalty to adding &quot;that sixth person over there,&quot; whatever class they may be, into your group. That is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded.<br />
<br />
In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group is one that we need to take a serious look at. While there are definite benefits to forming &quot;well balanced&quot; groups in terms of damage, tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to those who cannot find groups of &quot;optimal&quot; balance.<br />
<br />
As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we refer to as the &quot;group bonus&quot;, for having two to six members. In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways.<br />
<br />
In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better rate of experience.<br />
<br />
As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% &quot;group bonus&quot; experience for having two to five members. <br />
<br />
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% &quot;group bonus.&quot; For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
We realize that we are, essentially, &quot;manufacturing&quot; a new type of experience after a kill. As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people. It simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together. After all, that's the whole point.<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **<br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60. The &quot;blue to 65&quot; range has been increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best benefits, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. <br />
<br />
The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there. Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to adventure. The addition of new content shouldn't entirely obsolete what already exists. Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well, atleast we can take solice in this...<br />
<br />
&quot;The &quot;blue to 65&quot; range has been increased as far as level 50&quot; <br />
<br />
Im very glad that is finaly being tested. This is a large step to making many zones more usable to a level 65ish player again. props for a good choice in testing it.<br />
<br />
But man , i still cant help being a lil down as the soloers get shafted again. Didnt they already decrease the soloers exp ? I know then did then eased the ratio but i thought it never went back to what it was, it was still tweaked against the soloer. So is this yet another case of penilizing the soloer furthur ? Or is it just a reimplementation of what they did before.<br />
<br />
Either way I think we all need to get some feedback going on this cause we made a difference last time and i sure hate to see soloers ( as im one of them ) be choked out. Its not really far to classes that cant get groups easy and there isnt much a point to doing it to people who can solo well either.  Make goruping worth more yes, but not by slowing down the soloers, this game takes enough time to level at the higher end (50-65). I think this type of tactic is just going to drive people away. <br />
<br />
I hate to say it, cause i like EQ and think EQ2 is going to be more my style then WoW, but if im going to be kept down for the sake of people that group then im heading to a less time consuming game like Wow when it comes out.<br />
<br />
I guess we need to see how much difference the changes make. <br />

Sadly, I have too many friends and never get to solo any more, so it will be nice to get better exp while doing so.  ;)  It's really what the game is all about, as some have already mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not easier, if you look at what they are doing, they are taking the bonus from PoP zones. So in essence they are making every zone a PoP zone but it's predicated on being in a group.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of the biggest myth's in EQ for 4 years (6 person group gets an extra bonus) finally comes true!  That seems a bit extreme though, 80% bonus for a full group, and they divide by 5 instead of 6?  An aa in BoT or PoV is gonna take 40 minutes now.  I have a feeling it might get lowered a bit before going live.</div></div><hr />

It is funny that you mention soloers getting shafted.  Over on the necro boards, they are happy that non-pop zone mobs will be opened up for them (pet tanking might be back in style again!) :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy necros were the class i had in mind the most in my post. I would figure they would be upset about this more then anyone cause necros are one of the best solo classes and in the same respect, one of the hardest ( in my exp ) to get a group with.<br />
<br />
Intresting..<br />
<br />
Id like to see their reaction when the exp penalty hits and they start to notice it, if its that large a hit i mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Xp change for 60+ = GOOD<br />
The contraction of 60+ was bad and i fully understand and support this change.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER.<br />
<br />
We do not need to make xp go even faster in groups. Ok so before you all start throwing large objects my way think of this: HOw hard is it even for a race with xp penalty to reach level 50 nowadays with let's say 4 hours a day played (i would think most ppl who play play at least 4 hours a night) 50 was EASY and i am a troll. Boring to solo to 50? yep you bet but not hard.<br />
After 50 most would go to the planes where the xp was even better and they would ding 65 in the planes.<br />
This means that even more people with lack of skill will reach 65 and not know how to properly know how to play their class.<br />
The reason it took a while to reach 65 was that by the tiem you reached it you knew how to play your class.<br />
So xp will be nicer in other zones great but plana xp will increase by the same amount and will still be the better place for xp and thus people will all rush to the planes to level and there they will reach 65 faster and if you think that your chanter sending you a tell askign which haste is better or seeing a 56 necro asking for kei is bad then you just wait till 65's will ask you on directions on how to get to Dreadlands. Sigh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BAH!!! I like the first part.. I don't know if I like the second part.  I kinda liked having all the nonpop zones empty so we could explore and kill whatever we wanted, not caring about xp.  Now people will be crowding these zones again and casual players will not have access to rare mobs anymore because they'll be permakilled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grr, now I can't decide which to do before the change.. head to BoT and turkeybee myself a couple dozen AA, or continue enjoying SOLE DOMINATION of CT (where I recently solo'd my brother a nice set of FT3 boots while praying for RGC research drops).  I am loving being able to walk into ANY zone and simply take over the areas I have heard about before as popular group camps.<br />
<br />
<br />
  On the upside though, if people continue to sit in PoP thinking that the exp is still best there, then I can easily reap the benefits of more dk blues :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Here is a intresting thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not making exping in games like EQ super easy. BUT... make much enjoyable content and quests that are very much appropriate for those levels. Do not make the game rewarding for those who have the super best gear and slave all night and day and quit their jobs to live EQ, but simply make the rewards right for the level and it only allows you to access quests and content right for that level. Make the game so the higher end content isnt more fun or challanging or something to race forward to, make each step enjoyable and not just a build up to a later part of the game. <br />
<br />
This way you just enjoy the game and when you wanna move on to new content you grab a group and zip up a few levels then go around doing quests and battling mobs and building towns and doing tradeskills and FUN things again.<br />
<br />
Ehh, just my dream fro a RPG i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok I think this is the single greatest change ever in eq. Soloer's tend to piss me off seriously when they keep saying how godly the exp they are getting is. I think every class hould be able to solo, but when you can get an aa in half an hour solo and I'm getting one every 2.5hours grouped theres something really wrong with that. <br />
<br />
The groups bonuses always needed to be bigger. This is the perfect solution. The down time with a group (changing members, buffs, ect) is so much bigger then soloing that you don't kill enough mobs to make it worth adding that extra person or two. I tend to put together groups of any class thats looking for groups in guild. This will make such a huge difference and I won't feel bad about turning down an odd class becasue I want something different. <br />
<br />
If this works the way it looks I'm going to cheer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">a AA in 30 min ?<br />
<br />
No, your not pissed at soloers, your pissed at high level necros/chanters/mages. Classes that can charm mobs with massive DPS and haste them even more and tear through zones.<br />
<br />
Dont penalize the soloer cause some classes have abalities that are a lil questionable as to wether they should be availible or not. I dont make an AA everyone 30 min, but i sure do enjoy soloing for exp sometimes and damn sure dont wanna be forced into grouping when we are such a good soloing class to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Solo experience always has been very good, just sucked for the poeple who couldnt solo effectly or found it to be plain boring.<br />
<br />
Litgruv, you say why should solo XP get nerfed. Why should group XP have never been up to par?  I distaste soloing defeats the point of playing the game for me.  But I really hated watching my roomate get an AA an hour in PoS soloing when i couldnt get anywhere near that in a group.  something is inherintly unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Think about it this way lit, instead of decreasing solo XP in pop zones they coulda just increased the benifit from grouping.  this would leave solo XP the exact same.  Would you have complained?  i truely hope not.  afte all your coveted soloing is equaly effective.  just maybe the edge wont be on your side.<br />
<br />
instead they lowered the amount of XP the mob gives across the board and made group XP more. its scaleing down XP for all people.  The grouping people will get less XP than they would have if it was toned down.<br />
<br />
So i think your just bitching for a few reasons, cause thats what your good at.  and cause your methods of XPing are being encrouched on by an alterior method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actualy grouping and dealing with others is not the point of the game i feel. I feel the point of the game is about having fun and sometimes its fun for me to go off some where and be alone and not be bugged for buffs and hastes and people walking past me asking for FoS and other buffs and just being alone and enjoying the peace and power that my hard work has allowed me to aquire. <br />
<br />
As far so soloing getting nerfed and group XPing not getting upped, i didnt say that, maybe im not reading you right cause i should be asleep truthfuly, but i DONT want a soloing nerf and i DO want group exp bonus, so im not really &quot;bitching&quot; about what you think i am. Again i might have misread you so feel free to correct me.<br />
<br />
I have no desire to make massive amount of AA, im not a enchanter or necro or mage and i have no ability to do so even if i want to. Infact that should only solidify my stance as a shaman and i would think all shaman that, since we dont really solo fast to begin with, why would we be happy with a decrease in the exp we make per kill ?<br />
<br />
Also just to make it clear i do not solo for exp, i group. Its faster, but again , when i do want to solo i dont feel i should be hurt ( again mind you ) for the benifiet of others. I guess we really need to see some percents and see how badly this is going to hurt before too much excitment eh ?<br />
<br />
And as far as you comment to my bitching, do yourself a favor and put me on ignore if it bothers you that much. Sorry to be a irritant to you and a few others on this forum, but i enjoy posting here and im not leaving and god help the poor souls, a few here even respect me. So if there is a issue put me on ignore as i dont have anything relivant or important to say anyway (or some would like to believe ) and be done with me, but comments like that will get you no where in either case. Or .. we can continue to try our best to interact in a positive as possible way and draw upon the knowledge that we have worked hard to obtain so that we can learn from each other and help those around us as best we can.<br />
<br />
And now im going to grab my lil hobbit book and head to bed lest i make less sense in the next post then i did in this one.<br />

<br />
Its not actually clear that soloers do all that badly from this: you can now get exp from a greater range of mobs.<br />
<br />
So in PoP zones you may find exp loss due to lowering the PoP zems is offset by being able to solo lower level mobs (at a faster rate) for full exp.<br />
<br />
And in non-PoP zones there is no change in ZEMs and you can solo at 65, whereas before you couldn't.<br />
<br />
For groups this is very good news: the group exp modifier was derisory.  I could always solo for faster exp. than I could get exp. in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Interesting...  The simple truth is they went way the hell overboard with the zonewide xp mods in PoP because SoE probably figured that nobody would be soloing those hard hitting mofos.  As usual, they were clueless about the game they created.  If this finally makes it so that Solo xp is not better than group xp, I'm all for it.  That's the way it's supposed to be.  Soloing should  NOT be a better xp option than grouping in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If I wanted to level a character by myself I'd play a non-MMORPG style RPG game. The whole point of EQ is the interaction with other people <br />

Just becuase you solo doens'nt remove the interaction from the game. You have guild chat, OOC, tradeskilling and many many more things to socialize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Once again, let's look at the bottom line.  This is a game that's been out over three years.  It's been played (if each subscription is played an average of 1 hour per day) over 300 Million Man hours.  SWG and WoW are just over the horizon and Sony's worried about loss of revinue.<br />
<br />
So they introduce several things designed to not hurt anybody.  They open up tier 2 and several tier 3 zones to anyone who wants to go there.  They slightly decrease PoP EXP, while massively increasing group EXP.  They also open up many zones to 60+ that have been closed for awhile.<br />
<br />
Who does this hurt?  Soloists who have been &quot;doing it THIS way and I don't want to change!&quot; and groups that have been exp'ing &quot;HERE and I don't want any damn n00bz in competition with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Either of those aren't likely to cancel their subscriptions due to this change.  People who were stuck in Tier 1, getting crappy exp were.  Bored with so little loot in PoP zones?  Do what we do every once in awhile....  We send 2 3-person groups into Seb and handle every single mob on the first floor (except those in the crypt).  It's hella fun and very fluid (as well as about 3-4K per person, per hour).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">*** is SoE have against a soloer, can someone answer me this? <br />
<br />
<br />
The correct question is *** did SOE have against group dependent classes, can you answer me this?<br />
<br />
Think about a Rogue. Why should they receive less experience for being reliant on groups for exp? Why shouldn't a group(something that VI, then SOE claim is their &quot;vision&quot;) mean as much exp as soloing? Shouldn't there be a reward for grouping instead of thinking to yourself &quot;Man, I could group with those guys but it will just kill my exp.&quot;?<br />
<br />
Both should be equally viable as a means of experience. What this does is to partially erase the penalty on grouping - however for what it's worth I do believe it is a mistake to nerf the PoP modifiers.<br />
<br />
Obviously SOE has been reading the paladin boards(hey, least they listen to some classes - right?):<br />

<br />
I can see roaming from one end to the other and back, maybe we have different definitions of &quot;handle every single mob on the first floor &quot;.</div></div><hr />

After running the numbers on the monk boards WITH  the new xp bonus, this works out to a nerf to groups with less than 5 members and a _slight_ increase in xp to groups with 5 or 6 members.  As others have posted elsewhere, the only real winners to this change are full groups in non-PoP zones- Paludal Caverns anyone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I certainly dont want group XP to be hurt, despite my argument for im 100% all groups getting more XP, it is my main source of exp so for me, that dandy. I agree solo exp should never out weigh group exp, but inturn i dont feel a soloer should be penalized either, meaning they should be close to or equal.<br />
<br />
Remember this, save 3 classes at the upper end of the game, most soloers take longer to kill a mob then a group does, so if he is making noticably less exp per mob and on top of that moving about 3-5 times as slow, that to me really sucks. Again this isnt just levle 65 im talking about here, this is across the board im talking. I have many characters of many classes and many level ranges. This is why im concerned on how they do this.<br />
<br />
I guess as it was said before and i said myself. It remains to be seen on what the numbers are before any serious concern can be valid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The solo nerf is completely unwarranted, and slams us much harder than most classes, since we don't solo very well in PoP compared to other soloing classes to begin with.<br />
<br />
But everybody knows that if you can only play an hour or two, Verant thinks you are worthless garbage who shouldn't be playing, so this should be expected.<br />
<br />
They are keeping the &quot;close to your level&quot; bonus, so PoP xp (even &quot;slightly reduced&quot; or whatever) will probably blow away most xp.  And if the xp is at all worthwhile the old world places are just going to be dominated by one AE group.  Imagine what a 65 +PoP gear/focii/AA AE group could do to those zones /shiver.  Good luck finding *anything* up.<br />
<br />
+80% and divided by 5?  That's obscene.  By the time the next competitor comes out, I expect them to be offering 300 free AA points every time you log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I posted a reply on the necro boards (My baby necro is about to ding 50)<br />
<br />
Anyways the necros seem split. Half like it cause they can now pet solo dark blues again, or they have all thier aa and exp doesnt matter. The other half realizes this as a massive nerf (which it is).<br />
<br />
People, think about this a second. I'll sumarize from my post on the necro board whats REALLY going on here.<br />
<br />
1) SOE made a mistake with PoP exp bonus. They could not continue to keep adding bigger and better bonuses each expansion. LoY came out and lvl 50's really arent playing in it. PoP Tier 1 exp is jsut so much better. To combat this in upcoming expansions they will jsut remove the exp modifier from pop, while upping the group modifier. Now you can exp ANYWHERE there are dark blues, and providing you are in a group get PoP like exp or better.<br />
<br />
2) This is a HUGE fundamental change to the game. HUGE. Let me repeat that HUGE. Sit and think about it a second. Nothing they could do would change the game more.<br />
<br />
3) Soloers made great exp but they took on large risk. A necro soloing in PoP dies when an add shows up and he fails a FD. Fact of life. Thats offset the by faster than average exp. Tweaking this is natural, elimating risk/reward is not. Now that same necro is going to see the PoP exp bonus disapear. The mobs wont be any easier. The risk is the same. A 6 man group, who, by the way, are balanced around the trinity and 3 dps classes wont want the necro. They will be able to pull PoP exp ANYWHERE at NO RISK. The soloer is now forced to group with a class thats been developed and blanced for 3+ years as a soloer. No group wants him, and his solo exp has been nerfed. Good job SOE.<br />
<br />
4) EXP exploits. Oh let me count the ways. Jesus. Think about it. The ultimate exp group is now 4 wizrds, a tank and a cleric. go to a zone with low Dark blues that do little damage.. 48-52 range say in Loy. Pull 10 or 20 of them, wizards unload AOE, with the exp bonus now thats INSANE exp. Do the math. It blows away anything in PoP WITH NO RISK. sure you dont get the lvl 5 and under exp bonus but who careses? its an extra 25-50% Seriously? you are getting a 80% bonus already split only 5 ways and you just slaughtered 10-20 mobs in seconds, and you can keep it up forever? Remember the Fungus grove fiascos? I mean comon SOE, pull your head out of your ass.<br />
<br />
You think chanter charm exp was insane, wait till you see the totally unblanced groups that form now to farm exp and clear WHOLE ZONES at a time. The problem is they are manufacturing exp out of the air. Its a novel idea but in a large game it doesnt work unless the whole game has been balanced from the start against it. EQ never was and there is no way it can ever be.<br />
<br />
The thing is, there is NO way to fix the above without totally fubaring the whole game. The game is BALANCED around the current exp system. Altering it skews so many things in favor of some classes, and so many things against other classes, you will see a huge shift in teh player base. And thats not good.<br />
<br />
I'll shift back to playing my shaman more. Others wil lshift to thier clers and tanks. It'll be a 1 dimensional game with little fun. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">...but i sure do enjoy soloing for exp sometimes and damn sure dont wanna be forced into grouping when we are such a good soloing class to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actualy grouping and dealing with others is not the point of the game i feel. I feel the point of the game is about having fun and sometimes its fun for me to go off some where and be alone and not be bugged for buffs and hastes and people walking past me asking for FoS and other buffs and just being alone and enjoying the peace and power that my hard work has allowed me to aquire. <br />
<br />
Also just to make it clear i do not solo for exp, i group. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Need a bit of clarification here.  If you just want to get off in a corner and enjoy the peace and quiet, what does it matter if your xp rate drops?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think change #1 is good, and change #2 so-so.  Many people in EQ take the path of least resistance, and if they can get xp in Seb at lvl 65, where the risk is practically nil I suspect the zones will be 'full' with only a handful of people covering the entire zone.  I guess that's better than the zone standing empty ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I still see one major reason beyond all others that grouping exp should be better then soloing exp.<br />
<br />
Soloing i log on, move to some random spot, and start to solo (sometimes grabbing a kei).<br />
<br />
When I group, especially not on my shaman it can involve 30 minutes to an hour to put a group together, all that time a soloer can get exp. Even if they exp faster, that 30 minute to an hour head start really helps. Not to mention the time invesment  isn't there since they can log in 2 hours where as I'd need 3 and a half to equal them out.<br />
<br />
Now lets say I get into an established group (assuming im on my paladin), 15 minutes later chanter has to go afk to put his kid to bed, crap no slow. Ok well 15 to 20 minutes he comes back and we can start pulling, but oh crap our cleric has to leave. Hmm well we don't have any backup healing, so we need to get a replacement. Even a shaman would do, but there is only a bard, a wizard, and a beastlord lfg at the moment. Screwed.<br />
<br />
30 minutes later I've bribed my friend, the 65 druid with 200 AAs to stop soloing loroks and come heal for my group, of course now i owe him one because he is slowing his exp gain for me.</div></div><hr />

In old world zones, all groups get more XP except the soloer.<br />

<br />
The pre-PoP zones stand ready for soloing, EXP probably about the same as post-nerf PoP, no GY but less risk...<br />

Classes that can solo well in PoP are getting an obscene amount of exp. I forget the exact number, but a guildmate of mine said something like 63% per quad in PoFire. My jaw litterally dropped when he said that. But as someone mentioned earlier, these people are quading mobs that SOE never imagined possible.<br />
<br />
Rather than modifying solo exp in just these planes, SOE instead modifies solo exp in all PoP zones which not only penalizes the classes that can solo really well, but also classes that can solo for just barely more than they can get grouping. Alas, good idea, but poor execution.<br />
<br />
The grouping bonus will be refreshing, however. More AA's for less work. I will be able to max them all out and finally quit this god forsaken game!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think most of you are misinterpreting this, although it's understandable by the way the announcement was worded. They are not nerfing solo exp. Read it again...when they talked about solo experience being decreased, they were only referring to PoP. That has nothing to do with being solo - it has to do with them lowering exp in PoP.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
Read it in context and you will understand they did not nerf general solo experience. They only nerfed exp in PoP to counterbalance the new grouping bonuses, and that will in effect lower solo exp IN PoP only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Lowering ZEM in PoP zones = Nerfing Solo XP in PoP.<br />
<br />
Solo'rs in PoP zones have reported XP rates to be lower (some very significant, such as in PoFire).  Regardless of how its worded or interpreted, the fact is that on test, solo XP is reduced.  Therefore it can be concluded that solo XP in PoP has been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">No kidding, Mardack. I know that. But people were complaining that solo exp itself was being nerfed, which in fact is not the case. Reading comprehension = good.</div></div><hr />

Er? Could you put your thinking cap on for a second (using this phrase isntead of the pull your head out of your ass phrase cause I'm a nice guy).<br />
<br />
Where do soloers solo for exp post 60? PoP. Why? Cause thats where the mobs are that are close to your level that dont summon.<br />
<br />
Thats right. Killing 10,000 low level dark blues out of pop inst as effecient solo as killing a smaller number of yellows or reds in pop with the pop bonus and the level bonus. <br />
<br />
So, soloers kill in pop. No reason not to. Whats happening is that soloers will now get a 1/3rd cut in solo exp BECAUSE exp is done in pop? see the nerf now?<br />
<br />
As someone posted before kiters getting 63% per kite is freakn silly. The problem is instead of SOE fixing stuff liek this on a case by case basis (effort) they are going to remove exp from the zone so that its not as attractive (no effort) with the side effect of crippling the single soloers.</div></div><hr />

They simply reduced the exp that PoP mobs give.  This impacts across the board, not only soloers.  At the same time they increased grouping exp bonuses.  That is all they have done!  <br />
<br />
Outside of PoP, there is not even a percieved nerf.  Those mobs in those zones give the same exp they always did.  And with them being blue again, and our power to rip thru them, it might approach PoP exp tables in terms of AA/hour.  After all, if you kill 4 non-PoP mobs in the same time it takes you to kill one PoP mob, aren't you ahead?  With the change, I think you will be.  <br />

   Okie from what i read i may lose some exp soloing. Seems like it will still be better exp than anything before pop just less and now i will have more blue when i leave pop which might make my trips of of pop more fruitful but i should quit now right? I also believe i read that just adding one person is suppose to give you more exp than the old system.  Oh well people fear change <br />
<br />
   Would i ask them to take the pop zem down some? Nope but i'm not going to quit if its just lowered some. Least grouping out of pop with my lvl 60 friends i might actually make some ok exp for a change in some of the places.

Ok, look at it this way.  Kill the same mobs in PoP, pre-patch and post-patch.  Implemented as described, solo'rs in PoP will receive less XP.  All others will receive more XP if they do it right.<br />
<br />
This can be viewed as a PoP solo Nerf, or an overall upgrade.  Just depends on what you do.  Since I two box normally, I will only be upset if my XP with a 2 person group is reduced.  Will I be crushed over it?  Not really, it just means that grouping will be more appealing that it was before.<br />
<br />
If it goes live as it is on test, you will just see more duo'rs and less solo'rs.  Thats all.<br />

Yes, it still is a PoP Solo XP Nerf.  But at least it is not without alternatives.</div></div><hr />

Sigh. Look the end result in a PoP zone is that the soler gets 25-40% LESS exp and the grouper gets somewhere near 40-55% more (pull out your calculator and do the math. Before it was 1.20/6 = .20 Now its 1.80/5 = .36. Thats 80% more. subtract out the 25-40% nerf and you are at 40-55% more).<br />
<br />
Its subjective though cause its percentages. What IS constant is this:<br />
<br />
Mob is worth 1 exp.<br />
Necro was getting 1 exp. he is now getting .6 to .75 exp.<br />
<br />
Full group members were getting .2 exp per kill. had to kill 5x as fast as the necro to keep up exp wise (impossible unless its a good pull spot) and this is also assuming necro doesnt die.. which does happen.<br />
Full members are now getting .22 to .27 exps per kill (.36 * .6 to .75)<br />
<br />
Thoose numbers dont look impressive but think about it. Groups only have to kill *3* times faster that a soloer now for the same exp... at no risk. This is easily doable.<br />

Next time dont bother to post till you sit down with a calculator and do the math.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, when im off enjoying the peace and quiet, i would rather not make totaly crappy XP either. To me i dont see why a balance cant be established where soloers and groups alike make good exp. Why should i suffer cause i dont wanna deal with people ? Am i really that wrong for wanting to be alone ? I doubt there is a necro in the world atleast that would argue against that point. <br />
<br />
I just am looking for a fair balance on the 2. But it seems over the last 6-8 months its SoE's goal to hurt soloing more and more. I dont think we need to take a look as experience ratios, atleast not on the topic im talking about, i think we need to look at the classes that are getting insane solo exp and modify how they gain exp. Making enchanter pets take some of the exp  was a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Steelbear : Your right its only PoP content, but when i solo i dont solo in Seb or Velks. I dunno, like i said before i am going to need to see how bad the cdrop off in PoP is to compensate for a added 50% bonus. One would think it would be significant to offset the huge bonus given, which would equate to fairly noticable solo exp loss which to me was barely worth it other then the peace and quiet already. <br />
<br />
 In the overall im very happy for the groupers as this should help things move along, but im still concerned on the effect of the soloers in PoP. Have to wait for implementation at this point i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mob is now worth 1xp + &gt;X% bonus for PoP<br />
<br />
Experience for soloers has not been nerfed at all. There is no penalty being attached to the amount of exp gained for killing a mob if you are solo. What is true, however, is any player will be able to offset the reduction in the PoP bonus by being in a group of 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Since this is so &quot;unfair&quot; and upsetting, perhaps they should only reduce the PoP bonus and not do anything at all to encourage grouping. Afterall, everyone knows that soloing is the only way to play this MMORPG. If we wanted to play in groups, we'd play Baldur's Gate or something...........</div></div><hr />

I fail to se how a massively MULTIPLAYER online roleplaying game equates to a game where you only group. They two are not synonymous. Never were. Just because you like to think the two are the same doesnt make them the same.<br />
<br />
in a MMORP you have solors, small groups, large groups, and monster raids. You have the whole gamut of the spectrum. You dont want too many of any one group because it unbalances the game.<br />
<br />
With that said, people should be encouraged to group, and single players getting 63% of an AA per quad is silly. However, there should not be a penalty for the guy that has a newborn and a toddler, runs his own firm, only has 45 mins some nights to play, and cant take the time to find a group. <br />

I'm not saying im expecting to solo raid items, im saying that I expect the  low end killing (exp) to be on par or slightly better than a group. I take more risk solo, and I cant do what a group can. I cant kill minis for loot like a group, I cant do lots of stuff a group is able.<br />
<br />
There has to be a balance between risk and reward, otherwise the game is NOT fun to play and becomes something along the lines of Diablo 2. We all know where that went.</div></div><hr />

Mob was worth 1xp + X% bonus for PoP<br />
<br />
Mob is now worth 1xp + &gt;X% bonus for PoP<br />
<br />
Experience for soloers has not been nerfed at all. There is no penalty being attached to the amount of exp gained for killing a mob if you are solo. What is true, however, is any player will be able to offset the reduction in the PoP bonus by being in a group of 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Since this is so &quot;unfair&quot; and upsetting, perhaps they should only reduce the PoP bonus and not do anything at all to encourage grouping. Afterall, everyone knows that soloing is the only way to play this MMORPG. If we wanted to play in groups, we'd play Baldur's Gate or something...........<br />
<br />
No. Wrong. Beep.. Thanks for playing. Try again.<br />
<br />
Mob was worth 1 + exp bonus for pop + level difference bonus (if any). (solo. * 20%/6 for a group per player )<br />
Mob is now worth 1 for solo + level diff bonus, and 1 + level diff bonus * 36%/5 per group. (per player)<br />
<br />
If you cant get your little mind around that 5th grade math, god help you.<br />
<br />
There is simply no way to argue it. Thats what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Its not a stupid Solo XP nerf.   If they had only increased the grouping bonus would the soloers have been bitching?  i really hope not.  THough if that had happened solo XP would not be as good as group XP.  Instead they lowered how much XP everyone gets across the board.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way with numbers, made up by me.<br />
<br />
it used to work like this. kill a mob get 12 points of XP.  Solo get 12,  duo get 6, 3- get 4, 4 - get 3, 5 get 2.5, full group get 2.  but with small XP modifeiers it was really more like.  Solo gets 12 duo get 6, 3- gets 4, 4 gets 3, 5 gets 3, 6 gets 3.  or something close.<br />
<br />
Now if they had just increased the bonus for grouping it would be kinda like this... solo gets 12 duo gets 7, 3 - gets 6, 4 - gets 5, 5 - gets 5, 6 gets 5 points.<br />
<br />
Now they decided they dont want XP to be that easy to get so they toned down how much XP each mob gets.  ie a mob gives 9 instead of 12 points of XP so it works like this (very roughly)<br />
<br />
Solo gets 9, duo gets 5, 3 gets 4, 4 gets 4, 5 gets 4, and lets say full group of 6 gets 4.<br />
<br />
Now these numbers are all made up and who knows if its even close to being right.  But the point was that they did NOT NERF SOLO XP.  they just toned down XP across the board and also increased the bonus for grouping.  If it had just been increase to group bonus you would ahve had no grounds to complain.  And seeing that EVERYONE gets less XP per kill no matter what, how can you still complain?</div></div><hr />

This only applies to charmers.  Charm is phenomenally overpowered in PoP, and just one example (of very many) of how SOE didn't really bother to think the expansion out before releasing it and opening their wallets to catch the cash rain.<br />
<br />
Shamans (this is a shaman board, remember?) can get a solo AA at 65 in valor in 100-140 minutes, depending.  A group AA at 65 is 120-150 minutes, depending.  Now a solo AA will take like, a day lol... :(<br />
as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system<br />
preliminary reports from necros on Test show the PoP xp being nerfed by roughly 33%. After running the numbers on the monk boards WITH the new xp bonus, this works out to a nerf to groups with less than 5 members and a _slight_ increase in xp to groups with 5 or 6 members.

Alot of us might have been unhappy, grumbled, but well, the game evolves. Groups do need to be balanced more and upping the exp is one way to do it.<br />
<br />
Doing it and nerfing pop exp which then nerfs solo exp and causes groups to gain the same or better exp with much less risk that the soloer is what most people are angry at. Couple the fact that soloers were balanced this way and now have no hope to GET a group, makes things worse.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Spin it how you like, the NERF is to all PoP xp, not just solo.  2-3 man groups are also being nerfed and possibly 4man groups if the numbers being reported are correct.  I believe someone said only 5-6 person groups were noticing similar or higher xp rates.<br />
<br />
Now then, Yes I firmly believe that IN GENERAL soloing should not yield faster xp than grouping.  I don't think I'm going too far to say that's actually part of the design or as it was once known, The Vision (tm) ;)<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with a few choice spots with fairly high risk to the soloer yielding better xp than some groups and that's pretty much unavoidable with a game this size anyway.  As it is now though, there are just way too many ways for solo classes to rake in better xp than any group can match in PoP.  I'm guessing they pulled a typical SoE move and overly nerfed the xp in PoP overall, in which case hopefully they will raise it back up somewhat.  My personal guesstimate is that a roughly 15% nerf of overall xp to PoP mobs would do the trick nicely.  Solo people would feel the nerf the most, but rightly so.  A group of 6 would finally be noticably rewarded for their efforts.  <br />
<br />
As the patch message and others have said, putting a group of 6 together often means significantly more setup time as well as more chances for necessary breaks as RL comes  up for one of the ppl in the group.  Soloing I can log on, run to PoFire and be pulling down nice xp within 5 minutes of logging in.  It's a rare special day when I can find a group and get there and start killing that fast.<br />
<br />
As far as groups raping places like Chardok and Sebilis... If they adjust the xp in PoP then I don't see it as a problem.  Even with the 25% reduction in PoP mobs, I have a hard time believing that it'll be a problem though.  I've soloed in Chardok mines clearing the skeletons at the front which were, IMO, the best source of aaxp at 60 you could find or at least one of the top 3.  They die fast and would yield a lil over 1% aaxp per kill.  At 65 they are still dark blue, but the level difference makes the xp drop to something like 1/3%, if I remember correctly it took me roughly 3 skeletons to see a 1% move on the aaxp bar.  Perhaps AE groups would come back into fashion and clear entire dungeons, i dunno but hopefully (yes I am naive to even utter this) that will be tested on the test server and adjustments made to keep that from becoming the new optimal way to xp.<br />
<br />
what would a 15% nerf to PoP xp do?  well those 18% aaxp red cons in fire would now ONLY yield 15.3%... Still a very nice pace of xp for a soloer but chances are they could actually do better with a full decent group, which is the way it should be.  Looking at by time, say it takes an hour per aaxp now,  at 15% less xp per kill it would take 70 minutes.  Still a very solid rate of xp and very viable.</div></div><hr />

Is that what it's all about?  Mindlessly raking in exp as fast as possible?<br />
<br />
If a soloist can do that and attack the same content that ordinarily takes a full group, then there's a game balance issue.  Otherwise it's a class/playstyle envy issue.<br />

<br />
 A few people have mentioned that this is not a soloing exp &quot;nerf&quot; to PoP content, that they simply are lowering it across the board so that its not aimed at soloers, its aimed at all.<br />
<br />
Correct me if im wrong, but if they lower the ZEM for everyone then add on back a 50% group bonus, how is that not a &quot;nerf&quot; to the soloer. Everyone drops off, groups come back up 50%ish and the soloer is still left with the drop off.<br />
<br />
This is without a doubt a reduction to the soloer and a increase to the grouper. At this point it remains to be seen if this is bad or tolerable, but its a fact none the less.</div></div><hr />

This will (hopefully) fix both issues that were forcing that, and hopefully spread the population out a bit again.  I suppose it is a nerf to people who just soloed in PoP zones for max exp, but I think it'll improve the game for a lot more people than it'll hurt.<br />

<br />
I really doubt it.  As I stated, I think that SOE thinks that PoP tier 2 and 3 zones are too small for both soloers and groupers to coexist, when the flags go down.  Someone's gotta go, and the groupers have up to 6 subscriptions, where the soloist only has one.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  IF you had an even number of soloists to groups at any one time in PoP, the ratio would be approx 5 or 6 to 1.  The fact is, there are almost certainly MORE groups than active soloists at any one time in PoP, so the ratio grows even higher in favor or groupers.  Soloists might be a vocal minority, but a minority they are.  Number of subscriptions serviced IS the bottom line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Soloing is irrelevant in EQ.  You may like to solo, I certainly like to solo sometimes... but its not part of the game design.  The entire game concept revolves around interdependant groups of players working together to accomplish things.<br />
<br />
A couple of classes were given the ability to solo, and the trade off was that they were not as desireable to groups.  Now, these classes have abilities that make them desireable to groups, however; they dont group because they can accomplish more without a group than with one.  Is this a problem? Yes.  Should this be changed?  Yes.  How to change it? Take away their abilities? No.  Make grouping more attractive than soloing? yes.  How?  Change the way experience works.<br />
<br />
With the changes to exp, its practical to solo in far more places than it was before, but none of them will give more experience than grouping.<br />
<br />
I was soloing in Valor a week or so ago.. just doing a small patch of golems.  A nearby group asked me to join them.  I turned them down because I could make better experience by just clearing 3 spawns solo than by supporting a whole group.  Thats not balanced.  Making it so that I can gain more by working with them is balanced.  Encouraging us to follow the game design is not a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm inclined to agree with you partially regarding the game balance issue... BUT, what are the odds that SoE is going to rebalance all of PoP to make the risk/reward more even for both solo and groups?  I can think of a real easy way to do it (summoning) but I think that'd be met with FAR more cries of anger than this and I think it would be too much.  <br />
<br />
PoP pretty much threw game balance for a curve.  The fact that PoP mobs are extremely more difficult to kill than any xp mob from a prior expansion means that they SHOULD give a significant bonus to xp per kill.  That's all fine and good when looking at a typical group encounter with a tank, healer, etc...  Now when you bring in the root/rot and kiters things change drastically.  Kiting a non-summoning mob in PoFire is NOT significantly more difficult or dangerous than kiting a non-summoning mob pre-pop.  It's ridiculously easy to kite a red con mob that gives 18% aaxp per kill in PoFire.  It is slightly more dangerous to root/rot IMO since a badly timed broken root can mean a quick death if the mob gets within melee range before you can re-root it, but still it's not THAT much harder than before to merit the immensely larger xp gains.  <br />
<br />
These mobs ARE a lot harder for a group to take on and the increased rewards for doing so are justified IMO.  They are more difficult for soloers only because they have more hp, they're procs and melee are insignificant since the kiter and root/rotted are based on avoiding those completely, thus removing one of the major increases in power for these mobs.  So, please explain how it's balanced in a RvR sense for soloists to be able to rake in massively more xp than a balanced group killing the same mobs.<br />
<br />
I think the intent is a good one and hopefully they will strike a happy balance where soloing is still viable in PoP but not ridiculously overrewarding as it is now.  If there's a better way to strike that balance, please /feedback and post it up... Enlighten us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol you think that is bad try Earth and Beyond. you get 40% exp bonus person if you are within so many levels. You get 200% bonus with a full group. The level differences are much broader in Earth and Beyond. Anyone can group with anyone to get exp. but you have to have an overall level difference of like 50 levels to contribute <br />
If you want an easy exp game E and B is it. You can have one person group with a bunch of lower levels and kill mobs at his level and watch the low levels raise Combat levels in a matter of 5-10 minutes a level.  Or if you want to raise Explore Levels, you just get a full group of newbies and hit every nav point in every zone. The newbies will go from level 1 explore to level 30 by the time you are done and if you are the high level giving the &quot;tour&quot; you get exp for every person you help discover each nav point. Trade levels is the only thing hard to raise after level 20. So I dont see a reason to complain. Soe is just making EQ a little more comparable to games like E and B.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  Unfortunately, whether or not I get a group as a wizard depends largely on whether the group feels like they can do with a wizard, rather than what absolutely necessary skill I can bring to the group (ala slow).  What Sony has never understood is that they can do stuff like this all they want, and it really doesn't change the way people form groups.

This is an excellent point.  But the fact is that the root/dotter or the single kiter don't really make much more xp than a group.  More, yes.  Should it be toned down?  Possibly.  But the changes could be pretty mild: things like increasing pet aggro to make aggro kiting a bit harder, giving all dots a chance of breaking root, etc.  Not fundamental changes to the xp system.  <br />
<br />
The real balance problems were the PoP charms (which they nerfed) and the AoE spells, which offer fantastically good damage per mana ratios.  These are the people making TONS more xp than groups can.  See: wizzies in Fire, bards in prenerf HoH and elsewhere now.  Verant refuses to face the fact that the core problem is dpm.  So, they nerf everything except the dpm on AoEs, screwing everyone over in an attempt to nerf quadders and PBAoErs.<br />
<br />
The clearest example of this would be the PBAoE spells.  Theoretically infinite dpm ratio.  Any twelve year old should tell you that these spells will obliterate all other forms of damage in situations where they can possibly used.  Soloists (bards, maybe some others) and groups using PBAoE as their primary damage =obliterate= any other xp gain strategy in zones they can be employed.  So what does SoE do?  They get out the butcher knife and patch in enormous nerfs that destroy zones for everybody, rather than break out the scalpel to fix the balance issue they are worried about.  See, e.g. Grey, Acrylia, HoH, SH.<br />
<br />
Much like the zone nerfs beat everyone down in a misguided attempt to nerf PBAoE groups, much like the affliction focii nerfs [arguably] beat everyone down in a misguided attempt to nerf charmers, this nerf beats every soloer down in a misguided attempt to nerf quadders, PBAoErs, and possibly charmers.<br />
<br />
Really, they looked at the game and saw three groups:<br />
<br />
(1) Groupers, getting 1 unit of xp per hour.<br />
(2) Single soloers, getting 1.2 units of xp per hour<br />
(3) Other soloers, getting 29,000,000,000 units of xp per hour.<br />
<br />
SoEs brilliant solution is to cut #2 and #3 by ~1/3.<br />
<br />
<br />
[*Disclaimer, personally I don't believe that anyone should get nerfed on this, the game has been like this for a long time and people have made years of decisions based on that status quo.  I just think it is outrageous that SoE is crushing MY solo xp rate (which is only slightly higher than the group rate) in a typically clumsy attempt to nerf other classes who out-xp groups by several orders of magnitude.*]</div></div><hr />

Necros. I know they do alot of damage. I know they bring alot to a group. Most people dont. I go LFG with my shammy im invited to 10 groups in the first 5 mins. Go LFG with a necro and you can count on one hand how many times you are invited to a group in a week. Why?<br />
<br />
While necros do alot fo damage, Mages/rogues/BL/ect do more damage ina  group. Necros are BUILT to do massive damage over time.. not in quick spurts. Sure they can do alot fo damage fast, but not as much as a mage/wizzy, and they burn mana much faster and cant keep that peak damage up. Therefor, why group with one when ya can have a &quot;real&quot; fast damager instead?<br />
<br />
Another reason used to be the utility over undead and corpse summoning. The Graveyards took care of the corpse summoning, and who cares about undead now-adays. 60+ necros dont really have any undead spells except the undead charm, and thats ben nerfed since it wont last more than 5 seconds now anyways. Besisdes, charming pets in group with teh exp nerf is a bad idea now anyways.<br />
<br />
So, you've got a class that was built and balanced for exp, which groups dont want because there are better group class alternatives, and then ya yank the exp away from that class. Good Job.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Soloing is irrelevant in EQ.  You may like to solo, I certainly like to solo sometimes... but its not part of the game design.  The entire game concept revolves around interdependant groups of players working together to accomplish things.<br />
<br />
Where is this written? Show me? Or tell me the developer who told you this? If ya cant I'll read it as you just made the above statement up.<br />
<br />
<br />
A couple of classes were given the ability to solo, and the trade off was that they were not as desireable to groups.  Now, these classes have abilities that make them desireable to groups, however; they dont group because they can accomplish more without a group than with one.  Is this a problem? Yes.  Should this be changed?  Yes.  How to change it? Take away their abilities? No.  Make grouping more attractive than soloing? yes.  How?  Change the way experience works.<br />
<br />
Exactly how were classes like necros given abilities that help them group? News Flash here. They never were. They were given abilities to Solo. Not group. It hasnt changed. Pop gave Necros more Dots, more snares. Not more fast damage/heals. Hell, Necros best fast damage dot is stil lthe ultra rare Funeral Pyre from lvl 60. All the 60+ ones take more time or are a worse mana ratio. PoP actually made Necros less desireable since you dont even need them to summon a corpse anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the changes to exp, its practical to solo in far more places than it was before, but none of them will give more experience than grouping.<br />
<br />
Solo in more places? Oh you mean the places where AOE groups wil lbe setting up and killing the whole zone every time it pops? Ah.. Sure. I'm gonna love that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was soloing in Valor a week or so ago.. just doing a small patch of golems.  A nearby group asked me to join them.  I turned them down because I could make better experience by just clearing 3 spawns solo than by supporting a whole group.  Thats not balanced.  Making it so that I can gain more by working with them is balanced.  Encouraging us to follow the game design is not a nerf.<br />
<br />
I agree. Its not balanced. The way to fix it is to ddesign zones where a group is needed to split/pull/kill the mobs. Design the zone for grouping. Dont apply a blanket nerf because its &quot;easier&quot; to do.<br />
<br />
This is all about game balancing. Groups need places to exp where they can make as much or more exp than a soloer. The way to do it is not to nerf the soloer and keep the rest the same. The way to do it is to make zones for the groupers, or tweak zones to give advantages to teh groupers.</div></div><hr />

Let's not forget though that in these worlds, anyone can choose at any time whether they want to be in A or B.  Also, they're not taking from A for most zones in the game.

This sucks for anyone who enjoys the solo aspect of the game, and guess what there are A LOT of us out there.  Now I don't solo all the time, because at 61 in PoP it's just not that great of a way to gain experience.  But cmon SOE!!  This is a huge slap in the face to the common soloer, that social outcast that you so despise that sits for 12 hours straight camping something you MADE him camp for some damn quest.

Do we know for a fact that's true.  When my toons were one level apart, and I was hunting in PoJ basement when bored, to my warrior they were all light blue, but to my shaman they were a mix.  When I took the time to con them with the shaman, I could get singles by pulling the ones that were dark blue to him, if it's &quot;partner&quot; was light blue.  If I pulled the light blue one, I'd get both.  But it didn't matter if I pulled with my shaman who saw the con difference or my warrior, to whom they were all light blue.  Granted, that's not an extensive test, but it makes me think maybe it's based more on relative level than what color of con is applied to that level.  But I could be wrong - wouldn't be the first time. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Someone already mentioned the best reasoning behind reducing the specific mob experience in PoP, that being the near influx of non-flagged tier2+ soloers.  I'm sorry to all of those that feel its not a nerf to soloers in PoP getting a little too much xp for their risk, but come on.  Nerf the xp that *every* mob in PoP gives (hurts everyone) then increase the group xp that is given to everyone.  What does that sound like?  It sounds like exactly what the message already states, <br />
<br />
The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
The reason its targetted directly at PoP soloing is because as many of us know, making more mobs dark blue is just for show and merely a bone to alleviate some of the pressure to xp in PoP 61+.  They didnt say that they modified the &quot;kill mobs close to your level&quot; rules (hurting players who kill mobs of significantly lower level).  There are PLENTY of mobs that are currently dark blue to 61+ characters in old world zones...why arent they killed?  Because they give next to nothing for xp, despite being dark blue.  What is the point of making even more dark blue mobs that are a waste of time to xp on?<br />
<br />
The group bonus adjustment is a good idea because there is one reason I know my solo xp is better than group xp.  I don't know exactly why the game works this way, but if no matter who I have tried grouping with and how much *MORE* damage I know they are contributing to the group than I am, solo is better xp.  Group bonus my ass...as far as I'm concerned the game never had such a thing.  I could duo with a rog doing a good 30% more damage than myself and still end up with slower xp.<br />
<br />
The game has always had the choice of grouping or soloing.  Hell that was originally one of the core choices for your character as some classes were so obviously better at soloing there was no question about it.  The opinion that soloing should be stricken from the game (or nerfed, ignored, etc) is absurd.  Part of the EULA doesnt state that you have to group to get xp does it?<br />
<br />
The xp changes suggested in the message really aren't drastic at all.  A 30ish percent reduction in rate for soloers in PoP zones?  That sucks for sure, but certainly not the end of the world.  1 hour to get an aa will be 80ish minutes.  On the other hand, if you solo and find other people soloing near you in PoP, instead of compete maybe you can actually join up now if the bonuses are correct.</div></div><hr />

This argument boils down to this: before you could have a tasty steak in 10 places.  Now, you can have a plate of chicken feces in 20 places!  It therefore isn't a nerf, because you can get a big heaping pile of chicken **** in 10 places where you got nothing before!  Yum Yum! You've been buffed!!!

That misses the point though.  First off the friends thing amounts to nothing more than an ad hominem.  To the extent it has a point, it fails to make it.  Lets accept your implied premise (that I think is wacky) that people who are less sociable than others need to be brutally beaten down until they join the cheerleading squad.  <br />
<br />
This problem remains: plenty of people with lots of friends like to solo for a substantial portion of their online time.  You can have all the friends you want, but if you are frequently on for only small chunks of time, you're screwed.  A lot of people play solo capable characters for that very reason.  What happens if all of my friends are already in a group?  If they are on vacation?  If I am in a differnt timezone on business?  I took the morning off from work on a lark?  If you play a class that many people (rightly or wrongly) think sucks in groups?  etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Therefore, mobs you were able to single pull can no longer be so, thus, agro range is wider, soloing and farming become much harder.<br />
<br />
I don't like that at al <br />
<br />
Actually no, it doesn't change this at all.  Being able to single pull was level based not con based, and didn't change when the levels were increased to 65.  The hardcap for being able to solo pull is lvl 47.  And only worked when you picked the lowest of the bunch to pull.  We tested this with a duel boxed friend who was lvl 48 and conning the mobs for us.  <br />
<br />
So at 60, you can single pull dark blues using level pulling, but once you level to 65 you could only single pull greens based purely on level pulling.  Don't buy it?  Go test it in Nadox on the light blues off to the right after crossing the bridge, they don't single pull despite being light blue.  Of course there are other tricks you can use to single pull them, but its not level based. Such as assist range and proximity pulling.<br />
<br />
So actually, the exact opposite of what you are saying is happening, the con range of mobs we can level pull are increasing, not vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I believe that con color has nothing to do with single pulling, at 61+.  Basically, SOE screwed with what level mobs give exp, but forgot to change aggro rules to go with it - i.e. I routinely can't single pull light blue krup / illis frogs in Seb at 65.  Only SOE could start a long conversation about aggro simply by being incompetent and lazy lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Overall, I like the proposed changes. I don't think you can implement them w/o nerfing PoP zone modifiers though. Exp there would just be too fast in a group otherwise. <br />
<br />
PoP soloing is gonna be hurt, mainly though in the tier 2+ planes where people are soloing mobs close to their level, and most of those will, I think still be getting nice exp. Quadders and charmers will still be getting pretty insane exp, rotters are gonna be hurt. I think it's a pretty small price to pay though. <br />
<br />
Hell, even if you solo'd half the time and spent the other half in a 6 person group, you'd still be getting faster exp overall than now. I really don't see where the sky is falling. A pretty minor hit in solo exp in exchange for a major boost in group exp (in all zones) as well as giving the 61+ melees a chance to solo dark blues again. Even the PoP soloers might acually see faster exp in many places. SOE basically more than doubled the exp in a lot of old world zones with a full group, which means a lot more people are gonna be hunting there. Less competition for the PoP soloers (which was gonna be insane anyway with the flag removal) and the ability for a lot of people to solo outside of PoP again. And don't forget, if you weren't soloing mobs close to your lvl, your range of blues just got a lot bigger. Taking out a lvl 50 mob is a lot easier than a lvl 55 and the exp difference isn't that great if you're over 60.</div></div><hr />

These moves are designed to expand the game again, and encourage the formation of groups.  There's lots of group dependent classes who can't get groups because other classes that can solo are soloing because the rewards are better.<br />
<br />
That needs to change, and these changes, in combination, are excellent changes for the health of the game.  <br />

Long term, folks will be better off.  All these whines will disappear in the face of actual implementation once these changes go live.  <br />

It amazes me that people think it is unfair to take away getting 18% xps per solo kill, when groupers get like 1% or 2%.  Like others have said, no one is taking away the ability to solo.  They are just lessening the unfair reward you get for being able to solo.<br />
<br />
I don't think that anyone will disagree that there are classes that can solo: Necros, Bards, etc.  Also, classes that can't solo: Warriors, Monks, etc.  According to this, it is very unbalanced to allow those that can solo to get such a massive reward for their abilities while others can't.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that people are not looking at the big picture of how the group bonus will help the lower level players in the game.  People shouldnt' forget that not everyone is in the planes or are level 61+.<br />
<br />
My solution to this situation would be to give everyone the same xps, whether they are grouped or not.  I don't understand why group xps are split anyway.  Just so we are clear, I think that if a mob gives 10% xps for a solo kill, then if a group kills the same mob, everyone in the group would get 10% xps.  No matter how many people are in the group.  ZEMs would be used to give bonuses to xps.  Not group numbers.<br />
<br />
Let's think about it logically.  A soloer goes out and tags a mob, whether he root/dots or tanks it doesn't matter, he/she does what they need to do to kill it.  You get xps for using your skills to overcome a challenge.  (Green con mobs are not challenges, hence no xps.)  If you happened to get a skill up for Alteration or Conjuration, it was because you learned how to use that skill better.<br />
Let's look at a group.  For example, I am a warrior MT in a group.  For the fight to start, I run out and pull a mob.  I lead it back to the group, and I notice that the group shaman starts casting a spell.  I see the mob yawn, so I realize that it was slowed.  I then tell myself to fight the mob harder to make sure to keep it angry at just me.  I am doing a pretty good job because it is really beating on me.  All of a sudden the cleric says he is going to heal me.  Wow, I feel much better!  I didn't learn how to cast heal, because that is an alteration based skill (that I don't have), but I noticed that heals should come when the person has been hurt to a certain level.  The mob eventually dies, and during the whole fight I was noticing what was happening around me.  Everyone else was also observing what each group member did.  I learned better tactics and strategies, not new skills.  Hence the warrior and each person in the group should get the same xps that a soloer would get for that kill.<br />
<br />
That is the logical solution as I see it.</div></div><hr />

No worries.  Going to Seb will be MORE attractive after this change, but if you group there nonstop, you won't be EXP competative with your other level 65 buddies....  I think people will go there occasionally, but not constantly, and they will respect the level 55 campers.

This won't work because that group of 6 will be killing 6 times faster.<br />
The balance should be that they get 10%/6 = 1.66% exp if they are killing 6 times faster. That's what they are testing. If you have 5/6 people you should be able to make the same AA in a 1hr that a soloer can make in 1hr. This is fair, and everyone should be able to see that.<br />
<br />
The nerf across the board of PoP exp is just a nerf to bring exp gains back into the realm of reality. It's way out of hand and really ruined the need to hunt and play in exp groups anywhere else. <br />
<br />
ZEM's have been tweaked throughout the history of EQ.<br />
No one complained when Kedge Keep was worth more exp to hunt, No one complained when Permafrost was made worth more exp to hunt in. PoP zones had zems worth so much more then any other place in all of EQ that it has made it pointless to hunt anywhere else for exp.<br />
Edit: Especially considering that the vast majority of them are easy outdoor zones with graveyards. Prior to PoP the dungeons had the highest ZeM's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it is true that ZEM's have been tweaked and retweaked through EQ's history, the reason 61+ players hunt in PoP isn't directly due to the ZEM but rather that 61+ players recieve significant experience penalties for killing mobs of lower level.  The ZEM for PoP was used to offset that penalty and therefor give somewhere for low 60's to fight in.<br />
<br />
A level 58-60 lizzy in cazic thule is terrible xp as soon as you ding 61, however a level 55-57 lightcrawler in PoD is great xp.<br />
<br />
SOE could have easily gone about the issue by looking at the mob difference modifiers again and realized what is currently implemented is a total crock.  Instead, they saw that there were a few classes suited for soloing that were soloing too well in their high ZEM PoP zones, so much better so than other groups, some saw it as unfair.  This resulted in a mass nerf of all xp in PoP, hurting everyone, then to counter that they added additional grouping bonuses.<br />
<br />
What it doesn't seem that people realize is that the char's used in many of the examples of solo power like, &quot;wizzies that quad for 60% aa&quot; or root rotting a mob that gives 18%, are of extremely high capability.  The wizzy has dozens of AA, FT, most of his spells, huge mana pool, horse, etc.  Unfortunately those are the cases that stand out.  I wonder what people would be complaining about if there was always a group of equally equipped players, say shm,dru,rog,wiz,mag,sk (all with huge hp, ft, vengeance, spells, etc) claiming half of valor.  What would the nerf be then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">What it doesn't seem that people realize is that the char's used in many of the examples of solo power like, &quot;wizzies that quad for 60% aa&quot; or root rotting a mob that gives 18%, are of extremely high capability.  The wizzy has dozens of AA, FT, most of his spells, huge mana pool, horse, etc.  Unfortunately those are the cases that stand out.  I wonder what people would be complaining about if there was always a group of equally equipped players, say shm,dru,rog,wiz,mag,sk (all with huge hp, ft, vengeance, spells, etc) claiming half of valor.

<br />
Yeah to quad the mobs needed to get 60% aa a quad you'd definitely need to be pretty decked out.<br />
<br />
Just for giggles i tried some numbers. Assuming a wizzy has his level 65 spell tears of marr they can do 850dmg for 425 to the 4 targets. The mobs I'd guess they are quading would be the guards back by the fennin event on the bridge. They seem to have about 50k hps so thats about 58.8 nukes to kill them. Figuring a 20% crit rate every 5 casts = 6 casts worth of dmg. Soo 58.8 * 5 / 6 = just a hair over 49 nukes or 20825 mana. Assuming a 30% mana savings (~10% from regular spec ~10% from SCM and ~8 on average from a 15% MP item) gives you ~14575 actually mana spent. Needless to say no wizzard has that much mana. Just looking at cast times it would take almost 6 and half minutes of chain nuking just to cast the spell.<br />
<br />
Looking at better equiped wizzards on my server they seem to have about 6k mana. So that leaves ~8500 mana to be regenerated during the kite. Assuming maxed ft, maxed aa regen Po9 and C5 works out to a nice round 60 mana a tick which works out to a bit over a 14 minutes to regen that much mana. Even if you add on horse and an emp robe pushing your regen up to 90 mana a tick it would still be 9.5 minutes. I personally find a horse unlikely since the start up lag to get up to running would be fatal if 4 mobs that quad for 1k a pop catch ya =). So figuring on the 60 mana a tick regen you need 14 minutes of kiting to kill the mobs plus another 7 minutes or so to med your mana back or a total of ~21 minutes for 60 some of percent of an aa. That works out to about 3% a minute or roughly 35 minutes per aa. Definitely not a bad pace but nothing like what enchanter did with charm  at times and fairly compairable to what shaman have done soloing the same area. Sure 60 some percent of an aa in one kite sounds impressive when you just hear that but it takes a long time to do that.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that there is somewhat significant risk in kiting 4 mobs around that can hit for 1k a pop and could do 16k dmg in one round. You let em catch ya and your dead as a door nail.<br />
<br />
Edit, added mana savings in. Thats what I get for trying to do numbers while distracted =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Taraddar, you forgot to calculate in focus item effects. Any wizard worth his salt is going to have several. That alone can alter your calculations by 25% and more.<br />
<br />
A level 58-60 lizzy in cazic thule is terrible xp as soon as you ding 61, however a level 55-57 lightcrawler in PoD is great xp. <br />
This is do to the extreme ZeM in PoP. Both mobs are within the 5 level bonus to the player, yet one is worth substantially more exp. Coupled with the fact that it is less risk, it's just silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Nice work Taraddar.  Exactly what I was speaking of and yes focus items will probably have a pretty big effect.  Some may even have epic + mana robe also, so realistically we can throw out say 30-40 minutes for an AA max?  I just wanted it to be out there for people to consider :)<br />
<br />
Visc, aye the ZEM's of PoP had to be so huge because of the penalties in xp char's get now for killing blues.  The way xp is handled now is screwy.<br />
<br />
As for being less risk, thats subjective really.  Tanking PoP mobs for a shaman can be quite risky in PoP, as can root rotting using DD dots.  On the other hand some classes soloing in PoP is nearly no risk due to DDless dot's, snare, fear, pet, etc but you could also say that is due to the zones being outdoor.  Shaman have slows and heals which are much more valuable in dungeons, etc...<br />
<br />
Personally, even though a zone like chardok might be mostly green / light blue, it's still 10x more dangerous than any PoP zone simply due to the graveyards.  I have had to do plenty of CR's for myself in chardok and quite a few times I had to just break down and get a cler and necro / sk friend to summon and res.  Too bad that risk isn't worth anything anymore.<br />
<br />
Again, great point about the focus items :)</div></div><hr />

So the greater exp from higher blues is a bonus.  Lots of us got to 60 just fine without that, and now in PoP you get that bonus plus a crazy ZEM.  Personally, I think the exp rate in PoP is ridiculously fast, but maybe that's from doing it the hard way.<br />

Your confusing me with this statement? Are you trying to say exp is handled differently since PoP was released? PoP crazy high Zem's is what makes exp in old worlds look bad, but what is considered &quot;bad&quot; was the norm for 4 years.<br />

Edit: As stated above, the only change to exp was the bonus for killing higher level mobs. This has nothing to do with PoP and was rolled out before PoP was released. The lack of 60+ mobs is the only limiting factor.</div></div><hr />

Actually testing at the time when the did this pre pop release showed that they initially lowered the exp from low end dark blue mob in addition to the bonus for the higher level mobs that they stated. People complained and they took the penalty out so that low end of blues gave as much exp again.<br />
<br />
I can't back it with hard numbers but my experience tells me that this is in effect post 65. There is a HUGE difference in the amount of exp I get killing the wandering trash in PoS (all level 58 btw) at 65 and I get in PoV killing low to mid 60's razor's or golems or even the giants or frogs in PoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
We all get a bonus multiplier for fighting mobs that are close to our own level.  Even tho the PoS trash is level 58, and dark blue, it is not within the &quot;close&quot; range (reported to be about 5 levels at 65 although it is larger at lower levels) whereas the razorfiends and golems at 61-2 are in the bonus range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was levelling to 60 the only crap xp zone I found was seb.  Pretty much everywhere else was decent xp.  The low blue xp nerf was never fully removed, otherwise places like FG would still be camped all the time by level 60's farming AA.<br />

<br />
I apologize for lumping the xp nerf prior PoP in with the release of PoP.  The release of PoP indeed had no affect on the xp of old world mobs.  However, the nerf did affect the xp for every character 50+.  There was indeed a nerf to mobs that are of lower level in addition to the bonus for mobs of very close to, equal, and higher level.<br />
<br />
There must be a huge change in the way xp is calculated with the current system.  When levelling from 60 to 61, the (near) linear digression of xp recieved from blue mobs makes a tremendous dive.  For example, experience at 60 in old world zones isn't really crappy (chardok, FG, velks, katta, umbral, etc) but the xp difference when you ding 61 is horrible.  The same level mobs, still blue, suddenly give about 50% the xp if not even less when you ding 61.  This escalates even moreso the higher into 60's you get.  That is the screwy xp system I was referring to :)<br />
<br />
If there is no change to the xp penalty 61+ characters recieve for killing low blue mobs then there is no practical reason to open up the dark blue range, other than for a few zone farmers to get an aa every couple of days instead of never.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I don't think anyone stays 60 to farm exp in FG.  FG wasn't bad exp at 60, but now that you can get much better in PoP, people level on up to 62 or 65, depending on if they have access to Tier 2+.  When you ding 61, the Dark blue range shrinks (not sure of the exact range, but it appears to go from 15 levels for DB to 10-ish), so most of the non-pop mobs you got good exp on go light blue, and there is an exp penalty when you hunt light blue.</div></div><hr />

** Experience System Changes - Round Two ** <br />
<br />
In the test server update that occurred earlier today (server downtime), and in the PoP Zones Update that just occurred (PoP zones downtime), there were a number of tuning changes made to the new experience system and the PoP zones themselves. <br />
<br />
The effect of these changes should more closely match the intent that was described in the original message. The first round of changes, by the numbers, didn't. <br />
<br />
It went the right direction in all cases, and a number of the group size vs target type combinations were covered well. However, there were a number of cases where the target was overshot. <br />
<br />
Among these: <br />
<br />
- Not generous enough vs PoP NPCs for groups of all sizes, the smaller groups and soloists being the hardest hit. <br />
<br />
- Too generous with 4-6 man groups vs Non-PoP NPCs who can, in some cases, barely hurt their attackers. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested in helping test these most recent changes, here is the list of combinations that we're trying to make sure all reward appropriately: <br />
<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Solo - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Solo - PoP <br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Small Group (2-4) - PoP <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range <br />
Group (5-6) - PoP <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind while testing out group experience, as always, group bonuses only apply according to the number of people who are in range. <br />
<br />
Feel free to try out as many combinations as you can. As before, we look forward to hearing opinions on these changes via the boards and Dev Corner. Thanks very much for helping out! <br />

<br />
Sciek did not say that soloers should get worse exp.  You imply that they should get better exp (perhaps unintentionally, but you still imply it) than a group, but your logic is that they are the same in regards to a financial measurement.<br />
<br />
I suspect that you would be okay with Sciek's implied position that solo should be roughly equal to grouped exp, as opposed to either approach being better exp than the other.</div></div><hr />
