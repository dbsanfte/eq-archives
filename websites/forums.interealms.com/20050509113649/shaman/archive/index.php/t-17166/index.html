<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kellz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings greetings...<br />
<br />
forgive yet another N00b question....<br />
<br />
got level 55 on sunday...<br />
<br />
So, yesterday, I'm casting Form of the Great Bear on myself, and much to my chagrin, I'm not exactly a polar bear, the head is brown...<br />
<br />
Is this bug?  some piece of my gear cause this?<br />
<br />
Just wondering cause it was a bit disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah that's not right.  Wearing a leather cap changes the bear's lip, that's all.<br />
<br />
Ogres are brown bears.  Barbarians are polar bears.  Not sure about the others but I think Iksar and Trolls are black and Vah Shir and Frogs are both brown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have a Metal Linked Crown.<br />
<br />
If it is head gear that does it.... what DOESN'T make it brown?<br />
<br />
Will it be brown if I wear no head gear?<br />
<br />
Just trying to figure it out............<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:   and yes, I am a barbarian.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  I'm a barb and I have a brown head while in bear form...   :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a Kylong Darkmail Coif (chain graphic) and it does this to me too. It's a bug, hopefully it'll be fixed soon, but I can't imagine it being a high priority. Hopefully it's something that they can spot and fix easily though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happened to me and I was too embaressed to use FoGB for a while, lol. <br />
<br />
Figured it out though. It's your wode. Just hit /face and change to something else. Problem solved ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, it's nice to know what causes it, thanks for letting us know. But I won't change my woad just to work around a bug, for now I'll either put up with a brown face or not use bear form.<br />
<br />
I *will* try to remember to bug it next time I'm in game though - speaking as a software developer, the more information the better - knowing that the woad makes a difference is the sort of thing that might help a tester locate and fix the bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've just stopped using it because I like my woad the way it is, and I don't like the mismatched bear head... if they do fix that, maybe they can make us look like the LDoN battle harriers instead of blocky old school bears... druids got neat wolves, mages got neat elementals, skellies look swift now, and we're still... blocky old school bears.<br />
<br />
Ok, sorry, enough!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OH, I see, a MIXED bear.<br />
<br />
Try deleting all the .txc files in your EQ directory.  These are texture cache files.  EQ will automatically recreate them all, but maybe there's a problem in your cache that the re-created files won't have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, it's not that. I appear as a white bear with a brown face, but another barbarian shaman appears as a white bear with a normal white face. If there was a problem with the texture cache, I would expect all white bears to look the same. Plus, other people have commented on it too - if it was .txc file based, it would be different for different people.<br />
<br />
The woad explanation seems to fit (the other shaman has no woad), but I like my woad how it is, so I'm unwilling to change it for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kellz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">UPDATE :<br />
<br />
Thanks whomever said about the changing the /facepick.  That does solve the problem.  I changed to a different face and now I have a completely white bear.  I haven't tried going back to the face I had originally to see if it's just that face that gives the brown head, or I just needed to change it once or whatever.  <br />
<br />
But all in all.... problem solved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So the /facepick fixes it if you are running new models. What if you are running old models and have the problem? I just prefer the old world model since I don't use a horse/lizard.</div></div><hr />
