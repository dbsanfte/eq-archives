                     Diary, Me Grun.<br />
<br />
                     Grun have interesting day today. That last pixel of white still blink at Grun, but me think it never go away. Oh well.<br />
<br />
                     Me was in good mood all day, until late. Puny friend Krup (Shammy lvl 50 Barbie), take Grun to OOT and we get  Grun Ebon spear. So me happy. Krup good guy for puny Barbarian.<br />
<br />
                     Me bouncing along all day, doing normal Grun stuff. Me buff newbie troll, me scold humies harrassing bashers,'dat sort stuff.<br />
<br />
                     Me saving up to try for hoop again so me go Rathe to kill HG. Me see guildmate Rashana. She smart Erudite Wiz. She killing HG. She skinny, so me buff her good and we chat. Then me buff me and me go get a giant. Me say &quot;Hello Mr. Giant, let's have a chat&quot;, so he come to Grun to chat about weather and stuff.<br />
<br />
                     Remember, it long time ago Grun learn some these spells. And Troll no like admit, but we not smartest in Norrath. Anyway, me get giant and me root me like planned. Hmmm... me think something wrong. Me cast root, giant move but me no move. Me got headache from thinking too hard about it. <br />
<br />
                     Me kite no working good. HG no get far away. Me health go down fast, and me doggie too far away to care (he was doing doggie stuff). Then me realize &quot;Hmmm... maybe me head not hurt from thinking too much. Maybe me head hurt because giant hittin' it?&quot;<br />
<br />
                     So me panic. Me type &quot;/tell Rashana Heljp!&quot;, just like that.<br />
<br />
                     She no see where Grun is, so me stand there and do nail to his hammer. 'Dat no fun! BONK! BONK! BONK! <br />
<br />
                     Finally, root break (lousy root! me should root better than 'dat!), me get sow on me and me run to Rashana. She help Grun. Me live, giant die, me get loot.<br />
<br />
                     So diary, me sad after such a good day. Me root self like stupid Barbie, me cry for help like a sissy elf, then me hide behide skirt of skinny girly wiz. Me so ashamed!<br />
<br />
                     But tomorrow be 'nother day. Me go have a Gnome sandwich and me try forget it.<br />

                     Diary, <br />
<br />
                     Me still Grun.<br />
<br />
                     Today better day than yesterday. Me go back to the and kill more puny HG's. Me thinks 'dey lots easier if me root 'dem and not me, so me root 'dem from now on.<br />
                     'Dey no gud loot today. Me thinks they gamble with Inkies last night now they all broke.<br />
                     Me see funny looking flying thing there today. It wear funny hat and look like lion with wings. It flew over to me guildmates Rashana's group and 'dey all fight. It fun to watch!pow, wiz, splash! There I think six puny peoples in<br />
                     Rashana group. Me shiny cleric guildmate Ress there too. <br />
<br />
                     Me watch and some cyclops hit me, so me kill it and watch sphinx thing some more. Me think Rashana and Ress group having lots fun, so me sit for few more minutes. Me have fun watching punies try to fight too.<br />
<br />
                     But then their group mate yell for help, and Rashana say &quot;This is bad&quot; (that exactly what she say). Grun think someone big and strong should go help the punies. Then Grun remember Grun is big and strong. Grun pound chest and say &quot;Me Here! Me Here!&quot;<br />
<br />
                     So me poison it two time and send doggie it. It die so easy. It look mean but it die easy. Me no mean too, but me got the xp for it. But that no big deal -- it only have 7 gp.<br />
<br />
                     The puny group say they had three of them harmed and were scared. May be Grun lucky it so mad at them it no charm me, so me get lots of poison for it to eat.<br />
<br />
                     Anyway, it much better day. Me glad me help the skinny wiz this time. 'Dat is more like how a day in Rathe supposed to be.<br />

                     Diary,<br />
<br />
                     Me Lovelorn Grun, and me sad. Owwwww!!! Me so sad! Me cry like girly elf.<br />
<br />
                     Me had fun day killing giants some more in morning, so me felt like me did gud. Me become wealthy troll with 2012 pp in bank (me had erudite friend count it). Then when me got hrough swamp to go kill some more, me see pretty pretty Lynuga, swimming in the stagnant water. Oh, she look so pretty with the pond scum twinkling on her bald head. And the leech on her cheek was the cutest me ever see. She some Troll and me no resist her.<br />
<br />
                     Me thought me was over her. Last summer, Grun give her 2400pp in rubies and she give Grun a bunch of junk me no need. So me leave broken hearted. But today, diary, she sparkled Grun's eye again (me only have one eye), and me ask her what da matter. She say she like ruby. So (me friend Brok help do this), me get her ruby. She give me some junk and ask for another ruby. So me get her another ruby, she gimme junk and ask for another ruby. She just keep asking for ruby, and Grun's eye sparkled so me just keep getting her ruby. Me no can stop! <br />
<br />
                     Me bank account say 2012pp, then it say 1821pp, then it say 1432pp, then it say 815pp... It all a haze. Me only can think of get Lynuga rubies, nothing else.<br />
<br />
                     Me look up. Me poor friend Brok was helping me. Me see he lay dead! A bunch of Froggies came up and kill poor puny Brok, and Grun so sparkled me no even care or notice. Me just tell Brok to come back and help me give another ruby to pretty Lynuga.<br />
<br />
                     Finally, all me ruby gone, and Lynuga still no love me enough to give me a true sign of love. Me think you know what sign of love Grun hope to get. Me look down. Ground filled with junk, and Lynguna just walk off and leave me and Brok. Grun broke, and Brok have another corpse laying on ground by now.<br />
<br />
                     Diary, then, out of range of her gaze, Grun come to senses! What Grun do!? Grun spend all money and have pile of mallets and axes. So, me and Brok rush and pick them up and run to vendor to sell, then back to pick up more to sell, until we get them all. Brok smarter than Grun, and Brok count 22 ruby crazy Grun give away. Grun no even get his own mudder Troll ruby on Mudder's Day.<br />
                     <br />
                     Brok and Grun then sit in Grobb bar and have some Ogre Swill. Grun cry in his swill. Then Brok give it to Grun straight. He say &quot;Grun, you no smart&quot;. 'Dat what he say. Me give and give, and me only get broken heart from pretty Lynuga. Brok say Grun spent 3840pp on this lady since last summer and get nothing. Me no smart.<br />
<br />
                     ... but her eyes twinkle so pretty in the swamp gas.<br />

                     Hi Glubglub,<br />
<br />
                     I recognize your name from around Antonica. Great last name!<br />
<br />
                     Grun is a long-time member of the Wandering Lords. Two days ago, the Lords decided to raise the Int, Wis, and just plain rugged good looks of the guild so they invited me to join. Liking a real challenge, I accepted - I am now a proud member of the Wandering Lords myself - but a complete newbie to the guild.<br />

<br />
                     I am Krup - friend of Grun's. <br />
<br />
                     If you see us together, you can tell us apart quite easily: I have 2 eyes, hair on my head, I stand up straight, and can speak understandably (with a slight accent maybe, but women find it irresistable).<br />
<br />
                     I too frequent Grun's homelands. I speak with Lynuga, but she ignores me - I'm sure she gets lost in my ice-blue, barbarian eyes leaving her speechless. I'm used to that reaction from women. I also say hi to Zimbittle, but get no response. I think Zimbittle's Int is below Grun's, as hard as that might be to believe.<br />
<br />
                     I also speak with the bashers - some of them are uglier than Grun . . . all of them have Grun's manners. No matter how many times I tell them to stop, they try to look up under my Totemic Kilt. They say, &quot;Nice skurt hummie&quot; or &quot;Har, har, why yoo hav on purty dress puny barbie?&quot; Ignorant trolls! Well, I am a barbarian after all, and do not have the refined social skills of my Erudite and human friends, so my response is simply to bash in their skulls.<br />
<br />
                     Sometimes they forget about my kilt, and make fun of my dog instead. They say, &quot;Where yoo git purty poodul?&quot;or &quot;Mmmmm . . . that dawg look gud - speshully as pickul.&quot; Believe me when I say I try to be polite and explain that it is a wolf not a poodle, and that you're not supposed to eat pets, but it's like telling a druid not to kite. Instead, I just bash in their skulls.<br />
<br />
                     Then the other day I met a basher, Oggrik was his name I believe, that was a little different than the others. He had 2 blades - one of them was small, like a toothpick. And he seemed very confident. When he said to me, &quot;Hey puny barbie in purty skurt, yoo puppie look like pickul wif legs&quot; I demanded an apology. 6 Malosi resists, 4 root resists, and 2 E-bolt resists later, my puppy ended up a gherkin on the end of Oggrik's toothpick, and I was one scared barbie running through the swamp with my legs chugging and my skirt blowing up in back! No wonder Oggrik kept following me. Long story short: I took a quick peek over in South Ro just to see how things were (things were fine there . . . and safer!).<br />
<br />
                     So now when a basher with 2 blades, one of them a toothpick, makes fun of my kilt or my wolf, I do the right thing: I bash one of his friends' skulls in.<br />

                     Better hope expansion late...make 50 from 42 not so easy.. 'dat 45 is in da way.<br />
<br />
                     Me killed E Karana barbie fishing villiage guards from 37-47. Dey were easy and gud xp. But since then, Verant make dem much harder and 'dey resist. 'Dey even still resist Grun sometimes still. Me did Bandl in Everfrost from 49 to first bubble of 50, 'den that when guards got buffed resist big time, and me no can kill him anymore.<br />
<br />
                     Me no know if 42 shammy can still kill da guards. 'Dey always used to be camped, but now no one ever 'dere anymore 'cause 'dey so tough resist now. Me friend Scyth (35 Troll SK) kill 'dem, but that with Grun 'dere doing serious debuffing and buffing, and with doggie nipping.<br />

<br />
                     Dis be Norbie again. Norbie agrees, barbies resist much more dan dey used to. Norbie could still solo da guards at gate at 41, and since me lvl'd dismorning, dat be two levels ago. It be much easier once Norbie gets new puppy nipper and DD spell. Me hate dungeons much as Grun do, but Norbie tried out Sol B fer a bit, Got me mah last bubble of 42 and first of 43 purdy quick. A couple hours was all it take Norbie. Me TINKS dat I can hunt der till 44, den solo guards till 45. Norbie hears dat 18 hours of soloing spectres can getcha through 45, but dat from inkies without troll penalties. If youse have any udder suggestions fer where Norbie can hunt, or if you wanna get wit Norbie and barsh sometime, Norbie appreciate any info.<br />
<br />
                     Norbie wants Grun ta keep diary going, even though mah head hurtz from da reading<br />

                     Dere Diary,<br />
<br />
                     Me Grun.<br />
<br />
                     Me been busy today. Lil' Scyth is me lvl 34 Troll Shadow Knight friend. Me been helping him level so me get more troll to go bash High Elves some day.<br />
<br />
                     Me go out to E Karana to help Scyth. Me walking down da path, dum dee dum dumm...it beautiful day in 'da Karanas. Me just smilin' away. Me have such pretty smile.<br />
<br />
                     'Den me was thinking about how da humies say troll no too smart. 'Den me wonder &quot;If humies so smart, how come Grun see humie farmer all over Karanas, surrounded by Hill Giants and other nasty things, always being eaten for lunch?&quot; Me no can think of any troll farners 'dat till land when HG sneaking up on him. Now 'dat dum!<br />
<br />
                     Anyway, da trip out to E Karana bring back lots memories from when Grun kill these guards when me was little lvl 37. Guess me just a sentimental troll. Me remember when Guard Tubal insult Grun's lil' Nipper back then, and Grun need kill him several hundred times to teach him no do dat... Oh, those da days. But finally Tubal learn lesson. And now, lil' Nipper no so little anymore either.  <br />
<br />
                     Anyways, me see Scyth standing 'dere. He very good looking troll -- he have head cracked in three places and have only one eye, just like Grun. Troll ladies love 'dat look!<br />
<br />
                     So, Scyth all excited and want to barsh guards. He tell Grun &quot;Me all excited and want to barsh guards.&quot; 'dat why me think he all excited and want to barsh guards. <br />
<br />
                     Now Grun say &quot;Hold on lil' guy! You no barsh guards for no reason. It is guards' nature to scowl at you, but 'dat no reason to barsh 'dem. Grun only used to barsh guards because they insulted me lil' doggie, but 'day learn their lesson gud now and no insult doggie anymore&quot;.<br />
<br />
                     Then me want to prove dat da guards learn dere lesson gud. Grun and little Nipper go up and say hi to Guard Tubal. Grun smile pretty and say &quot;Hi Guard Tubal!&quot;<br />
<br />
                     Well, Guard Tubal attacked Grun for no reason! Now, 'dat don't upset Grun all too much, after all grun did say it in da nature of guards to scowl. So Grun say &quot;Ahh, Guard Tubal, Grun no have time to play now...Grun just helping out lil' buddy Scyth.&quot;<br />
<br />
                     But before me know it, little Nipper see all this. Little Nipper see 'dat Guard Tubal want to play, so lil' Nipper want play too! So little Nipper play with Guard Tubal.<br />
<br />
                     Now diary, here where da nice sunny an' happy day in Karana turn dark and gloomy. Instead of play with lil' Nipper, Guard Tubal insult me lil' doggy! He no play, he just mean!  Tubal say 'dis &quot;lil_Nipper_0, I'll teach you to interfere with me!&quot; 'den he try hurt lil' Nipper.<br />
<br />
                     Grun no believe what he hear! 'dat just same thing Guard Tubal used to say before Grun teach him how to no say it! Grun spend eleven levels teaching Guard Tubal to no say 'dat, and now he go back and unlearn it.  Sheesh, Barbies are dumb!<br />
<br />
                     Diary, despite all this, grun restrain self. Me think Scyth see all this, and Grun need teach Scyth how behave in front of guards. But alas, me see Scyth already know! He in 'dere, yelling &quot;Tubal no insult innocent doggie!!&quot;, and he swinging some big ax like a crazy man! Whack, Tubal lose arm! Whack, Tubal lose nose. Whack! Tubal lose, well, Grun no can say 'dat here.<br />
<br />
                     Grun just stand back, slow Tubal down a bit and speed Scyth up a bit, 'den me sit down. (Me careful to make sure Scyth do 51% damage)<br />
<br />
                     So, if 'da people from Shaman's Crucible or our guild see Grun and Scyth hanging around 'da guards in E. Karana, 'dey most likely figure out we just helping Tubal out and teach him to love 'da lil' doggies.<br />
<br />
                     Me predict tubal no learn lesson again until Scyth into lvl 47 or so. He 36 now but Tubal still learning.<br />
<br />
                     PS - dat white pixel still blinkin' at me!<br />

                     Hey Grun!<br />
<br />
                     We're rock stars my one-eyed, toe-nail-on-the-bottom-of-the-foot, pointy-nosed, barbarian-killing stud!<br />
<br />
                     I was hanging out in Rathe Mts the other day taking a break from harvesting hill giants by buffing the Cyc killers by the Lake Rathe zone and what happens to me but (I might have the name wrong but it's close):<br />
<br />
                     Zugzug (Troll Shammie): Krup! You famous!<br />
                     Krup: Hello Zug. What do you mean?<br />
                     Zugzug: You and Grun rite funny stuff. Me read on the Shamans' Crucible.<br />
                     Krup: (Thinking: As if you could read troll-breath!)No, _I_ write funny stuff. Grun is funny because he does dumb things like a tro . . .ummm . . . errr . . . well it's just funny! And he has an Erudite translate his misfortunes into something normal Narrathians can understand.<br />
                     Zugzug: Well me just want to say hello. Gud huntin'.<br />
                     Krup: (gasping for fresh air) Take care shaman-brother.<br />
<br />
                     I hope I didn't ruin your reputation big guy, it seems the Troll population is so short on real heroes that they look to you as a (*snort*) ROLE MODEL!<br />
<br />

                     Dear Diary,<br />
<br />
                     mez no Grun, Mez Luddo. <br />
<br />
                     Mez not seen Grun in long time and me finds dis book lying on a log in da Swamp. Mez tink Grun may be dead, dat make me berry sad, cause Grun gud.... even if he only dumb Trollie. Mez tinks dat his gud mate Torvo be out lukin fer im, but me aven't seen Torvo in long time either. Luddo worried bout Torvo now as well.<br />
<br />
                     Luddo can writes cause i've smart Ogar, so mez will wirte himself.<br />
<br />
                     Sad thing happen to Luddo last night as well. Luddo in South Karana lukin fer stuff den mez hears musac to me ears. &quot;GRIZZLEKNOT AT TREES&quot;.<br />
<br />
                     Quick smart Luddo runs over dere to start bashin him. Me didn't have any juju but I knew I could smash dat naughty tree by meself if i cast dat spell dat makes me mad..<br />
<br />
                     So mez finds da Grizzleknot fing and starts bashin at him, mez only just started on it and den my doggy starts bashin on him.<br />
<br />
                     Den my doggy started casting spells on da Grizzleknot as well. Luddo Happy!!! mez have super doggy, it can casts spells now!! Wolfie was doin really gud and da silly Tree was goin down fast.<br />
<br />
                     Den Luddo think. Luddo no have doggy. Luddo only got his 33rd skull. mez no get wolfie till 34th skull. Den who's doggy dis.<br />
<br />
                     Grizzleknot falls over and Luddo no get nice lello message saying dat mez get experiencey.<br />
<br />
                     Den most amazing thing happened. Doggy talked to Luddo. He says &quot;I own u d3wd&quot;. <br />
<br />
                     Mez not understand doggy talk, but it not sound nice. Den he run off wif Luddo standing amazed. No Grizzleknot, no bark. <br />
<br />
                     Luddo sit down and cries. <br />
<br />
                     Mez no like me Bloodstained Tunic thing, it make Luddo look like one of those Ogres dat hang round da seedy side of Oggok wif all those boy Wood elfies. Mez wanted to look tuff with nice Totemthingy shirt.<br />
<br />
