<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have the tear, beat down the Kirn, ready to take out Rak and Neh.  Only took like six months, hehe.  I planned on just taking them both out at the same time and was wondering if this is how most peeps have done it.  I assume that it's best to bind in the city nearest rak temple and just run to give spirit neh's drop then gate back for rack.  Might be a silly question but just thought I'd ask.  My plan is to use a warrior for main tankage and have fire pets assist, this is based on everything I've read here on the crucible about the failure some have had with fire pets.  Any helpful comments are appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's my plan too, I'm doing it in 5 days. Mobs on the ground floor of CoM don't wander, so there are some relatively safe places to bind there: entrance, outside the temple, the two big empty courtyards on either side of the central goo house (arena), and on the bridge in front of the castle between the two gazebos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How did you guys get on?<br />
<br />
What tactics did you use Tank + Fire pets or just fire pets?<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is that my self and another Shaman are planning to do Neh/Rak next week and are unsure as to what tactics to use. If it works I'd rather use a Tank and fire pets rather than just the fire pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No firepets at all, its way too risky after the changes in resists. Just bring a GOOD tank with nice resists. Make sure he keeps agro (and stays alive) and Rak should be no problem.<br />
<br />
I survived several hits from his AE just by using Sup heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On mine,<br />
<br />
Neh was easy, just cleared the 2nd-to-last hut and waited there, pulled reaver from last hut to 2nd-to-last hut, did hand-in and killed her.<br />
<br />
For Rak, we had no mages show up for the raid. Had 2 groups 53-60 including a 60 paladin, a 60 monk, a 60 cleric, and 3 druids. Rak was fought on the ground floor inside the castle. I had one group of melee inside at first to fight, the healers and the 2nd melee group outside the locked door to shield them from the AE. After the hand in, Rak agroed on the monk with an ice comet, not on me. Maybe the monk was standing closer to him. So not getting initial agro, I lived, and lasted through the fight by healing myself. At 50%, rogue opened door and 2nd melee group was brought in to seal the deal. AE went off maybe half a dozen times, and lots of healing was needed (60 Paladin group heal for 660 is real helpful). Only the monk died, and towards the end.<br />
<br />
I would have liked to have fire pets there for extra support in case some of them happened to be resistent, but it didn't happen that day for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ebeneezer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I finally got mine just over a week ago and we did have a few problems.  Fire pet trick didnt seem to work, so we just sent a nicely buffed tank in to do the business.  However we were also trying for Neh for another shaman and a mage.  When it came time to clear the last black reaver for Neh.. well.. long story short story - we had 91 black reavers pop in a row.  After about an hour of fighting the groups either stood and died or zoned out of sheer boredom.  5 minutes to rez and regroup to try the whole lot again.  All went a lot more smoothly this time, although we did have to split the final reaver off to Kill Neh in the end as a further 12 reavers popped from it.  All in all tho - a great day.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and we got a total of 12 jade reavers for the guild bank too - which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Horadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">best thing to do is bind at the spirit kill nah and gate to spirit turn it in while group keeps killing its way to rak then after turn in get back to CoM and be coth back to party its the quickest way<br />
then when you are done just gate back and get spear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the info guys.<br />
<br />
I completed my epic last week, and for the first Rak kill we had 4 mages and a 60 SK to tank for us. I was a bit freaked out becuase when I handed the tear in he didn't agro on me! but on the SK.<br />
<br />
He went down quite quickly the SK just taking a few AoE's (I only took one and survived.) The pets however had to be recast. The are no longer a safe way to take Rak down.<br />
<br />
after we had beat Rak we had a server crash and rollback. I got my Tear back from a GM  and we had to kill rak a second time. This time we only had 2 mages. Again Rak didn't agro on me, but on the SK, and again the fire pets had to be recast. In the second fight I didn't take any AoE. Even with 2 pets Rak still went down quite quickly.<br />
<br />
my stats were 109 base FR and circle of seasons. 3K HP (or there abouts)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Juat out of curiosity Does anything Spawn Neh?  Also What is the best way to get to her?  None of the maps give me a clear idea of how to reach her.  Also what are the best tactics in regards to killing Neh?  i'm lvl 49 now and have been ready to  Turn in the Ring to her since lvl 47 and also speaking of which  do you HAVE to be lvl 51 in order to kill Rak and  do the final turnin to the spirit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Neh is in the hut in the sky numbered 9 in this map. (http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html) When we fought her we went throught the throne room (number 1) then along the corridor to the right at the back right of the room then through the secret passage onto the invisible walkway upto number 7. We fought our way to the second to last hut number 8. A rogue pulled Neh's reaver back to room 8 and we killed it to get Neh to spawn.<br />
<br />
As for your question about levels. I've heard of people getting the spear below 51, but I don't think you can click it until 51. This is just hearsay on my part though, hopefully someone who has done the spear below 51 will reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well i originally posted this thread several weeks ago, and finally got around to completing epic this saturday (14dec).  We had roughly two and a half groups, two mages.  This was kind of a duo with rak, as myself and another shaman both did our hand-ins.  For the first rak we used 64rogue to tank with two mage fire pets, worked like a charm, rak went down.  Rak's reaver was positioned near the throne and was fought there, chanters were available to handle adds.  This was not the &quot;safe spot&quot; but crowd control was handled well.  Second battle, I didn't use fire pets but two epic mage pets and 64 rogue.   <br />
Rak went down as the rogue did a superb tankin job and mage pets stayed alive due to cleric support.  As has been mentioned on these forums before, you do not need mage pets if you have none, just a good tank or two and heavy heal support.   My pet even joined the fray and stayed alive through a bub of Rak's health, go figure.  I never took a lick of damage, Rak immediately aggroed rogue.   All meleers attacked at 20%.  Never asked rogue what his fire resist was, i assume it was around 150.  Gated to spirit, and got the spear of fate !  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just tried this today 01/15/02. Short story is we lost. Had two 60th mages who debuffed themselves down before summoning. Pets had aego, focus, and regrowth. It didnt matter. <br />
<br />
I handed the tear in waiting till he proced and the pets engaged. I died almost immediatly but the pets lasted a bit longer. Clerics were Ching the pets and the mages were chain summoning. Still didn't matter. <br />
<br />
On the positive side I did get into a fear raid later tonight and got another tear. Going to try next saturday with a more traditional raid force. Wish me luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whelp I finally got to finish this tonight myself (12/15).<br />
<br />
It was a real nail biter :p<br />
<br />
My observations:<br />
<br />
1) DISPELL THAT DAMAGE SHIELD - we didn't notice this until well into the fight but he had a 30pt damage shield up that was ripping the pets apart (I certainly could have missed it but I don't recall reading anything about a damage shield on him in any of the other posts on the subject).<br />
<br />
2) definitely pull him to the left side arches... we tried fighting right in front of his door but got adds because the fight took too long.  Unless you have a number of good tanks/pets, expect a good long fight.<br />
<br />
3) He gates so start stunning him when he gets low (although if you do just go ahead and fight him in his room this isn't that big of a deal but then you have all the adds to play with during the fight).<br />
<br />
4) Mana sieving/theft of thought does appear to help... near the end of the fight he just completely quit casting apparently out of mana.  If we had started that earlier it probably would have made the whole thing easier.<br />
<br />
5) I had about 150 FR/CR and was able to survive a couple of AE hits.... ice comet polished me off while pulling him on first attempt though.<br />
<br />
6) He's pretty damn resistant.  Tash landed but not much else (tried to mark of karn him and some other goodies).  I do believe mana sieve and theft of thought were landing though but forgot to ask to confirm.<br />
<br />
7) Just go ahead and plan on lots of adds including the possibility of reavers (especially if he gates).  Fortunately the adds are mostly pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Lastly, just a goober tip but if you can do the raid thing, do it so if you get the kill but get overwhelmed with reaver adds you have plenty of time to clear them or escape and get back to the dead rak for your scale (since corpses last longer when killed by a raided group than a normal group).<br />
<br />
Woof</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just killed him on Saturday, it was a pretty close fight.  We didn't use pets, but had instead a 62 warrior buffed against fire.  We also had 2 clerics which made all the difference.<br />
<br />
The warrior attacked and got agro for about 30 seconds before some other melee classes all 52-56 joined in.  Several of them died soon from the aoe, so the rest backed off and let the warrior do his thing, with maybe a wizard and druid nuking when able.  I'd say the warrior soloed Rak with about 30% life remaining.   He said he was able to resist the aoe a few times, but not very often.<br />
<br />
For the optimum group I'd bring:<br />
<br />
60+ Warrior<br />
2 Clerics (must have kei)<br />
Druid (fire buffs and nukes)<br />
Mage (ds + fire buff + pet damage)<br />
Shaman (help heal)<br />
<br />
Substitute a 60+ melee for the druid after fire buffing if possible.</div></div><hr />
