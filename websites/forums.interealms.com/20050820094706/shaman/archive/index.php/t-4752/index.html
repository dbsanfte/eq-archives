<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone, I got a quick question.   Is there a command to turn attack off.  Basically, the reason why I am asking is that I recently got a horse for my shammy.  I duobox the shammy with my monk and alot of my macros go like this<br />
<br />
/target Ryuodin (My  Monk)<br />
/assist<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/target Ryuodin<br />
/assist<br />
/cast 1 (slow)<br />
<br />
My goal would be to be standing 100% of the time and not be autoattacking.  The reason for this is right now, as long as I am not moving and I don't have autoattack on, I med while standing with my horse (in outdoor zones only of course)<br />
<br />
So, I have tried /attack off and it didn't seem to work.  Is there anyone out there that knows how to either target my Monk's mob without turning on autoattack or to turn attack off immediately after assisting my monk.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any info, I appreciate your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not certain if this fixes your problem:<br />
<br />
In your eqclient.ini file, setting AttackOnAssist=FALSE will stop attack from being turned on when you /assist. Or at least I know it did a while ago (these things have a way of breaking over time).<br />
<br />
However, /attack off should work in your macro; perhaps try a short /pause after turning off attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you do /assist off, it will turn off the autoattack when assisting feature.  This is pretty much a permanent arrangement, and saved per character I think.  Anyways, that should do what you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you very much for your help.  I will give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">or just make the key /assist Ryuodin   instead of targeting then assisting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanted to let you all know that /assist off worked great!  It solved all my problems.  Thank you again for helping me out:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You should ALWAYS have /assist off anyway.  If you are ever on a raid or in a group where it is important for the MA to get aggro before you engage, you don't want to be turning attack on when you assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use /assist for a number of things.<br />
<br />
1. tageting the puller's taget before its in range of slow.<br />
<br />
2. determining who has the current agro of a rooted mob.<br />
<br />
3. figuring out who the MA is currently fighting on multiple pulls so I can pull others for ghetto mez.<br />
<br />
4. checking on if the other tanks are keeping track of MA or puller.<br />
<br />
all this I do with a simple command called /assist</div></div><hr />
