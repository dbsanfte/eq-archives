<br />
At any rate, is there a placeholder for the spectral courier in CoM?  Have all the other pages, as well as the high scale icon from the temple... after 14 hours of camping and clearing the stables, it has popped once, and dropped the sk scroll... I was not amused, to say the least.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
<br />
Let me add that it wasn't just me, but a guild group ranging from a 49 warrior to a 56 mage... we cleared the zone all the way to the castle several times, and back again... had to do this 3-4 times to get the army behemoth to spawn (just FINALLY got cann2... worth the wait?  Jury is out, but so far, an improvement)<br />
<br />
So it wasn't a matter of not clearing the zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems to be bad luck. But anyway, there is no real PH for courrier, he can spawn at any spawn point in the stables, just keep the 2 stables cleared and hope for luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've camped stables for a couple days without seeing him, and sometimes I'll see him 3 or 4 times in a night. If you can still get exp there (up to maybe 51 or so), get a group and just camp the stables. If not, offer to buff and slow stuff for a group that's there if they let you loot the courier. I've seen him in both the stable and the little huts back there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is the infamous courier PH map.<br />
<br />
He will normally be in the bottom one or the right one...only seen once at the top one.<br />
<br />
I spent 14 hours there and never saw him once, then had a druid friend tell me he was up one day...got a port over killed him and he had my page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for what info was available... kind of figured there was no set placeholder for it... after an aborted reaver raid, some guildmates and I stayed and worked the stables for another 4-5 hours... both sides... the courtyard for variety... sweet exp, sweet cash, 3 couriers, 3 sk pages :(  Seems to just be the luck of the spawn table.<br />
<br />
But each time, it did spawn from the right side.. so this is definately more a test of patience than good ole Abe and friends...</div></div><hr />
