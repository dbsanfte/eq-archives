<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Xegony encounter, elemental wave. Me and another shaman can't land a slow on mobs, tried all 5. Tugur won't take hold, he was using Antithesis I was using regular spell. Mezzed mobs so pretty much impossible to have it dotted to death and debuffed (30 debuff slot limit). Next wave, all is back to normal.<br />
<br />
What the hell?<br />
<br />
New patch feature?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a bug that occurs when a boss of a wave dies at the same time it ae's Diseased Cloud. All mobs around him gets hit by it then since the ae is then &quot;Unowned&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since you can't overwrite the ae'd slow you'll get a &quot;Turgur won't take hold&quot; message. It's not really a big deal though, since the ae is 55% slow at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok good, I am sane then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The spider was slowed by the &quot;corpse&quot;. The Slow, coming from an NPC, is NOT mitigated and thus more effective than Turgur's. That's how I recall it anyway.</div></div><hr />
