<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyninn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone, this is my first post here and I would like to thank everyone on these forums, as you've been a vast source of knowledge for everything I've done in EQ.<br />
<br />
Background: <br />
Level 49 Barbarian Shaman (about to be 50 later today) with JBB and reasonable equipment, nothing fancy. I've been playing Everquest for my 4th week now.  Guess you could say I'm still somewhat of a n00b, but regardless I do love to powerlevel.  I've been using proceeds from the sale of my old Asheron's Call character to buy plat when needed (thus the reason I have JBB) - this allows me to continue to concentrate on leveling and not deal with the jerks in Rathe Mountains.  I've also been utilizing the elusive Project Alpha to my favor.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: <br />
I know some who read this will have the tendency to reply and tell me to go read the threads here in the 50s hunting spots.  I have - I'm posting this request because alot of what im reading seems to be old news, too camped, or whatever.  I'm just hoping for fresh ideas.  Also, I would rather not hunt nobles in HHK for 2 reasons - faction and I don't want to go back to some place I've already hunted at in the 20s-30s.<br />
<br />
Where to Level Fast??<br />
Props to the person who posted under the 40s hunting spots thread about the Plaguebone Thieves spot in Dreadlands - that spot rocked and took me from 43 to 49 in 4 days.  Awesome thanks!<br />
<br />
What I've been hearing about 50s is scaring me - no more yellow bubs in a couple hours? 1 blue bub an hour? eek! hehe.<br />
<br />
So what would you all suggest if I were to want to scream through the 50s straight to 60s?  I would prefer to solo only because lately it seems to be much better exp than grouping.  I dunno.<br />
<br />
I've read several suggestions here, starting out in places such as Chardok, City of Mist, etc.  I also heard some amazing things for mid 50s about Shissar Temple?  But once again, my gauge here is exp per hour and I would love to here suggestions from the Shaman gurus here.<br />
<br />
My deep thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start off in High hold keep doing nobles and bards on the second floor.  not only do you make xp, but you can kill the guards and make about 300pp an hour in fine steel and 50-55 pretty fast<br />
55-60ish you can do Nathyns guards in Katta Castellum.  they are up by the tenebrous mtns zone in.  Roam around, you should not be KoS, look for some sonic wolves standing in a courtyard, there is nathyns.  You can do other guards, lots of people do the bank, lover levels (55 ish) do the guards at the twilight sea entrance, but all of those guards drop faction with katta castellum.  eventually you end up KoS with the whole zone, no fun.  I'm max KoS to nathyns guards, and that is bad enough, because compared to the nobles in HHK, they have a HUGE (monstrously so) aggro range.<br />
<br />
At 57-58ish it's really time to start grouping..   POD and PON are going to be nice spots.  the xp is about as fast as katta solo.<br />
<br />
Others may have ideas, but using my suggestions, you can glean some key words to do your searches when looking for places to solo.<br />
<br />
These are not the end-all be-all.  There are many places to go, this is just a nice one.   Platinum cash becomes a primary concern eventually.  You need plat?  Group in sebilis.  If the cleric gives you any crap about all vendor loot going to him, let him have about ten and then say &quot;all right , damnit, enough is enough&quot;   <br />
<br />
clerics really clean up in seb, but only because people let them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow 4 weeks to get to 50, I'm jealous *drool* Took me 2.5 years lol.<br />
<br />
If you want to fly from 50-54 with no waiting in line for a camp then head directly to CoM. Start at the entrance then to the temple then move to the arena and then to the gazeebos as mobs turn to light blue. With a KEI buff and alpha dog you basically don't have any downtime and the XP rolls in. You will get multiple pulls 2-3 sometimes at 50-51ish so be ready to root park the adds.<br />
<br />
You are keeping your abjuration skill up I hope? You will want to group someday and not fizzle all your resist/talisman spells so keep up abjuration in between all that PL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">50-52 COM.  Start with the U turn, pull the Goo house too.  Remember, max casting range is your friend.  if its not camped, then summon pet to the U turn on the opposite side, and kill those.  You'll lose your pet if you just try to run through w/out summoning.  <br />
<br />
53-54 HHK.  Nobles/bards etc.  Doing all the mobs(issa/bards/nobles/3rd floor noble) i racked in a blue every 12/15 minutes.  At 54 it was about a blue every 25 or 30 minutes.  <br />
<br />
55-60 POP.  Doesnt make sense to exp anywhere else really.  Probably make 2 blues an hour or so, depending on wether your DPS is any good.  A strong guild will help you out in finding those groups of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, be careful... Like Solariis said, if you do too much &quot;screaming&quot; then your less used skills will fall behind... by alot.<br />
<br />
Divination and Abjuration - better known as the 'hell skills' - are very easy to leave behind and annoyingly tedious to raise back up (far more than any of the other schools of magic, Abj and Div spells have big cooldown times for god knows what reason)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kyninn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My Div and Abj are almost maxed atm - spent last sunday sitting PoK with C3 on casting over and over and over and over and over and over and over....I'm kind of anal about my skills being maxed hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyways, appreciate the advice everyone.  I'm actually going to try and avoid HHK because I generally dont like loosing faction in places I may need it to be good.  Is it possible to increase HHK faction after you've horribly ruined it? hehe....<br />
<br />
Update: I'm half way to 52 now - CoM is awesome exp for me atm.  At first I thought it was slow, then I realized I was just a n00b to the zone and had to learn the hunt.  Now I'm hunting the center - the two houses and the gyrating goo temple areas.  Earning about a yellow bub per hour.  I would like to keep this rate as long as possible haha.<br />
<br />
Oh and one thing - anyone have advice or links to detailed info on AAs and their advancement?  I'm not looking for information on specific AA skills, I'm just trying to figure out at what level, where, and how people suggest spending time on AAs.  I've heard people wait till lvl 60 to stock up on AAs...why?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anymore advice is greatly welcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman lvl 60 spells &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  AA points.  If you do a lot of dungeon crawling, Run 3 might be worth it but other than that, get to 60, get Malo and Topor and *then* worry about AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kyn, go do all of your epic stuff that requires FreePort(takes like 10 min - not counting waiting for that fugging boat), then go to HHK.<br />
<br />
Dont want to inconveniance yourself any more then you have too :D  Old world faction is useless, other then for the small smidgeon of epic which takes place in FP for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyninn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya actually I hear you.  In the end, I care about levels and not some faction hit for which I wont care about.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of Shaman Epic, I've been reading and assembling necessary maps etc to start it this weekend.  So hopefully I can get the Freeport done.<br />
<br />
Well I gave up on CoM- I dunno what it was about that place but I just couldnt seem to pull decent exp per hour there even though most mobs gave 1% exp at my level 51.  Just pulling slow and lots of caution involved with pulls makes it really slow.<br />
<br />
Also, one of the times I went, I grabbed a C3 from a friendly enchanter and she asked where I was headed.  Told her CoM, and she said that place was horrible for exp.  She told me to go to the Planes and I asked which plane, she replied..&quot;any&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Anyways I've got no clue where to start looking if I were to hunt the planes... any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I think I'll retract my inhibition to hunt at HHK, I am however not looking forward to griefing campers...tis the Catch 22 I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, forget about the faction and go to HHK.  I asked a friend about where I should go to get out of 51 (seems that Ive been stuck there for weeks) and she said HHK.  I went there with one yellow left in 51.<br />
<br />
After killing the 2 nobles and bard twice each (seems like it was about 15 or 20 minutes) and Ive got about 1.5 blues left in 51.  <br />
<br />
Fastest exp Ive seen since my alts played in Paladual caverns.<br />
<br />
I also made about 40 plat.  Not great cash, but not bad for 20 minutes.  Havent sold the FS from guards yet, so the total is actually higher.  <br />
<br />
Id recomend Incapacitatiing after you slow.  My AC isnt stellar (only about 870 with buffs) and the nobles were smaking me for mid 70's up to 116.  It got to hurting after awhile.   A quick debuff later and they were swatting like kittens. ( no offence to any cat shaman out there :)  )<br />
<br />
Camped there, and cant wait to get back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Didnt you say you made a yellow an hour in COM?  I dont see how that is horrible, in any sense.<br />
<br />
Before POP, the average exp rate of a solo shaman in his/her 50's was around 1 blue an hour.  HHK was the exception, i made almost a yellow an hour there at level 53.  In any case, 1 yellow an hour is great.<br />
<br />
As for HHK<br />
Issabella: 5min spawn time<br />
Bards: 15 min spawn time<br />
Nobles: 6 min - 3rd floor noble is also on a 6 min, but splits his spawn with a green gnome.<br />
<br />
HHK is better exp then COM - just harder to single pull, and probably the planes for you.  Mobs in the planes hit HARD, and resist me at 55 a fair amount.  HHK was better exp then i get now(in PON/POD) anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A good alternative to HHK is the gnoll caves in Jaggedpine.  Do a search on this board and you will find more info about this, but in my experience HHK was always camped and not always by the nicest of people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xani Crimsonheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Minor correction...<br />
<br />
Bards are exactly a 19 minute spawn.<br />
<br />
HHK is amazing by the way.  Get your epic and the only thing you'll spend mana on is slow.  I switched from reg to AA xp here at 55 to get a few under my belt.  I kinda wish I had stayed there longer.  I could do over 20% per hour AA.  The cash was decent too.<br />
<br />
Just watch out for level 30ish Druids that exploit the wall bug.  I would always petition/report them so I could get the camp ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There are plenty of places on Luclin to solo. Try scarlet desert on the plateau, mons letilis at thought leeches. or the grey but mons letilis zone line. I have always found these places good. KC also hasnt been bad for me either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The big problem with HHK is that the nobles are the ones that give exp.  There are only 3 of them and 1 of them alternates with a green wizzy that does more damage and give no exp.<br />
<br />
I did 1-61 in 7 weeks.  I tried the HHK and it sped me through level 51 and I tollerated it at 52.  Being an ogre and having the 15% exp hit I would get 1% from each noble and 1/3% from isabell and the bards.<br />
<br />
With the nobles being on a 6 min spawn and the bards being on a 20 min spawn it works out to roughly 8% of exp every 20 - 25 mins with med time.  <br />
<br />
Now that has 1 big assumption.  That you can actually get the camp which is permenatly camped on my servers.<br />
<br />
At 52 I went to pon and didnt leave till 60 a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
PON is a lot like DL and groups very a lot there.  Mostly I grouped with a chanter and bard and the exp flew by at the rate of over 1 yellow an hour until 58 then it slowed down some.  At 59 I got 10% an hour.<br />
<br />
I also did some soloing around 56 in PoI on the rats senties and guards.  The exp was pretty good just make sure you pull to near zone out so you dont get adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;53-54 HHK. Nobles/bards etc. Doing all the mobs(issa/bards/nobles/3rd floor noble) i racked in a blue every 12/15 minutes. At 54 it was about a blue every 25 or 30 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
My xp rate in 55 and 56 was just about the same as it was 53-54 (sickeningly fast...)<br />
<br />
It slowed slightly at 57, but 58 they started greening :(<br />
<br />
This was LONG before planes of power though so I dont know how the xp would be there in the mid-upper 50's.  Wouldnt it be hard to get a group in the planes as a mid 50's shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
Shaman are sought after in Tier 1 on E. Marr at least in my experience. I would think a moderately equipped mid-50's shaman w/ decent skills would have little trouble finding a group.<br />
<br />
I don't know for sure, because I was already upper 50's when PoP came out, and hit 60 soon after.<br />
<br />
I would say for your guide, level in CoM to 52, then seek out Tier 1 PoP groups.<br />
<br />
The only downside to the low-mid 50's shaman LFG in Tier 1 is that shaman as a class have a hard time overall getting flagged PoV/PoS, which means there might be competition for those groups with other shaman of greater level/AA than you have in PoP.<br />
<br />
Shaman in good guilds will get flagged, but those seeking pick-up Executioner Trial groups are having a hard time from everything I've heard.  I know I was pretty much carried through my flag, despite the fact I did everything possible (DS potions for everyone, Torrented like crazy, slowed boss mob, assist healed) to make me a valuable member of the team.  I still think they would have won without me.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If I were mid 50s Shaman looking to group, I would head to the Umbral Plains. People still exp there, and while its not on par with PoP exp, what is? <br />
<br />
Being 50-55 will make it a little difficult to find groups in PoP, but not in the Umbral Plains since it seems like alot of folks have forgotten about this zone since PoP's release. Its one of those zones where you need a slower, so you should have a relatively easy time finding a group.<br />
<br />
Also, soloing in Chardok gained me about half a yellow per C3 at 56-57, and I *think* you can single pull at 56.</div></div><hr />

Sub-50s in nexus paying for Kei/Ageo/Focus.... Hmm, what was life like BEFORE all that...<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just a bad week.. but it sure seems like alot of people screaming through 40s and 50s and don't have a clue how to play their class... don't have alot of experience other than their &quot;typical&quot; role in xp grinding... <br />
<br />
What happened to shammies that know how to solo, know how to pull, know how to manage adds, know how to control their pet, know how to cani, and know how to manage agro?  Heh, that don't mem gate and worked it too the very end??<br />
<br />
Seems to be a slowly dying art form... :/  Possibly the same source of peeps that say shamans are so nerfed?<br />

Though if you know where to find the PoNightmare, PoDisease and PoInnovation, you can go wait at the zone-ins of those zones. I've never waited more than 15 minutes to get a group. Now, waiting for said group to locate a qualified Cleric is another thing.</div></div><hr />
