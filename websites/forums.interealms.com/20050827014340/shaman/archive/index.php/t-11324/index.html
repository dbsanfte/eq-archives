<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">gann.  they switched the accept/decline buttons on the login EULA screen.  I just quit out twice before I noticed.<br />
<br />
Why can't they leave well enough alone &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
*edit*  After patching another time and going through it, it appears to be random.  I've had it show up on both sides twice now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">TAB then ENTER always gets you through that screen no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's only moved for the first time you logged in. Most likely because they changed the eula and want you to actually read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tab enter u say ... i didnt know that<br />
<br />
<br />
u know that pissed me off every time why cant they just make the accept button set focus first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tab then enter, thanks!  Yet another thing Verants doing to piss me off lately :P<br />
It's good to have a work around</div></div><hr />

Because then people could claim they didn't see the screen because they hit ENTER at the wrong time.  You have to actually click on an &quot;I Agree&quot; button to enter Everquest.<br />
<br />
They should not allow TAB ENTER to work either, if their lawyers knew they'd probably tell them to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They changed it. The changed text is as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
By clicking accept you agree to allow us to use your first born as a sacrifice to cazic-thule in hopes our new expansion wont crash the game servers</div></div><hr />

I dont buy that for a second, by entering the game you claim responsibility for pressing I accpept either by enter or tab enter or any **** like that.<br />
<br />
But you are right ... I mean if a burglar gets into your house and hurts himself he sues u and wins .. thats how it works in the good ol' us of a.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, if an EULA should have any validity at all, it should show a clear warning whenever the EULA changes. I mean, who it the world read the EULA each time you log in? <br />
The real point is, in case of a conflict between SOE and a customer over the EULA, one of the first questions asked will be: Was the EULA readily available to the customer?  SOE makes it (annoyingly) available for that reason.<br />
<br />
The fact that you have to &quot;accept&quot; it everytime you play is the result of the litigous society America has become.  It's SOE's way of saying &quot;Ball's in YOUR court now, Mr. Acceptor - our way or the highway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thay been doing the &quot;reversed button&quot; this way since before Kunark came out - catches my attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree.  I think the lawyers should do something about this.  I mean.  I think the box should move away from the mouse cursor when you try to click it.  That way you really really have to want to click the darn thing.</div></div><hr />
