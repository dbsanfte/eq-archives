<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 62 now and have a primal 2hb and am wondering if I should purchase VotB for 5k. I don't see it for sale much in bazaar. Is it worth it or should i just keep switching in my 2hb to proc avatar? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its not worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Ceno. Not going to buy it. ttyl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends on your definition of worth it. <br />
Id rather have  18 min buff that maxes everything out then have to swap weapons to make avatar proc. But i think the real issue is that if 5k is alot to you , then no its not worth it, but if 5k isnt that big a deal then i say go for it. Heck if for nothing else itll be one less spell you need to complete your spell book ( if that matters to you )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Had this drop from Sont a while back, scribed and cast it, went 'ooohh!' a few times, moved to back of book ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As Litgruv said if 5k isn't a large chunk of your cash then go for it.  It sounds like since you are always pulling out your 2hb to proc avatar that you'd use the spell so I'd say go for it.  I bought it for 4k just to be closer to a full spell book but I use it on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think I cast it about 10 times total in my shaman career, the refresh/silence on it is too clunky and spell slots are at a premium, if you're a commited soloer perhaps its useful, wasnt to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't have a primal (/whimper) -- but you're balancing 35AC and likely maxed str/dex/agi against maxed str/sta/agi and +100 atk.<br />
<br />
Wanna get hit slightly less, or hit slightly better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Back in the day it was a good spell to get over that 1000ac hump, now I never use it at all.<br />
I stopped using it the day Primal Essence went live. I'd rather have the always on stats from that on a regular basis. Stamina is more important then any of those other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use VotB when it gets me over an AC 100 mark but if not I mostly just click the hammer for Primal Essance.  Another consideration is the that I never stop casting anymore and don't have 30 seconds to waste waiting for my icons to go live again.  I spend about 90% of my solo time casting and the other 10% pulling and I just never seam to have the time for VotB.<br />
<br />
VotB is very nice for caping str for smithing thow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does the JBB work during the 30 second period that the spell gems are greyed out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have VotB i love it great spell i payed 3k yes it has a downtime of 30 sec but the buffs are worth it. Yes you can cast any click item when your spells are locked out. VotB is in my reg self buffs and i dont see it changing anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I believe this has already been said by yes any time a spell locks out your Icons you can still use the clicky items.  Just be warned after the first click you icons will appear to refresh but in reality they are still disabled server side.  So when you try to cast a spell normal before the timer finishes then you will just get a message stating your spell refresh time has not been met yet.</div></div><hr />
