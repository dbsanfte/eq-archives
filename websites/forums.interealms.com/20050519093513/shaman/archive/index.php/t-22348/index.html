<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the necro mana dot line will not come over to shaman, but what about a large hp to mana dot that lasts maybe 24 or 48 seconds and is self only? The reuse could be something like a minute or even 5 mins ( make it an aa ) and the spell could even snare us like original torpor and have a upgrade in oow that is no snare, something like as we develope a focused mind, our body's reaction begins to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice idea, Banana, but I think the last thing SOE is going to do is to give Shamans better mana regen than they do now. Any Shaman mana regen ability that stacks with Canni would be considered unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that's a great idea, of course, with canni 2, I use something similar for regening mana after buffing or a painful string of slow resists. I simply made a hotkey to pulse canni 2 five times in a row, then I heal myself and hit the hotkey again.  Of course in battle it sucks because you are committed for like 20 seconds or so, but very useful rather than click it, wait for reset and click it again.  I know it's not the same thing you're thinking of, but I would love to use a skill/spell like you suggest over mine. Leach and go...  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well they did said they want to make something so that we don't have to click canni as much... Wouldn't this be a perfect thing to replace canni? I think its an amazing idea! Just make it the same hp/mana ratio as the canni's but have it as if you were casting canni# 5-6 times in a row with just one cast over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just giving us Lich would work fine.<br />
<br />
And in all honesty? All the mana in the world does no good is all you do with it is BotJob. &quot;Buff plz&quot;, &quot;Slow this&quot; &quot;buff plz&quot; &quot;hast plaeze&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even if it was short duration, still, can you imagine how mad the necros would be?<br />
<br />
They'd have to give THEM a castable one time conversion comparable to cannibalize or they'd be playing favorites in players' eyes.<br />
<br />
Also, if it lasts a short time, and SNARED me, I would never memorize it.  I would just use cannibalize.  Also, if it's short duration, you still have to cast it over and over and over.  And then there's the stacking with KEI issue.  <br />
<br />
All I want is a canni that has a large conversion and a fast casting time that I can cast a few times a minute, and ISN'T an ancient spell!  And I'd like to not have to shell out 30 bucks for omens just to alleviate the soreness in my canni IV finger (As in the OMENS canni that is EXACTLY the same, at least ATM on lucy, as the ancient one, only a couple levels higher and only attainable by those who spend teh $$$ on Omens).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm lucky to have the ancient canni. It does exectly what you what: Less canni clicking. Even the 18sec recast time is fine. <br />
<br />
And I can tell you canni4 + ancient canni + canni5 is awesome mana regen (only use canni4 and ancient canni together after rezz). Now another form of self mana regen and will will get a 1.2kDD in OoW . but we have to burn 2k mana for it because we have such an good mana regen!<br />
<br />
I know ancient canni is OOR for most shamans. I would be more then happy if this spell would be aviable for most shamans. But when you ask for new spells / skills you have to include all spells to keep somekind of balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're aware that the lich line, in addition to being passive. also has a better HP to mana ratio than Cannibalize (not by a huge margin, but every bit counts). I'm sure you're aware that unlike Shaman, necros have the ability to turn their very hefty mana regen into very hefty damage?<br />
<br />
Frankly, necros complaining about Shaman mana regen is kinda like Rogues complaining about us wearing chain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we have canni...we're more than ok. i'm only out of mana immediately after a rez. <br />
<br />
period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like a Cann version that let me eat my HP's but transfer the mana I would normally get to my target.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of us run out because we are casting other spells besides canni.<br />
<br />
Why don't people get that?  When you are spamming cannIV you could be doing something else instead.  Something more useful.  Like healing or something.<br />
<br />
I can run out of mana in a LDON, especially if I'm the one pulling.  Yes, I could stand there and spam canniIV, but then I am not doing anything &quot;usefull&quot;.  You might say, &quot;Why do you call getting mana back not usefull?&quot;  Then I would say, its not usefull for the group.  It isn't making things die faster or keeping your group buffed and healed.  Yes its helpful to have canni to cut down on the downtime, but when theres action, if you are spamming canni, you are not helping the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ratio doesn't bother me, because I can get all that health back very easily with Quiescence, heck, even moreso now that it is upgraded.  How about a lich spell that gives 5 mana for 1 hp per tick?  Stellar ratio, but worthless because i need the mana NOW.  I just don't want to have to cast the canni 100 frikkin times and not be able to move or do anything and then have that annoying 2.5 second wait afterwards to cast something else.<br />
<br />
I want ancient canni, waaaah!<br />
<br />
But you are right about them turning their mana into better damage.  That's a different subject though... like I've said before, you could give me infinite mana, I still won't do much with a Tnarg's Chain or one and a half Velium Strikes chain casted before the mob dies to insane dps from other group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">doesnt lich still not stack with enchanter mana regen (kei/voq)? I know at one point they didnt stack, and if they still dont that really hurts their regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lich has never stacked with the Clarity line, it does however stack with Gift of Brilliance(most non-necromancers don't know this), a Kunark spell which gives 2 mana/tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The canni-over-time idea has come up before. It's a good concept, but the design of the new Ancient: Chaotic Pain spell is more or less equivalent. It's not exactly the same, but it overcomes the basic problem of having to spend a ton of time chaincasting Cann4. The problem with Chaotic Pain is one of availability - which could be easily solved if the devs would use their heads every once in a while. These days, using Cann4 to get back mana is like trying to fill a swimming pool with an eyedropper. One of the Omens canni spells isn't ancient, so eventually maybe we can all get our hands on it.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about my mana regen in OoW. I'm worried about having something worthwhile to do with my mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">By the look of the new spell line up on AoW, the spell Pained Memory ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5403&amp;source=Live') (SHM/68) is identical to Ancient:Chaotic Pain ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4979&amp;source=Live') (SHM/65) but is not ancient, hopefully meaning it will more readily available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All I want is a canni that has a large conversion and a fast casting time that I can cast a few times a minute, and ISN'T an ancient spell!

<br />
I'd rather pay 30 bucks than spend 3 months praying for it. The new canni being ancient was one of the main reasons I didn't buy GoD right away, and one of the main reasons I still haven't bought it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, but this is a problem they should have fixed without requiring an expansion... I mean, it kind of sucks that they make a great spell that addresses something ALL shaman (casual and 5/night raid guilded alike) have been complaining about, made it an ANCIENT, and then said, hey, we'll make a non ancient one, and stick it in Omens.  Seems sorta suspicious to me... <br />
<br />
If they do as they mentioned at the summit and decrease the frequency that all canni's must be casted by giving them recast times and larger conversions, I will be happy.  I don't need a 600 plus HP conversion.  I'd be happy if they just doubled the conversion of Canni IV, bringing it to about 300 hp for 160 mana, and putting a recast timer on it that would grey it out for the length of time it would have taken to recast under the old conversion size.  <br />
<br />
It wouldn't be UBER fantastic, but hey, if I wanted uber fantastic, I could strive day and night for the ancient or buy Omens.  This is something that was listed as mentioned by devs at the Summit by Gloriana.  Apparantly the only thing holding it back is them working on the code to link certain spells' recast timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">lol, I love how they need recast timers. I don't see why they don't have em already in place to keep me from ubber generating mana with BOTH canni 3 and 4! =)<br />
<br />
I guess I just think OoW will be worth more to me than GoD. Of course GoD &lt; Rytan's used toothpick right now to me. This is a pre-elemental shaman's viewpoint though. /shrug</div></div><hr />
