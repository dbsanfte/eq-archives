<br />
18 people dead, mostly teachers from early reports.<br />
<br />
Even though it doesn't hit close to home, it's still sad to see these things happen.<br />
<br />
Just something to brood on over the weekend.</div></div><hr />

Germany has some of the tightest gun laws in the world and yet they continue to struggle with crime and even have extremely bad incidents like this.<br />

Feel sorry for the teachers and students but perhaps if a teacher had been armed the body count wouldn't be so high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a headline page about that this morning. My heart goes out to the families of the victims. ;(<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I am against arming teachers. Here are just a few of the reasons why:<br />
<br />
1) Some teachers can't handle the responsibility. My fiancee has a professor who only shows up half of the time and even when he does, he lets his ten-year-old son teach the class sometimes. A ten-year-old. Trying to teach a college class. There's nuts everywhere.<br />
2) Dealing with a group of unruly children who out number you 30-1 is highly stressful. The chances of the teacher snapping and using the firearm are significant enough to ensure that somewhere, some day, it would happen.<br />
3) Teachers often have to spend time during classes correcting papers or working on lesson plans while the students study, watch a movie, or read. All it takes is one student who can move quietly while the teacher is engrosed in what they are doing to get the gun away and start firing.<br />
4) Teachers in many places now have the ability to put a normal, healthy child on drugs such as Ritalin and Prozak, and do so way more often than they should. They've already shown as a group that they can and will abuse any power given to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, the tighter gun laws generally cause more problems. I've noticed that when tighter restrictions are put on any kinds or products it just increases the want for such products. When the more strict laws are laid down, people will do more outlandish things to obtain these products.<br />
<br />
I do think that there should be some sort of system for teachers to protect them selves from student situations such as these. Whether be arming them or training drills for schools, there should be some type of security implemented. <br />
<br />
I know that when I was in high school we had 2 full time officers that would patrol in inside and around the school area looking for anything suspicious going on. <br />
<br />
Of course a couple of the teachers in my school had some extensive self defense training and that did help keep the student in their classes in line pretty well. :D</div></div><hr />

When I was in high school, the only suspicious things going on around school were kids making out in a quiet, out of the way portion of the building. Yeah, there was some minor marijuana (sp?) dealing going on, but that was about it. That was only 13 years ago. My, how times have changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to have you think good of me Tel, but you're spot on here. ;) <br />
<br />
Gun prohibition != less crime.  The notion that guns cause crime is akin to Bic lighters being a cause for arson.  Making gun laws stiffer is only going to make decent, law abiding citizens an easier target for crime.<br />
<br />
This, like any incident of this type is unfortunate.  Incidents like this cannot be prevented, at least not until there is a marked shift in the attitudes and beliefs of mankind as a whole - and I don't see that happening anytime soon.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the gun-prohibitionist line of thought on the matter.  I disagree with it wholeheartedly though.  These issues though have been around since man has recorded his history.<br />
<br />
I think one of the best ways I've heard it put is from Cesare Beccaria's &quot;On Crime and Punishments&quot; from 1764 (commenting on laws prohibiting ownership of weapons):<br />
<br />
&quot;The laws of this nature are those which forbid to wear arms, disarming those only who are not disposed to commit the crime which the laws mean to prevent. Can it be supposed, that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, and the most important of the code, will respect the less considerable and arbitrary injunctions, the violation of which is so easy, and of so little comparative importance? Does not the execution of this law deprive the subject of that personal liberty, so dear to mankind and to the wise legislator? and does it not subject the innocent to all the disagreeable circumstances that should only fall on the guilty? It certainly makes the situation of the assaulted worse, and of the assailants better, and rather encourages than prevents murder, as it requires less courage to attack unarmed than armed persons.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Gun laws only affect those who abide by the law to begin with.  They only make the rest of us easier targets for criminals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just lisenting to a story about this on NPR. They said that there are 10 million registered guns in Germany, and officials estimate about 20 million unregistered guns. That's with a population of 82 million -- one gun to every 2.7 people.<br />
<br />
In the United States, I've read that there are 235 million guns (I am assuming this is a total of legal and illegal), with a population of 273 million -- one gun to every 1.1 people.<br />
<br />
I like the Exile program. Rather than making guns illegal, it mandates a 5-year sentence in federal prison for any crime committed using a gun. There has been statistical and anectodal evidence that those committing a crime will deliberately avoid using a gun in order to avoid an Exile penalty.</div></div><hr />

True. It takes real determination to kill 18 people with a knife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saldrin Pathwarden</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, there are already laws to that effect in most states and most municipalities - mandatory X number of years jailtime for crimes involving firearms.<br />
<br />
Sadly though, these charges are usually among the first to be plea-bargained away in court, and are never applied.  Gun rights activists have maintained all along that NEW restrictions on gun ownership aren't the answer - but enforcement of the over 22,000 Federal, State and Local gun laws nationwide would be more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the pro-gun argument and I wholeheartedly disagree.<br />
<br />
The problem with arguing with gun enthusiasts is that whenever I try to compare American society (lots of guns, lots of gun deaths) to European countries (heavy gun control, much less violent crime) I'm always told that you can't legitimately compare two different cultures.<br />
<br />
Mr. Beccaria lived in a society that today we would call lawless.  He only had experience with very innaccurate guns with a slow rate of fire.  The level of training between your average citizen and the professional soldier was fairly small.  He had never seen a democracy that worked.  A community police force was almost unheard of.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
Hardly seems relevant today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been beaten to death here but you can look at several European nations which have extremely strict gun control measures and the crime there is attrocious.<br />
<br />
Also just to note the way track crime often counts the same crimes multiple times if there were multiple infractions during the same event.<br />
<br />
Other countries tend to count a crime once and classify the event under one crime type which is how they artificially keep their numbers lower than what is compared to in the US.<br />
<br />
Furthermore psychological tests conducted on criminals in prison both in the US and in other countries back up the claim that gun ownership = crime detterant and lack of gun ownership = crime magnet.<br />
<br />
Most criminals surveyed stated that if they know the owner of a home or business owns a gun they will avoid the place and find an easier target.<br />
<br />
Rapists have stated that if a target it carrying or might be carrying a gun or other weapon such as a stick club or knife(not mace as most rapists laughed at mace usage) they would pass them over for easier more vulnerable targets.<br />
<br />
Furthermore comparisons in our country have found that cities and states with lesser gun controls tend to enjoy lower crime rates.<br />
<br />
Washington DC and Phoenix AZ were perfect examples of cities nearly identical in population and size but with differing gun laws and their related crime rates.<br />
<br />
Furthermore Germany continues to have MASSIVE gun problems from illegal guns entering the country including what looks like renegade guns so I don't see how banning guns prevents this type of thing at all.<br />
<br />
To bring up an old statement... Knives are useful tools or dangerous weapons.  The knife itself doesn't decide how its used but the wielder does.<br />
<br />
Guns are the same exact thing.  Guns can be useful tools for home protection(without a shot ever being fired sometimes... i.e. the sound most criminals reported hating to hear during a heist was the sound of a shotgun ****ing) and sporting events like hunting and target competitions (I need to go buy a pistol sometime and get into that as I enjoyed that when I shot with my father).  Or they can be used as weapons both for good and ill purposes again in home/personal defense or in murders robberies and other criminal activity.<br />
<br />
I've already stated in another post that had we had a well armed society I would not have been able to commit much of the criminal mischief I did when I was younger and probably would've been shot and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
And yet here I am a one time legitimate target telling people you could've stopped me had you been armed.<br />
<br />
More over you have a Police man on this board saying a similar thing.<br />
<br />
Something to chew on and I and Saldrin are not alone in these decisions and there is a lot of evidence backing this point.<br />
<br />
More over the final use of guns is to keep the government in check.  The government is getting more and more aggressive in the pass few years both unde republican and democratic rule about taking away our liberties.<br />
<br />
While I don't suggest it now as I think there is still hope to reverse this process there may come a time when the people have no choice but to resist using armed force much like the Revolutionaries did the late 1700s.<br />
<br />
If a society is unarmed its easy to control.  Look at any unarmed society in history and the examples are there.<br />
<br />
The Romans disallowed conquered tribute states from forming armies or letting the general citizenry bear swords.<br />
<br />
The Nazi's collected up weapons all across Germany before making their more brash and evil moves.<br />
<br />
The British tried to collect the muskets and pistols of the colonials knowing full well that would help to stop them (they failed of course which is why we are here).<br />
<br />
There is a reason the 1st amendment is 1st.  Freedom of ideals and speech is critical in running the government for the people.<br />
<br />
There is also a reason the 2nd amendment is second.  An armed citizenry is sometimes required to make sure the government is paying attention to the 1st ammendment.<br />
<br />
P.S. I have no personal beef with you Saldrin and in fact am going to bet that you and I end up on the same side of most issues judging from my initial impression of you.  More over I think the whole cop thing is partially misunderstanding and partially pig-headedness on both our parts.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to call truce, shake hands, drink a beer,  and drown hot running emotions if you are.<br />
<br />
And in reply to your other suggestion I have/am seriously entertaining the thought of about joining either the local police department in the computer crimes division or the FBI in their computer division.  <br />
<br />
I'm one of the few geeks who can play a computer like a piano and then turn around and interact with normal people with no difficulty and I can breech the line of computers and people and explain to programmers what normal people want and explain to normal people what programmers are doing.  So when it comes to explaining to lawyers and jurors whats going on I think I've got a decent shot at succeeding.  <br />
<br />
Just got to handle this college debt and get a house purchase underway and then look at handling the lower pay that is unfortunately a part of government jobs :(</div></div><hr />

I agree that guns can be a crime deterrent, but if we have strict enough controls, the criminals won't have guns either and the playing field will be level.  And the crime's that do occur will be a whole lot less lethal.<br />

<br />
It may not have an immediate effect, but over the long term, a gun ban will greatly reduce the number of guns available to criminals. <br />
<br />
you couldn't be more wrong.  Germany is a great case in point.  There are more guns in criminal hands today than there have been in any part of german history (Nazi's aside as they are not the type of criminal we are talking about here) and Germany has had strict gun control since the time of the Kaiser.<br />
<br />
Germany and other countries like it are a big gaping maw of a hole in your Argument Kullaas.<br />
<br />
Also Kullaas how hard do you think it is to make an UZI or other similar submachine gun?<br />
<br />
Try a few industrial springs bought at your local hardware store a few pieces of industrial grade metal also bought at your local hardware store and a machine shop (which most major cities have several hundred of) and you can now produce submachine guns of solid quality.<br />
<br />
LA and Houston both have a problem with the above type of weapons entering the criminal economy.<br />

Can you give me examples?  I don't know of any countries with effective gun control and higher crime rates than the US, although I could be ignorant.<br />
<br />
There is also a reason the 2nd amendment is second. An armed citizenry is sometimes required to make sure the government is paying attention to the 1st ammendment.<br />
If this is the reason we allow guns, shouldn't we allow rocket guns and tanks?  After all, if the US government tried a hostile takeover we'd need them to fight the army.</div></div><hr />

After the wall went down and the russian forces withdrew from the eastern part of Germany in 1990, it was ridiculously easy to purchase illegal firearms, at least for a time.

<br />
Beccaria lived in a very orderly 18th century society.  We're talking about the period of the Enlightenment here - not some prehistoric anarchical society.<br />
<br />
Would you also say that the 1st Amendment no longer really matters because they didn't have mass media communications when it was written? (Written less than 20 years after Beccaria's statements here were).  I don't think you would.   The Bill of Rights has just as much application today as it did over 200 years ago - ALL of it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with comparing international crime statistics with ours is that 1) it is difficult to compare the crime rates in smaller countries with a more homogenous population to a large nation with a population as diverse as ours - each situation creates a different set of problems and,  2) most the time these comparisons fail to include countries with strict gun control policies where the violent crime rates are higher than the US (Mexico comes to mind).  They also don't include comparisons of how &quot;free&quot; (from a civil rights perspective) the people are in many countries where there are strict gun control laws, or how often and to what degree the people are abused by the government in those same countries.<br />
<br />
I think that pro-gunners dismiss comparisons of this type as equally as anti-gunners dismiss comparisons of US cities which indicate that the cities with strict gun control laws have higher violent crime rates.<br />
<br />
Tel - most rank and file police officers I know and have worked with are extremely pro-gun.  Police Chiefs and national level police lobbying groups (who have a vested interest in supporting the politicians they work for) rarely represent the opinons of the rank and file officer on the street.<br />

<br />
Level?  hardly.<br />
<br />
Your average criminal is often fairly strong (perhaps not the best of shape but sheer youth helps) and much more streetwise to fighting than the average citizen.<br />
<br />
And women are even more disadvantaged due to physically on average being weaker.<br />
<br />
More over the elderly who are somewhat frail or slower will simply not be able to handle a youthful criminal.<br />
<br />
Guns are the equalizer.  It now comes down to who can shoot first and while reflexes may help of which youthful criminals might have the element of surprise which a home owner knowing his home will have could balance that.<br />
<br />
Guns are what allowed the inferior number and skill of the Revolutionary Army to beat a superior force.<br />
<br />
And speaking of militias it seems to be militias which get attacked the hardest by media and the government.<br />
<br />
SECOND AMENDMENT<br />
A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free <br />
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be <br />
infringed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The way that was envisioned and is envisioned in 44 states which have laws citing the same thing indicate there are two groups present in that amendment.<br />
<br />
First there is the State itself which is allowed a state militia for the purposes of security and maintaining a free state.  Militias have been largely done away with and replaced by larger police organizations like State Troopers and National Guard.  The modernization of the culture made it so that militias were either too large/obtrusive to fulfull law enforcement duties, and too small to handle the jobs of the National Guard.<br />
<br />
Secondly there is a second group of people.  Quite simple &quot;the people&quot; and the thought on this was due to a very fresh uprising against Britain by average citizens they realized that State militias themselves could be subject to corruption by a tyrranical government.  Thus they wanted to ensure that individuals had the ability to rise and revolt should that government become oppressive.<br />

How is banning the purchase of guns through legitimate avenues going to have any affect on that?  It won't, and I think anyone who believes otherwise is fooling themselves.<br />
<br />
On another note, reading about this incident brought to mind the recent no-tolerance discussion.  My first thought on the shootings in Germany was I hope the American school system learns a serious lesson from this incident.  One of the young men involved in this shooting was expelled from school very recently.  A no-tolerance policy in which troublemakers are immediately expulsed does not fix the underlying problem.  We need to find a way to *deal* with problem-children, rather than tossing them out into the world and hoping someone else fixes them.  Ignoring problems doesn't make them go away - they just come back and bite you in the arse when you least expect it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guns in law abiding hands however might stop a criminal from committing a crime or better from killing.<br />
<br />
And sorry but if a criminal infringes on someones right to Life and Liberty and property then they've given up their claim to those same rights for the duration they are committing the crime.  To deprive someone else is to deprive yourself of the same things and thus I contend I'm fully justified in ending said criminal's rights permanantly.</div></div><hr />

Ok first of all, notice the word Milita in the second amendment, Tel.  A population armed to the teeth-- see myrea's stats- was not what the drafters intended.<br />
<br />
Kullaas, not to sound condescending - but you need to go back and take a look at your american history again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Arms in the hands of individual citizens may be used at individual discretion...in private self-defense.&quot; -John Adams:  A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That the said Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms.&quot; -Sam Adams: During Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification convention, (1788), Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts<br />
<br />
&quot;It is always dangerous to the liberties of the people to have an army stationed among them, over which they have no control ... The militia is composed of free citizens.&quot;  -Sam Adams:  Writings, III <br />
<br />
This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidible to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.&quot;  -Alexander Hamilton Federalist Papers, Article 29 January 10, 1788 <br />
<br />
&quot;Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.&quot; -Alexander Hamilton: Federalist Papers, Article 29 January 10, 1788 <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?&quot; -Patrick Henry: During Virginia's ratification convention, (1788), in The Debates of the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution at 168, Jonathan Elliot, (New York, Burt Franklin: 1888) <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary...the militia shall always be kept well organized, armed and disciplined, and include ... all men capable of bearing arms;...&quot;  -Richard Henry Lee: Additional Letters From The Federal Farmer at 169 (1788) Walter Bennett, ed., at 21,22,124 ( Univ. of Alabama Press, 1975) <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides the advantage of being armed, which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate [State] governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit to. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.&quot;  -James Madison: Federalist Papers, Article 46 January 29, 1788 <br />
<br />
I can go on with these all day if you like.<br />

Morg--I realise that.  But 98% of criminals don't really really mean it:p<br />
Saldrin, as I said before: go look at the text of the law and notice the word militia. <br />
<br />
Kullas Go look up the legal definitoin of &quot;militia&quot; currently as federal law defines it.  YOU in fact are likely a part of it.  I think my previous post states the Founding Fathers' opinions of it.<br />
<br />
I suggest you crack a history book and learn what the word meant in the context its used in in the 2nd Amendment.<br />
<br />
Then i suggest you look at this link at the current Federal definition of &quot;militia&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/311.html<br />
<br />
Sec. 311. - Militia: composition and classes <br />
<br />
<br />
(a) <br />
<br />
The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. <br />
<br />
(b) <br />
<br />
The classes of the militia are - <br />
<br />
(1) <br />
<br />
the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and <br />
<br />
(2) <br />
<br />
the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are likely, if you're over 17 - a member of the &quot;unorganized&quot; militia.<br />
<br />
Likewise each state has a &quot;militia&quot; - no, not the National Guard (which didn't exist as such until 1903).  A state militia, like the Ohio Military Reserve and the Virginia Defense Force - whose members are volunteers and are requirew to supply their own uniforms, equipment and firearms.<br />
<br />
Try again?</div></div><hr />

Ok, 2 or 3 out of the 8 are the only valid ones.  Not to mention, they were talking about arms of a whole different magnitude.  I wholey doubt that they said these when thinking about easily conceilable 9mm semi automatic pistols.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saldrin, regardless of whether the law says that we are militia or not, the vast majority of the country doesn't consider themselves members of said orginization.  Thus, they are not buying guns as part of their dutys as said militia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're all equally valid and apply directly to the issue at hand.<br />
<br />
The Founding Fathers didn't envision abortions as we practice them today.  No mention is made of them in the Bill of Rights - yet we're told women have a Constitutionally protected &quot;right&quot; to them?<br />
<br />
Just because technology exists today that didn't in the 18th century doesn't void the ideas behind the Amendments.  They couldn't possibly have dreamed of radio and television.  Does this invalidate the 1st Amendment?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that we've established both historically and legally WE are the &quot;militia&quot; - its moot to hang onto that point as a reason the &quot;People&quot; can be prohibited from owning guns.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Amendment not only has the term &quot;militia&quot; in it - but also &quot;the People&quot;.  That same language is used in the 1st and 4th and other amendments as well.  Why do you ascribe a different meaning to it in the 2nd?<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution - which provides for an Army and a Navy - thought they had to add a clause at the end of it that says they're allowed to have guns???</div></div><hr />

Our military is strong yes.  Our military is powerful yes. Our military is strong and powerful because????? it has the civilian resources of the private sector behind it.<br />

More over if the situation ever got so bad that the a Revolution or Civil War broke out there would be MASS defections of soldiers ESPECIALLY in the special forces (which are the bad dudes in fighting guerilla style wars a Civil War in this country would create).  I'd have to spend some time refinding it but I used to read a news letter heavily read by many special forces and ex-special forces people on the net that addressed this precise thing.<br />
<br />
They were sort of a watchdog on issues regarding Rights (especially the second amendment but all Rights) and there were articles in there about when would it be appropriate to break rank and become resistance fighters should the government become corrupt?<br />
<br />
Also the US is LARGE.  Its not like an Isreal or a former Yugoslavia where every square mile is either cram packed city or virtual open wasteland with no place to hide.<br />
<br />
The US is chalk full of places where small guerilla groups could operate.<br />
<br />
Its kind of old and somewhat Hollywoodified but go rent &quot;Red Dawn&quot; Patrick Swayze.  Its about a Soviet Invasion and some Highschool kids using the Rocky Mountains to conduct guerilla warfare from.  Its actually been hailed by several Green Berets and other insurgent specialists as being a half decent portrayal of what civilian forces against an organized army can accomplish.<br />
<br />
At any rate the biggest factor is our military only churns so long as its civilian population continues to produce its equipment, fuel, and provide bodies.</div></div><hr />

Also, &quot;Red Dawn&quot; is a comedy, or it should be.  There wasn't a single thing those kids did in that a well organized military unit wouldn't counter in about five seconds.  Heck, I could come up with the counters, and I'm not even a professional soldier.</div></div><hr />

Really????   All 300 something million of us??  Without the backing of the people the military would be in a world of hurt.  No supplies, food, etc....

The right to bear arms is guaranteed by the constitution.  My interpretation on it has always been that the founding fathers in their incredible wisdom, were looking forward to a time when unscrupulous men would try to seize control of the country.  They protected us by preventing these unknown villains from using the historical method the British governemnt tried to use on them, disarmament.  Once the people lose the right to protect themselves, they are willing to give up almost anything else to feel safe once again.<br />
<br />
The advances of technology do not give anyone the right to invalidate the parts of the constitution they don't like.  That alone would set one of the most dangerous precedents around.  One by one the amendments will fall because technology moves forward.  Suddenly, freedom is a historical curiosity.<br />
<br />
Kullaas, you may never have mentioned the second amendment, but you and others here were advocating violating it through the content of your posts.  The first amendment gives you the right to do that.  It also gives the rest of us the right to disagree.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else notice that Australia isn't being terribly forthcoming with making public their crime statistics since boldly seizing their citizenry's arms?  All indications are that armed robbery has increased strongly since the law abiding citizens lost the right to arm themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, &quot;Red Dawn&quot; is a comedy, or it should be.

<br />
I said up front the movie was hollywoodified however the protrayals of what a Guerilla force in the US could do  is not far off.<br />
<br />
You say you could counter what they did in 5 seconds but in 5 seconds in an ambush chances are you are already dead.<br />
<br />
Secondly the rest of the world's military's are not our military.  They are poorly trained, even the Russians compared to our soldiers.  The reason the USSR was a threat to the United States had nothing to do with the quality of their soldiers but rather the sheer number of their nuclear arsenal and their tank brigades.<br />
<br />
Up until the the early 80s the Soviets out numbered us in tanks 7 to 1 and to make matters worse we were using inferior tanks.  The doctrine up to that point was that should the Soviets invade we would sacrifice Germany for the rest of Europe.  <br />
<br />
The Soviets had to bring their armored columns down one of two routes.  Either along the coast where our naval ships would've torn em to shreds or down the main valley leading through the mountainous terrain (forget the actual name of the valley off the top of my head though for some reasons the Folded Gap stick out).  Chance are that since the Soviets did not want to deal with our naval threat they were going to go through the valley gap.  We made it perfectly clear in objection to the German people I might add that should the soviets try such a thing we would make the valley glow.<br />
<br />
We KNEW we could not beat them in a conventional war due to their superior numbers and tanks.<br />
<br />
The turning point in all that was the release of the M1A1 tanks.  During tank competitions the US had been placing around 30th each year using the old tanks.<br />
<br />
With the release of the M1A1 tanks the US took 1st 2nd and 4th (with a British tank squad taking 3rd).  Up to that point ALL tanks had to:<br />
1) stop<br />
2) aquire target<br />
3) fire<br />
4)move on.<br />
<br />
This left the tank vulnerable and an easier target to hit while firing.<br />
<br />
The M1A1s on the other hand were not only able to aquire target while firing but move while firing and already be aquiring the next target during the firing.<br />
<br />
At the competition the M1A1 squad who took first place, paced the field ahead of time (which is legal).<br />
<br />
One of the targets required navigating a ditch.  Most tanks had to drive through carefully come out the other side then aquire and fire and move on.  It often caused many tanks to lose precious seconds during the competition.<br />
<br />
At the competition the 1st place squad didn't drive through the ditch.  Instead they flew over it.  Not only that but in mid-air the tank aquired the target then fired ALL in the air and hit a perfect hit and drove on to the next target in under 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
The Russian tank squads and the commanders there congratulated the Americans and even said themselves that with this new tank it didn't matter if we out numbered you guys.  You will kill us in a full confrontation.  That coupled with other Reagan Defense initiatives brought the Soviets to their knees.<br />
<br />
Anyhow little hijack I know but the whole point to this is if invaded the American people could resist most modern armies fairly convincingly as most modern armies simply do not possess the technological or training background that our guys do and the other big reason being is that we are armed from the get go and many of our citizens are ex-soldiers themselves.<br />
<br />
In the case of us resisting our own government.  Well the Army would have mass defections.  Also WHO would the government go after?  We are all Americans and it would be very hard to pick out rebels from loyalists.  More over many Americans were themselves trained in our military so would have the same combat skills the soldiers do AND would know the tactics employed by our military which also means they would know the weaknesses.<br />
<br />
The American people have been looked at by the Soviets and other nations who have given thought to conquering us as being one of the most indomitable people on the planet and largely due to the fact that many of us are armed and many of us have military or some other form of combat/survival training (cops, coast guard, Boy scouts, etc).<br />

Then again, in this case, the killer legally owned the weapons he used. He had no trouble with the law before. He actually was a law abiding citizen - until he mentally snapped after his rejection from the exams, and went on a killing spree.<br />
<br />
I think this sort of makes it a draw... if owning weapons would be less restricted, someone in school might have been armed and able to stop him. Were it even more restricted (well, and that's what is happening now), the psycho might not have had access to firearms at all - after all, he legally owned them and probably had no connections to any criminals that could procure illegal firearms. Maybe just the fact that there were guns and ammunition available to him made this tragedy possible - not everyone has the guts to go and find criminal elements that can procure guns, and without a gun in his closet, no one would have died.<br />
<br />
Determined criminals, of course, are another matter...</div></div><hr />

U.S. = ****ty gun-control laws.<br />
England = citizens simply don't have guns.  Illegal entirely.<br />

Those are facts.  Don't say that Europe has just as much atrocious crime as the U.S.  The U.S. has more than ten times as many homocides as the majority of Europe COMBINED.<br />

Don't say that someone would just go use something else, because they wouldn't.  The easier it is to kill, the more likely someone is to do it, whether they be a &quot;law-abiding citizen&quot; or a &quot;criminal&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I'm contemplating committing suicide, I'm much more likely to carry it out if I've got a gun next to me, rather than a razor blade, or a rope.  If I'm going to kill someone, I'm much more likely to do it if I have access to a gun than if I only have access to knives and bats.  As would anyone else.<br />
<br />
A knife isn't going to accidently go off in someone's chest.  No one is going to go on a killing spree through a school with a knife.<br />

We already have a senseless war on drugs going on, which is overcrowding our prisons to the point where our judicial system can't even punish people properly anymore.

Yes, people use the &quot;guns are only there to hurt people&quot; argument. But that is SO not true. I have a lot of friends who own guns. They are law abiding, regular, nice, cool citizens, just like you or me. They own that gun to PROTECT themselves. <br />
<br />
I have 1 friend in particular who lives in a VERY nasty area of New Orleans. In the area he lives in, sooner or later, he is going to be confronted with a gun. Period. The area is that bad. Most of these criminals are cowards. Pull your own gun, and they will probably run. If you don't.....well, god knows what could happen.</div></div><hr />

Show me a tranq gun that has the same accuracy, firing speed, and range of a real gun, and you are talking. Otherwise, there is no point.<br />
<br />
Most &quot;tazer guns&quot; and &quot;tranq guns&quot; SUCK. Accuracy for ****, terrible reloading speed, ect, ect. If I had your average tranq gun, and somone confronted me with a real gun, I would run, rather than risk getting shot trying to shoot somone with a silly tranq gun lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of that statistic is to show the irony of their reasoning to people that use protection as an excuse to keep a gun in the household.  You keep it to protect yourself from intruders, but you're more likely to lose a member of your family because of it's presense.  That is basically what's happening in the United States, similarly.<br />
<br />
Let's just imagine if EVERYONE had a gun in their pocket.  Yeah, I'd probably feel more confident that no one's gonna mess with me since they all know that I've got a gun in my pocket and can kill them with the pull of a trigger.  But I GUARANTEE we would have exponentially more shootings every year if such a situation were to arise.<br />
<br />
Gun laws in the U.S. paint a similar situation.  The fewer people that have guns in the United States, the more lives that will be saved.  Period.  <br />
<br />
People that advocate gun laws do so under the impression that only responsible people ever have access to firearms, and anyone who would ever use a firearm against another person is doing so with great premeditation.<br />
<br />
We that are &quot;anti-gun&quot; feel that the majority of the population isn't responsible enough to have access to such weapons, and we're justified in believing so by the homocide rate in the United States compared to the homocide rate in other countries.<br />
<br />
If you honestly believe that the government will take our rights away, and your only protection from that is to keep arms and make sure it doesn't happen, well, I say you're a little loopy.  But at least you have the justification of the Constitution and the Founding Fathers to back you up.<br />
<br />
Anyone that keeps firearms for protection, just look at the statistics.  Your friend in New Orleans just might be safer to have a gun in his pocket.  But for every friend of yours that actually will use a gun to protect himself from some criminal, ten other people are killed by some other idiot's who shouldn't have one.<br />
<br />
And that's my point.  Very, VERY few people in the United States are responsible enough to make sure that a gun won't be used either by them or someone else for a harmful - often lethal - purpose.<br />
<br />
And cars are not the same thing.  Guns have no other function than to hurt/kill another person (except for hunting, which is potentially an exception).<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  the idiots outweigh the responsible people in this country, and it's backed up by the homocide rate.  And when it comes to my life, and the lives of my friends and family, I would feel safer than if I had a handgun in my pocket.</div></div><hr />

I know that my friend in NO definitly is.....and I am not into the idea of stripping him of his right to own a gun and protect himself and his wife, for any reason.<br />
<br />
Then the question becomes, who is responsible, where do you draw the line? IMO, you can't draw a line, other than the lines that have already been drawn with our current gun laws.<br />
<br />
Getting a gun isn't all that easy as it is folks. My friend had to go through a LOT of **** to get his gun, his permit, and his Conceal and Carry license. To leagally walk down the street with a gun strapped under your coat is DAMN hard, it takes a lot of effort. Most people with a gun on them in public are ALREADY breaking the law....so why create more laws? So that it is &quot;Double secret illegal&quot;? :D<br />
<br />
All my point is is that, my friends situation is a pefect example of what would happen if guns were totally outlawed. he would give up his gun, but all the hoods that live in his area wouldn't...I mean, they are already breaking the law carrying, another law ain't gonna phase them. So, in effect. he just loses the ability to protect himself, without gaining any other protection. And that sucks.</div></div><hr />

There's a quote from an article I read over this shooting and a German student said, &quot;we thought this kind of thing only happened in America.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact that criminals would have more access to guns than average citizens is a problem that would have to be addressed quite a bit before any gun legislation could take place.  It would be interesting to see what happens in Australia with their current policies.<br />
<br />
It's a long-term process though, either way.  I think that if the United States ever takes such a step will probably depend in a large part to the success of the legislation in Australia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. The only reason I am in opposition to stronger gun control is that people need the ability to protect themselves. To be honest, I think the focus of Americas gun problems should be on the criminal gun elements, not on the law abiding gun purchasing population.</div></div><hr />

Not really. Most guns, illegal and legal, to be found in the US, are not manufactured here. Most illegal guns to be found here are smuggled into the US. Banning guns in the US would have to be secondary to a crackdown on gun smuggling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that is being completely overlooked is what effect gun ownership has had on the government.<br />
<br />
Lets look at Europe and its century long strict gun laws.  So far we have had Mussolini, Hitler, Franco, Lenin(and the cascading Soviet leaders), Milosevic, and many other tyranical dictatorial egomaniacs come to power.<br />
<br />
In another thread I stated I'm laughing at the French right now.  They are stuck choosing between a swindler (Chirac) and a Racist(Le Pen).<br />
<br />
Europe LOVES to flambast American democracy as being primitive and unsofisticated.  They say we have such problems with corruption, arrogance, and racism.<br />
<br />
Yet lets look at Europe.  There have been more racists, murdering leaders in various European &quot;democracies&quot; than in the US EVER.<br />
<br />
Tie this fact that the murdering leaders were able to do so because the people could never resist due to being disarmed and what were the minority of the day supposed to do?  They went to gas chambers.  They were executed by the millions in the White Russian plains.  They were raped and slaughtered in Yugoslavian hillsides.<br />
<br />
Gun are the ultimate guarantee against a Tyranical government.  They are also the ultimate guarantee against a Tyranical majority.  Ever heard of mob rule?<br />
<br />
Our forefathers wanted to specifically avoid mob rule and they placed several measures to stop it.<br />
<br />
First was by making us NOT a democracy... we are a republic.<br />
<br />
Second was that EVERYONE has freedom to speak and believe as they will.<br />
<br />
Thirdly if a majority were to try to enforce its will in violation of the minorities rights the minority would be armed and able to defend itself.  Now due to numbers they may lose but how many of the majority would also be killed.  The Forefathers were counting on the fact that the tyranical majority would favor their skins over their decision as most Tyrants tend to do.<br />
<br />
A Pyrric victory then would do the majority no good.<br />
<br />
Both Australia and Britain have seen a rise in crime in recent years as they have gotten stricter and stricter gun laws.<br />
<br />
Germany has had many gun related problems as well and while the German people are stunned by the school incident they shouldn't be if they had any clue as to how many illegal guns are in their lands.<br />
<br />
More over lets also look at the Freedoms these other countries have.<br />
<br />
In Britain, Germany, and Australia there have been cases of LEGAL censorship of people who had ideas that were not in accordance with the government.<br />
<br />
And while I disagree with the principles of this &quot;religion&quot; I don't believe scientology should be outlawed yet that is PRECISELY what the German and several other European governments have done.  In fact Tom Cruise was livid with Germanies announcement of such a few months back.<br />
<br />
So now we have two sets of examples to go by here.  One without guns and one with guns.  The one with guns has had minor power crisis from time to time that were resolved peacefully in most instances with only one time that it devolved into a Civil War.<br />
<br />
The other has had tyrant upon tyrant thrown on them.  They enjoy fewer rights.  They are subject to cencorship.  They do not enjoy the same due processes we do.  And when you include the Ethnic cleansings in those nations as murder crimes it all of sudden makes out rates look pretty miniscule.<br />
<br />
Nations without guns can't stop criminals from becoming leaders.  Mussolini's &quot;workers&quot;,  Hitler's Brown Shirts, and Lenin's Bulsheviks were not very nice people.  They brow beat the population into following or else they killed you.<br />
<br />
An armed citenzry might have stopped WWII, the killing fields of Russia, the slaughters of Yugoslavia.<br />
<br />
Its hard to prove a negative result.  But the absence of those conditions in the US in my opinion has a strong linkage to the ownership of weapons and the blessings of the Forefathers to USE those weapons should the government become unruly.<br />
<br />
And I think in the end it is that fundamental mindset that keeps politicians in this country at bay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Llegolas, you are running into what I said at the beginning--gun advocates wave away all stats that show countries with strong gun-control have less crime.<br />
<br />
Telumehtar, you've brought up recent European history as a reason to have guns.  But answer this: how did those despots you named get into power? Answer: most had guns.  You could make a case that if the population was less armed then we wouldn't have had many of those regimes you listed.  Here's a question: name one government since the 19th century that attempted a take-over and was stopped by an armed populace.  I can give you plenty of examples where an armed populace took control and instituted a repressive regime (eg. Mao and communist China).<br />
<br />
By Aizle:<br />
Actually, there have been quesitonnaires distributed to military personnel regarding the issue of whether they would fire on US civilians if they refused to surrender their firearms. <br />
<br />
The responses for the most part were, &quot;No and if you try to make us, you'll have to fight us too&quot;. <br />
Are you implying that our military personnel would fire on unarmed citizens but not on armed ones?  If so, are you saying that our citizen-soldiers (to borrow from Ambrose) would back a government takeover depending on whether citizens were armed?<br />
<br />
By Telumehtar:<br />
Our military is strong yes. Our military is powerful yes. Our military is strong and powerful because????? it has the civilian resources of the private sector behind it. <br />
<br />
If the refineries down here in Houston stop... so do the Armored Brigades and the Air Force and the Navy. <br />
So we don't need guns to stop the armed forces, right?<br />
<br />
For you guys who say we should allow guns because otherwise only criminals would have guns, would you support legalizing all drugs?  After all, if drugs are illegal then only criminals will have drugs.  And there's no way we can stop everybody from getting drugs.<br />
<br />
If having an armed populace makes us safe, how come Afghanistan--one of the most armed societies in the world--isn't safe?<br />
<br />
Do gun owners agree that guns should be kept locked in a safe at home?  If so, how does this protect you from an armed intruder?  I heard on the radio a while back that some criminals are starting to wear bullet-proof vests.  So here's the scenario: a wide-awake, armed intruder wearing a bullet-proof vest invades your home.  You must wake up, get to (and unlock) the safe, find the intruder and shoot him in your pajamas (or whatever you wear to bed) and hope you don't hit his vest.  Oh yeah, you're protected.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I agree that the intent of the founding fathers was to have an armed populace to protect us from a government take-over.  However, the FFs were smart enough to know that things would change over time and they gave us a way to change our constitution.  Because of thier wisdom we no longer have slaves and woman can vote, among other things.  I think it's high time we changed the gun laws.</div></div><hr />

Hitler actually was elected, which means that the majority supported him, blinded by a combination of his brilliant speeches and actual early successes like providing employment for almost everyone. What would have changed if the German populace would have been armed? Hitler won them with speeches, not by beating them into submission. The resistance was a minority, like the Scholl siblings. They were students... do you think their chances would have been better if they had guns and tried to take on some SS troopers?<br />
<br />
Maybe if they tried to put up armed resistance and died, others would see what a monster Hitler actually was and joined the resistance too? Maybe. But the Nazis usually didn't kill people outright if doing so would be bad for the public opinion. Instead, they dragged them to court and sentenced them to death with elaborate fake trials.<br />
<br />
Do you have any examples where an armed populace actually stopped a murderous leader?<br />
<br />
And who knows what would have happened if the native americans had been as well armed as the white settlers, and had known what fate had in store for them....</div></div><hr />

Tel, guns are not a guarentee against tyranny, not anymore at least.  When the government has tanks, missles and assault guns. pistols and rifles do little to no good.

Why are you so sure here... aquiring a gun in a country where it is restricted takes some effort, you don't just walk into a store and buy a shotgun. He snapped over being rejected from the exams... he grabbed the gun that was readily available, and went out to kill. Maybe the effort to illegally procure a gun would have been too much for him. Remember, he was a rather calm young man before. Not everyone has the guts to contact criminals and make them sell you a gun. Who knows... if he wouldn't have had a gun available in that moment of heat, he might have calmed down in time.<br />
<br />
Of course there is a chance that he was determined enough to deal with criminals and get a gun, but there is also a chance that this would have deterred him enough to vent his frustration in a far less violent manner. Maybe the presence of gun actually gave him the idea to use it...  does this sound so impossible?</div></div><hr />

I personally would rather die than be raped. Your tranq gun thing was probably a little alternative you just brainstormed up in a little while, not thinking of the consequences if such an idea were implemented. That's cool, I do it so often, and get shot down everytime. Not implying YOU got shot down though, your argument still has some merit.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I can argue that it'd be much easier to kill with a tranq gun. Most gunshot wounds are not instantly fatal, or even hit a vital spot. Tranq guns would obviously be better for protection no argument there but a killer could just tranq you, then slit your throat when you get knocked out. No resistance, and a bigger guarantee that they're dead.<br />
<br />
Morg, your argument, while sounding sound, doesn't really apply to people once they reached the point of no return.  Got rejected from exams, *boom* *snap* he's gone already, and sometimes time can't bring you back</div></div><hr />

I agree.<br />
But I think not everyone reaches that point of no return (&quot;sometimes&quot; is the key word here), and we will never know whether this particular killer actually reached it. Because he had a gun available immediately, possibly before he reached that point. But by now it is all speculation of course.</div></div><hr />

First off, no.  It takes ten times as much determination to kill someone with a knife as it does a gun.  Guns kill cleanly and keep you at a safe enough distance away that the brutality <br />
seems less real to you.<br />
<br />
Secondly, he wouldn't have killed 13 teachers, 2 students, a secretary and policeman with a knife, no matter how determined you think he was.<br />

That sounds incredibly paranoid-dillusional to me.  I for one don't happen to believe that there's a conspiracy by the &quot;politicians&quot; to take over our country and the only thing keeping them at bay is the NRA.  LOL.  Though I'm sure something similar to this is going through the heads of every member in the NRA.<br />
<br />
Plus, the government would have no trouble at all taking over this country if such an event were to occur.  Tanks, missles, nukes, etc. would put us down pretty damned fast.  Your shotgun isn't gonna save you.<br />

Wrong.  Without guns and the ability to resist then we will be forced to operate those refineries and other infrastructure at gun point.  With guns and other arms we can fight back and possibly even destroy those refinereries which denies the military resources.<br />

<br />
Actually quite a few of the military would in fact turn around and defect if they knew an armed conflict which essentially would become a Civil War were imminent.<br />
<br />
For you guys who say we should allow guns because otherwise only criminals would have guns, would you support legalizing all drugs? After all, if drugs are illegal then only criminals will have drugs. And there's no way we can stop everybody from getting drugs<br />
<br />
Actually I think the war on drugs to be one of the most stupidest things this country has ever done.  I say legalize and them regulate them similar to Amsterdam but don't provide medical insurance via government agencies for drug abuse... in otherwords no Medicaid for drug users.  Use at your own risk.<br />
(probably just scratched the chalk board for conservatives on that board and probably made the liberal scratch their heads on that one) :D<br />
<br />
If having an armed populace makes us safe, how come Afghanistan--one of the most armed societies in the world--isn't safe? <br />
<br />
Actually Afganistan is not a comparable instance.  Firstly the average citizen does not have access to guns.  Only warlords and their followers are able to and the warlords are constantly warring (hence the name Warlords) which is why Afganistan is unstable.  Afganistan is a collection of tribes.  Something that doesn't exist in the US.<br />
<br />
Do gun owners agree that guns should be kept locked in a safe at home? If so, how does this protect you from an armed intruder? I heard on the radio a while back that some criminals are starting to wear bullet-proof vests. So here's the scenario: a wide-awake, armed intruder wearing a bullet-proof vest invades your home. You must wake up, get to (and unlock) the safe, find the intruder and shoot him in your pajamas (or whatever you wear to bed) and hope you don't hit his vest. Oh yeah, you're protected. <br />
<br />
Yes I agree they should be locked up however there are lock boxes capable of being stored under your bed and which can be opened via keypad in under a few seconds.  As far as bullet proof vest well they are nice and all but they are expensive and while &quot;more&quot; criminals are wearing them most are wearing them for gang wars and bank robberies not household robberies.  <br />
<br />
Secondly if trained properly in police and military techniques you would know that you shoot 2 bullets... 1 in the chest and one to the head to kill a target.  Furthermore while bullet proof vests may stop the bullet the target still takes the full power of the bullet (the vest just spreads the force over a larger area but that force is still there) and quite often people will blackout from the pain, be knocked over, have the wind knocked from them ect ect.  Furthermore bullet proof vest are mainly only a viable defense against lower caliber rounds such as pistols.<br />
<br />
AR15 (civilian modified M-16s) and various rifles use standard rounds quite capable of penestrating Kevlar.  This is why the military doesn't offer bullet proof vest to everyone cause they are nearly useless against that  caliber ammo.<br />
<br />
Furthermore a shotgun with a tight spread will pummel an individual and knock em down.  Shotguns are highly effective at subduing people in kevlar vest just from the sheer force of the blast.<br />
<br />
So now that we see bullet proof vests really are not all that good lets look at the alternative to no gun ownership.  I'm being robbed by an armored and armed assailant.  I have to get out of bed get to a phone and call the cops and sit tight til they arrive.  They will probably take longer to get here then it would've taken me to get my gun and they would still have the same issues to deal with in terms of the body armor.<br />
<br />
Furthermore you have provided no statistics for actual number of criminals where body armor is used.<br />
<br />
The one incident that is in my head is in florida 2 fully armored criminals assaulted and killed/injured an FBI and got away.  That incident prompted the FBI to switch to 10mm guns which has the penetrating power to go through kevlar so now the crooks are back to square one.<br />
<br />
Because of thier wisdom we no longer have slaves and woman can vote, among other things. I think it's high time we changed the gun laws.<br />
<br />
Note though to date the amendments which have lasted were about being MORE free not less free.  No amendment has lasted which restricted or took away rights.<br />
<br />
If you tried to ban guns in total all you would end up having is another era like Prohibition.  Which btw didn't last.<br />
<br />
And next on the chopping block...<br />
Hitler actually was elected, which means that the majority supported him, blinded by a combination of his brilliant speeches and actual early successes like providing employment for almost everyone.<br />
<br />
Yes Hitler was elected however the reason he was elected was because his brown shirts killed the opposition and subdued any descent.  Its not much of an election when there is only one candidate to safely vote for.<br />
<br />
 Maybe if they tried to put up armed resistance and died, others would see what a monster Hitler actually was and joined the resistance too?<br />
<br />
It doesn't have the glamour of the French resistance but there was a German resistance as well and it played a major role in the war.  However I won't disagree that many Germans supported or at least gave lip service to the Nazi's.  Partly it was out of fear and partly some truly believed.<br />
<br />
However had the citizenry been armed how many fewer jews would've been killed or socialists, or Catholics or what ever faciton Hitler had a taste for the day.  When the Jews were able to get armed they put up a heavy resistance.  The Ghetto wars in Poland anyone?<br />
<br />
Do you have any examples where an armed populace actually stopped a murderous leader? <br />
<br />
Again hard to prove a negative result.  Has the presence of guns in this country simply prevented any such leader from arising in the first place?  You can't tell me it hasn't and I can't tell you it has with any sort of definity.<br />
<br />
However for examples of a corrupt leader in power being ousted by armed conflict.. how about the Nazi's and the various resistance groups once they got armed.<br />
<br />
Or the Czar removed from power by the Bolsheviks (which ultimately were corrupt themselves but they did remove a corrupt leader also).<br />
<br />
Or the United States (can't believe we are forgeting this one).  Without an Armed populace we would be having good ole King George on the one dollar bill errr I mean 1 pound bill or soon to be the common EU currency.<br />
<br />
And China someone said it was a power take over but China is an example of the people deposing a corrupt government.. in this case they established an equally corrupt government which btw had one of its first acts being to disarm the populace.<br />
<br />
Just because the result isn't democracy every time doesn't mean that the people's will at the time wasn't executed and executed through armed resistance.<br />
<br />
And who knows what would have happened if the native americans had been as well armed as the white settlers, and had known what fate had in store for them....<br />
<br />
Your right who knows what would've happened.  Perhaps we would've had to deal with them peacefully and fundamentally change how our culture is today.  Needless to say they were armed and they did resist and did so fairly effectively for a long time.<br />
<br />
And next chopping block...<br />
Tel, guns are not a guarentee against tyranny, not anymore at least. When the government has tanks, missles and assault guns. pistols and rifles do little to no good.<br />
<br />
Again wrong.  Tanks missiles and various military hardware would defect along with the defectors.<br />
<br />
Furthermore it kinda defeats the purposes of using those weapons of rather uncontrolled destructive power against citizens who you aim to subjagate and furthermore those tanks and other tools require civilian based supply lines to operate and further more how are you going to use a tank against someone in the city without destorying the city you are trying to keep intact?<br />
<br />
Nukes won't be any good as the tyrant doesn't want to destroy his own cities so that removes that power block.<br />
<br />
You keep assuming the Army is going to remain a loyalist institution when in fact much of the Army is very against large government (heavy set of republicans and even more extremem small government movements in the army).<br />
<br />
Also our tanks are not invincible.  Not to mention Tanks are designed for open engagements where there are drawn battlelines and an easy to identify enemy.  Tanks become EXTREMELY susceptible to guerrilla war where you don't know who is on what side and where an attack may come from.<br />
<br />
Note Tanks effective in Desert Storm where there was an easily identified enemy and easy to navigate terrain.<br />
<br />
Tanks didn't see much use in Vietnam due to a hidden enemy and bad terrain.  And well the US has TONS of tank unfriendly terrain.<br />
<br />
The Air Force would be near useless as well again due to the fact that there is no clear enemy.<br />
<br />
In otherwords in a civil war with Guerrilla tactics the military is going to be HEAVILY disadvantaged due to loss of several things it enjoys in foreign conflicts.<br />
<br />
Why are you so sure here... aquiring a gun in a country where it is restricted takes some effort,<br />
<br />
Umm no it doesn't.. trust me I know first hand its very easy to get illegal weapons.  Saturday Night Specials anyone?  Home made and illegal as hell.  Sub Machine guns.. everyone just over look the description I gave above of how to make your own and in several cities they actually do this.  Remember street value $500.<br />
<br />
Illegal guns are not hard to come by.<br />
<br />
All quote aside now.. lets look at this from a philosphical and legal angle.<br />
<br />
The right to bear arms is a subset of the larger right to own weapons which is a subset to the right to defend yourself which is a subset to the right to life.<br />
<br />
By removing the right to bear arms you are essentially saying you do not have the right to defend yourself and thus do not have the right to live.<br />
<br />
You may deny it all you want but considering other liberal hot topics like allowing abortion and in extreme cases euthanasia it really isn't a far cry for THAT line of thinking.<br />
<br />
More over it blows my mind that liberals want to destroy the 2nd amendment when its been stated in various historical viewpoints as getting started due to racism.  This was further pushed to an issue in the Supreme Court case, Dredd Scot vs Sandford (http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndcourt/supreme/15sup.htm).<br />
<br />
&quot;It would give to persons of the negro race, ... the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, ... the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.&quot; (P. 417)<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor can Congress deny to the people the right to keep and bear arms, nor the right to trial by jury, nor compel any one to be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding.... The powers over person and property of which we speak are not only not granted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are forbidden to exercise them.&quot; <br />
<br />
I think its pretty damn clear there that the Supreme Court states that the right to bear arms is universal and that many of the laws on the books today are very much against the 2nd Amendment.<br />
<br />
Furthermore if you challenge gun owners to try and take all the laws congress spews forth to the court to get them overturned then you are being extremely unrealistic and furthermore are advocating that congressman should not do a portion of their job as Congressman like presidents and Supreme Court Justices have to take an oath of office stating that they will uphold the constitution of which the Bill of Rights is considered a part of.<br />
<br />
Their legislating of law upon law that mimics or rewords laws overturned by the Supreme Court is in DIRECT violation of that oath.  But hey whats new for our corrupt politicians.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah so in otherwords too much reading makes life hard on you thus my opinions are null and void.<br />
<br />
Thanks Aizle, I'll be sure to apply a similar logic to your view point sometime down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Secondly, I can argue that it'd be much easier to kill with a tranq gun. Most gunshot wounds are not instantly fatal, or even hit a vital spot. Tranq guns would obviously be better for protection no argument there but a killer could just tranq you, then slit your throat when you get knocked out. No resistance, and a bigger guarantee that they're dead. <br />
The assumption in your argument is that the person firing the gun:<br />
1) has the time to complete the job<br />
2) Has the willingness to get actual blood on his hands, rather than a realtively &quot;clean&quot; firearms kill<br />
3) Has the intention of committing murder.<br />
<br />
A robber shooting a 7-11 clerk in the heat of the moment in a stick up is not going to take the time to go make sure the guy is dead. He's going to shoot and run. The shooter in the school-gun incident would have to tranq everyone in the room before armed police arrived in order to get the chance to then go start slitting throats.<br />
<br />
However, as for owning a gun for self-protection...<br />
Being armed is no guarantee of being safe. Ronald Regan was shot while surronded by the best-armed best-trained bodyguards in history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your asking me to prove a negative which is a nono in debate. The presence of guns may very well be the one thing that prevent our own government from becoming tyrannical.<br />
Sorry Tel, but you're not getting off that easy.  I'm not asking you to prove a negative, I'm asking you to give me one example of a take-over that was squashed by armed citizens.  I can give you many that were stopped by basically unarmed citizens (although some used violence).  The fall of the communist countries (esp. the Velvet Revolution), E. Timor (not non-violent but the poeple where hardly armed).<br />
<br />
I can also give you plenty of examples where armed citizens used their guns to take power and made things worse for everyone.  The idea that we are safer from our government because we are armed is a fallacy shown by recent history.  Your examples (1917 Russia, 1948 China) all resulted in governments that were worse.  Hardly a good advertisement for guns.<br />
<br />
If recent history is any guide, you are more likely to become oppressed by an armed populace than an unarmed one.<br />
<br />
Actually quite a few of the military would in fact turn around and defect if they knew an armed conflict which essentially would become a Civil War were imminent. <br />
And what I'm saying is that those some people will defect regardless of whether the citizens are armed.  It has nothing to do with whether we wield guns.<br />
<br />
Actually I think the war on drugs to be one of the most stupidest things this country has ever done<br />
You get credit for being consistent.  :)  I'll drop that one.<br />
<br />
Actually Afganistan is not a comparable instance<br />
More hand waving.  Again, every situation which shows guns to cause death and destruction is &quot;not comparable&quot;.  I might agree with some of these arguments but there are too many examples to be explained away.<br />
<br />
Secondly if trained properly in police and military techniques you would know that you shoot 2 bullets<br />
C'mon, what are the chances that you can squarely put a bullet into the head of an intruder in the dark, while fighting off sleep, before you get hit?  Don't forget that you want to recognize your target first or it will be &quot;oops, sorry Junior&quot;.  Maybe that intruder has training too.  I'd rather he had a knife and me a baseball bat then both of us with guns.<br />
<br />
Body armor useless?  Then why does my brother-in-law (a cop) put one on every morning that he walks the beat?  Yeah, maybe they're not totally bulletproof, but you're at a disadvantage if you don't have one.<br />
<br />
And you can't seriously be advocating having an AK-47 derivative in every home, can you?</div></div><hr />

However had the citizenry been armed how many fewer jews would've been killed or socialists, or Catholics or what ever faciton Hitler had a taste for the day. When the Jews were able to get armed they put up a heavy resistance. The Ghetto wars in Poland anyone? <br />
Don't you think that the poorly armed, but brave resistance in the Warsaw ghetto saved one single life in the end or stopped Hitler from doing whatever he was doing at that time? I think that less people would have died without that ghetto fighting. It is actually a terribly effective example for what will happen if armed but mostly untrained civilians make a stand against a well armed and well trained army. People die, and nothing changes. An armed German resistance probably would have shared this fate, since the SS was absolutely willing to fire at German civilians.<br />
<br />
But lets assume that a sufficient number of Germans opposes Hitler, and that they all are armed. A major part will still lack appropriate weapon training, the morale under fire that a trained soldier has, and most of all, they will lack leadership. A group of armed people, no matter how big, is inefficient without a good leader. And Himmler, head of the SS, excelled at eliminating opposing people in leadership positions. The SA, or brownshirts, the horde that paved Hitler's way to power, lost any political meaning after the &quot;night of the long knives&quot; in 1934, when Himmler's SS assassinated several generals and SA key personnel, among them their leader, Ernst Roehm. Lets assume the armed German resistance has a leader that can effectively direct them against the Nazi government - what do you think how long said leader would survive with the well trained, fanatical and totally ruthless SS after him? I don't think more than a few days unless he leaves the country, the distance making him that much less efficient.<br />
<br />
All things considered, I believe that unless pretty much the whole country would oppose the Nazis, an armed resistance would pretty much be over after a few very bloody weeks, because of the differences in weapons, supply, training and leadership.<br />
<br />
Well, there is one chance for it to succeed. The Wehrmacht and the SS had no love for each other, and if there were an armed insurgence and the SS fired at civilians, the Wehrmacht would very likely defend the people against the SS. How such a bloodbath would end however, I have no idea... but no matter the alternative, I think in the end more guns always equal more death for everyone involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok had some time to find some raw stats on Guns and Crime and now ready to fight that front.<br />
<br />
Firstly let me state that just about every &quot;stat&quot; presented on these boards that is Anti-gun is either falsehoods or downright lies.  And more over my sources not only include Pro-Gunners but also for refuting those false stats I will also point to a study from a Democratic Administration(the Clintons) bent on Gun control but didn't want their studies published because it would show that Gun control has virtually NO effect on crime.<br />
<br />
* Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 <br />
<br />
* Anti-gun Clinton researchers find an annual total of 1.5 million self-defense cases. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of &quot;Guns in America&quot; -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.3 <br />
<br />
* Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.4 <br />
<br />
* Anti-gun journal pronounces the failure of the Brady law. One of the nation's leading anti-gun medical publications, the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the Brady registration law has failed to reduce murder rates. In August 2000, JAMA reported that states implementing waiting periods and background checks did &quot;not [experience] reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates.&quot;5 <br />
<br />
* More children are killed playing football in school than they are by guns. That's right. Despite what media coverage might seem to indicate, more children die playing high school football, than they do by firearms at school. The most recent year on record shows that 18 football players died during the school year ending in June, 2000 (from hits to the head, heat stroke, etc.), as compared with 9 students by firearms.6 <br />
<br />
* Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.9 <br />
<br />
* As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.10 <br />
<br />
* Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).12 And readers of Newsweek learned that &quot;only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.&quot;13 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is just scratching the surface btw... I could go on but here is a link (http://www.gunowners.org/fs0101.htm) to the latest stats sheet.<br />
<br />
<br />
But my favorite was...<br />
<br />
3. Failure of Gun Control<br />
A. Poor track record<br />
<br />
* Washington, D.C. has, perhaps, the most restrictive gun control laws in the country, and yet it has one of the highest murder rates in the nation. <br />
<br />
* Objection: Critics claim criminals merely get their guns in Virginia where the laws are more relaxed. This, they argue, is why the D.C. gun ban is not working. <br />
<br />
* Answer: Perhaps criminals do get their guns in Virginia, but this overlooks one point: If the availability of guns in Virginia is the root of D.C.'s problems, why does Virginia not have the same murder and crime rate as the District? Virginia is awash in guns and yet the murder rate is much, much lower. This holds true even for Virginia's urban areas. The murder rates are: <br />
<br />
City 1999 Murder rate <br />
Washington, DC  46.4 per 100,00035 <br />
Arlington, VA  2.1 per 100,00036  <br />
(Arlington is just across the river from D.C.) <br />
Total VA metropolitan area  6.1 per 100,00037 <br />
<br />
* Guns are not the problem. On the contrary, lax criminal penalties and laws that disarm the law-abiding are responsible for giving criminals a safer working environment. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also lets look at Englands crime rates shall we?  This report is from the Dept. of Justice under the Clinton Administration.<br />
<br />
<br />
the English assault rate as measured<br />
in the victim survey was slightly higher<br />
than America's in 1981, but in 1995 the<br />
English assault rate was more than<br />
double America's (figure 2)<br />
<br />
<br />
the U.S. burglary rate as measured in<br />
the victim survey was more than double<br />
England's in 1981, but in 1995 the<br />
English burglary rate was nearly double<br />
America's (below, and figure 3 of the<br />
report)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the English motor vehicle theft rate as<br />
measured in police statistics went from<br />
1.4 times America's in 1981 to nearly 2<br />
times in 1996 (figure 10).<br />
<br />
<br />
You can read the whole report here (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cjusew96a.pdf) but its pretty damning on the whole that state gun ownership has no effect on criminal activities.<br />
<br />
Also lets take a short tour through history... you want nations where the armed populace overthrew a tyranical government...<br />
<br />
Well lets look right here.  The American Revolution.  The French Revolution both of which gave rise to Democracies.  Also we had several iterations of British revolts which eventually defanged the British Monarchy and created the modern day parliament we have today.<br />
<br />
Or how about Taiwan.  An Armed resistance movement which has secured (for the time being) independence from a represive Chinese government.<br />
<br />
Or how about the Phillipines and several wars over there securing their independence.<br />
<br />
Or half the colonial states that broke away here and there through armed resistance from their mother lands.  Mexico?  Argentina?  Brazil?<br />
<br />
The list goes on if you would just study a little history.<br />
<br />
Also what is this crap that fewer people would've died in the Ghetto revolts.  While that statement might be true there is little doubt that the ONLY lives spared would've been the Nazi's.  All the Jews would still suffer the same fate.  And the deployment of Nazi troops having to put down uprisings helped make our life as the liberating force MUCH MUCH easier.  So don't say they revolted in vain as that statement is about as big a slap in the face as you could give to people who gave up their lives fighting for what they believed in.<br />
<br />
Also you might find this to be an interesting little tid bit that Anti-gunners have no clue when they talk about this.  The Anti-gunners would have you believe it is the Police who will protect the citizens however here is a nice list of precisely the OPPOSITE.<br />
<br />
Mr. Russell falsely claims: The Amendment is silent on today's gun issues -- sport and personal protection -- although some drafts mention the latter. But the Second Amendment was written before the institution of police departments, the creation of which should have transferred the right to keep and bear arms to local police officers, thereby eliminating the need for citizens to do so for personal protection.<br />
<br />
Anti Self defense folks, like Mr. Russell are DEAD wrong on this!<br />
<br />
There are 28 court cases, all of which showing &quot; the Police have no obligation to protect any individual person from harm &quot;<br />
<br />

Your personal safety IS YOUR personal responsibility! Whether you choose to exercise that RIGHT is YOUR choice!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats right folks the cops are not responsible for your defense and our own Surpreme court says so.<br />
<br />
So now that I'm done tearing you a new hole on the issue will you perhaps just give an inkling to the idea that you MIGHT just POSSIBLY be wrong?<br />
<br />
I doubt it as liberals tend to think themselves as enlightened when in reality they couldn't have their heads any further shoved up their backsides even if God gave em an extra nine inches of neck.<br />
<br />
The constitution says it<br />
The stats say it<br />
History says it<br />
The courts say it<br />
And even anti-gun government studies say it<br />
<br />
But for some reason you folks keep insisting that the world is flat.<br />
<br />
And for those of you who just don't like to read... here is a summary... Anti-gun = wrong<br />

Every statistic, on both sides has been massaged and manipulated so as to say what the author wants it to, not portray the truth.<br />
<br />
There are three types of lies, lies, damn lies and statistics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well lets look right here. The American Revolution. The French Revolution both of which gave rise to Democracies. Also we had several iterations of British revolts which eventually defanged the British Monarchy and created the modern day parliament we have today. <br />
<br />
Whoa there Tel.  Let's take a look at your examples.  The start of the US, I'll admit, is a shining example of armed citizens.  I'll quibble a bit and say that the British government was not a &quot;local&quot; government.  It also helped that Spain and France were willing to join the war on our side but I'll let that slide.<br />
<br />
But the French Revolution?  Have you heard of the Reign of Terror?  The guillotine?  And tell me what came about as a direct result of the French Revolution? Napolean, nationalized armies and the largest war Europe had seen to that date.  Not much of an argument for guns.<br />
<br />
Let's see, Taiwan was the result of the Chinese Nationalists losing a war to Mao (who has some very interesting ideas about citizens and warfare).  Guess who backed Mao?  Yup, armed peasants.  Now Mao got his guns from the Allies during WW II so maybe we can't hold that against you. :p<br />
<br />
The Phillipines are wracked by communist guerillas who, surprise surprise, are &quot;citizens&quot; armed with guns.  The Filipinos, incidentally, got their independence from the US without fighting us (granted WWII had an influence on that).<br />
<br />
I'm admittedly a little ignorant of Latin American history, but didn't Pancho Villa round up some some peasent farmers, get them guns, and then wreck havok on the country side?<br />
<br />
Now, let's talk about countries that won their independence, or threw off the yoke of government oppression, without a general armed struggle.  Canada, Belize, Czech Republic and Slovakia, Australia, Poland, the Baltic states, heck almost all the former Soviet states.  India.  Even aparthied was eventually ended without a general armed struggle.<br />
<br />
I know my history and in my eyes the scales show a lot more pain and suffering attributable to armed citizens.<br />
<br />
I've also got to disagree about your example of the Jews pre-WW II.  If the Jews had been better armed the only result would have been more dead Jews and Germans.  Events like Kristallnacht were relatively bloodless.  If more Germans had been armed (both Jews and non-Jews) then the Jews would have resisted and the Germans would have killed them right then instead of 4 years later.  You may consider that a good reason for guns, but I do not.<br />
<br />
I don't have the time today to look over the stats you have listed.  They do appear to be damning regarding gun-control.  I will not hand-wave them away but I do need some time to look them over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just skimmed the report you listed.  Yeah, most of it is bull****.  The statistics inside could easily be used for either side of the arguement.  Did you happen to see this, on page 20 of the report Tel?<br />
<br />
The U.S. conviction rate per 1,000 population is higher than England's for murder, rape, and robbery.  Is this because the U.S. has higher rates of victimization from murder, rape, or robbery?  Or because the criminal justice system in the United States is more likely to catch and convict murderers, rapists, and robbers?<br />
<br />
 - The higher U.S. conviction rate for murder is explained entirely by the higher U.S. murder rate.<br />
<br />
So quit with the statistics.  They're gettin' to be like opinions and ***holes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bloodless.. well I suppose they were not killed there on the streets... instead they were lead to the chambers like lambs to the slaughter.  Bloodless my arse.<br />
<br />
Quoting statistics to prove either side in this argument is *bull***** and everyone should know that. Every statistic, on both sides has been massaged and manipulated so as to say what the author wants it to, not portray the truth.  <br />
<br />
Those statistics were largely founded by an anti-gun administration so if anything shouldn't they be massaged and authored to point the other direction?<br />
<br />
Anyhow real cute guys... you folks are clearly outdone and so you dismiss the argument saying that stats mean nothing.<br />
<br />
Well you might want to wake up from dream world and realize laws are based upon stats quite often and when the opposing side is presenting stats that favor my side what does that say about the issue as a whole.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I repeat myself.<br />

 Firstly let me state that just about every &quot;stat&quot; presented on these boards that is Anti-gun is either falsehoods or downright lies<br />
Anti-gun = wrong <br />
that Anti-gunners have no clue when they talk about this<br />
I doubt it as liberals tend to think themselves as enlightened when in reality they couldn't have their heads any further shoved up their backsides even if God gave em an extra nine inches of neck. <br />
Your asking me to prove a negative which is a nono in debate<br />

<br />
This is not meant as a flame, but more of an informational type of thing. I used to think the scientologists were just kinda rascally. Then I did some research. I suggest you do some also. They are more of a crime family than a religion. I am more scared of Scientologists than I am of the Mafia. They need to be shut down. Seriously, it is NOT a religion, it is a crime syndicate.</div></div><hr />

They can be made to say whatever you want them to say. Being reliant on stats basically makes you sheep. Judge ideas on merit, not meaningless stats.<br />
<br />
I minored in Statistics in college. It is amazing how badly and easily statistics like these can be manipulated. We spent a whole semester just dealing with this issue. Stats have WAY to much faith placed in them by lawmakers and the general public. Hell, in one of my classes we used statsitics to prove that Mustard was the most lethal substance on earth. It would have been very convincing, had it not been so rediculous. <br />
<br />
Trust me, in cases like this, it is much better to judge the idea based on its merits, not on some half baked statistics brought up by either side...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've provided everything from opinion to stats to judgments made by the supreme court.  Kinda like I did in other arguments I've made in the past and similarly when presented with this sort of front you guys wiggle out with that same lame excuse and dance.<br />
<br />
In addition, I could bring your post into my stats teacher and watch him rip a hole in your entire argument. The very act of using a statistic in an argument manipulates the truth of the data behind the statistic.<br />
<br />
You know that is funny cause every lesson I had on debate and writing opinion papers stated that backing your opinions with stats was critical to winning the debate or getting a good grade on the paper....<br />
<br />
What are they teaching you Kullaas?  Sounds like some lame school of the brainwashed and when you get to college if you just throw opinions out there without sources and statistics to back you up the prof should chew you up and spit you out and then throw you down the garbage chute.<br />
<br />
You(plural here no longer talking about Kullaas) bring up stats and opinion pieces and claim your view is right but when the opposition brings up data refutting yours and more over data from a source that SHOULD be on your side you dismiss it with lame arguments.  This isn't a one shot deal this is the same thing in several arguments now.  Its really indicative to me that you guys simply have no clue what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
But then what should I expect from liberals of today.  They don't actually think.  They just act on feeling.  That is after all the liberal philosophy... Do what feels good and forget about what is right or wrong.<br />
<br />
At any rate I'm done here.  If you folks won't even bring up counter arguments and back them with sources then its obvious you are brainwashed followers unable to stand behind ideals with sources to back you up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense, but I think that if he did, someone would come along and try and dismiss that as well.  It seems to me Tel did a good job of proving his side as compared to the anti-gun people in this thread.  I don't blame him for giving up.<br />

I've got the entire spectrum and they ALL say the same thing.<br />
<br />
Fewer guns does not mean greater safety.<br />
<br />
Have you just totally NOT read what I posted or NOT followed the links I pointed to?<br />
<br />
We are talking about Clinton Administration funded findings here... Either you view those findings as being an independent investigation or you view them as Anti-gun cause everyone knows Clinton and Janet Reno were NOT pro-gun and yet thier OWN stats say they that &quot;Anti-gun utopias&quot; do nothing to stem off crime.<br />

<br />
From http://www.cagv.org/facts.html<br />
There are approximately 192 million privately owned firearms in the U.S. -- 65 million of which are handguns. 1 <br />
<br />
In 1996, 10,744 people were murdered with firearms in this country. 2 <br />
<br />
In 1996, firearms were used in 2 out of 3 murders committed in the U.S. Handguns were used in 54% of all murders. 3 <br />
<br />
In 1996, 8 out of 10 of those murdered with firearms were murdered with handguns.4 <br />
<br />
In 1996, there were only 176 justifiable handgun homicides by private citizens in the United States. 5 <br />
<br />
Thinking of buying a gun to protect your home? You may want to remember that.. <br />
<br />
Guns kept in the home for self-protection are 43 times more likely to kill a family member or friend than to kill in self-defense. 6 <br />
<br />
The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home. 7 <br />
<br />
The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold. 8 <br />
<br />
Guns are a blight upon our young people. For instance.. <br />
<br />
In 1994, firearms were the number two killer of men and women 10-24 years of age -- second only to motor vehicle crashes. 9 <br />
<br />
In 1994, the firearm injury death rate among males 15-24 years of age was 2% higher than the motor vehicle traffic injury death rate. 10 <br />
<br />
In 1994, firearm homicide was the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34. 11 <br />
<br />
In 1995, 14 children, ages 19 and under, were killed with guns every day in this country. 12 <br />
<br />
Surprised? You shouldn't be, because.. <br />
<br />
In 1995 alone, 35,957 Americans were killed with firearms, in homicides, suicides, and accidents. In comparison, 33,651 Americans were killed in the Korean War and 58,148 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War. 13 <br />
<br />
Licensed firearms dealers sell an estimated 7.5 million guns everv year, of which 3.5 million are handguns.14 <br />
<br />
Of all accidental fatalities involving firearms, 71 % involve handguns. 15 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tel, you did a good job arguing your side of it.  I've just kept arguing 'cause I refuse to accept that the answer to a safer nation is to arm the populace, which I believe is wrong and probably will continue to believe is wrong no matter what you throw at me.  You're probably doing the same thing on your side of it.  I know, I argue this all the time with my best friend.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I'm trying to read your posts and seperate your points from your points-of-view.  Kullaas is just pointing out the flaws in your logic.  Unfortunately, he stopped adding anything useful to the debate a couple of pages ago.:D<br />
<br />
My side on the issue derives from my distaste for the availability of firearms to people who should not have access to them, and I judge *very* few people as responsible enough to carry them with the ability to say that they've kept their firearm at all times in a place where no one else can gain access to them.<br />
<br />
I feel that most people are not responsible enough to be in possession of lethal weapons, and you've said nothing to change my mind about that.  <br />
<br />
Our goverment has instituted laws against murder because although almost everyone knows that it's wrong, someone will eventually kill someone else even if they know that it's wrong.  Laws and punishment for those actions are a hard deterrent for people to not commit murder other than their ethical views on it.<br />
<br />
Laws are necessary to keep the murder rate down in our society.  Likewise, I feel that gun-laws are necessary to help ensure that people use and keep guns more responsibly.<br />
<br />
I think that the less access people have to guns, the less likely they are to use them.  Does this mean that we should ban guns entirely?  No, not necessarily.  But I think there's a direct correlation between murder and guns, and I think that if the gun ratio for citizens was closer to zero, murders would also be much closer to that number.<br />
<br />
But then what should I expect from liberals of today. They don't actually think. They just act on feeling. That is after all the liberal philosophy... Do what feels good and forget about what is right or wrong. <br />
<br />
I don't mind your arguements until you start pulling out the Rush Limbaugh.  Stop with the f*cking Limbaugh statements, it's extremely offensive to the people you're arguing against, whether they're liberals or not.<br />
<br />
Do you even know what the difference between liberals and conservatives is?  Liberals want the the government to work for the people, whereas Conservatives have a stringent &quot;hands-off&quot; policy.  Gun control is not a liberal idea because it's stupid, it's a liberal idea because it forces people to take more responsibility for their firearms, rather than assuming they will.<br />
<br />
On other issues I tend to say leave the people their freedoms, but on the subject of gun control, I do not want to gamble on someone else's ethics and responsibility for my own safety when my life could be the ante.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, this is not the liberal philosophy.  Ever heard of John Locke?  Look him up sometime.  He's one of the primary reasons the United States was founded and the Constitution set up the way it is.  Liberal thinking is the reason we didn't institute another monarchy in America.<br />
<br />
But I suppose that's what I should expect coming from a conservative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myrea, that's true, but the &quot;real&quot; killers aren't usually afraid of blood. Anyone who has the intention to kill and is afraid of blood is a wuss. Besides there are TONS of other ways, that are a lot less messier. Suffocation, breaking the neck, drowning, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Your first and third points are irrefutable, and rightly so. My statement IS based on the assumption that those aren't a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Tel, I started looking at the stats you pulled out and found this:<br />
The major exception to the pattern of higher crime rates in England is the murder rate.  The 1996 U.S. murder rate is vastly higher (nearly six times) than England's, although the difference between the two countries has narrowed over the past 16 years (below, and figure 5 of the report).<br />
Care to comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's more:<br />
Firearms are more often involved in violent crimes in the United States than in England.  According to 1996 police statistics, firearms were used in 68% of U.S. murders but 7% of English murders, and 41% of U.S. robberies but 5% of English robberies.<br />
More than a third of all U.S. robberies involved guns but only 5% in England involved guns.  I don't know about you but if I'm being robbed I'd rather the robber didn't have a gun.<br />
<br />
OK, here's a comparison:<br />
the U.S. robbery rate as measured in the victim survey was nearly double England's in 1981, but in 1995 the English robbery rate was 1.4 times America's<br />
Cool, less crime.  That's good.  But is it because the US is better armed or was it because of better police work?  Well, this might be an indication:<br />
the U.S. murder rate as measured in police statistics was 8.7 times England's in 1981 but 5.7 times in 1996<br />
So the comparitive robbery crimes made a complete turn-around but the murder rate changed just a bit.<br />
<br />
So if guns weren't the reason for the reversal in crime rates, what could it be?  How about this:<br />
Since 1981, an offender's risk of being caught, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration has risen in the United States for all six measured crimes (murder, rape, robbery, assualt, burglary, motor vehicle theft) but has falled in England for all but murder (figures 43-48).<br />
So apparently the US made a concerted effort to put more criminals behind bars and viola! less crime per capita than England.  BUT the murder rate is still 6 times higher in the US than in England.  Explain that please.<br />
<br />
I can: guns.<br />
<br />
Lemme make it plain for you:<br />
guns = more death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Telu, I'm liberal! Though I do what makes me feel good whether thinking of right or wrong...but that's not the point, I'm anti gun control for many of the same reasons you are.<br />
<br />
Anti-gun people, look at it this way, if a conflict erupted between anti and pro gun people, who do you think is gonna win?! Unarmed hippies, or violent gun freaks. Makes you wonder.<br />
<br />
P.S. Just so we're clear, that last paragraph was a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Kullaas lets look at your stats starting with criteria YOU first brought up.<br />
<br />
Are the sources you provided independent sources?<br />
<br />
No they are all anti-gun sources with an agenda against Pro-gunners.<br />
<br />
That right there according to you would be enough to disqualify those sources since you didn't provide any other sources of either independent or opposing sources.<br />
<br />
But I won't simply rely on that lame excuse alone (though to be honest if your going to try and hold me to one standard you should also hold yourself to that same standard).<br />
<br />
Secondly.... your sources are inaccurate as the data provided is incomplete.<br />
<br />
The injuries and deaths attributed to firearms doesn't state how many of those injuries and deaths were of criminals being shot while caught.  If they place criminals in the same catagory as law abiding citizens then yes those stats have been artificially pumped up as I doubt very many people would look upon criminals aquiring injuries during the course of a crime as being an accurate part of that statistic since the WHOLE purpose of the opposing side is to bear arms to hurt criminals.<br />
<br />
Furthermore it doesn't clarify how many of those were suicides.  Which if someone is truly bent on suicide they will find something to kill themselves with.  Furthermore the reason guns have the highest relation to suicide is because they are the most effective.  however the preferred method of suicide is massive drug overdose.  However ODers are often able to make it to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped and thus are saved.  So in terms of successful suicides guns are in the lead... in terms of favored form of suicide Drug Overdoses are actually the preferred method.<br />
<br />
And lastly it doesn't specify what type of injuries were sustained.  Were they actual gunshots or were they injuries sustained from things like pistol whip, or rifle checking.<br />
<br />
And the third major problem with your source reviews is that you use a liar.  The article at Scifreak's... This Michael Bellesiles that is hailed at Scifreak's site is undergoing a massive investigation not only by Pro-gunners  but also by peer historians for fraud, false research, and downright lying.<br />
<br />
So using him as a source was not only counter productive to your argument but also shows that you don't research your sources very closely for credibility which brings into further doubt the validity of your other sources.  Which in college can get you kicked from an English class (its almost as serious as plagarism)<br />
<br />
For links on Mr. Bellesiles fraud try these...<br />

<br />
The Continuing Fall of Michael Bellesiles (http://www.libertysearch.com/articles/2001/000110.html)<br />
<br />
SO Kullaas, now we have your sources credibility broken on several counts.  First they are from a biased source.  Second they are incomplete and third  you use a liar who is under heavy scrutiny and whose name is essentially mud.<br />
<br />
BTW you may be pissed at me right now for this but trust me if you ever get a tough English teacher in college you will thank me for burning you now as the teacher might not be so forgiving.<br />
<br />
I've just kept arguing 'cause I refuse to accept that the answer to a safer nation is to arm the populace, which I believe is wrong and probably will continue to believe is wrong no matter what you throw at me. You're probably doing the same thing on your side of it. I know, I argue this all the time with my best friend.<br />
<br />
At least that is an honest answer.<br />
<br />
I feel that most people are not responsible enough to be in possession of lethal weapons, and you've said nothing to change my mind about that. <br />
<br />
Then I have to ask you how responsible is enough?  Furthermore if you can't trust citizens with guns then how can you trust them with the vote?  The ability to control the destiny of the most powerful nation on Earth is infinitely more dangerous than the ownership of guns.<br />
<br />
If you truly think that the government needs to be controlling our lives then I have to ask why do you feel the vote is even necessary?  You say people are too stupid or irresponsible to handle firearms and yet you contend they are responsible enough to select a commander in chief capable of launching nuclear weapons or ordering the invasion of another country.<br />
<br />
Your logic fails me.  Its a very similar fallacy to pilots not owning guns.  You trust the pilot with lives everyday and not to purposefully crash the plane but you won't trust the pilot to defend himself and the ****pit and thus the entire plane's worth of passengers.  Where is the logic?  A cunning pilot bent on killing the passengers is just going to down the plane.<br />
<br />
Also why do you think policemen or military personel are responsible enough to use firearms but not citizens?  Those police and military personel are themselves just citizens.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I find it interesting you have so little faith in your fellow man in one area but trust them in another area that is even more dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So apparently the US made a concerted effort to put more criminals behind bars and viola! less crime per capita than England. <br />
<br />
Well lets see.. the murder rate is dropping also... and we are armed... give it a few more years and I'll wager that England pulls ahead of us as the trend seems to be in every other graph AND in the murder graph though just a little more slowly.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the PUNISHMENT of gun related crimes has been something the NRA and most Pro-gunners have been pushing for decades.<br />
<br />
The one question I have to ask liberals is you have several THOUSAND gun laws on the books now but you don't enforce them.. WHY then do you feel the need for more?<br />
<br />
Enforce the ones you have and see if they work properly then make a decision about whether or not they have an impact on the system.<br />
<br />
Gun sentencing is most often the FIRST thing thrown out in plea bargains and quite often ignored by DAs when prosecuting as the laws currently on the books are ambiguous and unclear and hard to prosecute.<br />
<br />
That report shows that an armed Sociecty is closing the gap or in several cases surpassing an unarmed society in multiple crime sectors.<br />
<br />
Furthermore if this report so clearly proves the Anti-gun point then why did the Clinton administration quietly release the report and tried NOT to draw attention to it when if it does what you say they should've been brow beating congress with it to get legislation pushed?  The reason... it was DETRIMENTAL to the anti-gun claims that were being falsely made the years prior to the report.<br />
<br />
Its a report from a source that is anti-gun that was tucked away...  You all seem to be ignoring that fact.<br />
<br />
(not to mention I purposely chose that source cause if you attacked the credibility of that source you also attack the credibility of your own sources.... its one of the nastiest debate tactics out there... its a essentially a checkmate on that front... you can't disavow the source without disavowing your own credibility for relying on that source in other areas)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a different analysis.  On page 9 of the report (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cjusew96a.pdf) you listed you'll see some charts showing the stats for 6 different crimes per capita in the US and England.  All the US crime rates except for burglery show the same pattern: a dip in the early 80's, a rise peaking around 1990 and then another dip.  This includes car thefts.  In my opinion car thieves don't use guns to steal cars--the car they steal is generally unattended. Yet car thefts show the same dip-rise-dip pattern that the violent crimes have.  To me that means that gun laws (or lack there of) had nothing to do with the crime patterns in the US (see previous post).<br />
<br />
Now let's look at England's crime patterns.  There's no real discernable pattern that matches all the charts except that they all generally go up.  All, that is, except for murder rates.  Dispite a general rising of crime murder rates are pretty much flat line.<br />
<br />
You're just plain wrong regarding some of your history (Taiwan and the Phillipines, for example) and I have countered many of your stats (I'll have to look into the Washington DC stuff).  Looks to me like your bomb has fizzled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You said it I didn't.... if gun laws have no effect on crime then why do you support them?<br />
<br />
Also the murder rate is narrowing, and yet more people today own firearms than in any other time in American history.<br />
<br />
Increase in firearms = steadily declining murder rate</div></div><hr />

It's all becoming clear now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or how bout you just admit that statistics on *both* sides of the debate are wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly how have you proven me wrong on Taiwan or the Phillipines?<br />
<br />
Or for that matter any other country I listed.<br />
<br />
You say China and Russia ended up as bad or worse off than before but I contend that the armed populace fighting the Tryant at the time got exactly what they were fighting for... they just didn't realize it would be as bad as what they lived under...<br />
<br />
In otherwords the the Bulsheviks thought Communism would be the save all of everyone.. sadly it just didn't turn out that way but you can't argue that it isn't what they fought for.<br />
<br />
Furthermore lets look at why Britain which up until the 1900 was an ARMED society.<br />
<br />
It was considered customary for EVERY gentleman to own a revolver... in fact if you didn't it considered a major cultural nono.<br />
<br />
Then what event occured in the late 1800s?  I'll give you a hint.. I mentioned just above this... The Bulsheviks.<br />
<br />
The ruling classes of Europe were scared ****less of the Bulshevik revolution and so to counter the possibilty of revolt many European nations confiscated their citizens arms.<br />
<br />
It had NOTHING to do with crime and NOTHING to murder rates.  It was simply a power grab by the ruling classes.<br />
<br />
Oddlly enough in WWII since Britain was disarmed they asked help from the Americans (who were armed) to send over guns.  Literally private citizens sent Boat loads upon boat loads of hunting rifles pistols and various other guns that were owned from private US citizens and given to British citizens for the Home Guard.<br />
<br />
After the war was over however the British again confiscated the weapons.  The Americans however replaced their weapons.<br />
<br />
Furthermore lets look at WHEN crime rates in this country and in Britain began to soar.  It happens to coincide VERY closely with the introduction of the TV.<br />
<br />
Furthermore In South Africa crime and murder also escalated in correlation with the introduction of mass TV.<br />
<br />
Furthermore for those that don't think TV doesn't frick with your brain you might want to try reading this nice articles which happen to also come from a semi-liberal source heavily advocating things like enviornmentalism and population control.<br />
<br />
Brainwashing (http://www.dieoff.com/page24.htm)<br />
TV Mutants (http://www.dieoff.com/page22.htm)<br />
Electronic Heroin (http://www.dieoff.com/page21.htm)<br />
<br />
In one of the articles it states that the scientist doing brain wave testing on subjects watching TV vs reading showed that there was a distinct difference in brain activity and that when watching TV you go into a passive mode and simply absorb information without fully processing it.<br />
<br />
Furthmore lets look at crimes rates and some of the national phenomenon.  Crime has steadily DECLINED in the 1990s but what else came about in the 1990s that would draw Americans AWAY from TVs.<br />
<br />
Thats right the Internet.  Which is an interactive and READ medium thus forcing the brain to comprehend what its absorbing.  Furthermore Interactive TV in the form of video games and some of the newer programs was also reaching its height in the 1990s.<br />
<br />
Furthermore widespread ownership of guns and even Automatic and semi-automatic guns were prevailent in the first half of the 20th century but we didn't have rampant crime.  Also at the time the dominant form of entertainment was books and some radio.<br />
<br />
After WWII and the introduction of the TV we see crime patterns swell.  With relatively no change in gun ownership.<br />
<br />
Then we take users of TV away and replace it with the Internet which is a READ medium and again there is little difference in gun ownership and we see crime begin to decline.<br />
<br />
FREAKY pattern isn't it?<br />
<br />
Now here is the kicker... I'm not one to blame objects (like liberals like to do with guns) but I think its just a little strange that with the introduction of a device that makes the brain go into Alpha Waves in under 30 seconds and then the subsequent rise in crime and general immorality is a little TOO wierd don't you?<br />
<br />
Perhaps what liberals SHOULD be going after is TVs...</div></div><hr />

I *never* said *anything* about the responsibility of the voting population, you're again putting words in my mouth.  I may think people are responsible or they aren't when it comes to voting, you wouldn't have a clue what I believe in that area, stop assuming.  I'm not going to mention it because it doesn't have a place in this debate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your logic fails me. Its a very similar fallacy to pilots not owning guns.

<br />
Tel, when the hell did I say I think pilot's shouldn't be allowed to have guns?  When?  I've never said that.  In fact, I think that if *anyone* should be allowed to have a gun, you might as well allow a pilot to carry one.  You're putting words in my mouth because you can't argue with my logic, so you're inventing things that you want to argue with.<br />
<br />
Also why do you think policemen or military personel are responsible enough to use firearms but not citizens? Those police and military personel are themselves just citizens. <br />
<br />
Why are military and police more responsible to use firearms than the average citizen?  What kind of a question is that???  They're TRAINED.  Trained to handle a gun properly, trained to use a gun, trained to keep the safety on when they're not using it.  That was an incredibly stupid question.<br />
<br />
I think you've given up trying to argue our points with personal attacks, Tel.  This is getting lame fast.  I don't even know what it is you're arguing anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't been able to find crime stats for individual cities (except for www.gunowers.org--hardly unbiased).  Anybody have some links?  So far I have found this (http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_00/00crime2.pdf).  On the last page of the &quot;Crime Index Total&quot; chapter is a chart breaking up the US into 4 regions with their per-capita crime rates.  Guess which area has the highest violent crime rates?  The south (which includes Texas).  And guess which area has the least gun-control laws?  That's right, the south.  Admittedly this is hardly conclusive by itself, but I'm still looking.<br />

<br />
Well, since Tel doesn't want to guess, I'll give it a shot.  I'd assume that the U.S. crimerate is down primarily for the fact that the economy is good and has been for years.  Good economy = less crime.  Less poverty = less crime.  I hope this is a correlation most people are not going to argue with.<br />
<br />
The statistics of crime in general could all be due to any number of factors, though I think the murder rate is one that could be looked at as being partially responsible by the availability of guns in the U.S.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How am I dodging?<br />
<br />
I provided TV as a directly related correlation to violence a pattern that is supported by proponents on both the left and the right.<br />
<br />
Also gun ownership(both in number and types) was a CONSTANT for over 100 years of American history but the crime swell and TV ownership are soemthing only fresh in the latter half.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I reenforce that conclusion with the fact that as people get involved in interactive TV(which changes brain patterns from passive to active) and the Internet that crime rates fall again?<br />
<br />
Its a very tight pattern that seems to be ignored by gun-control proponents.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying ban TV but perhaps studies on TV watching and related crime should be conducted even further.<br />
<br />
The trends so far are just a little too wierd.<br />
<br />
Guns being around can't account for the low crime in the first half of the century.  Furthermore with the increase in gun purchases over the pass ten years but a decline in crime and murder rates doesn't jive with your arguments either.<br />
<br />
Yet TV viewership DOES.  TV ratings are hurting BAD today.  The internet is siphoning off many viewers and in turn the crime rate is dropping.  <br />
<br />
Why are you just passing this over as nonsense?  Too afraid to lose your soap operas and sitcoms?  The corrolation is there and its obvious.</div></div><hr />

AHH I see.  Well forgive me for operating the normal mode of most americans in assuming that people trust the voters.<br />
<br />
So which is it?  do you trust voters or distrust them?<br />
<br />
If you distrust them then that makes your side look a lot more consistant though I would have to ask why the hell are you living the US?  Or would I be wrong in assuming that also?<br />

Or how about Taiwan. An Armed resistance movement which has secured (for the time being) independence from a represive Chinese government.<br />
Wrong.  Taiwan was created when the Chinese Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan with the National Army in 1949.  The independence of Taiwan has nothing to do with armed citizens and everything to do with the Taiwanese Army and the US Navy.<br />
<br />
Tel said:<br />
Or how about the Phillipines and several wars over there securing their independence<br />
Wrong again.  The Philippines were ceded to the U.S. in 1899 by the Treaty of Paris after the Spanish-American War.  Howard Taft was it's first govenor.  Starting in 1916 the US began initiating self-rule for the Philippines which was intended to give them their full independence around 1946 but probably later.  The Japanese invation speeded up the process.  In return for their support the Filipinos were promised full independence after the war. The Philippines achieved full independence on July 4, 1946.  Note that this had nothing to do with an armed populace.<br />
<br />
Then what event occured in the late 1800s? I'll give you a hint.. I mentioned just above this... The Bulsheviks<br />
Some more faulty history.  The Bolsheviks didn't start until 1903 and were nothing more than a fringe political group until the Russian Revolution in 1917.<br />

You say China and Russia ended up as bad or worse off than before but I contend that the armed populace fighting the Tryant at the time got exactly what they were fighting for... they just didn't realize it would be as bad as what they lived under... <br />

Now you're really reaching.  Blaming violent crime on TV? I do agree that TV is an incredible drain on the mind.  As I've said I watch very little TV.<br />
<br />
And is it just me or is the term &quot;liberal&quot; thrown around a little too much?  It's beginning to sound like Hillary Clinton and the &quot;conservative conspiracy&quot;.<br />

Whether or not I trust voters is irrelevant to the issue.  Yeah, the fate of our country lies in their hands, yada yada yada.  Some other time I'll argue it, but it's irrelevant to this discussion.<br />
<br />
You're branding me for making up ideas that have nothing to do with this arguement (such as saying &quot;I'm ASKING you to justify how you can trust people to vote&quot;) in order to say that I'm in the wrong on this issue as well.  That's pretty Nazi-ish of you, isn't it, Tel?<br />
<br />
Yes, voting is a big deal.  But I'm not going to give you fodder so you can go on about your &quot;stupid liberals&quot; ideals by giving my opinion on it when it doesn't belong in this debate.<br />
<br />
And you're probably going to yell at me and say that it does belong in this debate.  It doesn't.  What we're debating is whether or not guns should be regulated/banned in the U.S., and whether I trust voters or not may also be reflected by my views on gun-control, it's a seperate issue, so drop it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think responsibilty has everything to do with this argument.<br />
<br />
More over when arguments have overlapping substance (i.e. responsibilty in voting and gun ownership as they apply to rights) then it is a perfectly legitimate tactic in debate to debunk one idea by attacking the other.<br />
<br />
And more over since guns were placed in the constitution to protect the people from tyranny and thus protect their rights including the right to vote it has very real relevance to this issue.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
But ok I'll drop it though I have to wonder what angle your coming at on a lot of things now since your leaving the question unanswered.<br />
<br />
Though how you came up with me being Nazi'ish due to me trying to draw you out for further debate is beyond me.  Nazis generally try to get their opponents to shut up either through killing them or beating them down.<br />
<br />
I've simply argued point upon point with a smattering of goading to egg people on... not my fault you got upset at the name calling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I started to look at the court cases that supposedly show that the police don't protect us, we must protect ourselves.  So I started with the first one: DeSHANEY vs. WINNEBAGO COUNTY (http://www.soc.umn.edu/~samaha/cases/deshaney_v_winnebago_county.htm).  The case has nothing to do with police or guns.  A boy was tragically abused by his father and was suing the county Social Services for not removing him (the boy) from his father's home before the abuse started (the SS department had some reports of abuse).<br />
<br />
Do I need to look at more cases or are the going to be similar crock? How in the world is this a case for owning guns?  If this is the quality of the arguments that the pro-gun crowd uses I am totally underwhelmed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The case has nothing to do with police or guns. <br />
<br />
Actually Social services would be the equivilent of police in that case.  Basically all those court cases say the police or for that matter any government agency is NOT responsible for your personal safety.<br />
<br />
Respondents are social workers and other local officials <br />
<br />
The claim the child made was that the inaction of the Social Service and other local officials deprived him...<br />
<br />
Petitioner sued respondents claiming that their failure to act deprived him of his liberty<br />
<br />
Note that the child who was abused lost his case against the Social Services as the judge did NOT find them responsible for his protection.<br />
<br />
We hold that it did not.<br />
<br />
For an article that goes over various court cases and their decisions which support the premise of &quot;The government is not responsible for your personal protection only responsible for maintaining general law and order go read this (http://www.outlawslegal.com/friendly/dreamin.htm)<br />
<br />
So if the government is not responsible for protecting you who is?<br />
<br />
Also Taiwan's Army was an army of rebels.  By that point yes they had been organized but that isn't how they started out.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the Phillipines has been a hotbed of revolutionary movements several times.  Its partly why Spain gave them up and later the US.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore the idea that just because armed uprisings have failed in some of the pass encounters is no reason not to be prepared and try again in the future.<br />
<br />
There have been equally unsuccessful peaceful uprisings.<br />
<br />
China being an exemple... student protests did a whole lot there.  Or how about Falon Gong(sp?) they are peacefully resisting but they seem to be making little impact in China.<br />
<br />
Or various Soviet uprisings during the 80 years of reign... without weapons they were squashed.<br />
<br />
Or how about Chechnya... I don't agree with their beliefs or their tactics but as an armed rebelling province they've kept the great bear of the north plenty busy.<br />
<br />
Just because the outcome isn't democracy every time doesn't mean that the people didn't get what they wanted when they stood up and fought.  It just might be what they wanted was as bad or worse than what they previously lived under.<br />
<br />
So essentially your saying that we shouldn't even try to resist a Tyrant (should one come to power) with guns cause its futile.  And I would say even if I knew the outcome was going to be loss of everything dear to me I would still fight cause the losses I might inflict upon the tyrant might stop him from spreading that Tyranny and might possibly interfere with his plans.<br />
<br />
You want to roll over live quietly under the whip of oppression thats your business but don't try and defang me and force me to live under oppression with you.<br />
<br />
Also Kullaas I have to wonder if your actually reading the arguments here.  If more guns = more crime then why are all our crime rates going down including murder if the American people are buying more guns than ever?<br />
<br />
Also why didn't this crime wave state at the end of the civil war when the introduction of semi-automatic and shortly after that automatic weaponry become available?<br />
<br />
The fact is the crime increase started after WWII and it just so happens to coincide with the mass introduction of the TV.<br />
<br />
Also its shown in several scientific tests that TV watching Affects the brain and how it processes things.<br />
<br />
Why is it unreasonable to say then that when a device is altering out Brain wave activity and patterns that it be equated to a change of behavior in this case immorality which includes amongst other things murder, theft, sex, and various other taboos.<br />
<br />
You also didn't read the aritcles I linked to obviously.  It specifically states that after scientist found this change in brain wave activity that Ads PURPOSELY changed how they made ads.<br />
<br />
They started using suggestive patterning to tell women they were not adequate (kinda like we constantly hear woman claiming they will never look like a super model).<br />
<br />
Or the wide spread use of male stereotypical &quot;perfection&quot; which often bred a sense of inadequacy.<br />
<br />
Also psychologist have stated that when feeling threatened (which feeling inadequate leads to) people tend to behave more violently.<br />
<br />
So why is it a far cry to say that along with stats in crime going up in concert with the purchase of television sales going up is not the cause of crime?<br />
<br />
More over gun ownership has remained fairly flat with a few blips of low and highs that in no CONSISTANT way correlate to crime rates.... Kinda the pass ten years... increase in gun sales for the pass several years and yet crime is down... nevermind in those same ten years internet usage also soared to high levels and TV ratings are struggling.<br />
<br />
There is a pattern there too string to dismiss.<br />
<br />
Now I won't say ban TV cause to be honest I think as sentient creatures that once we are made aware of how we are being manipulated we are able to overcome that manipulation and TVs do have many useful purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, have you considered that maybe we have reached a saturation level?  Adding more guns isn't creating more crime because it's like adding salt to an already saturated solution: theres no effect because there is already so much salt in there?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The crime problem has only been a problem for about 50 years.<br />
<br />
This means that guns which are a constant had no effect for at least 50 years and in most scientific circles would mean that since levels of guns are roughly the same they should produce no affect.<br />
<br />
The introduction of TV however happened roughly 50 years ago and shortly after the crime wave got going.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many other ways to tell you that gun levels are not affecting crime.<br />
<br />
Your blaming a piece of metal when the problem is a social problem.  Find how to fix the social problem and the &quot;gun problem&quot; (not that there is one) fixes itself.<br />

Have you thought that it's possible this is because our police are actually catching criminals now?<br />
<br />
If you read the crime report you linked to earlier, it mentions that in some cases this holds true.  England has a lower percentage of reported rape as well as rape convictions for both the reasons that more rapes are reported in the U.S. and that the English authorities don't always apprehend rapists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I stated before, crime is probably down primarily due to the soaring U.S. economy.<br />
<br />
You make a point with television inciting violent behavior in people, because it does.  However, the high availability of guns gives people a very easy and accessible way to vent that anger, which also occurs.  Did you happen to hear about the German student that got angry for being expelled and shot up his school, killing 17 people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the rest of us, we will keep buying and owning them thank you.<br />
<br />
By the way, a person on drugs can resist pepper spray and tazors, and can take 6 guys to bring down, but a good ole .45 will stop him where he stands if used correctly from what I understand. <br />
<br />
I own many guns, mostly for hunting, some for target shooting, some for just collecting. I enjoy them alot, but I hope I never have to use one in defense. Most rational law biding folks probly feel the same way. It's those criminals who feel otherwise.<br />
<br />
This age old argument will never change.<br />
<br />
Won't to put a BIG dent in gun related crimes? Raise the bar on punishment, bring on capital murder and harsher sentencings. None of this airconditioning, weight bench, three meals a day stuff, but how bout breaking up rocks with a hammer for 14 hours a day times 30 years? Might deter some folks from breakin the law if they faced this.<br />
<br />
Right now, all crimes are getting worse because criminals have no respect for the judicial system. Ppl get off at the drop of a hat, or at best only serve a few months/years. To most of these guys, prison is where their friends are anyhoo, so it's like Yay! Get to go see my homies for a few months and build my rep on the streets. Then go back and break some more laws, cause they won't do nothing to me if they catch me, type of attitude.<br />
<br />
I will say it again.<br />
<br />
Guns don't kill, criminals with guns kill.<br />
<br />
But if your argument is youre worried about owning a firearm, because of you family getting accidently shot by it, then by all means, don't buy one. You will sleep better I am sure.<br />
<br />
Course, nobody in my family's history, at least as far as I am aware (my great-grandfather on both sides) has EVER been shot. And my entire family has owned numerous guns throughout it's history.</div></div><hr />

That is true. Of course by making Guns illeagel you will not be taking guns away from the criminals, you will be taking them away from the law abiding citizins. See, criminals do not care about breaking laws and will still have their illeagel weapons. They will not turn them in just because it is against the law to have them. Most of them have guns that are illeagel now.</div></div><hr />

This argument is somewhat of a fallacy.  Murderes don't care about breaking the law so we might as well not have murder laws.  People still cheat on their taxes so we might as well remove tax laws.<br />
<br />
Yes, we all agree that outlawing guns will not totally eradicate their use, just as having police on the streets does not eradicate crime.  What gun-control advocates contend is that outlawing guns will lower violent crime and gun-related deaths.</div></div><hr />

I contend that it would raise them. <br />
It is known that putting a sign in front of your house that says your property is protected by a security system will reduce the probability of break in even if there isn't a system in place. So if you remove the probability that there is even a security system present wouldn't if make sense that break ins would rise?<br />
I content that the same is true for guns. If you make it illegal for me to carry or own a pistol then there are people who would see that as weakness to exploit.</div></div><hr />

That is the point, what they contend is wrong. Your comments about Murder are not valid in the same way. We are not talking about making an action criminal, we are talking about making an object used in a crime criminal to have. Follow this logic.<br />
<br />
A man is going to Rob a bank, or a gang member is going to do a drive by shooting. He goes where ever criminals keep their guns (drawer maybe?) and takes out his ILLEGAL gun and goes out to commit a crime.<br />
<br />
Forward ahead to 1 year later, after guns have been made Illegal and criminal is going to commit another crime. he goes to the same drawer, gets the same ILLEGAL gun he always had and commits another crime. <br />
<br />
How did making guns illegal help here??</div></div><hr />

Interesting...if you got rid of laws against murder, then murder rates would shoot up. It's not comparable to owning a gun, guns aren't used solely for murder, they are often used to protect yourself. Murder laws protect innocent people, and so do guns.</div></div><hr />

OK Smokimon, explain this:  Tel was kind enough to post a link to a comparison of US and English crime rates (which we have hashed over).  6 different types of crimes are compared (eg. car thefts, rape, robbery).  In 5 of the catagories the per-capita crime in England is higher.  The one crime that is less in England as compared to the US is murder.  And it's not even close--the murder rate in the US is almost six times as high.  Please explain this if it can't be attributable to guns.  It seems obvious to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain why then, that Mexico (a country where firearms ownership is virtually prohibited), has a higher homicide rate then the US?<br />
<br />
Explain why Switzerland, a country where households are required to have a fully-automatic military assault weapon - the homocide rate is lower?<br />
<br />
The proliferation of guns in a society doesn't cause or facilitate the unlawful killing of another human being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Saldrin... the posting of the England vs USA crime stats was not to show that guns lowered/raised crime it was to show that guns have no or little impact on crime rate and that other factors are what are responsible for controlling crime.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the graphs state that Englands murder rate trend is ALSO going up while the US is going down.  Yes right of this moment we are leading England but that gap is closing and yet why is it the armed nation is going down?<br />
<br />
I'll admit that is has nothing at all to do with guns pro or anti... and has everything to do with more efficient policing and more severe punishments.<br />
<br />
In Englands case their courts have been getting more and more lax about punishment where as in the US punishments have been getting more severe especially as more and more states are giving up on the myth of rehabilitation and are returning simply to what worked for centuries which is incarceration or even execution.<br />
<br />
Furthermore Police here are doing a better job of tracking down criminals than in England.  Scotland Yard reported that they would be heavily short on men to keep up with crime and that they lacked the tools and resources to examine and collect evidence as efficiently as their American counterparts.  England refuses to contribute more money to their police force to help in alleviating these problems.<br />
<br />
The US however has had nearly 2 decades of mayors, governors, and every other official running on crime prevention platforms and almost always they throw money in the direction of the police to help keep the police apace of criminal activity.<br />
<br />
Bringing in Saldrin's two examples just goes to show further that murder rates are not tied to gun control.<br />
<br />
An armed society with record low crime and murder rate and a gun control society with horrible murder rates.<br />
<br />
So if murder rate is not tied to gun control then what is it tied to?<br />
<br />
Perhaps immorality?  But we would hate to advocate anything that might mean a return to traditional values and tell some people in the country that are simply living wrong.</div></div><hr />

We have guns in the United States.  The fact that we have guns means we have a higher homicide rate than other countries without guns.  Therefore, if we got rid of guns, the homicides would decrease.<br />
<br />
What I get from that is that somehow guns either cause or facilitate homicides.<br />
<br />
The point I am making - given the examples I have - is that the presence of guns in a society has no effect whatsoever on that society's homicide rate.<br />

Hey now, where have I used nonsensical stats?<br />
<br />
Saldrin said:<br />
Explain why then, that Mexico (a country where firearms ownership is virtually prohibited), has a higher homicide rate then the US?<br />
I'd like to see some links on this.  My first reaction is that Mexico and the US are in very different socio-economic spheres.  The point with comparing the US and England is not only do they share very similar cultural mores but have similar economic levels.<br />
<br />
Tel said:<br />
Furthermore the graphs state that Englands murder rate trend is ALSO going up while the US is going down<br />
Can you tell me what page (or chart)  that is?  On page 9 the chart for murder rates in England shows no increase.<br />
<br />
Saldrin said:<br />
Explain why Switzerland, a country where households are required to have a fully-automatic military assault weapon - the homocide rate is lower?<br />
According to this (http://www.guncontrol.ca/Content/International.html) page Swiss citizens are not required to have a gun in their house and that the actual rate of ownership of guns is comparable to Canada.  (Caveat--this page is pro-gun control  and so is suspect, but no less than hear-say on Swiss gun ownership).</div></div><hr />

There are 3 guns in my household, all hunting rifles.  Gun ownership is very prevalent in Montana and we have a low crime rate with guns.  In fact, as a whole, the US has a lower violent crime rate than nations with banned or stringent gun control policies, such as the UK.  (and yet some nations with even more liberal gun ownership laws like Switzerland, where all citizens are required by law to own an assault rifle, have far less crime)<br />
<br />
The only murders that occurred in my town were committed with a knife.  In the latest case, a man walked into a beauty parlor and knifed the patrons and employees to death.  (he is still at large as well)<br />
<br />
If any of them had a firearm they would likely still be alive today.  Gun control is unilateral victim disarmament.  You'll notice why so many people die in school shootings-- no one can defend themselves.  The &quot;law&quot; of no guns in school zones only keeps honest people honest.<br />
<br />
As far as teachers go-- a concealable soft body armor vest is approximately $600 and will stop all handgun and shotgun rounds.  (save the massive blunt trauma especially associated with a .44 magnum)  You can even get them with virtual immunity to all stabbing and slashing weapons.  Non-lethal deterrants such as pepper spray and stun guns are also available.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you want to kill people en masse-- explosives or NBC weapons are far more effective than guns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peryn</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, i think everyone owning a gun is your own choice.  You can shout anti gun till someone breaks into your house with a knife while you wish you had a gun to stop them from hurting you, your wife/husband, or your kids.  <br />
<br />
If someone attacked your kids, im sure you wouldnt have trouble killing them with a gun out of rage/self defence.  <br />
<br />
Saying that we should ban guns becasue they kill people is stupid.  Just like the mother Sueing Verant cause her son commited suicide over it, or saying we should ban driving becasue people die in car crashes.  If we ban guns, and it actually works (wont happen though, meaning people will still own guns) something else would happen.  For example, a burgler breaks into your home weilding a katana or other type of sword.  How are you supose to defend yourself? a steak knife? granted, if used right anything can kill, if you get the surprise.  However a 12 gage slug to any body armor will kill him VERY well.  Guns save lives.  They also end them .  Im willing to bet that if it came down to it, going anti gun and letting your kids get hurt, or shooting them, you would pick up the gun.  <br />
<br />
Yes, people die in shooting.  Murders happen.  But banning guns wont stop it.  Prime example (and im very sorry if i offend anyone) is September 11th.  NO guns were used.  And people still died.  If the pilots had a 9mm, maybe they could have stopped them, i dont know.  But it is an example of how people without guns can kill people.  <br />
<br />
Now.. all you anti-gun people can watch over your family with your trusty Cell-Phone, while i go clean my 12 gage =)<br />

Go back and read what we have said.  NOBODY has said that banning guns will stop murders.  Pro-gun people keep debating the wrong argument.  What we say is that it will LOWER murders.  The evidence in Britain seems to bear that out.<br />
<br />

I will never use a gun against a person for any reason. I would use a bat, rolling pin, sword, or whatever, but I would never keep a gun for defense, nor would I use it against a person, even one hurting my child.<br />

<br />
Except that the robber being an unlawful citizen in the first place will still be able to get a gun while you the lawful citizen get to sit back and watch your family get robbed and shot or worse.<br />
<br />
What we say is that it will LOWER murders. The evidence in Britain seems to bear that out <br />
<br />
May want to look at the chart a little more closely and you may want to consider other countries in your statistics.  Britain homocide rate is on the INCREASE while the US is on the decrease and then there was the example of Mexico with its huge murder rate and then there was the example of Switzerland with a fully armed society (by law) and very low homocide rates.  Also in a couple years when Britain surpasses the US (which its expected to do) what will you say then?<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting that teachers--as a normal precaution--wear body armor? Wouldn't it just make more sense for guns to be banned except by law-enforcement officers?<br />
<br />
Again banning guns doesn't stop gangs and murderers from attaining them... it only stops lawful citizens.  A ban on guns is kinda like a lock on your house.  It only keeps honest people honest but it doesn't do anything to stop someone who is unlawful from going ahead and breaking the door down or in this case obtaining a weapon.<br />
<br />
Essentially Anti-gun advocates are favoring a law which punishes the innocent and encourages the guilty.<br />
<br />
Furthermore there are examples on both sides of how guns present effect crime.  what does this say?  Perhaps that guns have NO effect pro or con on crime and that something else does?  Perhaps morals?  Perhaps something that the left fears more than anything?  The legislation of certain moral measuring sticks?  <br />
<br />
Now admittedly I'd be against legislating morals in many areas due oddly enough to my Christian beliefs but nobody can deny that if we lived in a moral society that we would never have a crime problem whether guns were around or not.<br />
<br />
So if guns have no affect on crime and morals do then that brings us back to the original purpose our forefathers had in mind when they wrote the 2nd amendment.  To keep our government in check at gun point.  And sense the opposing side seems to think we would get smeared by our army cause we use hunting rifles that means we need to repeal all those laws on auto-matic weapons so that we have hardware equivilent to the standing army and thus will be able to fight back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was about to ask the very same thing.<br />
<br />
It remind me of something I heard in Wizard's First Rule.<br />
<br />
Zed and Richard(I think) were talking about death through magic or death through other means.<br />
<br />
People fear death through magic but why?  Was death through magic anymore dead than death from a sword or drowning in a lake or dying asleep in your bed?<br />
<br />
Dead is dead.  The how is irrelevant as far as the reaper is concerned.<br />
<br />
Thus I have to ask if you kill someone with a bat or a rolling pin how is it any different than killing with a gun?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Along with Aizle &amp; Tel I have to point out that using a gun to defend yourself or your child does not mean you have to kill someone. I am pretty sure that you shoot someone in the knee who is about to attack your kid and they are going to have a tough time continuing.<br />
<br />
What we say is that it will LOWER murders.  <br />
<br />
Once again, someone who will break the law by commiting murderwill have no problem breking the law by killing with an illeagal weapon.<br />
<br />
I would be interested in knowing how many Murders and done with Legal, registered guns and how many are done with illegal ones. My guess is that illegal would FAR outweigh the legal ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you think that someone killed with a bat is somehow more humane or less violent than with a gun? <br />
No, but I'd wager I'm a lot less likely to kill someone with a bat than with a gun. Disable, yes, kill, no.<br />
<br />
To answer Smoki - I know a gun doesn't have to kill, but to have one for defense, I'd have to have one in my home, which I won't do. I'm not going to be able to use it to defend myself against someone armed with a gun, who would be infinately more willing to use his than I would be to use mine, and probably a better shot. If the attacker doesn't have a gun, the items I have around the house to bludgeon him will be more than sufficient.<br />
<br />
I also carry a mace/pepper spray combo in my car. I'm not against defending myself, and I'm not against someone else's right to keep a controlled, registered gun. I simply will not own one, fire one, or allow one in my house.<br />
<br />
I do take offense that someone would presume to know me well enough to think I would abandon my opposition to having guns in my home for my own gain. Unlike some people, I believe that principles are meant to be kept to all the time, not just when circumstances make it easy to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect you are reading more into his comment than was meant Myrea.  I think he was saying that if you needed to defend yourself/children/whatever and a gun was what was available, that you would likely use it.<br />
<br />
I respect your decision not to have a gun in the house to use for defence, and in fact think that it's a good one.  Of the 4 firearms I own, none of them are loaded at this point, and all are in cases.  I don't use them for protection, I use them for recreation.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, wrong, and wrong.  You're not looking at the right charts Tel.  If you go to page 9 on the report (go here (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cjusew96a.pdf)) you will see that English murder rate is pretty much flat.  You WILL see, however, that US murder rate has fluctuated.  Yes, murder rate in the US is going down right now, but it roughly matches the murder rate in 1984.  You can not guarantee that murder will not go back up.  If you are going to continue to insist that the murder is going up please supply a page number because I'm missing that stat.<br />

Please supply a link.  I will not reverse my thinking on hear-say.<br />
<br />
and then there was the example of Switzerland with a fully armed society (by law) and very low homocide rates<br />
According to the link I supplied earlier, Swiss citizens are NOT required to have a gun and in fact have a gun ownership roughly equal to Canada.  Please supply a link if that info is wrong.  Otherwise the &quot;Swiss example&quot; is suspect.<br />
<br />

More rhetoric.  Tax laws punish those who don't cheat on their taxes.  Tax cheaters benifit so we should remove all taxes.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore there are examples on both sides of how guns present effect crime. what does this say? Perhaps that guns have NO effect pro or con on crime and that something else does?<br />
Ah, now we're getting somewhere.  If anything, all these examples we throw at each other could allow someone to come to this conclusion: guns don't effect crime rates.  If this is true, then why have them?  Why allow items that have no effect on crime but kill hundreds (thousands?) in accidents.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something that the left fears more than anything?<br />
What is all this talk about &quot;left&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot;?  I doubt the liberals would take me in.  Are you against gun-control because the left is for it?  Hardly a sound reason.<br />

<br />
Once again, someone who will break the law by commiting murderwill have no problem breking the law by killing with an illeagal weapon. <br />

<br />
Safer from?  Fact is accidents happen its not going to change anything.  However the removal of guns from the populace lends us to be more easily subdued to a tyranical government.<br />
<br />
Our forefathers thought of this reason and Americans throughout the generations have believed in this and Americans today still believe this.<br />
<br />
As been mentioned by several others on this board in various ways our government is getting more and more powerful and American policy both abroad and at home is leaning more and more towards Empire.  In and of itself Empire is neither good nor evil and certainly there are examples of both but the one thing all empires relied on was control of their populace and being controlled is an ideal not generally accepted by traditional American values.<br />
<br />
Sorry but the benefits of gun ownership far outweigh the risks of gun ownership especially when you consider tyranical governments in the past who were bent on Empire often had bloody purges.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to be able to use it to defend myself against someone armed with a gun, who would be infinately more willing to use his than I would be to use mine, and probably a better shot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm reading something into this more than I should but would it be more accurate to state that you are unsure whether or not you are capable of killing someone at all whether it be in self defense or otherwise?<br />
<br />
If you are simply unable to before hand think out that you can kill someone then I don't fault you at all.  It took me several years while a teenager (and to this day I review my readiness) to figure out that under circumstances of defense (myself or loved ones or those who can't defend themselves) I would have no qualms about killing someone.<br />
<br />
Some people however cannot dedicate themselves to making that decision and again its nothing to be ashamed of in my opinion.  However this is something I encourage all people who have guns or think they might use a gun in defense to consider.  If you are not 100% positively SURE that you can pull the trigger then NEVER NEVER pick up a gun.<br />
<br />
If an opponent senses that you are unwilling to pull the trigger then by picking up the gun you have increased the risk to yourself greatly as the assaulting party will attempt to disarm and probably kill you.<br />
<br />
If you pick up a gun and say &quot;not another step&quot; and the person steps, you fire.  If you don't then you have given confidence to your assailant which may be enough to encourage him/her to attack.<br />
<br />
Anyhow Myrea as I said if I'm reading something more into that than I should be then accept my apologies.<br />
<br />
I'm not against someone else's right to keep a controlled, registered gun.<br />
<br />
And its nice to know there are people out there who are unwilling to use guns themselves but are also willing to seperate themselves from the notion that their decision isn't what is best for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Wrong...  Britain has a higher violent crime rate than the US.  Further dispoving the so-called &quot;guns to crime&quot; relationship that gun control advocates find to be so intuitive.<br />
<br />
If you look at US cities in particular, you will find the highest crime areas are those with the most stringent gun control laws.  Yet those areas with more freedom of gun ownership (like my native Montana), have less crime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting that teachers--as a normal precaution--wear body armor? Wouldn't it just make more sense for guns to be banned except by law-enforcement officers?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why the heck not?  If it's very inexpensive, lightweight and concealable, and will protect you from getting shot or stabbed, sounds like a good deal to me if you view yourself &quot;at risk&quot;  (not that I do-- but some teachers are obviously concerned). Look at the number of police officers that wear it and how many lives soft body armor has saved per year.<br />
<br />
You all spend so many hours obtaining armor for fictional video game characters, would think you could see the value of it in RL as well :P<br />
<br />
<br />
But gun control will make it more difficult for them to get a weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it won't.  Laws only keep honest people, honest.  Even in countries where guns are absolutely prohibited, criminals obtain weapons easily-- and citizens are powerless to defend themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
unsure whether or not you are capable of killing someone at all whether it be in self defense or otherwise? <br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have to kill someone to make a gun effective as a self-defense tool.  Sometimes the sight alone will do it, or perhaps a warning shot.  If not, you can shoot the person in the leg or something which will probably not be fatal.<br />
<br />
&quot;This year will go down in history, for the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration. Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future&quot;<br />

I am open to discussion and compromise.  I might even guess that Aizle and I could come up with something that we could both begrudgenly agree with.  It is hard to do this when people turn a blind eye to anything that does not agree with their views.<br />
<br />
No, it will make it more difficult for law abiding people to get guns, will not stop Criminals from getting them<br />

Myrea, I don't know if I'm hearing this right or what, but you're saying that if someone was going after your child, you wouldn't use a gun to stop him/her if it was available?<br />

<br />
If you ban guns, it will keep the people who follow the law without them, and the people who want them to have them.  instead of doing major weapons, take drugs for example.  Most drugs are banned in the US, yet they are still abundant and sold for high prices.</div></div><hr />

You're not looking at the right charts Tel. If you go to page 9 on the report (go here) you will see that English murder rate is pretty much flat. You WILL see, however, that US murder rate has fluctuated. Yes, murder rate in the US is going down right now, but it roughly matches the murder rate in 1984. You can not guarantee that murder will not go back up. If you are going to continue to insist that the murder is going up please supply a page number because I'm missing that stat.<br />
 <br />
What was Canada, the UK, Australia's, XXX country of your choice with restrictive gun laws murder rates prior to their enacting strict gun control legislation?  My guess is that it was still substantially lower then the US to begin with.  <br />
 <br />
However since people still insist on comparing foreign crime rates with ours.. - look here:<br />
 <br />
http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvintl.html<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />

there was the example of Mexico <br />

Here you go:<br />

 <br />
quote: <br />
and then there was the example of Switzerland with a fully armed society (by law) and very low homocide rates <br />
 <br />
According to the link I supplied earlier, Swiss citizens are NOT required to have a gun and in fact have a gun ownership roughly equal to Canada. Please supply a link if that info is wrong. Otherwise the &quot;Swiss example&quot; is suspect.<br />
 <br />
You're correct, in a sense.  However the swiss military reserve system does allow folks to have in their homes fully-automatic military grade small arms, and ammunition.  I would venture to say that the proliferation of fully automatic weapons in Switzerland is greater than legally owned Class III weapons here in the States.<br />
 <br />
The point is, given the presence of these weapons in their country - based on the logic that somehow the presence of firearms in a given location increases the violent crime/homicide rate - one would expect Switzerland to have a higher violent crime/homicide rate.<br />
 <br />
It doesn't.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
quote: <br />
Essentially Anti-gun advocates are favoring a law which punishes the innocent and encourages the guilty <br />
 <br />
More rhetoric. Tax laws punish those who don't cheat on their taxes. Tax cheaters benifit so we should remove all taxes.<br />
 <br />
Cocaine is illegal.  Possession, sale and/or distribution of it is prohibited by law.  Yet one cannot say that by its prohibition,  it isn't present on our streets today.  Thousands of tons of the stuff make it into our country every year.<br />
 <br />
Are the people who buy/sell/use cocaine deterred by the fact that its illegal?  No.  <br />
 <br />
Murder, rape, assault and robbery are illegal in virtually every society in the modern world.  Does the fact that they are make it go away? No.<br />
 <br />
The logic absolutely defies me as to how an arbitrary law will affect those who refuse to abide by the law to begin with?<br />
 <br />
Since you tossed out England as an example, you are aware that one of the larger sources of weapons for the IRA is stolen weapons from US National Guard armories?  Should we take away the National Guard's guns too?<br />
 <br />
On May 19th, 1986 legislation was enacted prohibiting the circulation of newly manufactured Class III (fully automatic weapons) weapons for private ownership.  All legally owned fully automatic weapons in circulation were therefore accounted for.  In the 10 year period that followed, literally thousands of fully automatic weapons were confiscated in various jurisdictions in the US.  Most were ultimately traced to stolen weapons from military sources outside the United States.<br />
 <br />
Do you think it would be any different if ALL guns were banned and successfully confiscated from every single law abiding gun owner in the US?  <br />
 <br />
Do you think that if someone capable of smuggling in TONS of cocaine into the country, that they won't be equally as capable of smuggling firearms as well?  Who's hand do you think those firearms would end up in?  Can you say &quot;the criminals&quot;?  If so - you'd be right.<br />
 <br />
quote: <br />
Furthermore there are examples on both sides of how guns present effect crime. what does this say? Perhaps that guns have NO effect pro or con on crime and that something else does? <br />
 <br />
Ah, now we're getting somewhere. If anything, all these examples we throw at each other could allow someone to come to this conclusion: guns don't effect crime rates. If this is true, then why have them? Why allow items that have no effect on crime but kill hundreds (thousands?) in accidents. <br />
 <br />
Exactly the point.  There are huge cultural differences across the world that account for the crime rates in various places.  <br />
 <br />
Why allow them then?  Because the only person responsible for protecting you is YOU.  The police, as has been stated before, are under NO obligation to protect you.<br />
 <br />
I was a police officer for 5 years.  Ask me how many assaults or murders I prevented.  Ask me how many burglaries or robberies I prevented.  Ask me how many victims I was able to protect BEFORE they were victimized.<br />
 <br />
The answer is ZERO.<br />
 <br />
<br />
As for you claim about people being killed in accidents, you are aware that doctors kill more people in medical accidents than die from firearms accidents, yes?  <br />
 <br />
Check here to see more examples:<br />

But gun control will make it more difficult for them to get a weapon. Could people still get a gun? Of course. But if the laws limit the number of guns then we are safer for it.<br />

I'll let someone else answer that comment:<br />

...and you can buy dynamite over the counter in Kentucky, and I believe in Washinton state (not 100% sure about Washington).  One can also purchase black powder over the counter in all states.  So.. its easy to make explosives... how about diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate fertilizer?  Remember Oklahoma City?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Deeger how have I not addressed your arguements?<br />
<br />
I contend guns make me safer if I use them in self-defense.<br />
<br />
I contend it is the presence of an armed populace that has kept this country great for 200+ years.<br />
<br />
I've presented several other sources indicating as much as have other people on this thread.<br />
<br />
And lastly why should I compromise to reach a &quot;solution&quot; with you when clearly you are wrong.  Compromising with someone who has been unable to sufficiently prove their case or point out how my stances and collection of information is incorrect would be the absolute worse thing to do.<br />
<br />
When you are right you do not give in (perhaps why I play paladins).  You have failed repeatedly to debunk the information being presented here and have offered up no credible alternate source of information to counter ours (probably cause there is no source who has a credibility that wouldn't get shredded in seconds).<br />
<br />
You are essentially wanting us to compromise on your heresay something which you accuse us of all the time and which we quickly provide direct support for when called.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry Deeger your whole stance is emotionally charged with no factual pretext to back it up.<br />
<br />
I'll admit mine is perhaps equally emotionally charged but in conjunction with my emotion is reason and fact backing it.<br />
<br />
You say I'm paranoid but history has time and time again shown that large governments are not to be trusted and our Forefathers knew this and added the 2nd amendment for this purpose and to this day there are Americans who think the same way.<br />
<br />
Furthermore your hearing it from a cop and you have heard from the supreme court through earlier links... the Government has NO, NONE, NADA, ZIPPO obligation to protect you whether it be in the form of police or child protective services or any other agency.<br />
<br />
Your security is your responsibilty and as for me I will ensure my security and the security of my loved ones through armed measures.<br />
<br />
Oh and aside from the homemade explosives its fairly easy to get TNT if you know a good farm supply store in most states and as for rocket launchers well they don't help much in crimes since usually your trying to steal something in one piece so that is why you don't see them.  However the LAPD HoustonPD and several other big city PDs have over the years confiscated things ranging from grenades to rocket launchers tied to drug lords, mafias and gangs.<br />
<br />
Whole lotta good banning explosives did eh?  What makes you think banning guns would be any better?</div></div><hr />

Sorry but the benefits of gun ownership far outweigh the risks of gun ownership especially when you consider tyranical governments in the past who were bent on Empire often had bloody purges.<br />
This is a piece of the argument that I find interesting.  Just what, exactly, are the benefits of gun ownership?  Which of them cannot be served by some other means?  <br />
<br />
The problem with this entire argument is that we look at a complex social, political cultural, and economic situation, and take slices of it according to our desired position.  Nobody tells the whole story.  There was a perfect example earlier in this thread.  Somebody pointed out that there was more crime in Washington D.C. than in northern Virginia, despite the fact that Washington has stiffer gun control.  For the gun rights advocate, this is telling.  For the gun control advocate, it only brings up more question.  &quot;What about the social and economic conditions in Virginia?&quot;  What about law enforcement?&quot;   The same thing applies to comparisons to Britain and Mexico and Switzerland.  You can't just quote numbers without assessing the society as a whole.<br />
<br />
Is it not possible that areas with gun control tend to have more violent crime just because an increase in crime tends to induce people to try to control guns?  Where's the causal relationship?<br />
<br />
Here's some causal relationships I'm comfortable with.  The rate of death or serious injury is far higher in incidents involving a gun than in incidents involving other weapons.  This includes deliberate use or accidental misuse of the weapon.  This is because guns, being inherently more energetic, and requiring less skill to use effectively, are more dangerous than other commonly available weapons.<br />
<br />
So, if we accept the premise that guns are more dangerous than other weapons, then if we reduce the number of guns in circulation, then even if the number of other weapons is increased, we still end up increasing the level of safety.</div></div><hr />

Because there are times when there is no alternative than a firearm for their own protection, or the protection of another.  What's interesting is that private citizens are involved in more lawful uses of deadly force (for their protection or the protection of another) than law enforcement personnel.  <br />
<br />
<br />
However, in the overwhelming majority of instances of potential crimes being committed - simply the presence of a firearm (being displayed by a potential victim) has deterred a would-be criminal.<br />
<br />
Links to several studies on these incidents have been posted in this thread.  <br />
<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the police are under no obligation to protect you, me or any other specific individual.  <br />
<br />
You're left to protect yourself.  <br />
<br />
You may choose to make yourself a victim - that's fine.  I choose to protect myself.  I have no moral qualms about you not wanting to own a firearm or use one for your protection.  Don't put that off on me, or limit my choices on how I protect my family.<br />

I absolutely do not accept your premise.  A gun is not inherently more dangerous than a car, a chainsaw, a ball-peen hammer or a knife or a commercial airliner, or a doctor.<br />
<br />
All of them are equally capable of taking lives just as efficiently.  Especially doctors.</div></div><hr />

Can you point to one specifically?  I'd like to see your definition of &quot;overwhelming majority&quot;.  When I reviewed the data some months ago, it indicated that only about 60% of cases where a crime victim used a gun to defend themselves actually resulted in the crime being deterred.  Hardly an overwhelming majority.  On the other hand, a substantially larger percentage of incidents where the victim used a gun to defend themselves resulted in serious injury or death of the victim, than in cases where the victim used some other weapon or no weapon at all.  In other words, if you use a gun to defend yourself, you're more likely to keep your money, but also more likely to be injured or killed.  Hardly a clear-cut argument.<br />

This argument is totally specious.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the police are under no obligation to protect a specific individual such that they can be sued or otherwise held responsible if they fail.  As a police officer you should know that protecting the public, to the best of their ability, is an important part of any police force's job.<br />

My premise is not that a gun is more dangerous than a car, or a commercial airliner, or a person.  My premise is that a firearm is inherently more dangerous than any other commonly available weapon.  I suppose I could clarify and say that I mean a loaded gun.  This is easily and empirically proven by calculating the amount of energy stored within the weapon, and considering the ease with which that energy can be released.  I suppose you could classify a car as a weapon, in which case the energy storage calculation would indicate that the car is more dangerous.  However, the difficulty of releasing that energy in a fashion which would be harmful to a human being would mitigate that considerably.  For instance, the likelihood of me, in my 14th floor office, being injured by someone using a car is pretty negligible.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'd be pretty happy if the security requirements applied to cars, or to commercial airliners, or to doctors, were applied to guns as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Saldrin for the links.  I've glanced through them a bit and I found some things that just don't add up regarding the pro-gun arguments.<br />
<br />
Quote from report:<br />
Rather than being the &quot;league leader&quot; in violent death rates, as the sensational and misleading media reports suggest when focusing exclusively on guns, though the U.S. is still high, its violent death rate is not orders of magnitude higher than other countries<br />
Even a pro-gun web site admits that US violent death is higher.<br />
<br />
There's a note near the bottom of the report:<br />
Argentina, Brazil, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Mauritius, Slovenia, Portugal, and South Korea are classified as upper-middle-income countries by the World Bank. The remainder are considered high-income countries.<br />
Guess which countries have a higher firearm homicide rate than the US?  Estonia, Brazil, and Mexico (and N. Ireland--I'll talk about that later).  Not one country that is in the same economic realm as the US has a higher homicide rate.  Not one country has a higher gun ownership rate.  You do the math.<br />
<br />
Another quote (this one talking about the relationship between gun ownership and homicides):<br />
When two countries were excluded, the U.S. (high gun ownership, high murder rate) and Northern Ireland (low gun ownership, high murder rate) the correlation was marginally significant<br />
Gotta love that.  If the stats don't fit what you want, exclude some of the samples (in this example, the US).  Even then, the correlation was &quot;marginally significant&quot; which means that there WAS a correlation, just not much.<br />
<br />
Another thing:  gun advocates keep talking about the Swiss being required to have a gun in their homes.  According to Saldrin's link, 27% of Swiss homes have a gun (compared to the US's 39%) and that includes all army personnel (see note '2').  So, Switzerland has lower gun ownership and a lower homicide rate than the US.  Hmmmmmmm.<br />
<br />
Pardon me Saldrin, but I just don't see how these stats bolster your argument.  The 3 countries (out of what, 40?) that have higher homicide rates are all lower income countries.<br />
<br />
Now let's talk about N. Ireland.  It's the only country listed in Saldrin's list that has a higher homicide rate than the US and is in the same economic bracket.  Can anybody guess why this is?  Once you have found the answer, let's talk about the peace process.  What is the number one thing everybody wants the IRA (and the unionists) to do to prove that they are serious about peace?  Bingo--destroy guns.  And why is destroying the guns so important?  Because everybody will be safer.<br />
<br />
Isn't that the whole point of this argument?<br />
<br />
The pro-gun argument would have everybody in N. Ireland armed to the teeth.  Are you really going to contend that guns would make N. Ireland residents safer?<br />
<br />
Saldrin said:<br />
Cocaine is illegal. Possession, sale and/or distribution of it is prohibited by law. Yet one cannot say that by its prohibition, it isn't present on our streets today. Thousands of tons of the stuff make it into our country every year.<br />
Does this mean that you are advocating the legalization of drugs?  Tel at least was consistent on this (he wanted legalization of drugs) but he pointed to the Netherlands as a good model.  In the Netherlands drugs are legal but regulated.  Does this mean Tel (and you) agree to regulating guns? (waiting period, all sales--including private--must be registered, etc).<br />
<br />
Saldrin said:<br />
Murder, rape, assault and robbery are illegal in virtually every society in the modern world. Does the fact that they are make it go away? No. <br />
<br />
The logic absolutely defies me as to how an arbitrary law will affect those who refuse to abide by the law to begin with?<br />
Does this mean that you think written laws are ineffective?  Do you think, for example, that laws against rape have NO effect on the number of rapes?  If so, what is the point of having any laws?<br />
<br />

You know what I see when I read this? &quot;In the 10 year period that followed, literally thousands of fully automatic weapons were confiscated in various jurisdictions.&quot;  Sounds good to me.   The less guns on the street (especially automatic ones) the better.  Looks like gun-control is working.<br />
<br />
Why allow them then? Because the only person responsible for protecting you is YOU. The police, as has been stated before, are under NO obligation to protect you.<br />
Oh please.  Do you know what is says on the doors of police cars in my town? &quot;To Protect and to Serve&quot;.  My bother-in-law is a cop and has stopped more than a few domestic batterings (granted my home town is on the forefront of preventing domestic abuse).  If the husband had had a gun my brother-in-law might have been too late.<br />
<br />
As for you claim about people being killed in accidents, you are aware that doctors kill more people in medical accidents than die from firearms accidents, yes?<br />
At least doctors [b]undeniably[b] save more lives than they take.<br />
<br />
Your quote by B. Franklin is very nice but lemme ask you this: are you allowed to yell &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded room?  No, of course not.  But doesn't this mean you give up an essential right (Freedom of Speech) for &quot;temporary safety&quot;?  Why do we have laws that outlaw yelling &quot;FIRE&quot;? Afterall, anyone who thinks it's funny to yell &quot;FIRE&quot; in a theatre will certainly not worry about whether it's illegal or not.  Answer this and we can talk more about why I think gun-control is important.<br />
<br />
So.. its easy to make explosives... how about diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate fertilizer? Remember Oklahoma City?<br />
If it's so easy to get dynomite why did McVie go through the trouble of using fertilizer?  Dynomite would have been much more reliable.  And what was one of the results from Oklahoma City?  It became a little more difficult to buy large quantities of fertalizer.<br />

<br />
IMO it is the gun owners who are emotional.  Many gun owners feel safer when they pack heat (which I liken to people feeling safer in a car than in an airplane).  Some owners get a machismo high when they clean their guns.  It would be interesting to see how many men are pro-gun compared to how many women are pro-gun.  Anybody got a link?<br />
<br />
My opposition to guns is based on neither morals or hysterics.  If I thought we were truely safer with a well-armed society I would be all for it.</div></div><hr />

You may choose to make yourself a victim - that's fine.  I choose to protect myself.  <br />
Let me see if I understand your logic here.<br />
<br />
Everyone bears the responsibility for his or her own protection.<br />
The only valid form of protection is a gun.<br />
Therefore anyone who does not carry a gun is a walking target.<br />
<br />
Baloney.<br />
<br />
There are pleanty of ways to protect yourself and your family without a firearm. The assumption that a gun is the only thing that can keep you safe is a logical falacy that adds no weight to your argument.<br />
<br />
By that same logic, anyone NOT carrying a gun who is the victime of a crime is at fault. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry you were raped, ma'am, but you weren't carrying a gun, so you were just asking for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, the various state supreme court rulings on the duty of police to protect citizens do not say that they have the right to stand by and let criminals do anything they want. It simply states that police can't be expected to be everywhere, and know everything, and can't be held responsible for a crime committed in their district. It's true that I hold responsibility for my own safety, but I can see to my safety without a gun by utilizing common sense and non-lethal protection alternatives.</div></div><hr />

What's interesting is that private citizens are involved in more lawful uses of deadly force (for their protection or the protection of another) than law enforcement personnel<br />
<br />
Please note:  &quot;Because there are times when there is no alternative...&quot;<br />
<br />
Care to explain how I'm saying that &quot;a gun is the only thing that can keep you safe&quot; ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;there is no more effective means&quot; is something entirely different.<br />
<br />
&quot;effective&quot; != &quot;no other alternative&quot;<br />
<br />
I guarantee you though, that when someone wants to kill you - there is no more effective means of protecting yourself than with a gun.<br />
<br />
Don't put words into my mouth.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
Deeger, I'll get back to you when I get to work ;)</div></div><hr />

Bull.<br />
<br />
Knowledge and training is the most effective way to protect yourself.<br />
<br />
You give a gun to someone who doesn't know how to use it properly and they are if anything worse off than they were.</div></div><hr />

No, no bull at all.  <br />
<br />
Knowledge and training is the most effective way to protect yourself.<br />
<br />
Where have I never advocated education and responsible use?<br />
<br />
Did you miss that I was a police firearms instructor?  Training police officers in the proper use of force, both lethal and non-lethal was what I did for several years.  <br />
<br />
Do I think that training programs should be required by law to exercise a protected constitutional right? No.<br />
<br />
Do I advocate that people who want a firearm for their protection 1) know that they have the moral and psychological ability to use the weapon if they have to and 2) educate themselves and their families in its use? Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
You give a gun to someone who doesn't know how to use it properly and they are if anything worse off than they were.<br />
<br />
So on one hand we have people saying that all of these guns in the circulation is bad because they're so easy to use and to kill and/or maim people.  Then we have folks saying that unless you're trained in its use, then it won't do you any good to protect yourself... ok...</div></div><hr />

Aside from the impossibility of proving a negative, I didn't say you were against education and responsible use.  I simply responded to your incorrect statement than a gun (and you only listed a gun, not gun with proper training) is the best form of defense against someone trying to kill you.<br />

Guns are easy to use to kill and/or maim people.  They only become more difficult to use when you are trying to kill and/or maim SPECIFIC people.  Someone who doesn't know how to properly handle a firearm is a danger to EVERYONE around them, and in some case those who are in the house next door as well.  It doesn't take ANY skill to be dangerous to many people.<br />
<br />
However, to be dangerous to a SPECIFIC person/target takes much more skill.  You have to be able to handle your weapon safely, you have to be able to aim, you have to be CALM during an encounter, etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone on this board should know this, you should as a firearm instructor.</div></div><hr />

I'll take a stab at that.  Giving a gun to an untrained person raises the chances that somebody gets killed.  Maybe the user, maybe their advisary, maybe an innocent bystander.  2 of these 3 scenarios are bad news.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter how smart you are, or if you can kill a guy 6 times before he hits the floor, if he has a gun and you don't, the odds are in his favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was listening to the radio the other day, and I heard one of the all-time best comeback lines in my life. <br />
     <br />
Note: This is an exact replication of National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster, and US Army General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military installation. <br />
 <br />
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they  visit your base?&quot; <br />
 <br />
GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting.&quot; <br />
 <br />
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: &quot;Shooting! That's a bit <br />
irresponsible, isn't it?&quot; <br />
 <br />
GENERAL REINWALD: &quot;I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle  range.&quot; <br />
 <br />
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: &quot;Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be  teaching children?&quot; <br />
<br />
GENERAL REINWALD: &quot;I don't see how. We will be  teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.&quot; <br />
<br />
FEMALE INTERVIEWER: &quot;But you're equipping them to become violent killers.&quot; <br />
<br />
GENERAL REINWALD: &quot;Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The radio went silent and the interview ended. And all I could think was, Go Army!</div></div><hr />

It may be a hoax, but the point being made is still valid. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the other sub part that goes along with the hoax is the stab at NPR.  As I have a high regard for them as a news organization, I wanted to make sure that folks knew that this was NOT how NPR conducted themselves when interviewing people.</div></div><hr />

That said, I think the story is hilarious.</div></div><hr />
