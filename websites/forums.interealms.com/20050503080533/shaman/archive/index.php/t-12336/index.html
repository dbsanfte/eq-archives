<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know where this drops and hoe commonly it does so? Want to help a guildie increase his smithing so that's why i'm asking. Also is 400pp a good price for just one vial of it?!?!(saw it for that in bazaar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on my server 400pp for iksar blood is a good deal<br />
drops in seb..droga...iksar bandit lord (only him) in WW..prolly couple other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have gotten some in Gunthak killing pirates and in Dulak also...very rare drops tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It used to fall like rain before Tae smithing went in and now the best spot I have found is The Windscorn ship in Dulak Harbor.  The dock patrolmen that are Leezards can drop it as well, but I have not seen it come off of the mercenaries or deckhands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It drops somewhat commonly in LoY, esp off of windscorn, a ship full of iksar who love dropping blood, plus the wandering iksar guards drop it alot too, this is in the Dulak Harbor zone<br />
<br />
Course if its still going for 400 a pop, im sure i could sell the stack and a half I have and get some upgrades or somethin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">which boat number is the Windscorn please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Windscorn is the last boat, you have to go around the big shipbuilder area to get on it. Also, I have sold 4 Iksar blood in the bazaar for 1000pp each in the past few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rodain1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In dunlak harbor there is a dock that has several Iksars on it.  i was farming for iksar blood and iksar meat for potions.<br />
<br />
blood dropped one time in about 30 iksar kills.  sounds pretty uncommon, lol <br />
<br />
iksar meat was only a little better at 8 meats for about 30 iksars killed.<br />
<br />
but that is the only place that i personally have seen it drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Windscorn is the best place to get the bloods (besides getting them CHEAP from players). Drop rate of iksar blood is not that bad (from the iksars - though you may have to kill lots of dark elves as well).<br />
<br />
Zone into Dulak then hug the left zone wall (but dont go into the factory) and you will find the boat. Also all the mobs have the name &quot;Windscorn &lt;xx&gt;&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Be warned though, the mobs undercon (adds are a PITA too). At 50 you'd probably get owned trying it solo.<br />
<br />
I start by going to the single spawn at the top of the front of the boat. Once thats dead I use that nice PoP 4 minute root spell to split spawns.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the cleric dude at the bottom of the ramp, he sometimes likes to chain cast high level cleric nukes.<br />
<br />
What sucks is people trying to charge more than 1k for bloods. Normally I try to pay 500pp. So what if the shields I make sell for 15kpp.... :) $$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">whoa, had no idea iksar blood was worth anything!<br />
Guess I shouldn't have destroyed all that blood I got from helping a druid farm for her healing spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doh !<br />
<br />
I have found the best way to make money these days is to be well informed, there are so many tempers and bits needed for Trade skills that you realy sould not trash anything. an example is the Dark ore amulet from Nadox. i had one in me Back pack for weeks before the quest its used in was found. Turned out I had all the bits needed, hehe<br />
(Its for the Melee neck haste item quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got iksar blood in old sebilis. Has the benefit of being a good spot to help out some lower level friends, and some nice gem drops too. The upper jail area or the rear of disco both have lizards that drop the blood. Again, its fairly rare. I only needed one, stayed for 8 kills, got it and left. Don't know if that was lucky, typical or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have killed the Bandit Lord in Warslik Woods so many times I can't even count them no more.  I have not once seen iksar blood drop from him.  I am not saying he doesnt drop them just saying its pretty damn rare.  Also you can coun't Droga out of the list with the changes they made to Droga a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bandit Lord once dropped blood twice in 3 kills. Before they screwed up Nurga that was the best place to get it. Iksar slaves there no longer drop it, last I checked anyway. Droga doesn't have it but the caster Iksar in Dalnir (necros) sometimes do. Seb necros drop it as well. <br />
Had 3 stacks from way back and sold them all 250pp per vial in about 10mins one day. Then I found out that it wasn't someone making (crappy) Iksar Cultural :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's insanely rare....I've been looking for some to make scale temper for my cultural smithing (it's also used in Tae Ew smithing) and once, only once, have I seen it in the bazaar....500pp for 1.  <br />
<br />
If I'm an iksar, why can't I just poke myself with my spear???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i got 2 iksar blood in 4 hours of clearing Dalnir<br />
<br />
coerced iksar drop it rarely<br />
<br />
and then i got 2 more iksar blood in 4 minutes of bazaar work .. at 50pp each :)<br />
<br />
i've seen someone in the bazaar with 65 of them at 200pp each</div></div><hr />
