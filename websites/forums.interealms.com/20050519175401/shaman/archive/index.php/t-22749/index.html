 Re: Class Issues List - Update    (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=2333)  [ NEW ]  Options      <br />
 <br />
  <br />
 1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  [currently being evaluated] <br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  [currently being evaluated] <br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. [new item] <br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast.  [new item] <br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. [currently being evaluated] <br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. [new item] <br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  [new item] <br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  [currently being evaluated] <br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  [currently being evaluated] <br />
10.  MGB Shrink.  [currently being evaluated]   <br />
 <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Concerning item 9:<br />
<br />
As well as reducing component costs, maybe create some new potion recipes that have real use.  Maybe endurance regen potions, shaman-made invisibility potions so non-invisers can carry 10-dose potions, better hp regen potions (like a potion version of Chloroplast), maybe even *gasp* a rez potion.<br />
<br />
I think a rez potion would bring a much needed ability to the game...the ability to rez the CLERIC.<br />
<br />
In short, make Alchemy USEFUL for more than SoW, damage shield, and gate potions.</div></div><hr />

There IS a Shamanmade potion with grants Invis.<br />
Since one of its components can only be foraged in Deeper Guk (Ldon) the recipe is not worth much, cause it cant be &quot;massproduced&quot; like other potions.<br />

Not that I'm against a Rez potion . . . just don't see the need for all the checks and balances on it.  I mean, clearly it'll be expensive . . . a L12 Gate spell costs 300pp a dose in potion form . . . so I suppose a Rez would prolly run ya . . . 1500pp a dose?</div></div><hr />

I agree, very very low chance of *any* of these items making it into the game...and if they do we'll have to buy an expansion (i.e. buy expansion to get new level 67 decent healing spell).<br />
<br />
SOE seems intent on fixing the little issues surrounding the periphery of many class problems.  The longer this goes, the more the guild summit looks like a circle jerk IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Content Skipping meet Rez Potion. Rez Potion, meet Content Skipping.What content exactly would you be skipping? not like you can feign someone to P5 in time and res a cleric there... though I don't know about GoD stuff, I do know that even in tipt you have to beat all the &quot;sub trials&quot; to be able to get the flag, you can't Feign a necro up to the riddler and res a cleric in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we DO need is the ability to shrink and GROW others in a raid situation.  Both groups and individuals.<br />

For those asking for a rez ability or summon to corpse type of ability, I ask you, &quot;When was the last time you were alive to do a rez or were able to sneak back to the scene of the wipe?&quot;</div></div><hr />

i look at broken content from 3 and 1/2 years ago, that has never been fixed; and think the strategy is to stall us.  at least to stall us till the next expansion we have to pay for comes out.<br />

<br />
It says &quot;Class Issues&quot; not &quot;Balance Issues.&quot;  I would interpret that to be the top 10 things that bug Shamans.  Some of it is going to relate to class balance, but some of it is going to be removing some inconvenience without touching balance.  Look at the Ranger Eagle Eye change for an example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I got my doubts about 8) and 9) aswell, but such a list probably will never completely please everyone.<br />
<br />
When you really have to talk about alchemy, wouldn't 'alchemy usefulness' be the more important topic? Most potions are too inefficient or far too situational to use them, even if i could make them for 1p per potion ;). But no biggie, overall the list looks OK.<br />
<br />
'MGB Shrink'<br />
<br />
Sudedor,<br />
i understood we can't drop items from the list that are not finally answered (you explained it often enough  :D ), but is there any chance to clarify that point in the list? The basic issue (in my opinion) is out of group shrinking, not primarly MGBing.<br />
<br />
Of course you can't write a novel to each point, but atleast one or two general remarks to every issue on the list would be helpful. Especially for those, that don't follow every single discussion thread here and on SOE board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Jalein,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Concerning item 9:<br />
<br />
As well as reducing component costs, maybe create some new potion recipes that have real use.  Maybe endurance regen potions, shaman-made invisibility potions so non-invisers can carry 10-dose potions, better hp regen potions (like a potion version of Chloroplast), maybe even *gasp* a rez potion.<br />
<br />
I think a rez potion would bring a much needed ability to the game...the ability to rez the CLERIC.<br />
<br />
In short, make Alchemy USEFUL for more than SoW, damage shield, and gate potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
now a res potion would be interesting. and as we have to make it and it cost us 90% or even higher 96% seems fine to me, and alot of rpg have res potions. my only concern is that they make it 1k to make, when really it should be closer to 100pp. (possible slightly more)<br />
<br />
my own thing would be to see sow potions at made at 1pp so could be sold for 3pp.<br />
invis about the same, infact anything that other classes can cast easily about that price.<br />
kei type potions for about 40pp <br />
gate potion for 20pp or so<br />
focus effect potions for 30pp<br />
res if we got it about 100pp<br />
basically unless the potion reaally is a would potion they should be over 100pp to make. i count res as a wow potion and dont think that should be more than about 100 to make.<br />
<br />
how about a potion to turn copper into gold? (hehe) tcost 100pp turn 150000 cooper into 1500 gold or 150pp:)  ok this is a joke:)<br />
<br />
the next problem would be if forage stuff was require, this is bad unless shaman get a forage skill (other than iskar)<br />
<br />
<br />
the rest of the list  seems ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Our guild commonly places mages in positions where we can avoid clearing trash (clearing trash is not raiding, it's tedium and boring and lacks any challenge) and just CoH to where the action is.  If they want you to not skip content, they would disable CoH and corpse summoning in that zone.  Otherwise you should take advantage of everything in order to not waste time in a game that is full of timesinks.<br />
<br />
My guild would easily pay whatever amount to get a mage and a cleric in position to avoid an hour or more of clearing trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Personally, and this is just me - I think Shaman should be able to duplicate darn near every spell in the game with a potion.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My largest problem with the 'cost' to alchemy, is that it is very expensive for a 1 shot use.

<br />
So for a rez potion, say make it 93% (equal to the necro, because theirs costs an EE, ours could only be used every hour or so), have an initial cost of around 5-10K depending on the triv, and make it ND.  This would allow a sham to rez 1 person to save the day on occasion.  It would also require a decent expenditure of pp into alchemy because a fail would be very expensive.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I wouldn't want to even think of how much drama Rez potions would cause in the Cleric community. Their biggest argument would be that clerics wouldn't be needed anymore in groups if everyone had access to Rezzes with a potion.<br />
<br />
Truth is cleric would still be very valuable for their free rezzes which would still be the best in the game.<br />
<br />
Make the potions 90% (I'd even be happy with a 75%) And have them require some sort of Cleric Imbued item.<br />
<br />
Have something like a Blue diamond that would have to be imbued. A dropped jewel that sells for 240pp on vendors (when players sell it to one) commonly go for 300-400pp in bazaar and can be accumulated from looting in various zones. <br />
<br />
In any case a cleric rez will always be prefered over a potion. Oustide making CoTH link set ups easier, the potions would be used just as commonly as when a necro uses their rez. When there's no cleric around or to rez the cleric who was the only rezzer in your group.<br />
<br />
I'm sure any cleric wouldn't complain about any player being able to use a potion on them to rez after they died in a GoD trial.<br />
<br />
Will rez potions happen? Very likely not... but then again if somone suggested illusion potions two years ago we'd all say that would have never happened. Ok.. maybe not game changing but surprises can happen. <br />
<br />
Just don't get your hopes up.</div></div><hr />

Rez potion would be nice....  They would probably make them GoD style<br />
for targeting, why not make it range nodrop and not stackable, and your throwing skill determines whether or not it works... oh wait, shamans can't throw for crap.  Kinda like giving us snare and stun and explosive potions... that only monks are remotely effective at using.<br />
<br />
LDON alchemy items<br />
Foragers don't forage for their friendly shaman, they destroy or vendor it all.  Nobody sells it in the bazaar, so it's ignored. <br />
<br />
Sure, the game is supposed to be about people playing together, so what happens when timmy takes his ball and sells it to the little girl down the street, won;t tell you who, you find her on your own and she asks a million dollars for it so you can play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Our guild commonly places mages in positions where we can avoid clearing trash (clearing trash is not raiding, it's tedium and boring and lacks any challenge) and just CoH to where the action is.  If they want you to not skip content, they would disable CoH and corpse summoning in that zone.  Otherwise you should take advantage of everything in order to not waste time in a game that is full of timesinks.<br />
<br />
My guild would easily pay whatever amount to get a mage and a cleric in position to avoid an hour or more of clearing trash.And that's the exact reason they'll never go in.<br />
<br />
At least for a CoH bot you gotta clear to the spot once... maybe more than that. Whatever little 'tricks' the designer put in the zone to make it more difficult, you've got the do them. At least the first time. Now imagine if the very first time you could grab a rogue with a mage corpse, then use ShowEQ and walk straight up to where ever you wanted to be without doing anything before that. Sure, everyone hates clearing trash but to SOE... that's 'content'.<br />
<br />
Disabling CoH/Summons just pisses everyone off when they're a little late and get shut out of the raid. Part of why people hate LDoN raids is because you can't get replacements, and Rogues are going to get awfully pissy when they need to drag everyone... if they can by that point.<br />
<br />
If you could find a 3 foot square to summon a tank and a couple clerics without aggro, you don't need to do anything prior. With a bit of practice you can even do it in spots where you WILL get aggro.</div></div><hr />
