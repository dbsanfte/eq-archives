<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey All,<br />
<br />
Found myself guildless this morning. heh. My choice, just needed a change. Well, turns out I am not that interested in being guildless, I like the interaction and constant chat.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a good guild on Rodcet Nife that is currently accepting applicants for a 55 Shaman? I play around 3 hours a night (Usually around 10pm EST to 1-2am EST), raid occasionally although I find it hard to get the block of time required due to RL.<br />
<br />
Really just interested in meeting new people, having good chat, and guildies that enjoy grouping together and helping each other out on epic raids, drop raids, or just xp grinding.<br />
<br />
I also have a 51 ranger than gets dusted off occasionally.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Karshak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love my guild (Union of Power) but it's not quite exactly what you are looking for... epic raids are rare these days and not guild supported (i.e. pick up with a few friends, not an &quot;official&quot; guild raid).  We are working hard on getting keyed/flagged for Vex Thal and the Emperor in Ssra right now, if that gives you an idea as to where we are.<br />
<br />
However, you'd have to level up to 60+ to have a chance with us, unless you know a member IRL.<br />
<br />
http://www.unionofpower.org if you want more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would like to ask the same question, if anyone knows a good guild on tunare, i play ALOT but i do have some RL stuff that gets in the way i like raiding and i have Fo7 and MGB if that helps hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Weissblau, t'will be a while before I hit 60, so while I thank you for your response, please don't hold your breath on my application... :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like a fun guild though, who knows, maybe someday.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
