<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Couple of cases for you to examine.<br />
Tactics, 140AA SK tank. I used an Apothic Shissar staff with a 315 per 7 second click and an HoT to heal the entire time until a named popped then I used SL.<br />
PoE, Monk tanking I never went below 90 mana the entire time I was there. Used CH almost exclusively. Druid was backup healer that I didnt need, she was dishing 133DPS.<br />
PoE, Shaman in a slowing role, Warrior tank, never fell below 80 mana even with named. Shaman was dishing 70plus DPS.<br />
<br />
With what is proposed here you will have no reason to place a cleric into ANY of those groups. Because the healing needs arent the maximum. The only place a cleric will be able to get a group will be high healing needs----lousy tank or high end content where max healing is needed and Im willing to bet that it will still require a backup healer for the high end content.<br />
<br />
As for your plane of earth story. That's nice.<br />
<br />
So in other words...<br />
Against a mob that does 1/4 the damage (slow, mitigate as needed)...<br />
and that dies 60% faster (haste on the tank)...<br />
Healing a warrior...<br />
With Daluda / Trushar, apparently<br />
A Shaman is still 10% less efficient<br />
than a Cleric who is not slowing, who is not hasting, and who is healing a monk with a level 39 heal.<br />
<br />
Please, what in the flipping hell are you bitching about, Belkram? Are you threatened by the thought that it takes a defensive tank and five level 60+ spells for a Shaman to come within spitting distance of your ability to heal a gimp tank with a pre-fifty spell in what several on this board would call trivial content?<br />
<br />
You're a damned loon, if so.<br />

I'm frankly amazed at what some people come up with to shoot at Shaman these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Belkram is a freaking tool, and not a very sharp one at that. Anyone who's read and posts on that forum can attest to this fact. He's got more &quot;fuzzy math&quot; than what's thrown around during election speeches, and similarly narrow-minded.<br />
<br />
I agree clerics should get some love and certainly more than was in the list that was crossposted there and here. It's funny how other classes can agree clerics could use some tuning if we're asking to be, but morons with soapboxes like this cant see past what they want. <br />
<br />
Thankfully most clerics who have a clue dont share in his me me me me me and ONLY me attitude. They have a better &quot;grasp&quot; on what effects the game beyond themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is amazing to me is how everyone has their own spin on how each of their classes is being screwed by this discussion, and the other 2 are getting everything they want.  I really wish people would open up their eyes, realize its a game, realize that no matter what you cant please EVERYONE no matter how hard you try, and that we arn't the only classes who need changing.  Im tired of 'well this class gets this, and this class gets that...what about us?'  Thats not how it works.  You cant compare like that otherwise everyone gets the short end of the stick.  I know that I have said a few things, but after looking at it from someone else's perspective on someone else's board...I realize that its moronic to try to say that other classes dont deserve the upgrades they may or may not need.  We think by looking at what they are saying, that they are ludicrus because they want some loving too, they think that way about us as well though.  Its a vicious cycle that wont end.  .....well..no more rambeling atm....I got my rant out :p have a good day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im glad we can heal in PoE but thats not going to help us even secondary heal in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Belkram is a over the top, but he has a point.  The cleric part of the list is pretty crappy.  That said, his insistance that clerics be mandatory for all content makes me want to throtle him.  As much as I hate to say this (due to past disagreements on shaman issues), corlathist seems to be on the right track on that thread.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you guys expected.  Clerics have a sweet situation right now where they are pretty much required to complete trials and top content as well as raiding.  MS has a monopoly as well and they are NONE too keen on giving it up ;)  That said, their class lacks much diversity, something druids and shaman have in abundance.  I can see why they feel threatened, but in todays game, specialists are required and generalists are harder pressed to fill roles.  That's whats got us all in this mess in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cascet--THANK YOU. glad to see i'm not the only person who feels that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that aside--when we all opted to play a shaman, we chose diversity of skills. none of us expected at the jump to be the best healers. we expected to have a variety of abilities at our disposal. there are a lot of other classes experiencing similar feelings because of their class choices. paladins and SKs are the shammies of tanking. rangers in end content fall far behind rogues in dps, and Wizzies are obviously nuts. i've heard more than a few rangers losing their minds because of Rogues. <br />
<br />
but that doesn't mean there are only places for the purist classes, and saying that this or that class isn't 'necessary' is in itself a trivial statement. few classes *are* necessary, but there are situations where ALL classes can help. <br />
<br />
good example--SK friend of mine in a GoD guild (all elemental, they're working on Time and GoD both) was sending me tells the other day saying &quot;we need more shammies&quot;. he was telling me that while the mob they were going after was unslowable, the mobs that add during the fight hit like crazy but *are* slowable. in cases where mobs ARE slowable, one shaman can drastically reduce the number of clerics needed, especially if the off tanks are big and the clerics are geared and aa'd up. <br />
<br />
also--it's not 'necessary' to own a car, but having one helps get the job done that much easier. that's us.<br />
<br />
radiant cure, malos/malosinia, DoT (helps on raid mobs when you know which ones to use and when you're able to), splash heals to help CH line, slows for slowable trash mobs leading to the raid encounter, or more importantly, for the slowable adds that may spawn *during* a raid. save a kiter, slow the add. buffs--everything from fo7 to FA, Tribunal, VP (add on cleric? knockback/root), adv spirit call for raid encounters for a little extra burst dps, etc. again, not a list of things that are necessary, but definitely a lot of desirable add-ons for a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
i know it's pointless to bring that stuff up--and i'm sure the next reply will be someone lifting a quote from this reply and arguing against it. that's ok with me. i love playing a shaman. bottom line. i would take my generalist over a specialist any day of the week.<br />
<br />
you want to be 'necessary'? great. go play a cleric or warrior. i'm sticking with what i've got.</div></div><hr />

I can just see a Belkram response to that.<br />

His posts make my head hurt. :(</div></div><hr />

What Chutoi isn't telling you is that all of us SI shaman retired except him and Specter. F EQ! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We usually have 4 shaman that show up for raids.  More if we are doing Time.  ( I think we have a total of 8, but 4 are active, 2 are so-so active, and 2 are hit or miss ) I do not recall a time when I was told to leave an exp for another class.  If the raid is full, then I just do something else - mostly work on BiC quest stuff or 2-box my rogue until a spot is open.  Sometimes living in PST timezone sucks :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We have never had to ask anyone to sit out a raid except for phase 1/2 of Time (and most people don't mind doing that). In any case when you go into raids like that, if there aren't enough spaces, you make up a class balance. Sure, if you have too many shaman and not enough clerics, one might be asked to sit out, because obviously you need enough of a healing chain. If you had 12 clerics though, you dont need that many, and I'm sure that one of them would be left behind in favor of some other class under those circumstances. It cuts both ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you would know, if you hadn't retired, is that Chutoi is right.  All but 2 Shaman get booted for the end fights in Uqua.<br />
<br />
Another thing you'd know, if you hadn't retired, is that a solo Shaman in Inktua can do everything needed.  Don't even need 2.  Just don't tell the rest of the guild that.</div></div><hr />

72 people can raid Time, after the first 2 phases.  It's amazing how many people have to sit out night after night when you cut that down to 54.  And, pretty soon, your attendance drops from 90 to 80 to 72 to 68 to 65 to 50 to 40 to 30........  and people retire...........  or &quot;take a break from the game&quot;.........  and you recruit and regear and start making progress again..............  and here come the people who were &quot;taking a break from the game&quot; and the retirees decide they just CAN'T stay away........  and attendance grows to 65 or so again.  But, you'll never recover those old numbers of 90 players ready to go and kill whatever the raid leader points at.  Just sad, really.</div></div><hr />

Same in my guild when they start P1/P2 - usually, I get home from work when the guild starts P3, so it is not a big issue for me in the past.  <br />
<br />
But, we are only raiding Time once a week now on Sundays, and most of the P1/P2 gear is rotting.  It is lotto'ed now, so if I see something I like that is a decent upgrade, I roll for it.  How I got my shield :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most of the things on that list seem quite ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sure kragg's and daluda's could see a bit more hp added on to them, and our dps changes wouldn't be overbalancing given that they're already gimped, but 900/tick on BoT, 600/tick on Q, and a 2000 hp daluda?  Seems quite excessive.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand how a rational person could believe that those changes would take place in that form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Those healing changes don't go far enough if the goal is to have 3 classes capable of main healing modern content and not need 9 clerics in a 54 person raid.  There will still be a lot of places and raids where only a cleric will be sufficient.<br />
<br />
If you're content to always have to find a cleric to main heal for any challenging content, then the changes go too far.  They are obviously far more than a &quot;patch healer&quot; needs.<br />
<br />
I doubt even with those changes most shaman could successfully main heal somewhere like Tipt.  The list would need to include rez and possibly DA, and maybe a group heal and divine arb for that to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wouldn't mind seeing Nihils with a -55 resist adjustment.  Basically a built in Malos.  -100 resist adjustment is ridiculous.  I do not have any issues on the duration of the spell.  Most of the time on raids it is overwritten.  Only a few of the shamans in the guild have Nihils.<br />
<br />
I am not even going to address BoT / Q.  I would rather see an MGB Heal or Mana Regen or Both like Paragon.<br />
<br />
Heals - I doubt we will see Daluda's Mending at 2k.  Possible for 1k8, but our heals are already hard on the mana pool - especially if we need to chain cast it.  There are GoD Class Gloves that is a 25% ( I think it is this ) Mana Preserv on Daluda's.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see lower cast times on our nukes, but I hardly nuke.  To me, it is not that important. <br />
<br />
For our dots, Bane is annoyingly resisted - even by mobs in the 50s - which is quite sad.  I think something is needed to correct this - I do not know if a resist mod is the answer.  Then again, dot aggro is a totally different ball of wax.  It is ridiculous how much aggro we generate from our dots - if we crit, ouch, watch out, we might have a mob in our face saying &quot;Hello, Mr. Shaman.  Me break you now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall, I think I disagree with most of the items on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">that aside--when we all opted to play a shaman, we chose diversity of skills. none of us expected at the jump to be the best healers. we expected to have a variety of abilities at our disposal. <br />
<br />
When I started my Shaman, the class was a capable healer, buffs meant something, and could crank out respectable DPS. A diversity of skills, all useful, wanted if not required.<br />
<br />
A cleric who started at the same time as I did would have been a premier healer who was better-able to handle the increased aggro from the better heals. He would also have the only rez spells in the game, and his powers against undead made him a potent force in most of the games' dungeons.<br />
<br />
We're not in Kunark anymore, Toto</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It is a touchy issue.  Clerics have the best healing in the game by far.  DPS was ramped up in GoD as a means of reinstating difficulty.  More DPS means more healing needed.  Slow was mitigated, destroying our ability to heal as a cleric when slow was available.<br />
<br />
I'll say this about the Shaman class... from another person's perspective, it may seem that since we have Slows, we need little else.  Problem is, if you have a decent cleric, you DO NOT NEED slows, especially in mitigated content.  In the groups in which I have Main Healed, slow is simply a tagging spell... I.E. %target has been tagged to allow its DPS to be healed.  Without tagging it first, I cannot keep up.<br />
<br />
In such a situation, Turgurs is merely &quot;The spell you must cast before you can adequately heal&quot; and little else.  Sure, it helps with soloing, but only because our pet is so feeble that unmitigated slows are required for it to last more than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
So let's forget about slow and heal for the moment... they completely own us in buffs, which is okay, to an extent.  I'd be happy with Druid-level buffing capabilities... Focus is nice, but my problem is that it seems every friggin tank and mage out there already has Shield up.  Tank Ornate makes me want to scream!  Try NinjaBuffing with Focus in PoK, your spell will bounce off more than slows on an un-malo'd mob.<br />
<br />
Which brings another thing to attention... our spells have zilch for resist mods.  Malo is merely &quot;The spell you must cast before you can cast other spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
So in a group, you have to cast &quot;The spell you must cast before you can cast the tagging spell that you must cast before you can adequately heal,&quot; then &quot;The tagging spell that you must cast before you can adequately heal,&quot; and THEN you can start to work your healing magic as a Cleric could without having to throw two spells off first.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget that you're blowing around 550-600 mana on those tagging spells, which makes Cannibalize less of a luxury and more of a curse.  Cannibalize is now &quot;The spell you must cast in order to cast the spell you must cast in order to cast the spell you must cast in order to adequately heal at the level a cleric can without any pre-requisites.&quot;<br />
<br />
Canni, Malo, and Turgur's look nice on paper, but they are merely hindrances.  This is why we thrive on long fights.  We have to get off our chain and if we cannot before the mob dies, we are pointless.  <br />
<br />
The DPS we have to fall back on is very low, and comparable to clerics'.  Thing is, we fall back on ours much more often because we have to.  Clerics have a one shot spell that solidifies them in all groups and raids.  Clerics have a simple role.<br />
<br />
Now then, how do you satisfy a Cleric's justifiable hunger for more diversity (as in, less simplicity) and, at the same time, satisfy a Shaman's justifiable hunger to, with all the tricks he must turn in the first 10 seconds of every fight, heal ENOUGH in a group to keep a tank alive?<br />
<br />
I don't know.  What I do know is that I would like larger heals, or larger nukes.  I don't care what you give me, as long as you give me some group desirability.  Go nuts, put something (GASP) ORIGINAL into the game, like Endurance regen or percentage avoidance, but make it UNIQUE to us.<br />
<br />
I'm done babbling now :)<br />
<br />
P.S., think I'm gonna go copy and paste this to the priests' covenant board, I'd like to see a Cleric's response.<br />
<br />
P.S.S. Scratch that, tried to register, the email they sent me was (unknown) and totally blank.  On a sidenote, I'm amazed Scirocco is still around.  I had a lot of debates with him on the grove as my druid back in the Kunark era.  I remember back then that Druids envied Shaman... but I digress.</div></div><hr />
