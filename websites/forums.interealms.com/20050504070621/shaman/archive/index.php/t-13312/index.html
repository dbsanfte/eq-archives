<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I plan to help to friends build faction by fighting giants in Kael in the bank area.<br />
My question is this.  Does quest armor drop at the bank area at all or only in the arena?<br />
<br />
I heard some rumors about rare drops happening around the bank area but cannot find confirmation on this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Armor can drop anywhere.  Just a much better drop rate on higher level mobs (which are found mostly in the arena).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been camping bank area for a while now. I've had 3 drops there, all from Lieutenants. The faction hits are pretty crappy though... I'd recommend splitting the tunnel area up to the arena (Senior Guards), but dont fight or camp in the tunnel as it is often trained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks <br />
<br />
Hopefully we will get lucky with a drop or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They can drop anywhere but I have found that the CHanter House and arena are the two best spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have gained a number of armour drops doing faction work at the bank. They only drop of Lieutenants there (maybe a few named but never seen it myself). Generally you get a Lieutenant about once every 1-2 respawn cycles and an armour drop once in every 5-10 lieutenant kills on average.<br />
<br />
You probably have a better chance in arena but the bank presents an easier option.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always had the thought armor only drops from KROMZEK giants<br />
<br />
KromZEK = NO beards<br />
KromRIF =  WITH beards.<br />
<br />
<br />
at least i've never seen armor drop from giants with beards ever.<br />
it might be that it's just REALLY rare from them.. but I wouldn't bother with the Kromrif<br />
<br />
( only exception that i know of is the Icehouse cycle - where Kromrif giants drop PLATE only - and this is a triggered event )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The truth about kael is that no armor drops until you no longer need it :)<br />
<br />
I raided kael for god knows how long when I was in my 50's and never got a single piece of armor.  Now, at 65, I have 13 pieces of assorted armor that I ninja'd off the trash my guild clears on the way to AOW ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can anyone tell me where the REIF drops in Kael? (I had to give my old one to my wife's shammy, now that she has come &quot;of age&quot;) heheheh. Damn, I never thought she would hit 36 before I got my EPIC!!!!  You know it's bad when the person youv'e been teaching EQ to, has become a more efficient EXP gatherer than you are!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">REIF drops (if you're lucky) from oracles in the chanter house (plate cycle area). They normally spawn in the back rooms. Never seen one myself though. <br />
<br />
Note they drop some other spear type weapon too, so don't get all excited when you see one with a spear like I did :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Places for armour drops in Kael are:<br />
<br />
Arena - best dragon faction, best all round armour drops.<br />
<br />
Tormax Arch - good faction and good armour. <br />
<br />
Bank - not bad faction, occasional armour. (Seems to be mostly bracers).<br />
<br />
Iceshard Keep ('Rif House, Chanter house, plate cycle) - good for plate drops, occasional other bits and pieces, including Rune Etched Icewurm Fang.<br />
<br />
If you're going for armour or dragon faction, and you have enough people, go to the Arena. If you don't have enough manpower for that, try the plate cycle or the Tormax arch (particularly if Tormax himself isn't up). A small group can do the bank and surrounding area, with a small chance of armour drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've always had the thought armor only drops from KROMZEK giants<br />
<br />
KromZEK = NO beards<br />
KromRIF =  WITH beards.<br />
<br />
<br />
The beard/no beard thing is not 100% accurate but it's fairly reliable.  I don't know any completely reliable way to figure it out unless your Rif, Zek, and Tormax factions all /con differently.<br />
<br />
I believe it is only Zek that drop armor (outside plate cycle, I wasn't aware that those were Rif).<br />
<br />
Tormax mobs also enter the picture btw, not sure if they drop armor or not.</div></div><hr />
