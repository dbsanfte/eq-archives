<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't done LDON for a while now. I HATE getting in a LDON group and waiting 35 min for the group still looking for a mezzing class or a cleric, I hate joining a LDON group and then they instantly making me group leader and telling me to making me get there last groups, I hate asking the group (with my 54 shammy) to get toegether for sow to run to the location and some take off and ask me for the same buffs 4 times before we get in LDON after I gave it out already. I hate buffing the tanks and when giving the aeo buffs, I call out , ALL GET CLOSE for AEO buff, 5 min later 2 of the group asks for the same buff. <br />
<br />
I hate the fact that after waiting a total of 50 min to get into the LDON, the tanks (without a mezzer) pull 4 to 6 mobs on the first pull on purpose, nearly killing the cleric upon CH, and me, the Shammy. I hate that 20 min into entering the dungeon, the pull 6 more mobs, this time killing the cleric and almost killing me and 1 of 2 tanks, again on purpose. Once the Cleric respawns, he runs back tot he location with KEI mean while the same multi mob pulling tank pulls more mulitble mobs. With me the shammy, to slow, cripple, and heal. SLOW creates a huge aggro, cripple will bring the mobs to me regardless of the tanks tuant, a Sup Heal on top of that is seriously asking for a problem with multible mobs and not all slowed yet. I managed the first wave of mulitble mobs. When he pulled the second smaller wave I personaly warned him that this wasn't right, that we needed to wait for the cleric. They told me to ****, the necro we had could solo the whole area himself. I responded to let the necro solo for the moment then, but to bring the rest of us into the fight without the cleric is insane<br />
<br />
Granted I don't know that much of necros abilites (my personal necro is only lvl 13) I figured the reason for the fast pulls ws to clear the quest with utter haste, not to piss me off. This was at the cost of the clerics exp however and nearly my exp. After we completed the whole thing in half the time, I realized my exp SUCKED MASSIVELY from being there. I was one of 2 lvl 54 char's in there, most all others were lvl 50. I should have gotten part of the lions share of exp, but it stunk. <br />
<br />
Is this the way all are playing LDON now, Is this the norm for LDON groups? Cause if it is, I will call it quits on LDON for me from now on. If I pulled this in PoV with my Bard on a normal basis, I know they would get rid of me without a question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like you have had some bad luck. As you do LDoNs you should run accross people that are good at playing thier classes and not total noobs. Put them on your friends list. Then just start making your own LDoN groups using that friends list and fill in the gaps with classes you need. <br />
<br />
Down time will be practically nil, you will have to replace 1 or 2 between addys and be much happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With LDoNs, some people feel so confident in their ability that the content is trivial to them. It sounds like whoewver was pulling had that attitude. While in a group that works well together (and in a RARE pickup group), pulling that way can speed things up provided: 1. everyone knows their class well, and 2. everyone trusts the others to play instinctively for the benefit of the group. Secondary tanks who steadfastly assist the MT while the healer is getting beat up by the other three mobs should PROBABLY be off-tanking. Classes who can root but don't root-park, are missing a vital step, etc. Basically, in order for such a game plan to work in an LDoN, everyone needs to be on the same page. In the group described above, it sounds like people weren't. In addition, it seemed some egos started showing through as well. <br />
<br />
As the above post stated, find people you trust and add them to friends list for LDoN. Making your own group will be easier that way. Also, if you want one but not lead, use the LFG tool and be discriminating aboiut the group you choose. <br />
<br />
At the levels you were at, you were high person level-wise (with another). I'm guessing the rest of the group were low enough to put you at the next lower tier of instancing (not sure where the cutoffs are, but I'm guessing you were near it). Adventuring with people the same level with you would net you mobs closer in level to you, and consequently more experience. Also, being at the low end of the spectrum would allow the group to fight tougher mobs  as well, giving you better experience as well. Basically, your situation seemed prime for a low experience gain by you. <br />
<br />
I'll let someone else explain the average group level and exactly where the cutoffs are for various instancings. I know it exists, just not knowledgeable enough to explain it accurately myself.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want my advice, Sudancia, forget LDoNs from 50-64. In my opinion the XP is not worth it, considering the time wasted before and afterwards, and the 20 odd adventure points you get at your level do not make up for it.<br />
<br />
At 54, I'd head to PoI, PoD or PoN. You'll get a more steady stream of XP that will last as long as you want, not 90 mins. Unless you are in a kite group or have great CC, most of the time the group will want to pull singles so, as long as you give the tank a tick or two, you won't have to worry about getting agro too much. Lastly, most of the camps in these zones are near the zone out so escape is a few steps away. If PoP isn't your cup of tea, other good alternatives include boats in Dulak.<br />
<br />
After doing several hours straight in one of these places, you'll wonder why you ever bothered with LDoNs. I certainly did.<br />

I almost never take an invitation to a pickup group.  I find that I usually have to wait 35-50 minutes to be invited to one, thus I typically make my own.  I think this is from the days of Sebilis when 20 people would be LFG, and no one would take the initiative.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I recommend making your own group.  I typically follow this layout:<br />
<br />
1 Puller (Make sure to inform this person they will be pulling before you give them an invite)<br />
1 Tank<br />
1 Healer (I'll take a druid here, or even a shaman)<br />
1 You<br />
1 Damage Dealer / CC<br />
<br />
I find that if the puller does a half decent job, that CC isn't really needed.  I also find that a shaman / enchanter duo is over kill, so my first option for CC has always been a bard.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, it might help if you do what I've done and put a clipboard by your computer.  On this clipboard write down a list of every player who you wouldn't group with again (such as the tank who pulls 6) and *why* you won't group with him again... this'll help with your frusteration.  :)<br />

I got Sick of the waiting period but at the same time came to realize that there are some killer items to be had , specificaly augs,  so I made up a rule.<br />
<br />
In my lfg comment section, I now post.   Perfer Planes,if LDON plz make sure group is rdy before calling me.<br />
<br />
I still from time to time get the rare, Do you want to join a Ldon group?  the I have to explain to them that the groupneeds to be near rdy or all persons need to be on the way before i will go to any LDON group any longer.   I dont have the time of day to sit for 40 min waiting on char that may or may not came, or never end up finding the last class for that LDON.   I don't like to be rude but this has helped me ALOT in times of being LFG.  I get Extremly few calls for LDONS and the ones I get (for the most part) have been rdy or on the way.  This Idea has worked for me very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The /note function was one of my favorites for EQ.  Particularly LDoN.<br />
<br />
I formed all my own LDoN groups, and checked my /note while inviting.  Check to see if anyone from the GREAT list is LFG.  Then grab people from LFG who aren't on the EVIL list.  I wouldn't start inviting others until I had the chanter or bard or healer - after which point I could start inviting everything else (I had the benefit of a near constant SK partner buddy).  People learned that when *I* invited them to a group, we'd be entering the dungeon within 10 minutes, and they'd race to join.<br />
<br />
Like most anything in EQ, it sucks and is slow to start out (it took a while to build up my EVIL list).  But after a little while of building your Great LDoN Group Leader reputation, you'll have people holding out about the time you're usually forming your group... looking for you because they want a good dungeon - or 3 or 4.  The longer you do it, the easier and faster it gets.<br />
<br />
I'd say, stick it out if you really want the LDoN gear - work on learning what makes a successful group, what classes you can sub in for others in a pinch (e.g. with some groups, you can take a necro to mezz in miragul's dungeons) - to avoid keeping the group waiting too long, etc.  It'll pay off before too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asama Tatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only time I ever participate in LDoN with my shaman anymore is when Im the puller. I just don't trust morons to do it anymore. At 54 with 450k worth of gear and epic, it's pretty easy to pull with slow, take the pounding till tank taunts, canni once or twice, rinse repeat. It's all in if your group is ready for what a shaman can really do.</div></div><hr />

I make my own groups often enough for Ldon.  It really bothers me that some people will put up LFG and have the nerve to ask if the group is full or ready to go.  I usually will not respond to them and find another person instead.  It's good your up front about it but I would personally pass you up just from your notes.  I don't enjoy spending the time putting groups together either but do it.  Why would I want someone who feels there time is more valuable them mine or others in the group.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I also wonder why it's so hard for some people to put up raiding in the notes while using the LFG tool.  I understand not all use this but think that the majority do.  It would bug the stuff out of me to get 10 tells for a group while waiting on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>forlaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I couldn't agree with you more...<br />
Out of hundreds of LDON's I might have had maybe 3 decent groups.<br />
Last one in N Ro... they thought they could handle a hard.  First pull cleric couldn't pacify, no chanter for mez, they pulled 3mobs at once, couldn't keep aggro.  To make a story short, we had to zone a couple times and go back in, I died twice, cleric died twice, we had to quit the ldon, which was only a hard 25 collect.<br />
It was pitiful.<br />
I leave LDONs as last choice and usually put &quot;No LDON's&quot; in my LFG msg.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Myseld, I was 65 Pre-LDoN and have done a few ldons with my Paladintwink(53 now), and honestly, the XP for him was pretty good inthe 20's and 30's, but 50+, I wouldn't use ldon for xp, just for points. even at 65, with a good group, i might get from 20%-40% of an AA inthe 35 minutes it takes to clear an ldon, I'd druther go slum in KodTaz for that 35 minutes and rake in a full aa or more heh.<br />
<br />
When I do pickup Ldons, and when I start them I usually make a group like this:<br />
<br />
1)  Myself (Slower/Puller or Slower/healer)<br />
2)  Druid/Cleric(for nukes/heals if im pulling)<br />
3)  Plate Tank -- Warrior or Pally or Sk,doesn't matter to me much<br />
4)  Bst/Necro/Mage<br />
5)  DPS (usually try for a rogue or ranger)<br />
6)  DPS/ Pet Class<br />
<br />
My main reason for this? If I accidentally overpull somehow, we have CC built into the group. I can root a couple off on the pull, plus the tank can pick one off, and then the pet class(es) and/or ranger can also pick themselves one off if I pull 4+ (rare). On singles, I gank the mob, slow, dot, root, and immediately get another because the mob is likely dead before I get back with another... kills are incredibly fast and the ldon flies by. Good times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason you get the occasional &quot;do you want an LDON group&quot; when you have the notes posted as written, is because some people never bothered with LoY, and therefore dont have access to the grouping tool. I am one of those people who have to find groups the old fashioned way. Annoying, yes. But it still works for the oldschool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nojno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I only do ldons now with friends and guildies. I'm in a small guild with some good peeps around my level so I try to stick to that.  For the most part though, we do 3 person ldons alot.  That only takes me(shammy/mage) and my RL friend(cleric).  Makes the waiting go away.  Actually that's not true, cuz we end up waiting for a low collect to pop up on the adventure request..lol...no assassinations/rescues for us! (we're wusses, I don't mind admitting =P)<br />
<br />
Yah, I really hate pickup groups.  But then, that's how I made alot of my friends, so I cannot complain.  You just have to keep an EVIL/GOOD list as some people have mentioned and keep it up to date.  Even better is just to find yourself a decent guild with lots of competent peeps at your level.<br />
<br />
I agree with some post I read along time ago that said LDON was one of the few ways for people who are non-uberguilded to get really nice gear.  So if that is your case, Sudancia, stick with it and find some reliable partners and things will go great!<br />
<br />
Nojno<br />
<br />
a few small hints..try to be flexible!  you don't need CC(bards/chanters) on many of these adventures...as long as you have other classes that play well and are willing to adapt.  You don't even need a true tank or a cleric.  So sometimes, just go with what you have, and you might be surprised as to how well things turn out.  Just be conservative and don't do hards until you're sure you can handle it.  But even if disaster strikes, as long as you are with good people, it will turn out well.  You can laugh about it afterwards!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">must admit, I was in a pick-up raid yesterday with a group who didn't have a bard, or chanter, but we had DPS galore.  We Used me as the slower, and made it  within like 35 min.  with the occasional 2 pulls, the tanks did well on getting adds tuanted.  I hate those resists, but I was only in danger 1 time due to resists.  Cleric saved me till my slow took, Alot of times my 3rd slow took around the mob being almost dead.  That was a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
At 54 with 450k worth of gear and epic, it's pretty easy to pull with slow, take the pounding till tank taunts, canni once or twice, rinse repeat. It's all in if your group is ready for what a shaman can really do.<br />
My experience was pretty much the same at that level when playing my twink cleric.  With a Fungi, Pile Driver, more hp than most of the group regardless of class, I would usually take over the group if the puller wasn't aggressive within the first 10 minutes.  If only half the group at that level know their class, as long as the other half aren't completely incompetent, you will still win the adventure in my experience w/ plenty of time left over.  The only time people will die is if they don't listen or have zero skills.  Twinking has made the sub60 adventures normal risk adventures trivial.  A well equipped necromancer at that level of the game probably could solo the whole adventure himself. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That said, twinking has also made sub60 adventures somewhat of a crap shoot, because someone else's alt (or even main) may only be geared with what you would consider junk, and not equipment you would expect to find on someone's level 40 main, much less a 50+ character.  So you might want to politely ask (or just peek) to inspect your adventure mates before beginning.  I've seen casters with over HALF their equipment slots empty before.  Yet I've also seen warriors with a CoF, BoC &amp; a full suit of Velious supertwink gear at that level range, so it all varies. ;) <br />
<br />
It really bothers me that some people will put up LFG and have the nerve to ask if the group is full or ready to go. <br />
I will go LFG (usually marked &quot;LFA or Tier2+ exp&quot; on tools) w/ my 56 cleric and then go soloing dark blues in SolB while I wait.  If I get a tell for an adventure one of the first things I ask is if the group is full or ready to go! :D   I let the person inviting know that I am bound at a Wayfarer camp and can be ready to go as soon as they are.  It is a long run from Wayfarer's back to SolB, and I can get good exp waiting for the other 4 members to gather in the meantime.  With a manastone regardless of what I'm doing I'll be able to buff the group w/ my cleric and be full mana before the rest of the group (even the shaman) is ready to go.  I HATE sitting around doing nothing.<br />
<br />
When playing Frekkels, I will usually also be soloing when marked LFG (marked &quot;LFA, GoD trials, EP's exp&quot; or something similar).  I generally don't ask any questions at that level because groups normally gather pretty quick.  If the group has CC (&amp; I'm married to an ench, so that's usually available to me) I know that the 2 of us can forcefeed practically any group through a normal adventure and win, even if I have to be mainhealer or main tank.  If I'm doing a hard adventure, I'm much more picky &amp; usually like to do a normal adventure as a &quot;warm-up&quot; if I don't know the people I'm with.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont do ldon much any more, xp is not worth it and the bad streak i am on, when i can go to pov or cod or even gates in ge. ldons are not worth it all in the 50s. my 2 cps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just curious Bullian, what are the group makeups you have been attempting adventures with?  For the longest time I would only do slaughter's or collects if I was with people I didn't know or in a group that had a bad or less than ideal makeup.  If I was with a group of people that I knew well, and I had faith in the makeup of the group, we would do assassinates, and if we felt like we had a tough enough group we would do Hard collects or slaughters.  <br />
<br />
For the most part, I am always the slower/debuffer and if we do not have an enchanter, I root park adds or off tank them with stoicism (torpor now) if the main target is dying quickly.  I also always have my puppy up and sick him on the main target as soon as it's in camp, then I throw Anathema on the mob.  If I have an enchanter and cleric or druid in the group, I will throw in some nukes as well because the mana is usually plentiful in those cases.  <br />
<br />
My only recommendations for things that seem to work for me are make sure you have a good tank (Pally's/SK's work the best for aggro in my experience, but have grouped with a few really good warriors that could even single pull 90% of the time).  The next thing I always try to make sure we have is a main healer (I can handle healing ok, but my DPS drops a bit :().  Finally I try to fill the group up with lots of DPS from that point on.  CC is nice if you can find it, but for the most part it isn't necessary if you have a good puller (Bards are great pullers as well).<br />
<br />
That's about all I have to say, good luck to you!</div></div><hr />

My Enchanter pulls 80% of the LDONs I am on. (Guk is the exception because of my crappy Vid card).  Granted the toon in question has around 6k buffed HP (and 3k of Runes), but my point is - it works.<br />
<br />
As somebody else said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mystyqe does LDON's different than anybody else I have ever grouped with - but it works.&quot;<br />
<br />
If what &quot;works&quot; is for the Cleric to pull with a Nuke - then so be it.<br />
<br />
5) Don't be married to the idea of a perfect group. I have had Rangers tank normals with Enchanter slow.  I have had a Ranger and BL on heals after the Cleric went LD.<br />
<br />
6) Someday's your LDON is just gonna suck.  People are going to take turns going LD, MOBs will seem to aggro out of the ceiling, people will fall asleep at the switch (keyboard).<br />
<br />
PERSEVERE.<br />
<br />
7) Make sure you loot every body. Make sure you rebuff.  Make sure you slow every MOB.  Not you personally, but someone.  The little things will bite you in the nuts.  Attention to detail.<br />
<br />
8) * IF * nobody has zoned into the adventure yet and someone goes LD - you can drop the adventure with no loss. This will help with &quot;Ninja LDON'ers.&quot;  Nothing I can say about those who do it once you zone in except see rule 1).<br />
<br />
That's off the top of my head. Once you &quot;get&quot; LDON - it is rote.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...<br />
<br />
3) Get to know the people who not only DO LDON's but are good at them. Let them get to know YOU.<br />
<br />
Those are probably the most important things to remember when doing LDON...and most of EQ in general!  Great points :)</div></div><hr />
