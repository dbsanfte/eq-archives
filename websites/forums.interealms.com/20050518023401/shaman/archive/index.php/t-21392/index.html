<br />
GE is pretty standard for Luclin mob wise, decent XP/crappy loot.  Be sure to have a map, it is esentially an outdoor dungeon that reminded me of DOOM with all the doors and walls.  The named drops are.....well, twink items at best.  Went up to Griegs area and explored since he wasn't up.  The mobs are indifferent so nothing to fear on the 2nd floor.  I will now add this zone to a high 40s PL spot, due to its under-utilization.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My suggestion about solo stuff:<br />
<br />
- Solo Tactics Pit. Use levitation and invis to get near the port out and kill boars to try to get the named to spawn. You can get ornate and some other items. I didnt find anything that summon down in the pit so you can root dot. If you get overwhelmed just click the port out and start over.<br />
- Hates Fury is nice but you cannot single pull stuff when you solo. Cript of Nadox is nice and have a lot of named...  Everytime I go there I get to kill many nameds and I always get many minor items for twinks. If you didnt do that yet you can do the quest for your Blood of Nadox spell. This spell is nice when you fight some encounters.<br />
- Lodi is nice but its never up.<br />
- BoT giants can be soloed eccept some will chain gate. Try to kill a non caster one.  can I say 'fully slowable' :)<br />
- SSRA: If you move in too much you get overwhelmed by casters and you will die.<br />
-The grey have a few nice named (which we cannot track) but a lot of roamers and annoying traps. Just go there and get your shard.<br />
- When you have time try to get shards and pieces for VT key. VT raid is very boring but many guilds go there so you may need it.<br />
<br />
My suggestions about EP:<br />
<br />
- Join a guild that raid but not everyday. So you get EP flagged but you dont burn yourself out with commitments.<br />
- Once you get EP flagged you will understand how much you sucks.<br />
- Loot in EP is afterall nice.<br />
- In PoE you will die soo much doing the rings that you will hate this zone.<br />
- In PoA you will die soo much at zone in waiting for the rest of the raid and in the top floors from spiders that you will hate this zone.<br />
- In PoW you will die soo much because unable to cast being pushed around in the water that you will hate this zone.<br />
- In PoF you will die soo much because a stupid bird charmed your MT and kill all the clerics wiping your raid that you will hate this zone.<br />
- Loot in EP is afterall nice.<br />
- You will end up in PoE exping at zone in gettin more than 1 AA per hour.<br />
