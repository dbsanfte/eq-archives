<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Active participant in above thread&quot; ... there's the answer to your update question. Grimbear has not been on these boards, that I've seen, for quite some time. Unfortunate; he did a really great job. I hope he hasn't left entirely.<br />

EDIT: Newest grey anon rep bump! &quot;Read what is said before condescending.&quot; LMAO! I wasn't condescending in either of these posts; In one, I posted a link, and in the other I said the original poster answered himself. I love morons! Thanks for the laugh.</div></div><hr />

Hey Zatriz! :) That news about Grimbear was among the first really positive things I've seen on these boards in awhile. I wonder how I missed his last post? Hm. Good to know he's still around, though.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just found post of his, clicked his profile and tada!  :)  His last post was in the Happy Holidays thread.<br />
<br />
Crucible seems really slow lately.  Usually check every couple days now that I am not in EQ and only 5-6 updated threads.  Tis sad.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah. I remember when I could come here every day and see a whole PAGE of new threads in the General section. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey guys :D<br />
<br />
I am very sorry that I havent been super active lately . First off with the holiday's Thanksgiving/Christmas I have been very busy IRL . <br />
Second , honesly since making the change to our top 1o list I havent had a TON of things to say that I felt were really worthy of posting .<br />
<br />
I do read the crucible and SoE boards everyday 'almost' . But i confess I have been a bit too quiet the past 6 weeks or so . Look forward to hearing a bit more from me in the comming weeks . Like i said things seem a bit quiet BUT ill stir something up for sure :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and thank you guys VERY much for the positive comments . I really do want to do the best job possible of gathering community feedback and presenting it it Brenlo and friends .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im impressed that you are still as positive about your &quot;job&quot;. The Crucible is truly fortunate to have someone like you doing all this. I had my doubts when you were appointed but you put them to shame :-)<br />
<br />
PS. It's still a mystery why a company like SOE dont hire people like Grimbear and pay them for keeping the community informed and bringing back information to the designers and programmers. Regular honest information keeps people happy (and paying) longer than almost anything else I suspect.</div></div><hr />

Well said!<br />
