<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me start off by saying that I personally feel that as a whole, shaman are pretty well balanced.  We have a few areas that could use some improvement, but I'm pretty happy with what our class can currently do.<br />
<br />
With that said, onto my suggestions.<br />
<br />
First of all, let's think about mana, and mana regeneration.  At this point, we are fine in this regard.  With Canni5, Canni4, and this new cannibalize spell that is currently in the works, mana should only be a problem for shaman in extreme cases.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at shaman DoTs.  We have some very good ones with high dps and moderate mana costs, and all of them stack.<br />
<br />
So, with all this mana, and all these damage over time spells, shaman should be doing huge amounts of damage, right?<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
The reason can be explained in 1 word:  Aggro.  Currently, aggro, not mana nor lack of spells to cast, is what is limiting our damage potential.<br />
<br />
Our damage over time spells are HUGE agro.  Huge, to the point that they are practically not worth using.  When you consider the fact that they take a relatively long time to reach full efficiency, and are easy to resist, it makes our damage over time spells nearly worthless.  At this stage in the game, the shaman can only realistically, even with a tank with good agro, cast ONE damage over time spell without worrying about taking agro.  You might be able to get away with more, depending on who is tanking and how long you allow the tank to build agro, but it is not feasible.<br />
<br />
So what ends up happening?  We are forced to use our highly inefficient, slow casting, and low damage nukes, because overall they end up being more DPS with less chance of gaining agro.<br />
<br />
An increase to our nuke is NOT what we need.  Nukes have never been a major strength of the shaman.  We do NOT need any more damage over time spells to be introduced, especially disease ones that are terrible DPS.  We already cannot use those that we have, due to agro limitations.<br />
<br />
What do shaman really need?  A way to dodge or limit the agro we generate.  Currently, the only real way a shaman can lose agro is through death or luck.  This is not sufficient.<br />
<br />
There are a few ways that the shaman's agro can be limited:<br />
<br />
1. By passively limiting the agro on shaman spells by changing the spells themselves or by giving the shaman a &quot;Spell Casting Subtlety&quot; type AA skill to reduce the agro that is generated.<br />
2. By adding an active ability, preferably an AA skill, that reduces the shaman's position on the hate list.<br />
<br />
What I propose is an AA skill, usable every minute or so, that reduces the shaman's agro (possibly using some mana, but nothing extreme).  Keep in mind, this is NOT intended to be shaman FD, or escape, or anything like that.  The best analogy I can think of is a more limited version of the wizard's &quot;concussion&quot; spell.  Give it a fairly long casting time, maybe 5 seconds, to limit its use, but make it drop the shaman's hate fairly substantially.  This will allow the shaman to cast more spells if he/she plans out when to use it, but is not very useful as an &quot;escape&quot; skill, since the casting time is so long.  Also, this would only be useful in long term fights- shaman's burst DPS would still be much less than other classes, which it should be.<br />
<br />
Considering how generally crappy our AA skill choices are at the moment, I don't think that something like this would be too out of line.  A skill like this would raise shaman's relative power without actually having to add any major upgrades that would step on the toes of other classes.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is just an idea, but any input or modifications on my idea would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem is not just aggro.  Yes we can stack lots of dots on a target.  We get that one nice tick of uber damage to show off at parties, I guess.  Sustaining all those dots is nearly impossible and you will run out of mana.  Any other class can just stand up, cast, sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is not a bad idea, but might trivialize a lot of soloing, on non summoning mobs, if i can dot, dot, dot the mob, slow, malo, cripple, and then drop off the hate list and see if dog dog can keep hate before he dies or i can mem a second spell set and then root the mob, canni, and start healing the dog.<br />
<br />
but really, more spells slots would allow me to to that too, if i could get the quick root off, reroot<br />
<br />
ok, so i figured you are talking in a group/raid.  it might make more than one shaman on a raid very viable, if they could stack some noticable damage, and not get summoned and wacked.<br />
<br />
perhaps with the melee &quot;improvement&quot; tanks will be able to gain/keep agro faster.  but i agree a gentle reduction in the agro we generate would be welcome.<br />
<br />
now myself, as a poor Kunark baby lvl 62, the stuff i hunt doesn't normally kill me when it leaves the tank and decides it likes bear butt better than chewey Ogre tank to eat.  it has gotten to the point that if the tank doesn't have to chase over to me to try and get agro, he asks if i am standing in the back just chain casting my CHA buff.<br />
<br />
i have tried to explain to him the value of CHA, but he does not listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it is a step in the right direction because I like to dot as well but have not loaded one up for probably almost 2 years (we all know why).  Anyway, the agro is one issue and the duration is the other.  Put a 6 tick max on all dots, re-work the agro and boom I'm back to being a shaman again instead of a poor mans wizzy.<br />
<br />
And to the above person who said it would make soloing too easy - I say so what...soloing isn't exactly what the game is about and if someone wants to solo more power to them.  BTW I have not soloed in a few years either - too boring for me but I fully appreciate those who want to.  I think that everyone remembers the soloing nightmare of 3-4 years ago when soloers disrupted group camps etc.  Fortunately the good drops are pretty much group or raid only now - so Sony could really save EQ by pumping up soloing for the casual or antisocial players.<br />
