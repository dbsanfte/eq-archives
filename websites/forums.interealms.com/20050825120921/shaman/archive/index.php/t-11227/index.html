<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like the new LoY spell thread is lame.   Gay even.  *** is up with you mods moving so many threads?   This is a GENERAL forum right?  All things dealing with shaman shoud be allowed here.   I haven't read the other forums on this board, except for maybe once a month or two, for 3 or 4 years now.   Do you really think anyone from Sony/VI bothers reading all the other forums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">THey do fine. If i had one thing to ask is that a lil : This was moved because :  post as its moved . Some are obvious , which wouldnt need it , others arent obvious. Just a personal thing , nothign to shout from the mountain tops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its amazing how many people have jumped on the anti-moderation bandwagon.  Heaven forbid someone actually post information about spells in the spells forum.<br />

The above remark shows just how lazy some have become.  Seriously, are you out to make a point or just join the mob?  Your post had no point, no new insight or arguement on the topic.  Just a lash out at the mods to fit in with the others.  Perhaps we should make an anti-moderation forum and move all these kinds of posts there....  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe Thantu should make the &quot;read new posts button&quot; day-glo yellow or some such.<br />
<br />
Wait, strike that: we'd have to wade through more crap.<br />
<br />
Folks, if moderation bothers you, just use that button.  Don't have to worry about which forum something is in.  Frankly, I like having things in the right spot.<br />
<br />
Yes, my underwear is arranged in the drawer by color, why do you ask?</div></div><hr />
