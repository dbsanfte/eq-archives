&lt;&lt; WARNING: This post discusses the current issue of flooding platinum onto the live servers. I am choosing not to participate in the scheme, but I feel I owe it to the EQ community to divulge what I know. It is not the actual event that bothers me, it is what the existence of such a thing entails. Also, I am not from your server, and will not be leaving my game name or server name.<br />
<br />
Im not going to flatter this post with many of my 'theories', so I am going to cut straight into the event and then briefly discuss what it means. Please copy this if you wish. Im trying to get this out to as many server boards as I can.<br />
<br />
There is a &quot;banker&quot; named Banker Aderodh that has been spawning in the dungeon Befallen off the adjacent zone WC. The bankers account is not tied to your global bank. When you transfer coin from gold to platinum, it goes at a 1/1 rate. But when you transfer it back to gold, it goes at a 1/10 ratio. This process can be quickly used to earn a &quot;monumental&quot; amount of platinum. I am a bard, thus I have track. I had never seen this name in befallen before, so I checked it out. Its a nervous habit of mine to transfer all of my change into platinum, so I noticed the bug. I then saw someone who obviously new about this come and port out. I petitioned the character.<br />
<br />
There is no way this is an un-intentional glitch in the game. The designers must have made some sort of code that separates this banker from the global banks. <br />
<br />
The reason I am telling this to everyone is quite simple in my eyes. I do not want my favorite hobby to be ruled by ebayers. The economics of this exploit only hurt the honest player. Now, either it will be even grounds, or this will get fixed. Do with this post what you will, thank you for listening.<br />
<br />
**PS: It was around 7pm in game time when the NPC spawned. I found him near the well to the bottom floor. I have no further information about the spawn time/place for the NPC. <br />
