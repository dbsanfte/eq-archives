<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All-<br />
<br />
Just dinged 39 last night so I went over to the Tim Deep and picked up the crushed diamonds, np.<br />
<br />
I know the clay and the bones can be begged/bought in the appropriate zone, then I find and kill the Yun Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda twinked (see below) but can I reasonably expected to dodge and run for the bones and clay and take down the Yun Shammy solo?<br />
<br />
My work and home schedule kinda prevent me from being really organized about EQ, and I'm in a small guild, but I can get a high level ranger to help for tracking if he's on.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, i dinged 39 last night, my guildy already has got me the yun shaman powder and ochre clay, all i need is greyish bone chips which i can ask for in KC via /ooc and the crushed diamonds in TD. IMO you won't be able to take down yun shaman yet, if you get a guildy to do that bit your fine for the rest of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">get it done asap, i would have been miserable without canni 2. get your guild to help you out with the shaman and keep your eye out for the ochre in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get it if you can.. If you have to, get someone to help you track and kill the yun shaman. Canni1 at 50+ can be summed up in one word.. painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">woot !  I got crushed diamonds in tim deep last night.  We went to check out the golras, but decided to go back to d.s. since it was better experience :-)  I kept the diamonds but had no idea what they were for as I hadn't looked up the canni 2 quest yet! :-)</div></div><hr />

Don't give up on it. The heckler probably didn't do the quest themself, so are jealous that you are trying to do it. I was 39 when I went for Cann II myself. I was able to get the Oche in CoM with help from a raiding party there, in KC a kind high level shaman helped me to get the bones, the diamonds out of TD were easy, and the Yun Shaman powder was very hard. He killed me twice before I finally shouted for help in TT. Luckily there was a raiding party headed for Sebilis and was kind enough to assist me in killing him, thanks to another shaman in their group convincing them to help...heheheh. BTW, I found the best spot (IMHO) to wait on the Yun Shaman is in the SE corner of the wall leading into Sebilis. I was able to come across three of those shaman pretty close together. Also, be prepared. Have every resist spell up. He casts a slow, then a poison dot, then a disease dot, then DD, then fights. Oh and roots too. Real nasty. And if you are on Erollisi Marr's Server, give me a shout. I will gladly come and help you kick this mob's arse...just for payback!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did mine at 39 with the help of some high level buddies (especially to pull Yun Shaman without adds). Yun was really easy to find (always saw a lot of them each time I went there, but always got add fighting them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye I've done some research on that Yun bastage.<br />
<br />
I'll bring some help along.<br />

Even if Can 2 is teh sux, its something kinda challenging to do.<br />

I found the best spot (IMHO) to wait on the Yun Shaman is in the SE corner of the wall leading into Sebilis.  <br />
<br />
Is this before or after going through the big archway that seperates the 2 areas?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ive been trying to find this sucka for 4 lvls, but ill get him.<br />
<br />
Waiting till i get JBB working at 45 and then i can kill adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quick question, how common are the grey bone chips?  I've never seen them for sale in the bazaar, so I don't know if /ooc'ingin KC would help if they drop only in a blue moon and everyone destroys them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">NO DROP and always drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Durdend,<br />
<br />
I believe the grey bone chips drop everytime, but they drop from the undead Skeletal Warlord,  who is quite deep into KC, so not killed that often, although I have seen him trained to zone on several occasions.<br />
<br />
The reason you have not seen them in the bazaar, is because they are No-Drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whats the best way to get to the Skelly Warlord if somebody does kill him, and lets me pity loot?  Other than hoping they train him to the zone first :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
According to EQ Atlas those chips may drop waaay back in KC (at leat waaay back for a 39 Shaman), and I bet invis won't help much, if at all. ITU 10 dose go for about 150pp on Torvon.<br />
<br />
Any helpful hints gang?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hints? hmm, hope KC is overcamped? Used to be easy when the place was packed...still busy now, but not like it used to be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">as far as KC is concerned, you just have to be lucky, unless you can get a force good enough to go camp the warlord<br />
<br />
the yun shammy...well it seems to be..although no one has yet agreed with me, that theyve fixed what was a really annoying faction issue in trakanons teeth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">FYI skelly warlord CAN spawn right before the courtyards... he can also spawn in alot of other skelly locations... so getting the bone chips shouldnt be too hard =P<br />

<br />
Now, where is the best place to find Yun Shamans again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hire a Ranger to track and pull it back to the TT zone for you. That's what I did, but only with my Druid. I was mid 40's at the time. I'm recommending a Ranger for you so he can also kill it for you. At 39 you wouldn't be able to take a Yun Shaman solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People generally back this up with a bunch of convoluted math figures, when what it really comes down to is that you have to hit the Canni key less.<br />
<br />
Thats a good thing.</div></div><hr />
