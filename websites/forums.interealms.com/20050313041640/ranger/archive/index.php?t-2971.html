<br />
Think there's still less than 20 of us out there with &gt;100 aa...those of us who are know how far rangers have come with AA.<br />
<br />
For the questions in the thread, maxed double riposte will grant you an additional 21 ripostes an hour or so tanking xp mobs.  With epics and modal dmg (45) for that 14 dmg weapon, you are looking at a little less to a little greater than 1k dmg average dealt in that hour as a result of 18 pts in double rip, if you are the main tank.<br />
<br />
However, don't expect to come out on top jousting with this guy :)  I have seen some pretty impressive quad joust passes as a result of this skill.  I elected to skip over it, since I primarily dual wield, or use my weapons as atk /hp/stat pieces for my archery in pvp.<br />
<br />
131 and goin strong :)  Grats on the 100 aa milestone!</div></div><hr />

Powerleveling doesn't work so well really..you get burned out..instead do camps your guild needs and fill up the group, pull nonstop, and solo when there isnt a group.  Unless there is a raid, or you are questing(tradeskilling as of late), put in 4 hours 5 days a week, (including raids), 2 of them are xp, easy enough to get 2 yellow a day if you pick your xp areas carefully.<br />
<br />
I have it easy tho, playing rng/clr/enc means I am an ae group waiting to happen, so its off to the deep for an aa in 2 hours :)<br />
<br />
It also helps to have a powergaming ranger peer in your guild..motivates..pushes.....Kraiven will be soon, or is at 200 aa...absolutely mindboggling the xp we can get if we make sure the yellow messages are flying across the screen for the time we play eq outside of raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I raid a ton.  I two box with my cleric and usually get atleast 1 aa per day even with raiding.  No i did not get innate camo yet because it did not fit into my vision for the first 100.  It does come within the first 150 though :).  <br />
<br />
  I set my AA up to gain more AA.  for example I did ambi first for damage output then did archery etc.  Then i started on the defensive aspect of the AA (double riposte, Natural Durability, Combat Agility, and soon Stability). <br />
<br />
  I have my first 200 points all laid out how i want them so I guess I'll see how it goes.  I love Double riposte it is a helpful tool but I hated the long exp it took to get that skill thats why I got it out of the way pretty fast.  The 9 point skills Suck :) .  Also no there is not another title yet but if there is one ill will get it in the next 43 lvls. (which i doubt).<br />
<br />
  Yes Skanda sutle is my two boxed cleric and he has a whopping 3 AA only because I got tired of outrunning him :)</div></div><hr />

I got burned out on power lvling so I have like 60 aa now and I have not gotten a point in a while. I may boot up my squad and push up to 80 or so soon though since people on my case in the guild cause I been slacking. /hug celt his elfbrotha !<br />
<br />
2) why on gods green eath would you max out riposte? we riposte for crap normally so maxing it out does not a whole hell of alot for us given the number of aa points it takes. Furthermore, we don't tank much and any time you are not tanking the skill is worthless. I mean I think the skill sorta sucks even for warriors but for anyone else it seems like a total waste.  I would much rather stick 18 points into archtype and max out crits and combat stability and agility...</div></div><hr />

He said he was 2-boxing with a cleric, with a mindset towards getting more AA quickly. Sounds to me like he will be tanking a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Double riposte actually is a useful skill in conjunction with agility 3 :) and yes i do tank alot as i normally do not group while i do my exp.  I can fight almost anywhere i want now and not have to many problems.  The other day I decided to take a break from exp grinding and decided I wanted to get my cleric some plate armor from the arena so I duod my way up and got him a full set of thurg plate.  Your vision is the only thing that limits what you can do.  I did things in a order that has made a huge diffference in my tanking abilities not everyone wants the same thing.<br />
<br />
  Celt your right jousting is my best friend in the arena :)  Its really funny when you pop them with arrows then when they try to get smart and melee you get a nice double riposte and damage them even more. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Celt,<br />
bro that is exaclty what I would prolly spend points on with the exception of healing gift. ( we heal for crap and that damn skill I hear never goes off so sorta a waste. ) I would get regen in archtype before I bother with healing gift. ****, half the time i play I don't bother to have greater heal even loaded. When a mob hits for 1k+ my 270hp heal has no shot in hell of saving my ass. Better to just pray that my cleric will save me !<br />
<br />
and if I am soloing.. I have a shaman there to heal me so... I don't use greater heal then either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celt</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Healing Gift is fun, but you are right in the fact that it is sparse in going off at level 1 :)  However, it has saved my life a few times soloing around normal xp mobs...and it is ONLY 2 POINTS hehe :)  I would have maxed this by now except I got my second box(es) working around 65 aa, so I have a cleric now...so my healing is on hold :)  The real benefit here is PVP of course...getting ramped up for the new test of tactics this skill WILL be awesome maxed, one heal in 10 is 540....<br />
<br />
Channel focus is again, pvp healing oriented...only reason to have it (other than tanking calefactions consistantly..which just rules hehe)<br />
<br />
Natural healing is on the horizon...after I max mental clarity with my next investment.  Then Body and Mind in Class.  After that Finishing blow 2 (to test the level theory, instead of percentage chance, there is an untested theory that it raises the level of the mob you can &quot;finish&quot;...I'm intrigued), possibly 3 if it pans out, level 1 and possibly 2 reinforcement for avatar longevity mainly, and then mass group buff for the spur of the moment pred during the emperor / seru zergfest :P  Then, Probably max out healing gift, channel focus, and finish off double rip or reinforcement...I dunno..we see how it goes.  At this point I am well rounded save my regens...which need to be addressed :)<br />
<br />
All the aa is worthwhile, even fear resistance if you plan on doing inner acrylia (mourn bristlebane server, and the weak rewards for the time spent).  You can't waste points...they all help..just some more than others.  Also they are situational...as finishing blow 1 speeds up xp like crazy at the goranga chief spawn/various monkey pulls/toilers, but if you mainly xp in fungus grove, the finishes are few and far between etc...and if you xp in ssra or ct..they are nonexistant :)<br />
<br />
Keep diggin, grind that 2 yellow every time you log on before you log off, and you will see results in a metered, easygoing (not loss of sleep grinding!) routine.  Heck, it takes me just over an hour to get 2 yellow these days in fungus if I leave my enchanter chill there, while i bring my cleric/ranger to raids and dual box..its just a quick punt to bind in shadowhaven, load up enchanter instead of cleric, and xp for just over an hour after the raids are done.  Well worth it to get your xp regimented..even if you only get ONE yellow per day...make it a habit...and you WILL see results over the next month.<br />
<br />
5 days a week, 2 yellow per day=2 aa a week=8 aa a month at the very least, that's if you don't do any weekend grinding at all....spend enough time pushing the envelope on a weekend grind you can solve out 3 points easily...and still 3 months of time will guarantee 24 aa in 3 months time..thats TWO arches completely maxed from start to finish, or if you are starting from zero aa, that's run3, regen 3, combat fury 1, finishing blow 1/natural healing 1 (depending on taste, I still like FBlow here), mental clarity 1, natural durability 3...ready to start your class skills :)  Another 3 months from then, you are guaranteed endless quiver and archery mastery 2, with 3 left to am3...all at just 2 yellow a day.  If you are like me, you end up with your quota on the raid days, and a whole lot more on the offdays when everything is dead on your server...where you net an aa easily a day.  Don't settle for less than 2 yellow though, and you will see yourself speeding up the aa significantly, with a part time schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakassan</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How fast was the exp coming in dual boxing with a cleric? Also what haste items do you have?<br />
<br />
I started dual boxing last weekend using a 60 chanter. I was grinding out a yellow AA in just about 40 minutes using the chanter primarily for buffing c3/haste and for slowing mobs.<br />
<br />
I had thought about using a shaman as they could buff/slow/heal and they have their own mana regeneration avenues. However, I think that would have been a little player intensive. I am interested in the exp rates and locations as I could possibly have access to a cleric and could try zones where mob melee is a little more &quot;powerful&quot;.</div></div><hr />
