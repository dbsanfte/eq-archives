<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At the zone in to the warrens from Paineel is a male erudite NPC , forgot his name ,but anyways when hailed he asks you if you are looking for work. Follow the quest dialogue key words and on the last phrase you have to say either I will help the merchants or i will preform the mercenary service .I forgot which one or the other though. <br />
Anyways though he asks for 2 badges (actually insignias) from each of the 5 ships the trolls use to raid the mercahnts at sea.And gives you a 10 slot container to place them into . These 5 ships are in Dulak Harbor (considering the boats are always there I dont see how they can get much raiding done) <br />
Again I didnt memorize the names exactly but its something along the lines of the Stormwave , The Lady Dirulia , Doldorans Run , Oceancrasher , and Scornwind. Kill the mobs that share the boats name , IE ~ A Scornwind Templar , A Stormwave deck hand , etc etc. <br />
The mobs on each boat vary in level Stormwave has the lowest level mobs then progressively the Lady Dirulia , Doldorans Run, Oceancrasher , and Scornwind with the highest level mobs on it a good deal of the scornwind mobs were blue at 61 Oceancrasher and Doldorans Run mobs were all lt blue at 61 and the final two ships were all green at 61. <br />
Anyways kill kill kill until you recieve an insignia bearing the ships name . A Scornwind Insignia , Oceancrasher insignia etc etc. These are NO DROP items. Youll need 2 from each ship average seems to be about 1:40 pirates for insignia. Although theyll also rarely drop a diamond or blue diamond to make the camp a little less painful along with the deepwater insignias used in paly spell quests i believe. <br />
After youve finally collected 2 insignias from each ship place them in the box you were given and combine .The box should ID as a sealed crate.Then give the sealed box back to the erudite in paineel at the warrens zone line. <br />
For this youll recieve : <br />
Symbol of Loyalty to the People <br />
4ac <br />
10 charisma <br />
30 hps/mana <br />
12 save disease / poison <br />
Magic , Lore , No drop <br />
Range slot <br />
all races all classes <br />
<br />
didnt say this quest was worthwhile just that its out there. =p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting post. I talked to that guy and got the merchant crate the first day and wondered what the end result would be. I havent done much exploring or hunting in the new zones yet. Guess I wont worry about it though...doesnt look like something I could use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't had much time to spend in LoY, but did find this zone and these ships.  Are there any named mobs that make the camp fun?  Was thinking when I first found the ships that maybe each ship had a captain or something to make them a decent xp/loot spot.<br />
<br />
Of course, I found after killing about 10 mobs on the two hardest ships that xp was horrid, so the only thing that could save these camps would be some loot.<br />
<br />
Any info you can provide would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah xp was pretty bad on the boats for the 60 plus crowd , probably because its designed for under 60s heh, the mobs on the scornwind werent too terrible for AA xp at least. Took me roughly 16 hours on the various ships and saw no nameds on any of them during that time. The only loot that dropped was the new version of fine steel with this expansion and rarely a diamond ,blue diamond or lesser gem star ruby, sapphire etc. <br />
But for targeted player range I had some friends come help me with their twinks a 56 BL , 54 ranger and 52 monk. On the doldorans run boat which was all lt blue at 61 they said the xp was very good for them. I just pulled with slow for them not grouped of course and supplied haste, didnt even have to heal them through the 3 hours we spent on that boat . Ended up making around 1500 in cash and gems for the group so wasnt a bad camp at all for the people it is intended for. <br />
One thing i did note on all the boats is root is nearly useless. Even on green cons resists ran in the 25-33% range and of the roots that did stick most broke in under 15 seconds. Also pet pathing caused dog dog to poof poof enough to make me go it without him.<br />
There was a seperate named in Dulak zone not on the boats that dropped a rather nice 1hb tho 15/23 8 wis (some other stats i dont recall offhand) proc'd a 73 hp lifetap shm/clr/dru useable.weapon name was Soulstriper or Soulsipper not sure where exactly it came from bard friend of mine saw a named on track went to kill it and she came back with her prize. <br />
