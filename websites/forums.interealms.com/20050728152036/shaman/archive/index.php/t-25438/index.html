<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been doing some extensive experience in Riftseekers and managed to snag a couple Flameshield Stones (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70307) only because the tank had four and nobody else wanted 'em. I put 'em on both my wrists, 'cause I had a 35hp aug on my quarm bracer and nothing on my new Volklana's Wristplate.<br />
<br />
Most of my stuff has pretty hefty AC, and I'm sitting at slightly under 2k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
My question is, Where do you draw the line in AC vs HP? I get beat on a lot at least by raid trash, and I'm still noticing reduction in damage by getting more AC. For instance, in Phase 3, I get very few 1k+ hits from the trash mobs. I have Defensive Instincts 5 maxed. HP wise I buff up to about 10.8k.<br />
<br />
Would you use a 25ac aug instead of a 40hp one?<br />
<br />
Magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45358&amp;alt=224348. The number is a bit off, I'm at 1981 unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">while I may not be at your level of play atm, both have their benefits<br />
<br />
but where I am currently, I'd make a mad dash for the HP, because more HP=more Mana=more Casting=more DPS/Heals/buffs/whatever....<br />
<br />
AC is a different concern, More AC=less HP taken from mob melee=More survivability=more of everything else because you are alive longer....but it doesn't extend resources of HP/Mana to such an extent as more HP...<br />
<br />
so they both kinda go hand-in-hand...only AC you need alot more of to make a noticable difference...I don't really notice a difference when I have personal AC buff up or down against WoS/MPG mobs hitting 500-1000 and rampaging constantly....they tear through my average buffed 6k HP pretty fast though...(always fun when you are on that MPG mob, and it decides to use you as ramp tank (O.o)...lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ac is one stat that seems to be hard to nail down to a specific value. On the one hand AC is extremely useful in decreasing how much mobs hit for and from the parses I've seen from the tank boards very effective at doing so. Unfortunately tho that requires large amount of ac. If memory serves correctly some parses with xegony showed that ever 100 ac over 2k ac was a 5% decrease in her dps or something like that.<br />
<br />
For shaman we're limited in the amount of ac we can get being a chain class. The net result is we'll probably never have enough ac for it to make a significant impact on big mobs on current content. In my case I'm about 2k ac raid buff and our biggest mt is nearing 3k raid buffed with a bard. Not to mention the 35 avoidance and 25% shielding he has. Those types of stats are pretty much impossible or extremely impractical for shaman to get. I have a hard enough time getting all the focus's I want, keeping my resists up and balanced while upgrading my gear.<br />
<br />
On the other hand when your talking about trash mobs on farming content that can be a very different story. In Potime the trash mobs in the first few phases are a far cry from the raid bosses in current content. Think back to what mt's where like back in the day when people where first getting into Potime. 10k hps and 2k ac was pretty good for a tank back then. Those types of numbers are definitely possible for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i am sure you know the 1hp to 5ac deal (25ac=100hp)...with my pally i use 6ac in that equation. i visit the pally boards often...although ezboard refuses to let me log on to post /boggle...from what i have read about plate ac there is no hard/soft cap anymore.  as taraddar said, with large upgrades in AC you see significant damage reduction even over 2k ac.<br />
<br />
you are about 1khp and 300ac ahead of me, but as much as i get beat, even in xp groups, i am going to go all AC at the detrimet of HP.  while 40hp isn't going to give me much of a chance if i am getting beat down, 25 ac sure will imo.  i had been thinking about going back to GoD to farm AC augs....that is serious as i ****ing hate GoD...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think its pretty much acknowledged that AC goes in &quot;steps&quot;. The latest thread I saw discussing this suggested there were very noticeable effects at the following numbers 1800ac, 2k ac and 2.2k ac.<br />
<br />
I think AC wise for a shaman try to settle for a number you are happy with and pad out the rest with hp and focii until you can maybe approach the next step after several upgrades of various slots.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd be very happy with 2k ac - I'm currently sitting about 1500ac and 8k raid buffed. <br />
<br />
A pally in my group the other day was so happy that he managed to hit 8.8k buffed (Conviction, Fortitude and Wunshi). I didn't have the heart to tell him he was only 800 hps more than me as a priest class :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think its pretty much acknowledged that AC goes in &quot;steps&quot;. The latest thread I saw discussing this suggested there were very noticeable effects at the following numbers 1800ac, 2k ac and 2.2k ac.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is really wrong but I do feel that is an over simplication of what is going on. Everquest actually really complicated in the way ti does alot of things. Ac may actually be one of the most complicated of the bunch.<br />
<br />
Can I say with out a doubt that I'm right? No but i don't even think anyone at sony could either at this point. The people have changed probably several times over for most and the game has gone well beyond what anyone envisioned i'm sure. Can just look at things like class balance and the constant tweaking of any number of things to see this.<br />
<br />
How does ac work? In a very specific cause it's very simple. The mob has an attack value. Thats compared against your ac value with a random number thrown in. The d &amp; d analogy of taco, a d20 and ac works well here. Now just like D&amp;D there's always a chance to hit. There also would seem to be always a chance to miss.<br />
<br />
Theoretically speaking if my ac is significantly bellow the mobs attack value the odds are extremely high that he'll hit me and increasing my ac doesn't effect that much if any. 100 bellow or 200 bellow. Either way he's still nailing you.<br />
<br />
By the same token if your ac is significantly above the mobs attack. Your already being hit for min or missed and adding ac isn't going to effect that much. 100 or 200 above doesn't make much difference either.<br />
<br />
The natural result is what's called an S curve. It starts off reletively flat gets to a point and starts curving up substantially and then gets to another point and starts flattening off again. Too high or too low and it doesn't have much effect but when your going threw that sweet spot it makes a pretty big difference.<br />
<br />
This is where the idea of steps come from. Mobs in a particular zone often share many things in common. Level, hps, etc. It's reasonable to assume attack is simular too. If all the mobs in a zone or in several popular zones have 2000 attack or what ever it happens to be then obviously in those area's your going to see great effects getting to the top of that curve at 2200 ac or what ever it is. Of corse you might need 2400 ac for the monks in the next zone or next expansion. Thus the value of ac is always dependant at least on what mob your considering.<br />
<br />
There are other factors. Level difference seems to effect things more than just better gear and higher skills would seem to sugguest. I suspect that it adds a bonus or penalty to the equation outside of a particular range. Especially when you look at ranges where no improvements in skill are possible, IE going from lvl 60 to 65 for most classes.<br />
<br />
In the extreme consider this. Do you think you'll take any less dps from a skelly nakid at level 70 or fully clothed? Either way your natural ac and level make it almost impossible for him to hit.<br />
<br />
This is why I say on the one hand it can be very helpful in easier content but wouldn't consider it a substantial factor for challenging conent. We simply can't get our ac high enough to get to the bottom of that curve in challenging content. Sure ac is nice and always welcome on gear I pick up but I'd say it's only slightly ahead of wisdom. It's one of those things that just comes with good gear not what makes it good gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I expect we are on a different mitigation table to the tanks who are talking about the 1.8, 2, &amp; 2.2k steps, &amp; perhaps different from the other chain classes too. The only way we will find out is through parses. <br />
 <br />
The only detailed parse I've seen that included shamans is a fairly old monk one. Oddly, a cleric with 2-300 more AC was getting hit for around the same as the shaman. That suggests there might be a &quot;priest&quot; table with a fairly low softcap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does unbuffed AC make any difference over buffed? I vaguely recall reading something somewhere that suggested that some class should shoot for 1k unbuffed, perhaps because of the &quot;steps&quot; people mention - don't see how where the AC came from would make a difference....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As has been mentioned already, priests are on a different mitigation/avoidance table than melees. This is not to say all melee's are on an identical table, but have a higher &quot;soft-cap&quot; than we do.<br />
<br />
IIRC, PoP-era shaman soft cap was parsed to be around 1350 AC. That is to say, that the benefeit of additional ac points beyond that was negligible. I can't recall, but seem to think that this took into consideration MOB attack value too. IE, regardless of the lvl &amp; interpreted attack rating between various mobs, 1350 seemed to be about the magic number in this expansion-era. <br />
<br />
For example: whether you were fighting sentries in PoJ, or Warriors in PoF, any AC over 1350 didn't make much difference.<br />
<br />
I volunteer you for a long &amp; excruciating parse of this in OOW Grizlor :)<br />
It will be a long time if ever before I worry about sacrificing between hps/ac since right now I'm only at 5K/1250.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Just took a careful look at your magelo (/drool) &amp; didn't see ANY +% dodge effects, 0 improved dodge modifiers, 2% shielding &amp; only +10 avoidance. This may be a better spent area to concentrate upon. I have an improved dodge II aug I made out of leftovers &amp; immediately upon equipping it, notiticed at least a 25% increase in &quot;dodge&quot; message. 25% more of not a lot isn't much, true, but better than nothing. Maybe an improved dodge III aug is in order?<br />
<br />
Is there more +% dodge, +avoidance, &amp; +shielding stuff out there you could get ahold of? That wouldn't be a downgrade stat-wise? You have a few redundant focii, those might be some slots to look at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bear in mind that this is only his parses against ONE MOB, and that each mob's sweet spot is, in all likelyhood, going to be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Upon further thought, I think I was reciting Luclin-era info...<br />
<br />
&quot;Priest Soft Cap&quot; is ringing in my ears though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A very small quantity of avoidance is actual dodging. most of it is &quot;missing&quot; due to high AC or avoidance AAs. 30% for improved dodge 3 might seem like a lot, but if dodges only make up 10% of our misses, and misses account for 40% of swings.... you're talking maybe 1-2% less damage for improved dodge III. Better than a couple points of shielding yeah, but not worth blowing a discordant scoriae.<br />
<br />
Regarding percentage to dodge, Vallon Zek sleeves have 4%, but more cold resist is the last thing I need, and I'm holding out for Kanleku's. 6% spell Shield &gt;&gt;&gt; 4% dodge.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are throwing around the number 1350... that very well may be the cap on trash mobs in PoJ, who are like level 45-50 and have fairly low atk. Versus something like Riftseekers trash, they are higher level (con yellow at 70) and are likely to have much higher of an attack rating, thus you need higher AC to match it. I'm pretty sure all this nonsense about &quot;Soft Caps&quot; is exactly that, nonsense.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the question still stands: would you use a 25ac aug over a coal?</div></div><hr />

Nope - not on the five slots that can take one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Me neither, but then Sam &amp; I are practically identical in specs. Err in caution &amp; go HP I say.<br />
<br />
My crappy input is that a 1325ac (buffed mind you) shaman, with LR5, IDII, &amp; +5% dodge is quickly turned into Barbarian pudding in PoP eles, GOD anything, &amp; most definitely OOW.<br />
<br />
OOO to tank.. I log on my lil ogre when I feel the need. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When i played i didnt use AC augs unless i didnt have anything else to put in that slot.<br />
Since you are pretty much at the same level as me i would say that you should always try to get HP then resists then AC. I talked to a ranger i know its not the same think but he said that his AC is up to ~2100 now, and i think shamans AC is a bit lower so if you got ~2000 unbuffed you got alot to spare. my guess is that we are ~1850 AC now, but i didnt test this at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cosikfin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">avoidance and spellsheild are the 2 effects i look for. i've never done any phasing but i've seen a huge drop in the damage u take soloing in solro sence i uped my avoidance from 20 to 47</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Below a lvl of AC given certain content you are going to get hit, and hit for as hard as that content will hit you, if getting the lvl of AC neccasary is impractical then HP's is your friend.<br />
<br />
Above a lvl of AC given certain content you are going to get hit for less, if getting AC above the mark is practical dropping HP's for AC makes sense to a point.<br />
<br />
I figure HP's are great if you can keep them, if your not mitigating worth a damn it won't matter how many hps you have, with the content we're doing now you won't keep them long enough to use them if you can't mitigate and avoid.</div></div><hr />

Love those warriors. I think a 2k AC shaman might be able to distill some information from there as well. Make sure you tell them what your ac is Grizlor, I'd love to see the response :)</div></div><hr />

Nope. I check in at around 1430 AC buffed (I'll have to get the exact number sometime), and that's fine by me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&lt; AC freak<br />
<br />
Sit at AC2204 buffed, and I can tell ya it makes a huge difference ....<br />
<br />
At AC2204 I can actually Main Tank in MPG with only 1 - 2 CH's per mob (and my Cleric has grouped with WORSE tanks that apparently need back to back CHs, up to 4 per mob) ....<br />
<br />
There are no AC 'softcaps' as people refer (except for monks), but more along the lines of AC 'sweetspots' depending on the Era ....<br />
<br />
Original EQ had a sweet spot around AC800,  Kunark moved it to around AC1000,  Velious was AC1200-AC1400 depending on Zone, PoP was AC1500-AC1700 depending on zone, GoD was AC1800-AC2000 depending on zone, and OOW was scaled back a bit for ' everyone ' to enjoy .... OOW sweet spot remains AC1900 (WoS) - AC2100 (RS) ....<br />
<br />
You will find its a general rule .... Knights / Warriors with AC's below the 'sweetspot' will 'require more healing' if you speak to Clerics ....  <br />
<br />
Find a curious Cleric (one that always asks a tanks HPs / AC) and they will confirm the existence of some sort of sweet spot .... <br />
<br />
What does it mean in terms of HPs?!? I don't know ... my general rule of thumb is +AC15 is worth to me around +40 HPs ... would I swap an AC25 Augment for a HP+40?!?  HELL YES !!!!<br />
<br />
Hehe, I would even swap out my +90 mana augment on my other wrist for another AC25 augment !!!!<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />

I am low on hps, so I still worry about AEs during raids etc.. but I will take AC at a 3:1 ratio as a general rule. so 15 AC &gt; 45 hps. HPS, but 20 AC &gt; 60 HPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have to find that AC camp in Rift, all I get are the lousy 70 and 65 HP ones (just kidding, still need some more).  But I too notice the difference of AC in OoW, I actually keep AB up most of the time to break 1900.  I even still carry the old JB BP for the 17 AC clicky :).<br />
As in value of AC over HP, I think my ratio is about 3:1, I'd use a 15 AC aug over a 40 HP one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">to get to the 25ac aug camp, head up into fire, take the third right, then the first left.  go left in the room past the first mob, then set up along the wall between that mob and the one to the north.<br />
<br />
If you're good, you can keep that room clear, plus roamers, plus the familiar venomtail (from the balancer/rs room go south, take a left, its the chimera on your right in the next room) who drops some charm and a 4 fire damage aug also.<br />
