<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sch08835</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 20th level Shaman Bar. I am trying to figure out what weapon I should be using.  Currently I am using a Northman's Mace 1H blunt.  I have a really high 2h Blunt Skill from my lower levels using a Fine Steel weapons.  I started using the mace and my skills are getting good.  I have run into people who tell me I should be looking for a piercing weapon.  I solo alot and have been doing well.  Should I wait and Max out my 1H blunt first ??  or look for a piercing weapon ??  Any ideas are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would depend on your preference, but if you intend to get epics, work you piercing.  Personally I've found 2HB a waste (Warhammer of Ethereal Energy looks nice, but doesn't do much).<br />
<br />
Also, do your shield (bashing) practice, as in later levels this would help your group with caster mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sch08835</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found the 2hb to be a waste too.  I do good damage with the 1 HB.  What is a good weapon for to start with for piercing skill ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With Luclin, there are better 1HB options than before (Centi warhammer, Goronga club), but 2HB is still a viable skill.<br />
<br />
I'll not pretend to be a tank.  any melee damage I do is gravy.  most of my damage is from dots and my pet, but it sure makes me smile when I hit for 71 max, and average close to 40.<br />
<br />
I use a barbarian spiritists hammer (22 41, 13 wis, procs winters roar 263pt DD).  I get better wis from this than from my old spine chill spear and shield of falsehood.  It has a better damage/delay ratio also.  I paid 4000pp for it about 6 months ago.  I've since seen it in the bazaar on Drinal for 1000pp.<br />
<br />
Check it out, or a drakkel icegrinder for a much cheaper alternative.  I still carry my spine chill and a clay guardian shield for the times i need AC more than wis, but I carry my options with me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">None of the weapon skills is a waste at high level since there is weapons with important additional procs.<br />
Journeymans Walkingstick to Tash in 1hb is very helpful in some situations<br />
2hb with Knockback effect can come in handy sometimes<br />
Stun on the piercing weapons (e.g. Howling Harpoon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, do your shield (bashing) practice, as in later levels this would help your group with caster mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't get bash as a skill - only 1 pt in slam (for the large races).  But Seanus is correct, you need to get used to slamming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bought a Poison wind censer for 250pp. Its 2hb, 20/28, proc Gale of poison. Try it on ice giants, they are so bigm that you can melee them without being caught in the AOE. At level 51 I can melee them without any dots or nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Work all 3 skills. Do it NOW, dont wait to max 1.<br />
<br />
In order to get skill raises you have to be fighting light blue con mobs or better. as you get higher level, the mobs hit harder and harder, and if you are trying to raise weapon skills from a low base, you are gonna spend a lot of times sewing your butt back together.<br />
<br />
There are lots of great weapons in each of the 3 skills. Most people concentrate on piercing, but  am currently trying to get a few more points in 1hb and using a Dark Ember, which is actually not a bad stick!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree Weyalan<br />
<br />
I used 1hb a little and mostly 2hb when I was young (when Staff of the Observers was a sweet item) and then used Piercing up to 200 with JCP/Epic.  Raising my 2HB from around 80 or so after I was level 60 was pretty tough.  I highly recommend that you raise them all as you advance.  My 2HB is now 198 and I do almost as many DPS with my Hammer of Spiritcalling as I do with JBB.  Even if you prefer to keep using JBB, having a big 2HB swing in between each JBB cast is pretty nice.  Remember that right click items do not cause your melee attack to wait for recycle the way regular spells do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did 1hb ALOT when I was levels 1-30ish. Now I regret it bigtime. I wish I would've done 2hb much much more than I did. I started it way too late and now it's almost impossible to get up. Max weapon skills ASAP, they are invaluable 50+ (IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">see if you can pick up a slime covered harpoon, that took me thru till around 49. and 2hb is NOT useless. i have a barbarian spiritists hammer and i hate myself for not working on it sooner. even with my low skill (100) the thing proces atleast 3 - 5 times a fight. i regularly steal aggro with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stilts Stonebender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Jade Chokidai Prod  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=743)works pretty well also. It's rather easy to get. If you're &lt;40th lvl, you may want to get some help from a friend or two. It has good damage/delay and +6 to WIS. Plus, they go for ~1K on Lanys. (it's part of the HS key quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chulain said it. I use the Barbarian Spiritist Hammer with JBB and just love the sound of the JBB landing followed by the Hammer procing. Had it happen twice in one fight with a Seafury Cyclops yesterday. That's the fun in wading in and meleeing instead of sitting and watching something rot in place. It can't all be about efficiency, can it? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You definately want to keep up all your weapon skill as best you can.  I used a Bloodstained Fang from level 8 when someone gave it to me (thanks Teem) till 18 when I found a Groaning Mace on a merchant for 134pp.  That's when I realised how important it is to keep all your skills up.  Here I had this great new weapon and couldn't hit the broad side of a barn for 5 levels.<br />
<br />
Some weapons you should keep an eye out for that haven't been mentioned are a Bogling Chieftains Spear (10/26, fast for leveling skill and rare but cheap),  Staff of Living Sand (sell for 200pp but hits like a groaning mace with a proc), or a Skull-Shaped Sacrificial Hammer (6/24 with a nice damage shield proc,  great for skilling up).<br />
<br />
Of course, if money isn't a problem get a Rune-Etched Icewurm Fang.  Amazing little weapon but never less than 3kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sch08835</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have The Imbued Northman's Mace for a 1HB and now I have recently got the Slime Covered Harpoon for a Peircing weapon.  I am still looking for a 2HB weapon.  I have my 2HB up to 70 and my 1HB to 100 I just started Peircing at about 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well for piercing(even with epic) i think this spear is prolly one of the better choices, and at lvl 52 (with a good solid group) not really hard to get, or buy see em in the bazaar on TM often enough for around 4 to 6k<br />
<br />
rune etched icewurm fang <br />
12 dmg 19 delay<br />
5wis 30 or 35 mana<br />
effect spirit strike 81hp coldbased dd spell<br />
<br />
for working piercing skill this wpn rocks, its fast does decent dam and with high dex 170+ procs 4 to 7 times a fight normally with a skill of 150 or higher <br />
i also have a barb spirit hammer 2hb, but i got away from 1hb i need to really work that soon just because</div></div><hr />
