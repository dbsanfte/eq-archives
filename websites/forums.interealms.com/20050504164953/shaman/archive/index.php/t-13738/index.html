<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">think of it this way, you have maxed your metal capacity, and have gained such control over your metal faculties that you can conjure spirits to be commanded at your wills, you can command the very nature of life itself to harm or heal others, <br />
you have the ability to Increase the very essence that gives a person lifes breath. <br />
you can control and command the force in and around a living object in such a manner as to slow its attack. or even stop its movement. <br />
<br />
but you are too damn stupid to remember more than 7 things at a time...freak you suck! <br />
lets see if this was real... you could remember what day, what month, and what year it is, your name, where you live, how old you are, and lets see....oh yeah, cant forget where you left your car keys....but then again you wouldn't be able to drive because that would require you to remember another dozen things, but you're just to stupid to do that!<br />
<br />
so tell me again why the drunks at SOE made it so we can only have 7 spell gems?</div></div><hr />

They didn't... we have 8.<br />

I have to admit rants are more effective when the small details are correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">despite the details being wrong, i just wanna say, i feel your pain.<br />
<br />
This is one of my only thigns in EQ that REALLY annoys me. Ive finaly gotten used to it enough, thank god and a 35 min group haste never hurt too, but i cant see what the harm in creating a lil toggle button on top which gives us 8 more slots. make it a AA skill, i would pay 12 AA for this easily .<br />
<br />
But i think the fact is that SoE isnt going to change it, i mean i know it was verant that made that claim , but it just seems to big of a thing.<br />
<br />
/crosses fingers, never know though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A lot of spells have been added to the game since the original EQ wrld that didn't have as many spells.<br />
WE NEED an upgrade.<br />
<br />
10 woudl be much better and woudl make a hell of a lot more sense than 8 atm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">8 is supposedly a magically significant number, which the designers seem to feel fits well with having the same number of spell slots.....<br />
<br />
I guess in reality thers some complicated coding they cant be arsed to untangle!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think they are just stupid, much easier to handle that way. <br />
and you know...i really do think they are stupid, i bet they dont even play this game...im sure they did at one time, but after a while they all got the attitude of &quot;been there done that&quot; and dont think they need to get into it anymore, <br />
and theyre just plain and simply stupid. <br />
<br />
=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">8 is supposedly a magically significant number, which the designers seem to feel fits well with having the same number of spell slots.....<br />
<br />
7, 9 and 10 are more magically significant, as is 13.  But you must remember that developers are geeks.  And to a geek, 8 is a VERY significant number.  It wasn't magical convention that these guys were honoring, but binary convention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 more spellslots would be nice but I got over it a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">4 more slots would suit me just fine.  Not being able to keep all of the spells that a particular type of play session requires, and thus having to swap spells out constantly, is one of the small frustrations of the game that I could do without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would love to be able to use Alt+9 and Alt+0, making it a nice even 10 slots.<br />
<br />
I have also come up with another system that I know will never ever be put into the game.  Giving us a spell bank like one person said already, but the way it would work is the best part.<br />
Even if it was only two pages, unlike the hotkey bank with 10 pages, it would be fine.  3 or more would be better though.<br />
<br />
Let's just say that bank 1 had your fighting spells in it, and bank 2 had your buffs in it.  You could just hit a button and you would sit and automatically forget the fighting set of memorized spells.  Then just start to mem the new spells, from the buff spell bank, automatically.  But, if the banks you are switching between contained the same spell and in the same slot, like haste, then that one wouldn't have to be rememorized.  When you are done buffing just push the buttons again to revert back to the other spell bank.<br />
<br />
You could just push a couple of buttons and you would be ready for buffing your group without having to hunt through your spell book and find the right spells, then push the buttons again, and be ready for fighting mode again.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could still do it the old way also.<br />
<br />
Again, I know it would never happen, but I think it is a good system.  I can imagine uses for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do you guys really realize what you are asking? To you know what adding 2 gem slots would do?<br />
<br />
-- All boats in OOT would break.. The ones in TD would sink.<br />
<br />
-- The spires would send everyone in the zone NOT inside the spires to the nexus every 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
-- The PoP books would send you to a randomly selected book somewhere in the world, but never to PoT...all the books in PoT would send you to another book inside PoT<br />
<br />
-- Spelling mistakes fixed in the last 5 months would reappear, and many doors in Freeport would again swing the wrong way.<br />
<br />
-- The keys on your ring would fall off.<br />
<br />
-- The graphics for all of your inventory slots would be mixed up, so it would appear that you are wearing a halas meat pie for a hat. (that was a fun day)<br />
<br />
-- By zoning into the bazzar, you would appear as a naked female dwarf, complete with beard, and be unable to change form even after leaving the bazzar.<br />
<br />
-- There would be a solid cohesive storyline to Everquest, a situation that would have to be remedied with a quickness.<br />
<br />
-- Cons would reverse, Green con monsters would kill you instantly, red cons die with a whimper, and corpse poof. <br />
<br />
-- You WILL get stuck in the geometry.<br />
<br />
-- Froglocks will once again be the whipping boys of Norrath. (not a bad thing)<br />
<br />
-- The servers will come down for a 8 hour patch, To be followed by a 4 hour emergency patch, supplimented by a further 3 hour patch to fix a loot table bug in the Erudin palace, which was not designed to be hunted in in the first place!<br />
<br />
With this in mind...Im happy with 8 gem slots :)</div></div><hr />

Lol, I think you've just about covered it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think you forgot:  Zoning out of any indoor zone would send you to the Cat Room, from which you couldn't zone out again<br />
<br />
And zoning form an outdoor zone, it'll send you to the one-way locked room in Runnyeye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What's this 8 slot garbage? I only use 4. Makes it interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lovisla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Remember new expansion in the fall:<br />
New zones<br />
New melee skills<br />
new quest<br />
<br />
<br />
My predictions ...and many others believe the same<br />
New race: most likely Rats<br />
New carrot (for people who say they will not buy it cause they don't want a new race or new dungeons ...just like I said I would not buy LOY then they expanded the banks:  2 more gem slots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">lets see if this was real... <br />
If this was real we wouldn't be casting any spells :p  I'm ok with 8 slots.  The farthest I'd go toward supporting the idea of more would be an aa that casts gate without having to have it memmed.  Could be just one level, or could be 2-3 levels, lowering cast time with each level.. .I dunno, something like that..   SOE gives us a zillion and one things to complain about, most are more important than the number of spell slots available, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I did see a thing from the developers saying that they would increase the amount of gem slots. Wasn't this on that famous statement when they were talking about their future plans?<br />
<br />
I could have dreamed it though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you want to complain about something, complain for the meleers. The stupidest creatures of Norrath can bare-handedly defeat a warrior with lightsabres. Is this fair? What is it about the races we choose that make them so physically imcompetent that they can not beat the snot out of anything within 10 lvls of them past lvl 50? I mean, you refered to how stupid a person must be to not be able to remember more than 8 things? So let's count what a warrior must remember. Press A. Press kick/bash. Crap, what next? ummmm, oh yeh, press hotkey that says &quot;/g SOMEBODY PLZ HEAL ME IM GETTING MY ARSE HANDED TO ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean how many games are there where not only is the master of physical combat unable to do any damage, he also can't do anything but press auto-attack button.<br />
<br />
Velius/planar mobs should be made harder (WAIT, HEAR ME OUT!), and warriors should be made MUCH better. Like an AA that maxes at 4 points, where each point the user is granted an additional 500 hp. Each would obviously require 15+ AA, but still, they deserve it.<br />
<br />
Also, how can a weapons master miss a mob 3 out of 4 swings when the mob is ROOTED TO THE FREAKIN GROUND?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think that the higher you go in level, the more spells you should be able to have memorized at any one time (aka D&amp;D).  This may mean that you start out at only 4 or 5 slots (lvl 1), and wind up with 10 or 12 slots (lvl 65).  That would give a little more incentive to level after 61 or so.</div></div><hr />
