<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question on Artisans.<br />
<br />
I was doing some quests on the Isle of Refuge yesterday and some dude asked me to clean his basement.<br />
<br />
I did and found that while I was doing that I dinged to level 2 in Blacksmithing!<br />
<br />
I made him some file he asked me to make and dinged level 3 Blacksmithing!<br />
<br />
Does that screw up my chances to become an Alchemist?<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
<br />
Where in Qeynos (Level 7 citizen now) can I start doing quests to move me towards scholar/alchemist?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rayche</div></div><hr />

You do this by talking to an npc in Q harbour. If you want to be an alchemist pick scholar first, then before lvl 20 you can pick alchemy.<br />
<br />
2. You need to join a society. First choice will be a wholesaler society until you ding 10 and have picked your spcialization area (scholar). After that you need to join a scholar society. Look around in the Qeynos city zones for npcs standing next to doors. Talk to them and one will ask you if you want to join. NPCs in these tradeskill zones will give you tasks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just dinged level 8 tonite (Regular, still level 3 Artisan)<br />

Servers went down then :(<br />

Off to watch some Episodes of Babylon 5 on DVD in bed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not sure if this happens for everyone, but I got a note from that initial tradeskill quest guy last night with a list of contacts in the city for tradeskills.  That list might be hiding out in your inventory somewhere (unless it's a new thing).</div></div><hr />
