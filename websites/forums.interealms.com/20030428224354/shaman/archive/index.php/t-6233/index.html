<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aelric Frostbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alchemy is a joke, period!<br />
<br />
Why make a Gate to Everfrost potion for 170pp when you can have a Faithstone that never uses a charge?<br />
<br />
Why bother making clarity type potions that you fail on when you can get KEI that lasts over 2 hours?  Mine as well level a chanter to 60 instead of working on tradeskills, its cheaper and you can make a heck of lot more cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unhappy my old friend? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aelric Frostbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi Garf, good to hear from you :)<br />
<br />
Aye, as far as alchemy goes yes I am unhappy hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ummm cause the clarity potions stack with chanter buff? Don't they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't bothered to make any clarity potions because they are so $$$.... but I started adding odd spells to my trader this weekend just so I had them on hand for my guild.... imagine my surprise when I sold Kilva's Skin of Flame (400) and Disease Treatment (120)<br />
<br />
:) I was very happy about that. I guess every now and then, people want the odd stuff. But I doubt it would sell regularly.<br />
<br />
Faithstones don't work for non-shamans and clerics by the way, so if you are KOS in Thurg, you'll want a gate potion if you are a melee that does planar raids or pickup raids.<br />
<br />
Or if you don't have the time to get the parts, a shammy gate potion can be bought NOW rather than later, and doesn't cost a k..... I do plan on stocking these once I get the skill.<br />
<br />
I also plan on adding more odd potions some day,  just right now I am trying to afford malo and torpor.</div></div><hr />
