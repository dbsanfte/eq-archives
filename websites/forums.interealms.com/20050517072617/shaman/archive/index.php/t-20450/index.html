<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having been involved with the WoW Alpha since November 2003, I was going to do a big write-up for this board.  <br />
<br />
I noticed though that Whizbang put together an excellent writeup over on Graffe's so in the interest of being lazy I will just cross-link it for your reading pleasure!<br />

<br />
Supposedly beta emails are going out over the next 2-3 days (posted by a Katricia on one of the official boards) for phases 1 and 2 (and phase two folks can't actually join the beta yet even though they're being notified - don't ask me, I'm just passing along what I've read).<br />
<br />
WoW does sound better and better all the time.  I've been reading lots of threads about it at various forums since the NDA was lifted and I have yet to see a seriously negative comment.  In fact, many have said the alpha was more solid than many recent MMORPG releases (not saying much since they've often been total garbage) and that they'd pay and subscribe for WoW now (again, people are often rabidly hyped for a new MMOPRG and write this kind of stuff).<br />
<br />
The write-up by Whizbang is very good reading.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it Litgruv. Usually they do a char wipe before the go live. In Eve they gave everyone crazy stats for a day before they killed the beta servers and went live.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if blizzard are definately planning a European based server? After getting used to nice low ping times on AB, I doubt I could go back to the days when I had a ping in the 300's  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't really all the hot and bothered over WoW, but after this post...I'm seriously starting to look at it as an alternative to my unfortunately faltering love for EQ.<br />
<br />
If things are as good as they look/sound so far...it could be a real winner!<br />
<br />
-Z</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hadnt played Warcraft 3 till very recently, a Doctor friend of mine hooked me up with a copy of it for Xmas and until then, I hadnt really understood what all the hub-bub was about for people jonesing for WoW.<br />
After playing it (between EQ sessions, patches, and when my daughter simply wont let me play EQ) I finally began to see what all the fuss was about.<br />
WoW is the only game that could drag me from EQ...I have a lot of time and effort (and frankly cash, the amount of cash I have spent on computer upgrades in the name of a game is insane) wrapped up in EQ, but WoW is looking simply amazing.<br />
See ya there maybe, till then Norath has my attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It may be a mistake for us to think that we've seen all this before: that this is just yet another 'game that will kill EQ', like DAOC or Diablo2.  WoW looks like it does genuinely offer something that is better than the other alternative MMORPGs that have come along.<br />
<br />
I had thought that the evolution of EverQuest into EverRaid would make it vulnerable to any MMORPG that chose to focus more on the wants of the majority of its playerbase.  According to a poll on this forum only roughly one half of EQ's playerbase bothered to buy GoDs - and that on a forum whose membership is heavily biased towards the very players that GoDs was designed for.  I would have thought that this alone indicates the vulnerability of EQ.<br />
<br />
But it seems that even Uberguild raiders are interested in WoW.  It will be fascinating to watch how this works out.</div></div><hr />

Ever since SOE took over EQ got Luclin, POP, LOY, LDON, GOD. 5 expansions and some of them (ahem POP) screwed a lot of people over. People want the magic back. People want to play a game run by a company that cares about its image and its fans. WOW is most likely coming out by the end of the summer and if not that then this year for sure. EQ got nothign on wow. Broken economy and memories of what it once used to be. A lot of vetrans have left and are leaving. Maybe once 300 000 + people leave the game will rebalance itself. MAYBE. But until then we got WOW and I am not looking back.<br />

Amen to that. I shouldnt have bought GoD to be honest, because again, I'm just itching to pull the plug on my EQ account. EQ2 has, however, sparked my attention also (not sure if anybody mentioned it, cause I didn't read everybodies' post). The game, I must admit, looks simply amazing (even if I can't even run it on this computer). The changes made sound amazing. However, thats a whole nother topic on itself. WoW does look and sound awesome, I only wish that THEY LET ME INTO THE BETA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I wasn't raid level yet when pop came out, but I'd still rank it as my favorite expansion. GoD on the other hand sucks hardcore. I've been there twice since I bought it with one character out of 5 accounts that I got it for. I wouldn't have bought it other then going there for guild events but we haven't even bothered with it yet (got elemental access instead).<br />
<br />
As far as WoW goes I seriously can't wait. I've been a huge warcraft fan since the first game and everything I've read so far has been positive which for a mmorpg I've never seen that happen. (Face it, generally we're a pretty whiney bunch). <br />
<br />
Still hoping for that beta email myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hoping to get into beta myself. I have 5 active eq accts, and only one has GoD. figured i'f i'm boxing I can at least do the leadership stuff with one toon and that'll be enough. Unless of course it doesn't work like that and I wasted $30 on getting to GM alchemy for cheap. <br />
Blizzard knows what gamers want, and they continue to deliver the goods with every game they release. I still play diablo 2 quite a bit, and have played warcraft 2 and the original alot as well. Didn't really like the custom scenario's difficulty level in warcraft3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Warcraft 3 was the worst game ive played in a while.  Utterly terrible and horribly boring, and completely unimaginative, about the only game i hate more is Diablo 2.  I dont look forward to wow because its playerbase is likely to be so screwy, even if they do manage to make a good game (no idea on that yet).  They can hype it all they want but i'll wait for the results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet you continue to play EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for linking the write-up.  It was informative, and gave me some idea of what the game will be like.<br />
<br />
On the game, though, WHERE ARE THE DAMN OGRES?! /sob<br />
<br />
My biggest hope when I first heard about WoW was that I would finally be able to play an Ogre Magi, like in WC2.  In WoW (so far), it seems like they don't even exist as npcs.<br />
<br />
Also, what's with not being able to group with certain races?  I understand the rationale for it based on the storyline, but come on, there should at least be quests that allow you to 'defect' to the other side if you choose.  Fantasy literature is rife with characters that have converted, defected, betrayed their homeland to the enemy, or are otherwise unfettered by their culture.  Make it really hard, require great sacrifice from the player, whatever.  Don't make it impossible.  I play role playing games because I enjoy investing my character with the traits, tendancies and preferences that I choose to give him.  To be told categoricaly &quot;YOU CANNOT COOPERATE WITH THIS OTHER PLAYER CHARACTER, PERIOD&quot; sits not at all well with me.  I want to be able to be Grendel if I choose to.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
The concept of a psychedelic troll with a blunderbuss does have a certain amount of appeal.  :)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Or maybe an Orc Warlock...and the Dwarves get big wolves to ride, and do lots of smithing and engineering...When is this suppossed to ship again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I recently bought warcraft 3 and love it, only played the single player modes but its really great and is similar to eq in a few respects. I think WoW will definitely be something special, just curious if they will be able to hold onto an audience with a different formula than they are used to. Now I just wish the European based Beta will open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I agree that people call for the end of EQ every time something new releases, but I really think that this time they may be on to something.  No, EQ won't die.  I doubt any servers will even close; but I do believe that EQ will see its largest decline thus far in its life.  I think there are a lot of people (myself included) who only play EQ because its the only thing out there worth playing.  When there is a serious competitor, which WoW appears to be, those people will likely leave EQ for good.  How large that population is remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
WoW looks amazing so far...I'm dying to play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">EQ *will* die:<br />
<br />
- GoD sux hardcore, there is simply almost no content for the pre-time guilds. This is a bad move on Sony's side, there was a need for an alternative to PoP painful progression (hi reflagging!)<br />
- everyone is tired of the game mechanics themselves (wanna grind more AA anyone?)<br />
Everquest ceased to be fun with AAs' grinding necessity and the armies you need to gather in order to beat the PoP progression.<br />
- MANY new AND polished games are coming out, it's not just the odd DAoC, Shadowbane, or FFXI. This is a BUNCH of them coming out from now to summer 2005.<br />
Before now, you had an odd and single competitor coming out of the blue as an EQ clone, now you have several games with a concept (Vanguard, DnL) or a greatly improved EQ clone (WoW, Lineage) coming out almost altogether.<br />
<br />
The majority of players remains because of the social aspect of the game, those who actually *enjoy* playing Everquest are a minority.<br />
<br />
Myself i'm only here for a handful of people, the day i quit is getting closer and closer.<br />
<br />
EQ is 5 years old; yeah sure some people will remain, like in UO, but it doens't take hardcore brainstorming to realize that people will leave in droves when wow comes out.<br />
<br />
And when the incomes is reduced, Sony will have to move their asses finish EQ2, and offer a *real* new game.<br />
<br />
I was in *their world* for long enough, now give me a fun game to play, not a timesink/secondary work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Three things have to be done if EQ is to survive:<br />
<br />
1:  close the ridiculous gap between &quot;uber&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; players.  Until they do this, they cannot make an expansion that appeals to everyone, because it will be absolutely impossible to design content in one expansion for both sides and yet make the expansion reasonable in size and content.  This means that SoE will have to either A) upgrade gear attainable by casuals or B)&quot;nerf&quot; uber gear to make it more in-line with casual players, then adjust raid mob difficulty proportionately to take that into account.  Option B would be much harder to accomplish than option A.  However, to prevent a sudden &quot;Monty Haul&quot; syndrome, scale this new gear in such a way that casuals would have to have good gear in the first place to get access to it.  In other words, create a way to progress through gear WITHOUT the flagging nightmares of PoP.<br />
<br />
2:  change the game from monotonous grind to something FUN.  SoE needs to de-emphasize grinding xp/AA and concentrate more on quests that can be completed solo or with groups.  Set it up so you get that XP/AA while DOING the quests.  Duh.<br />
<br />
3:  stop the ridiculous mudflation and restore server economies.  Much as it pains me to say this, but SoE should institute required level restrictions on ANY piece of gear that drops in a level 30+ zone, scaled so the item's rec level is 5 levels below the average mob level of the zone.  In addition, accounts should have a limit on the amount of plat that can exist for any one character, say 400kpp per character and a maximum of 100kpp in the shared bank slot, but allow an exception to this rule for a REGISTERED guild bank mule (as in officially inspected by SoE and flagged to allow it to carry more than the maximum allowed plat in the account).  This will kill a goodly number of duped plat money laundering accounts.  Finally, SoE MUST crack down on IGE and other plat-for-money operations, because they are why our economies are so messed up right now.<br />
<br />
If SoE doesn't do something, the game is going to fade away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Let eq die :) gotta happen someday, im proably going to leave for Wow. at least for sure try, it looks promising... my eq days are ending, maybe wow days start! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Three things have to be done if EQ is to survive:<br />

<br />
This is why I think EQ2 will be at best a mediocre game that will &quot;succeed&quot; as well as SWG- guaranteed they will make the same mistake of giving a big &quot;GFY&quot; to the casual player who doesn't want to raid.  My biggest fear, by far, for WoW is that when they include raid content they will opt for the same stupid design mistakes:<br />
1- need 70+ of your closest &quot;friends&quot; to do anything<br />
2- raids must take 4 hours/night of your life<br />
3- gear gap between raiders and non-raiders is so huge that content has to be split between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; (this creates a design and marketing nightmare- witness GoD)<br />
<br />
They're not making the mistake of mandatory PvP, w/ any luck they'll learn from EQ and not make the mistake of mandatory raiding also.<br />
<br />
WoW cannot come out soon enough regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I love Blizzard games. They have some of the best games in the history of computer gaming. I still bust out Starcraft once in a while. <br />
<br />
I am hopeful that WoW will be a great game, but I am not going to get my hopes up TOO high. The main problem with recent Blizz games is staying power. Diablo 2 is a fantastic game, for about 5 minutes. Then its old old old boring boring boring. I pray WoW doesnt fall into this category as well. <br />
<br />
Iz, you and I have been round and round on the whole casual-vs-hardcore player, but I will agree with you on one thing. SOMEONE needs to design a game where people don't have to rely on huge raids and massive time investment to advance. LDoN is a good attempt at this, but it can be done better. In fact, I wonder if fully implememting an LDoN style of points for EVERYTHING isnt a possible solution. Want to be a tradeskiller? You earn points for upgrades. Want to XP for an hour without worrying about a &quot;mission&quot;? Earn a few points. Etc etc. I dunno, something like that, anyway. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to say that I dont necessarily disagree with everything you say, Iz, thats all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">WoW sounds awesome.  If you haven't seen it yet, look at what they are doing with player deaths.  Very imaginative.  Classes look vibrant, although time will tell how balanced they are.  Currently I heard they were using the rock/paper/scissor approach to balance (to quote an article from gamespy) where one classX will always beat classY, but will always get tooled by classZ.  PvP sounds so amazing that I might even try it out.<br />
<br />
There are issues though.  Without ogres or shadow knights there seems to be a portion of the MMORP player base that will not be entirely happy.  Some of these unhappy people are friends of mine, but I hope they come over because they are great peeps.  Loads of people are also kind dispointed with the less realistic graphics (slightly more anime look), but I figure since luclin, I haven't seen too many women in my place of work or in my neighborhood that look like any pixled woman from EQ ;)  <br />
<br />
All said, for all the positve things I have heard about WoW, the best is how they listen and respond to the playerbase.  I see biweekly updates posted on the forums with specific player questions answered.  I'm seeing guides posted and the NDA is gonzo allowing some fantastic information to come out.  Blizzard seems to have loads of faith in their product and so far, the faith is justified.  they are even working on load balancing on servers and phasing what they are testing.  Now if they can anticipate the load of folks who will be flocking to WoW when it goes live then all will be great.</div></div><hr />

Never tried SWG or Shadowbane but have heard their dogs.<br />

The only way SOE is going to improve EQ is if players leave. If you had a company why would you change the way you were doing things if you had market share?<br />
<br />
And PLEASE don't use the argument that you want to keep your existing customer base happy, things simply don't work that way. Companies do what makes money. Customers vote with their money. <br />
