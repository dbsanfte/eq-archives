<br />
I am having huge problems with the use of terms such as &quot;ghetto mez&quot;, &quot;ghetto kite&quot; and other uses of the word ghetto.  It comes off to mean &quot;poor man's mez&quot; or &quot;poor man's kite&quot; thereby directly equating ghetto to equal poor.  Now, when you envision the &quot;ghetto&quot;, what do you see?  I see black and/or Latino people living in poverty (the media leads us to believe that blacks and/or Latino's are the only  poverty-stricken people in America...yeah right).  <br />
<br />
Like I said, i' dont know if i am being oversensitive or making much ado about nothing but that just doesnt feel right.  It's like saying trailer park mez or something else that could be taken by some as offensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To whit, Beverly Hills could be referred to as a &quot;Golden Ghetto&quot;.  The Hasidic pouplation centers in New York could be defined as a &quot;Jewish Ghetto&quot;.  The Amish rural farming areas in Southern Pa. could be referred to as an &quot;Amish Ghetto&quot;.<br />
<br />
My point about how PC has ruined things has everything to do with the point of this thread.  The word GHETTO should, by definition, NOT immediately be associated with negative connotations.  And even if it should, calling a spade a spade should not be a matter held up for censorship by some nebulous set of rules enforced by any morally bankrupt group of individuals that wants something to whine about.  I don't NEED PC police.  Neither do you.  Let your own conscience be your guide, and if you find something or someone offensive, then DON'T associate with it or them.  It's a free society, and the constitution guarantees free speech.  If some people don't like the manner in which someone else speaks, then DON'T FREAKING LISTEN.<br />
<br />
But don't for one minute assume that PC is somehow harmless.  To me, it is the second worst form of censorship, which is censorship by mob rule.<br />
<br />
Don't be part of the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is used, as you say, to equate to 'poor-man's mez' etc. I've never seen it as a racist term, though maybe a classist term. In the US, ghetto traditionally refers to a poorer, inner-city neighborhood. While there are people of all races living in these neighborhoods, they are predominately black and hispanic. In that sense, ghetto could be seen to refer to minority neighborhoods. <br />
<br />
Don't be part of the mob. <br />
This admonition works both ways. Don't necessarily follow the PC mob, but are you going to follow the anti-PC mob?<br />
<br />
The backlash from the extreme PC movement is not pretty. Many people got so tired of being told what to say in every situation, they've rebelled aginst the idea that thier choice of words has meaning. <br />
<br />
Words bring meaning to life. The wrong words can ruin a person's reputation, even if he's done nothing but good in his life. Words can be as painful as a fist, and can take longer to heal.<br />
<br />
As for the racism concern about using ghetto as an adjective, I've always been proud of my ability, as a Ranger to 'ghetto-mez.' I say the term with pride and honor, not as a derrogatory, so I don't think of it as racist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;ghetto-XXX&quot; is probably politically incorrect <br />
<br />
Determination of &quot;PCness&quot; all depends on careful analysis of the denotation of the word, the connotation of the word, and whether the combination of that denotation+connotation would be deemed offensive to some subgroup of the population.<br />
<br />
Realize many English words have denotations, which are the precise meaning of the word as used by the speaker; and a connotation, which is the associative implication of that word (often an emotional associative implication).  It's the combination of denotative+connotative meaning in English which gives our language such rich poetry, songs and literature.<br />
<br />
The terms &quot;ghetto-mez&quot; and &quot;ghetto-gear&quot; do have connotations and denotations which several prior posters are glossing over.  A modern denotation of the word 'ghetto&quot; refers to a lower-class inner-city region/culture, and its specific connotation in this slang usage is closest to: &quot;inferior&quot;.  Political correctness concerns centers around the combination of denotation+connotation of the word ghetto in this usage; namely does the association of &quot;ghetto&quot; with &quot;inferior&quot; imply that the people living in inner-city area are themselves inferior?<br />
<br />
IMO, the use of &quot;ghetto-XXX&quot; as an noun may be borderline offensive to some people who live in the inner city.  Since anything deemed &quot;offensive&quot; to any subgroup is &quot;politically incorrect&quot;, this phrase is not-PC.<br />
<br />
Don't shoot me as a PC-cop.  I am just explaining the analysis process to determine PCness.</div></div><hr />

While this is not exactly following along with the ghetto term, it still has bearing.<br />
For my example, the *N* word.<br />
The ORIGINAL definition of this word was to mean ignorance.<br />
Not to denote a race or its slang. As stated in one article I read, society has actually changed the definition of a word to its worst, most insulting  definition to the point that most dictionaries no longer  have the  original. This is PC for you and yes, it can destroy.<br />
It even goes so far that, a person of differing ethnic  persuasions MUST be careful with every day words and phrases around  persons of a different  ethnithisty.<br />
Even to the point where  some LAWS are now on the bbooks  where  a phrase is illegal.<br />
Yes, it is illegal to utter the phrase &quot;Oh boy&quot; in Jonesboro Georgia. Using the word boy in the south by a white person is something that must be done carefully. At forty something years old, I have to be very careful how I saay this word in mixed company. Why? Because of  some ignorant peoples use as a derogatory term. Although I call most  males my age and younger boy. With the exception of a Black person.<br />
So you see, Political Correctness  does and has had detrimental effects on society when taken too far. What can be an honest, fond phrase for ones  contemporaries can also be misconstrued into a hateful, insulting, derogatory comment, even when that intention is not there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilucia</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first moved out of my parents' house, my first apartment was a block away from what's commonly referred to as my city's ghetto. Are there a lot of minorities living there? Sure. But there are plenty of every race there. I'm white and I lived right on the outskirts of it in a pretty bad neighborhood. Does the fact that I'm white make that apartment any less ghetto? Of course not.<br />
<br />
My city also has what's often referred to as the &quot;college ghetto&quot;, where college students live in low-rent apartments because, well, they're poor college students. The people there are of ANY race or ethnicity (actually I believe most of the people in the college ghetto are white). I used to live in an apartment in the college ghetto as well. <br />
<br />
So I don't think the term has anything to do with race. If you look at any city's ghetto, there's a pretty big mix of people in it. The term more commonly refers to there being more dilapidated and worn out buildings and low-rent apartments. It's just a less-PC way of saying &quot;lower economy housing&quot;. Using the term in EQ has none of those connotations for me anyway, I just use the term to mean &quot;not as good&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Niggardly, which means &quot;stingy&quot; has a completely different etymology than the &quot;n-word&quot;.  This word is completely unrelated to the &quot;n-word&quot; other than a similarity in pronunciation.<br />

Besides, do any of the PCers really believe that there are no more fat people, skinny people, crazy people, or dumb people?  All the people who used to be fat are what?, like &quot;gravity enhanced&quot; instead or something? No way, they are still fat. Dumb people are now mentally challenged? Why ? Why? Why? To me, the word FAT doesnt mean you are any less of a person, .. but rather just to the contrary you are much much more of a person :P<br />

Ghetto is a long time resident of several languages, dating back to at least the middle ages.  Slang misuse of it does not make it a bad word.  It does give people pause while its fashionable to misuse it thus.  If it bothers you, refuse to use the term.<br />
<br />
Slang comes and goes.  Tup is an Old English word, a piece of slang that meant sexual intercourse.  Gives a whole new meaning to Tupperware once you know that.  Does that mean we should relegate the brand name Tupperware to the politically incorrect closet.  Of course not.  <br />

Do not give other people the opportunity to annoy you with their slang usages unless its truly offensive, like people having cyber in ooc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farmatyr</div><div class="date">05-07-2002, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Northern California, ghetto is commonly used as an adjective meaning both trashy and tasteless. It sort of only applies to people's behaviors and places. So a flourescent pink tube top wouldn't itself be ghetto, but wearing on would be. A bar with tiles falling off the wall in the bathroom would be ghetto. I suppose a lowered 1979 Ford Mustang with custom rims and too much adhesive chrome over the flaking paint would be ghetto. I don't think this is local slang, but I'm not sure if I used to hear it in So Cal.<br />
<br />
In general, behavior and sights and places associated with the ghetto are described as ghetto.<br />
<br />
Yes, it used to mean neighborhood, so people would say the jewish ghetto, the italian ghetto, and so on, because immigrant groups tended to live in the same areas so people knew what you meant. When you were refering to somewhere that wasn't primarily an immigrant area, you'd have to refer to it by it's proper name, rather than saying the whatever ghetto. So the only thing you refered to as a ghetto was an area where poor immigrants lived, so ghetto came to connote a poor neighborhood.<br />
<br />
The perfect term for how ghetto is used in EQ is &quot;mickey mouse&quot;, but I don't know how many people know that one. Fixing your shift linkage with bailing wire would be mickey mousing it. It would also lead to odd looks two years later when you have your car in the shop to replace the driveshaft, but that's another matter...</div></div><hr />

Student Demands 'Niggardly' be Prohibited at University of Wisconsin (02/03/99)<br />
          Student Amelia Rideau is upset that her professor used the 'N-ardly' word at least twice: Once on Jan. 25 during a class on 14th-century English poet Geoffrey Chaucer, and once in a subsequent class to explain the word’s meaning.  Ms. Rideau was outraged, and is demanding the UW implement a speech code which would punish anyone using what she described as 'offensive' language - including the 'N-ardly' word.  She urged the university not to require proof of intent before punishing verbal villains such as her professor.<br />

On Friday, the professor repeated the word and defined it for the class, Rideau said. Angry he revisited the topic after she asked him not to, Rideau began to cry and stormed from the room. On Monday, she brought three black friends with her to the class for support, she said.&quot; (Associated Press, via Star Tribune 02/03/99)<br />

David Howard, head of the Office of Public Advocate, said he used the word 'niggardly' in a Jan. 15 conversation about funding with two employees.<br />
<br />
          &quot; 'I used the word 'niggardly' in reference to my administration of a fund,'  Howard said in a written statement yesterday.  'Although the word, which is defined as miserly, does not have any racial connotations, I realize that staff members present were offended by the word.  I immediately apologized,'  Howard said. ' . . . I would never think of making a racist remark. I regret that the word I did use offended anyone.'<br />
<br />
          &quot;When Howard, who is white, noticed the reaction to his use of the word, he apologized to his three-member staff, which is made up of two blacks and another white. It is unclear which two employees he was addressing when he used the word. <br />
<br />
          &quot;Soon after the remark was uttered, the rumor mill started churning that Howard had used the word 'nigger'.&quot;   (Washington Post, 01/27/99, Page B1, by Yolanda Woodlee)<br />
 + + + + +<br />
BTW, for those interested in the etymology of &quot;niggardly&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;Webster's Tenth Edition defines the word 'niggardly' to &quot;grudgingly mean about spending or granting&quot;.  The Barnhard Dictionary of Etymology traces the origins of 'niggardly' to the 1300's, and to the words 'nig' and 'ignon', meaning &quot;miser&quot; in Middle English.  No where in any of these references is any mention of racial connotations associated with the word 'niggardly'.&quot;<br />

I'm a person.  Not a person that is normally thin-skinned or overly PC.  But just a person with feelings just like everyone else.  <br />
<br />
I am sitting here reading responses to what i started and i have to say I am not surprised by the variances in your responses.  Yes EQ is a game but we all have people that we have have kinships with.  You think that cleric is a she but is really a guy on the other side.  But what do you do?  Tell off-color jokes.  What happens when you think the guy you are playing with is white but is really black and you tell the funny N joke?  <br />
<br />
I simply stated that the use of the word ghetto struck me as odd.  You can use the dictionary all day if you like.  But  the actual everyday definition is something we all know.  Using a word without knowing the definition makes you look really stupid.  Using words without know how it will be taken by those around you is ignorance.    Use of words like ghetto bring certian images to mind.  It's a fact.  It doesnt matter what you mean it to be if each and every person that hears is not on the same page as you.  It's like the very silly debate of the n word that ends in &quot;a&quot; vs the one that ends in &quot;er&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Use of racist and classist words not only separate, they define.  Ghetto brings a picture of poverty and the people that live there as being very poor.  Now, in your image, what do those people look like?  That's what I thought.  Now, someone mentioned &quot;Beverly Hills ghetto&quot;  Real quick imagine the gheeto being in beverly hiils and the people there?  No way in hell you can tell me you got the same picture.<br />
<br />
Being PC is not my concern.  My issue was with bringing yet another ugly piece of real life into the fantasy worlld that is Everquest.  If more people would actually think about the repercussions and affects that their words/actions have on others, then everyplace would be a much better place to be.<br />

Now you see how the pen is mightier than the sword</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Etymology of the word ghetto comes from 17th century Italy where parts of the population (Jews) were forced by political regulation to live in certain (less desirable, generally) parts of the city. The ghettos in Italy were abolished in the late 19th century but the practice continued in parts of Eastern Europe until the end of World War II.<br />
The term was coopted in America to signify the various neighborhoods that certain economic castes were forced (or able, depending on which verbage you like better) to live.<br />
 <br />
The comparison between poor, dilapidated, overcrowded conditions and that which is lower quality, out of context, or substandard is a perfectly reasonable and colorful hyperbole. I don't know much about the term after it was coopted in America, but my best guess would be that the phrase was adopted by the citizens of the ghetto itself and not by its neighbors looking for a negative descriptor.</div></div><hr />

Frankly when playing in this or any other &quot;fantasy world&quot; I'd suspect most would prefer not deal with the &quot;ugly pieces of real life&quot; thank you lol.  Personally it sounds like your digging to far for to little IMO.</div></div><hr />

For what its worth I have always found the term moderately offensive also.<br />

Take this feel good, I don't want to offend anybody, liberal crap somewhere else.  You don't like the term don't use it.  Guess what, you can't please all the people all the time, it's a fact of life you tree hugging liberal pukes can't seem to grasp.  I'll continue to use ghetto as a term.<br />

And as far as the word nigger, lighten up ! Next thing we know they will want to ban books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn for its use. Its just a word and if it upsets someone that much maybe they need to take some desensitivity training.<br />
 <br />
Why is it ok for one person of Afro-American Ethnicity to call another nigger while if a person of European Ethnicity uses it they are a racist? Its all a pile of hoke. Bring on the thought police.</div></div><hr />
