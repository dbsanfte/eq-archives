I need a place to lvl 3 times as a 31 shammy in one night.  I know its possible but where can i do it?  Without Pling i cant think of a place but i thought u guys could help.  Maybe i'll get a cleric from my guild to pl me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mechanical gnomes in Sol A are great xp for your level.  However, I've only ever PL'd there so I don't know how it'd be for you to try soloing.  <br />
<br />
They do assist each other, but they won't start running until around level 38 or 39.<br />
<br />
*edit* You will kill your gnome faction though, but at first you should be able to walk around and check things out (gnome area, not goblin).  You may even stay non-KoS beyond your 3 levels wanted.  This is as a barbarian.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try HHK basements.  The exp is starting to slow down there when you approach the 30's, but you can still get good exp all the way up to 35ish there.  Hmm, but with no PLing 3 levels in one 'night' is kind of a tall order.  Maybe in one DAY, but in like 8 hours you are going to be pushing it.  you might get 2 levels.<br />
<br />
Oh also, if you are an ogre, troll, or iksar shaman getting 3 levels in one night is even harder than a barb, cat or toad because of the exp penaties that you have to deal with.  And if you are looking for someone to PL you, yor best bet is a druid at that level.  Get them to load you up with a DS and cast your level 19ish AE poison dot.  Fastest way to exp that I know of.</div></div><hr />

Try the Yeti Caves in Dreadlands.  They're low-30s (31-33 or so) and are fairly light on hps (maybe 1200 or so).  Pulling singles maybe tough in some cases, but for the most part, the caves are safe from wanderers, the yetis are good xp and you can pull stuff from the main part of DL if want and fight them in peace in the tunnel.  Only issue is they will run on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sakiris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, any more suggestions?  Ur saying in 8 hours i could not lvl 3 times? that seems impossible.  I would say about 2 hours of camping would allow you to lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Two hours of non-stop, buffed+twinked carnage perhaps. My monk, dual-wielding SOD's and with a Fungi Tunic soloing at level 32 against most mobs in SolA took 1.5 hours to level, without any outside buffs. Doesnt get any quicker than that without PL'ing.<br />
<br />
No other suggestions except what has already been said. SolA is great, gotta keep those runners rooted though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took my Beastlord in his mid 30's to the Basiliks in JPF. Was making a level about every hour or so. (Barbarian so no XP penalty)<br />
<br />
Not sure how'd they'd be at 31 with a Shaman. JPF wasn't around when I was that level. Give it a shot though. They're very good XP, plenty around, all spread out and have a very quick respawn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sakiris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive been to JPF, i will get a guildy to come with me and keep me alive if i go.  Lots of higher lvl stuff there and i would have to nuke, not melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did like 26 - 42 on my beastlord in sola mostly killing the gnomes after the goblins greened out.  Really, there is a seriously high exp modifier in there and it's worth it if you can go there.</div></div><hr />
