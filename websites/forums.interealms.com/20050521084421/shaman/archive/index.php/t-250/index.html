<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got to lv30 and went to Halas to train specialization. Dumb me didnt read the chat text before I trained in a skill so I trained in Abjuration before Alteration. But I read on this page that it wasnt until I hit 51 in the skill I would major in an specialization. So I strarted cast alot of Alteration spells to raise to above 51 in spec alt. But I seem to be stuck at 50, am I screwed? Or can you only train to 50 in spec at lv30? Or did they change it so that the first spec you train in gets to be you major? If so, are there a way to change your major spec?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to train at least one in each, then go cast your alteration spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did that, casted alt until I hit 50 in spec alt (havnt casted any other spells but alteration).<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Ohh, you mean I have to have atleast 1 in each of the spec?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You put one skill point in each of the other specializations at the trainer, correct?<br />
<br />
EDIT: LOL, I answered before your edit came through. Haha, yes, that's correct each needs at least one point trained into it at the trainer before any one will go over 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So.. since you have one at 50 already, just put a point into every specialization. Your one at 50 will hit 51 and that will eventually reach 200. Your others will go up to 50.</div></div><hr />
