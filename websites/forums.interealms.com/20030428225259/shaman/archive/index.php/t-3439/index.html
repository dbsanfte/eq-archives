<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curious.. I was in Halls of Testing and couldnt land any spells on the dragon mobs... at 53... <br />
<br />
Then I saw that this raises the casting level by three.. Would this allow my spells to possibly hit the mobs at lower levels? <br />
<br />
Like slow hitting more efficiently? Will this work with 60 level characters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was always told that Mystical Apptitude just reduced fizzle rate.<br />
<br />
You say that it actually increases the effective spell casting level?  Hmmm... that sounds pretty darn good.  Can you tell me where you got that info?  I would love to read a thread on that!<br />
<br />
I hope you're right, too.  That would make this potion MUCH more useful.  I might actually make a few for myself for the boss encounters when I need to slow those lvl 60+ MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DEAR gods yes reply!!<br />
<br />
Now THAT would make this a KICK ASS potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it reduces fizzle rate by raising your effective casting level only as it relates to fizzles.  You fizzle less on a given spell as you gain levels.  I've never heard a clear explanation of this by anyone official, but this is the understanding I have.  I've never heard that it gives you a better chance of landing spells as if you were three levels higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DOH.  I'll test this with an enchanter present and see what happens (they have a similar spell) and parse it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this really sparked my intrest .. <br />
<br />
add 3 levels to myself ?<br />
<br />
then i remebered a guildie taking about his Mag AA skills .. mage fire form .. adds 5 lvls .. so if you stack this potion and the mag AA skill your lvl 68 ... <br />
<br />
not sure what to think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The sad part about this is how damned expensive it would be to do a statistically valid test to determine if the effective level impacted resist levels.<br />
<br />
If this had a (pulling a number out of my butt) 5% increase in Turgur's landing in NToV or other high end content, I'd never go raiding without it.  If this just decreased my fizzle, I couldn't care less.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow.  ok - gonna have to try these out.  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hence me asking about this. It seemed it might have been a possible oversight on the Shaman community of the use of this spell.  Please if anyone finds out, post info. :) Currently broken so cant make the potion to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well - I would have say that this potion would DEFINITELY make it easier for you to land your spells.  Three levels is a significant difference in effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The question remains, tho, is the 3 level increase simply for the fizzle check, or is it for all purposes, including the resist check by the mob?  I can't think of any way to verify this (short of getting a direct answer from VI, which is not likely) other than doing a very long and carefully controlled test.<br />
<br />
So, you need a mob that is tough to land a spell on, that is consistent in level and buffs from spawn to spawn (or is rooted and you can chain cast on?), get some potions, do a run of, say, 1000 casts, recording to a log, then do another 1000 casts without the potions, and HOPE that the results were not a statistical fluke.<br />
<br />
Let's say you have a 10% resist rate normally, you would get ~100 resists without the potion.  If the potion had any effect, you'd get less.  Assuming 1000 is a large enough run to counter the RNGs streakiness.<br />
<br />
So, 2000 casts of Turgur's.  At 9 seconds per cast (3 cast, 6 wait), 250 mana (less specialization, etc.), that's 5 solid hours of non-stop casting.  Obviously, we don't have unlimited mana, so we're looking at probably more like 10 solid hours of non-stop testing.  During this time, we need to keep all variables constant, so keep the same buffs and effects up.<br />
<br />
And while we are doing this, we might as well challenge the charisma and wisdom effects too.  So, make that 4000 casts, and let's get some answers!<br />
<br />
/grin<br />
<br />
Melee fighters have it much easier on parsing.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, snapdragon, but the fact remains that VI made the quote regarding the AA skills, NOT the potion effect.  I haven't seen (not that it doesn't exist) a VI quote saying that the potion is the same as the AA skills.<br />
<br />
Please refute that if you can, it would be great knowledge.  If the only effect of the potion is to reduce fizzles, I personally would not spend the money on the potions.  Fizzles are not really any issue for me normally.<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to try this stuff out some.  But I'm not sure I actually will, it's a huge investment in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, shoot, THAT's where I'd heard it, Snapdragn's most excellent reply to my own question.  Sorry Snap :(  Memory like swiss cheese here....<br />
<br />
While anything is possible knowing Verant, I think it's highly unlikely that they'd put in two spell effects with the same name and similar yet not quite exactly the same actual effects.  It's much more likely that the potion is the same as the spell.  Not certain but we won't have that unless someone runs the aforementioned expensive, complicated, and time-consuming tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How about testing it by dueling someone? I don't think they'd mind being slowed 100 times ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The dueling thing may work, but I'd be curious about the relevance of PC resists vs. mob resists.  Some spells are crippled or modified in PvP.<br />
<br />
But it's not outrageous to think about a run of 100 casts on my 2-boxed warrior.  Hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">54 shaman v 57 monk with items selected to set MR at 100, no buffs on either of us:<br />
<br />
100 casts of Turgur's for each test.<br />
<br />
normal:  31 stuck, 69 resists.  Yuck.  I hate red-conning monks.<br />
with Mystical Aptitude:  52 stuck, 48 resists.  Fair 'nuff.<br />
with MA and Int Advancement:  88 stuck, 12 resists.  Let the pwning begin.<br />
<br />
It would appear that this does more than just fix fizzle rate, there is an indication that it can help counteract resistance based on caster/target level difference.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
PS...  dueled a 60 bard with MR somewhere around &quot;ungodly high&quot; with both MA and IA, and couldn't land a damn thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ok i tested this crap <br />
<br />
theres a few ways to raise &quot;effective casting level&quot; or ECL<br />
<br />
:::wizards get familiars ( lesser adds 2 ECL`s, greater adds 8 ECL`s) <br />
<br />
:::mages get a 3 level fire form AA skill (progersive 1 ,2, and 5 ECL`s) <br />
<br />
:::enchanters have 2 spells &quot;intellectual advancement&quot; that adds 3 ECL`s and then get another spell &quot;intellectual superiority&quot; that adds 6 ECL`s note: these dont stack<br />
<br />
:::shaman can make potions of mystic apptitude that add 3 ECL`s<br />
<br />
<br />
ECL= effective casting level <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 CENO  vs. CITRA<br />
ceno = lvl 60 shm <br />
citra =lvl 60 chanta<br />
<br />
citra's MR was 74<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Round One DING DING <br />
<br />
100 casts of slow  ... 70 resists ...  30 slows landed ...  fizzel2x<br />
<br />
Round Two DING DING <br />
<br />
i had &quot;intelectual supiriority&quot; (this add 6 ECL's)  <br />
<br />
100 casts of slow  ... 70 resists  ... 30 slows landed ...  fizzel0x<br />
<br />
Round Three DING DING <br />
<br />
i had &quot;intelectual advancement&quot; (this add 3 ECL's)  <br />
<br />
100 casts of slow ...  75 resists  ... 25 slows landed ...  fizzel1x<br />
<br />
<br />
if your making any ideas about the fizzel rate keep in mind i have SCM MAXED wich reduces that fizzel rate, mana consumtion yadda yadda ... this also includes fizzels while casting canni &amp; torpor<br />
<br />
<br />
now i could do 20 cast of turgurs ( about that ) with a full bar of mana (kei was on at all times) <br />
so it was 5 full bars of mana per 100 casts<br />
ok so i have SCM to lower mana cost + FT6 + kei <br />
so im getting mana fast<br />
i really hate to see how long this took &quot;shandyorcbane&quot; to compleate<br />
<br />
<br />
so with the results of this test .. i have TWO conclusions<br />
<br />
A) Max casting level is 60 .. so these spells/potions only help a caster under the level 60 .. <br />
<br />
 OR <br />
<br />
B) These thing dont help at all with landing debuffs and shandy orcbane is a JACKASS<br />
<br />
<br />
atm my personal vote is going tward option B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Umm... did you even test the potion?  As I read your writeup, it talks about the chanter spells - but not the potion.<br />

Unless I'm reading your results wrong, your findings are worthless in this discussion.<br />

Furthermore, your verbal harangue of Shandy is unwarranted and unwelcome.<br />
<br />
Now, if I have misread your post, then my apologies.<br />
<br />
Regardless of if I misread it or not, take your pathetic flames somewhere else.  They have no place here in a serious discussion regarding alchemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here ill say it again <br />
<br />
potion adds 3 ECL's<br />
<br />
lvl 12 enchater spell adds 3 ECL's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Time potions lasts... 25 minutes<br />
<br />
With 100MR and casting Turgurs on myself 100 times both cases:<br />
<br />
Resists without Mystical Aptitude:  100<br />
Held without Mystical Aptitude:          0<br />
Fizzles without Mystical Aptitude:      3<br />
<br />
<br />
Resists with Mystical Aptitude:        98<br />
Held with Mystical Aptitude:              2<br />
Fizzles with Mystical Aptitude:          0<br />
<br />
<br />
My conclusions:  Nothing solid as far as Turgurs being resisted. I think Mystical Aptitude definitley helps with fizzles, but no way am I going to pay 120pp for reduced fizzles for 25 minutes. Might be something good for Clerics in specific situations tho.</div></div><hr />

I did this with 100MR to see if the potions had any effect on something with a 'high MR', even though 100MR isn't really all that high by today's standards.<br />
<br />
I will try it again at a lower MR and post it here, but Ceno had already tried something similar with someone who had 74MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Maybe there's significant difference between somebody 54 trying it on a 57 as opposed to a 60 on another 60?  Seems to me that what the spell did was remove the level-difference resistance penalty.<br />
<br />
Before:  Lv 54 shaman v 57 monk w/good resists.<br />
Myst Apt:  Lv &quot;57&quot; shaman v 57 monk.<br />
Myst Apt+IA:  Lv &quot;60&quot; shaman v 57 monk.<br />
<br />
Basically, with the potion I landed spells on the 57 monk as though I were a 57 caster.<br />
<br />
Friend just mentioned these don't stack any longer.  :(  I'm out of funds (spell buying spree in the bazaar, doncha know) can somebody check?<br />
<br />
One thing we're seeing... resists, etc, are HUGELY influenced by the level of the resister him/herself, in addition to the level difference.  Even with both effects (potion and chanter buff) going it doesn't look like I'm going to be landing anything on a lev 60 char any time soon.<br />
<br />
Yes, it took me a good long while, even with a couple folks to back me up and feed me mana in one form or another.  That's why there are only 100 tries on each.<br />
 <br />
I've used the potion while soloing goranga.  With the potion, I'll solo the even and yellow cons (except for the shaman... I hate him) and land spells on them far more reliably.  Without it, I don't land near as many.<br />
<br />
And as for man from Jackass:  Well, I'm furry, brown, and have 4 legs.  I suppose the fact that the legs are short, stubby, and truncate in paws rather than hooves might fool the less than truly observant, but yes, he was right.  Who else than a jackass would spend hours and several K worth of plat testing something, when I could have been off doing another boring xp camp or acquiring those ubah lewtz?<br />

From what I understood these ECL didn't discriminate based on level. The ECL should be applied regardless of level.<br />

I suppose I can try the potion on the next raid we go to. Any suggestions as to which to try? I'm thinking Dagarn might be a good one, he resists alot even with debuffs, but is still slowable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 57 beastie (red to me at 54) will resist me a lot.  Bumping up my ECL with the potion (to 57) seemed to make his resistance checks consider me 57 and not 54.<br />
<br />
Could just be the same Random Number Generator that can still make me fizzle 7 SoW potions in a row laughing at me, though.<br />
<br />
Since I'm still 54, I really have no ideas on where you (at 60) would go to test it out.  Is there someplace where there are critters that con yellow to you?  That may be the best test, since you'll know they're 61 or 62.  Assuming that the ECL doesn't have a level-60 cap (and I have no idea about this) you should essentially be a level 63 caster.<br />
