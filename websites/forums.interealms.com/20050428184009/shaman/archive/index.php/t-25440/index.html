<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some good stuff in there!<br />
<br />
Personally I am trying to tone mine down.  Using Cosmos right now and I think some of the problems (lag and such) are caused by it.  Looking for a good Actionbar supplement, such as FlexBar or BibMod, that has a bottom bar like Cosmos'.  That being the synchronized paging effect.  Multiple ActionBars that page through the various sets when you change which set the ActionBar is on.<br />
<br />
Also want:<br />
moveable things:  bags, bank, mail, casting, tooltips....<br />
Level displayed instead of ??<br />
Map Notes (not sure, hardly use it now)<br />
<br />
That Sell Value mod looks interesting.  That way I can toss the cheaper item if I need space while adventuring.  Hmmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Am I the only one who uses the UI that came with the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Zatriz - I'll be adding in/testing a movable bag mod tonight. Level ?? is already fixed in this remix. Mapnotes are great for when you just happen to run across that mob you know you'll need for XX quest in XX levels. I used it a lot for the Master Hunter quests in STV to mark locations for the elites I knew I was going to have to kill soon. <br />
<br />
FWIW, I tried Cosmos, didn't like it. Bloatware, and yeh....some lag. That's why I started piecing this one together. Most of the stand alones are very small with a specific purpose. CTMod as a base is considerably smaller than even Cosmos Lite. So far I haven't had any lag/stutter issues like I did with Cosmos. If/when I start seeing performance degrade I'll stop adding things, streamline/refine some of the existing mods, or strip some extraneous mods out.<br />
<br />
Faern - yes. Get with the times son! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">QuickLoot - places the loot window under your mouse cursor when you loot a mobs corpse. No more will you have to right click, then move the mouse to the upper left hand corner of the screen to loot. The items are placed right at your mouse tip for quick right click looting.<br />
<br />
<br />
I always wondered how those guys ninja loot every corpse so quickly.  I thought they had some type of auto loot macro setup in Cosmos or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hold down SHIFT when you loot and it autoloots everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I used CT Mod for a while, but when installing WoW on my new machine I tried Cosmos.  There are a few things I like that CT doesnt have:  Quest Minion, Notepad are the two biggies.  CT has some nicer stuff like better sidebars and better buff info.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just looked at your link Val and I might have to give it a go...some really neat stuff there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get it. Is this a rand new md or is it a modifed Ct mod?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Sousltorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I started out with just CTMod, so I give credit (link to their site) to them as the basis for this.<br />
<br />
Over the past few weeks I've found other stand alone mods that I wanted to use as well, so added them to my \AddOns directory. If they worked, great. If not, I tried to fix whatever was causing the conflict/errors. If I could fix, they stayed. If not, they aren't in this remix.<br />
<br />
So, it's a new &quot;remix&quot; of an existing mod package (CTMod) plus several stand alone mods. I took no credit for any of them except for putting the compilation together and fixing conflicts so they *would* work together. <br />
<br />
Zatriz - Sorry bud, no movable bag mod. The BibBagMod is pretty buggy. I may spend some time trying to fix it, but that will have to be next week. I'm busy this weekend trying to raise $$ for my mount. :)<br />
<br />
Snap - I considered adding a notepad to it, but just couldn't really figure out what I'd need it for. Do you use it alot? For what? I find that most of the time I need to jot something down it has at least something to do with a location on the map, which MapNotes handles nicely for me. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Val,<br />
<br />
I use notepad for some of the same stuff I did in EQ, and a bit more.  Probably everything could be kept on random scraps of paper around desk but this is cleaner.<br />
<br />
The cosmos version of Notepad (which may have been created by someone else and then 'borgified') allows you to create x number of notes that you can then tab through (similar concept as the quest window).<br />
<br />
So far I use it for:<br />
<br />
a) Keeping a list of good, non guild people I group with.<br />
<br />
b) all my successful auctions (so I know roughly how much a stack of herbs are worth, for example).  <br />
<br />
c) General notes such as where the Artisan trainer is (in a zone I've never been to).<br />
<br />
d) Most importantly, a list of EQ friends and their new WoW name.  :)  Most of my friends have different EQ/WoW names.  So I get odd tells sometimes and it helps to be able to see who they were/are.<br />
<br />
The notepad is across all characters, so I can enter Auction house info on my low level dwarf and read it later on my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll see if I can frankenstein the version out of Cosmos and make it stand alone. I can't imagine it being too big all by itself, so wouldn't affect the disk/mem requirements of mine too much.<br />
<br />
Lemme see what I can come up with.<br />
<br />
[EDIT]<br />
Ok, I grabbed the NotePad mod from Cosmos and tested it. Seems to work fine, no issues. As the notes say on the page referenced above you'll have to manually map it to a shortcut key using the Keybindings menu, but that's easy enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dangit, Val, you're going to tempt me away from my gypsy, aren't you?  I honestly only switched from the default UI because it was so BIG... and I just can't function on only one hotbar.  It seems so barbaric now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just an FYI<br />
<br />
UI Remix has been updated to CTMod v1.64 Core as base. Lots of new and neat functionality.<br />
<br />
I've also added some new stand alone mods. Details at<br />
<br />
http://www.eldersofamshara.com/ui</div></div><hr />

There is already a notepad add in out, maybe you can incorporate it.  I appologise, but I can't remember the link.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I installed the new version last night my desktop (been using on my laptop for a while) and I noticed that QMinion wasn't part of it any more.I removed it from the latest version of my UI remix. The only functionality I was really using it for was the quest level indicator in the quest log. All other features where turned off. Some guildies found it was causing the game to completely lock up for them (they added the stand alone's one by one and noted it started locking up immediately after putting QM back in the AddOns folder), so as a courtesy to them I just removed it. Since CT now includes the quest level indicator, I saw no reason to keep it in the remix.<br />
<br />
Besides, there's a better mod out there with similar functionality called &quot;[u]MonkeyQuest[/url]&quot;. I haven't used it that much, but it also logs completion date/time, level, reward, exp, etc. You might want to give that a try. You should be able to just copy it into your AddOns folder without any conflicts from any others I've included in the distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My experience with Cosmos (Readers Digest Version)<br />
<br />
1) DL Cosmos<br />
2) Install Cosmos<br />
3) Log into game<br />
4) Fiddle around with Cosmos<br />
5) Experience HORRID frame rate lag.<br />
6) Spend 45 minutes uninstalling and deleting all references to Cosmos.<br />
<br />
One thing was apparently I was constantly communicating with Cosmos or a Cosmos server. Keep getting message: &quot;CPU time expired, biggest culprit MONITOR_REFRESH&quot; or some such nonsense.<br />
<br />
The frame rate was so bad it was as if I was in IF when in actuality I was out in WP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pretty much my experience with Cosmos too Faern. Which was partly my motivation to find a better solution. Ultimately I decided there was no one single UI to do what I wanted, so decided to go with the leanest compilation I could find and simply add on to it when I found a need.<br />
<br />
Cosmos weighs in at a whopping 18+ MEG. Mine? A miniscule 1.08mb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Updated again to add:<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What do you guys (n gals) think about Gypsy?  Although I may try Val's out too.<br />
<br />
I'm a little gun shy after my experiences with (shudder) Cosmos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Only reason I have cosmos anyway is for the extra toolbars, would not mind getting rid of it entirely, letme know if gypsy is cool.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I really like the CT Mode/Telo's addons.  Extra functionality without all the crap from cosmos.  The features I think are critical:<br />
<br />
1.  Auto SelfCast<br />
2.  Extra toolbar on the bottom that goes the length of the screen.<br />
3.  I like Telo's Clock for buffs, I can tell when I need to redo stam and Inner Fire.<br />
4.  I like knowing exactly how many HPs the mobs still has, whether I should nuke one more time, or let SW:P tick a few more times.<br />
<br />
That's all I need.  That, and naked Kate Beckinsale.  That's all I need.  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you are just using cosmos for the extra bars, I strongly recommend changing to CTmod.

No, you are'nt, don't worry. I use the default UI as does everone of my friends. it's very intuitive and doesn't really need to be improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I did make one change.  I now am perma-PVP flagged.  &quot;Ever-PvP&quot;<br />

I use the default UI as does everone of my friends. it's very intuitive and doesn't really need to be improved.I felt that way for a long time myself. A friend of mine kept trying to get me to try Cosmos, which I refused to do (didn't want to get caught up with the nightmarish patch/UI update cycle that my EQ UI became). All it took was for me to try one of the first releases of CTMod and that's all she wrote.<br />
<br />
Having access to 4 additional banks of hotkeys is a real boon to efficiency and effectiveness. EQ had to wait five years and require a buttload of AA's just to get a single extra spell gem. All it takes in WoW is unzipping a few files to your Interface\AddOns directory and you can have up to fourty eight additional hotkeys.<br />
<br />
If you want to play with the default UI, more powah to ya! I don't.<br />
<br />
Shilzah, glad you liked the tunes. I'm hoping to get back into &quot;music mode&quot; soon, but I tend to focus on one hobby for a while, then move to another for a bit. I cycle between 3 or 4, and right now gaming is my primary focus. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I didnt feel the default ui was a problem Til I really needed to start using alot more blessings post 50. I got tired of swapping in what I thought i needed to have to find the one I didnt think of. Thats when i forgot which direction to swap to. <br />
<br />
What i like about this ui is its very easy to just add 1 extra bar if you need it or minmized the others if you want a partial bar on the side. <br />
<br />
One extra bar of 12 and a side bar of 9 and Im loving it. But the options are there to easily go very minimal or hotkeymania. Enjoy the default Ui but wish you had just an extra kotkey or just a couple exta? can minmize an extra hotkey bar. Anywhoo sounding like a commercial enjoying this ui alot is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm with you there. My best case is when I get into a 1 and half focus mode. Least than I'll keep wow somwhat active when music mode kicks in big. But there are alot of times I rotate between them also. Right now I fiddle with my acoustic on the longer griffon rides lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I used to like the custom UI, but I play on a PvP server and it got right out of control having to swap hotkey banks because you get jumped by a bunch of alliance gankers who are feeling lucky.  Now I use flexbar, I have a whopping 54 extra buttons floating on my screen, grouped by totem type, combat (subgrouped by timer), healing, travel, misc, potions (subgrouped by timer) ... I don't know how people function without it.  Now I don't have to flip through 3 rows of bars to find that cure poisen or rarely usefull totem.  I don't have to wonder why 4 of my totem icons look the same (tremor, frost res, nature res, fire res), but do completely different things (I now know what they do without holding my mouse over it by what group it's in and the position relative to other totems of the same type).  I also don't double drop totems anymore, like I used to drop stoneskin and then snare thinking the stone was still up, but because they're grouped, I don't screw up like that anymore.  Now I can put purge RIGHT beside my IGM and warstomp icons for when you get that &quot;I wish I wore diapers today&quot; feeling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you meant 'default', not custom.<br />
<br />
extra hotkeys are wonderful.  Being able to see your bank items in the field is wonderful.  Being able to mouse over an item and see how much it sells for is wonderful.  I really like having a list of quest items on screen as I'm rambling around STV.  <br />
<br />
The best advantage for me is I can put a bank of hotkeys up by the party icons...my various heals and buffs are literally 2cm from the party icons.  Huge timesaver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's great!  But I may be partial, being one of its developers =P<br />
<br />
No worries about it causing problems like Cosmos might, it's an actual UI (User Interface) mod, not a functionality mod.  Makes some windows moveable, adds a few features in the options.  It's still got a few odd quirks you can get into, but for the most part it's stable.<br />
<br />
Hopefully 1.0 will be out eventually, but we're both working a lot and trying to run a guild and level to 60, so time gets spread thin =)</div></div><hr />

When Blizzard removed the ability for people to see levels instead of ?? or 'skull' this little Mod broke...and instead of throwing up an error message and not working it keeps on working...but shows the wrong level.<br />
<br />
Last night in my PvP group we were doing Scarlet Monastery and several times I would attack a lvl 33 or 34 Alliance, only to have my friends tell me he was 42 or higher.  Booty bay was even worse.  Every Alliance player I targetted was showing 33-35 (I'm 32) but were actually anywhere from 30-48.<br />
<br />
Obviously on a PvP server you can get yourself into a LOT of trouble if you think the enemy is 15 lvls lower than they actually are. ;)</div></div><hr />

Ahem that'd be me then, I jumped onto a level 33 warrior with my &quot;death from above&quot; chant, only for me to see my own arse as I missed with cheap shot, and only one Sinister strike hit out of 5. I hardly made a dent in him before he took me out with a few swings :D<br />
