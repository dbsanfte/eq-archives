<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was surfing around today and found out that google.com now has 20 years of Usenet newsgroups archived and searchable (http://groups.google.com) -- so I did a search for Everquest during 1997 and came up with this:<br />
<br />
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=everquest&amp;hl=en&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=4&amp;as_minm=3&amp;as_miny=1997&amp;as_maxd=31&amp;as_maxm=12&amp;as_maxy=1997&amp;selm=34748b43.4781422%40news.swbell.net&amp;rnum=3<br />
<br />
It's a pre-beta FAQ from November 1997.  Kind of cool to see what was planned, what they said would happen and did, or didn't and just the general thoughts at the time.  Actually might be a pretty boring read, but I was already bored and needed something to keep me looking busy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This server will run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, creating a truly<br />
persistent environment. <br />
<br />
No mention of patch day.<br />

.8 What kind of hardware will be required to play EverQuest?<br />
The targeted minimum system requirements for the EverQuest client<br />
program is a<br />
Pentium 166mhz or higher, with a Direct 3D compliant 3D card, and 32<br />
megabytes<br />
of RAM. The program runs under Windows 95 or Windows NT. We recommend<br />
a<br />
3D card at least as fast as the Voodoo 3DFX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1.6 ...EverQuest is a professional and commercial product -- our staff will be on hand 24 hours a day to meet your needs both as a player and as a customer. <br />
<br />
3.7 Will there be some other ways to travel than walking? Horses,<br />
boats or teleport spell?<br />
<br />
Yes to all of the above. (Ssauron: Took em long enough on the Horse part)<br />
<br />
11.8 Can I log off from a fight to survive?<br />
If you log off, your character will still be in the game for a few<br />
minutes. He will defend himself, but I'd say it's certainly not without significant risk. <br />
(significant risk: sheesh - I recall a Frog-King raid once, where a lag spike hit, disconnecting half the group right as the king room repopped - a certain KoE Dorf of some note went NPC and I stayed behind as the casters dove for the portal, to make sure he'd poof safely.  The room repopped and our Dorf-NPC dove into the frogs, laying waste to a good many of them - I dare say he was at least as dangerous on autopilot as under normal battle circumstances.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xouqoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3.6 If I switch servers, will my character keep his levels and<br />
equipment or will I start new? And can I switch back and forth between servers? <br />
<br />
We're still working this out -- off the top of my head, I'd say that lvl and items should transfer over, but certain unique artifacts may not. Also, we probably won't be able<br />
to allow constant switching between servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shoulda read, &quot;Yes but we will charge you $50 and you won't be able to transfer your items cause it might ruin our non-existant game economy!&quot; hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I liked the parts about guilds being able to purchase guild halls for storage, etc and how they would most likely hold special GM quests/events for some of the more active guilds in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">6.8 Can I enchant weapons? <br />
There is one class of magic-user that can enchant weapons, and a<br />
player can choose<br />
that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;&lt;&lt;3.13 Will there be weather in the game?<br />
Yes, you will see rain, fog, wind, and this will affect gameplay (i.e. visibility, slippery surfaces, etc.).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
How do you see wind?<br />
<br />
Where are those slippery surfaces?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;4.11 Can I have a shop or be a blacksmith like in Ultima Online?<br />
Yes.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
The answer should read &quot;Yes, but it will be completely pointless and drain your income.&quot;</div></div><hr />
