<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A Shadow Knight and I stumbled upon a series of quests that is given out in Grimling Forest, and that require you to keep alive Vah Shirs as they are repeatedly attacked by waves of Grimlings. We managed to complete the first three quests for each of us, and now have a map that we are supposed to give to a captain to begin the next phase of the quest. Unfortunately, Allakhazam's has very little information on these quests, and so I'm not sure how difficult the next part of the quest will be. The captain tells you to bring 24 people, all around Level 30-40, so I'm thinking two groups of Level 50+ should be good enough (you still need bodies, as you have to occupy swarms of green casters before they can nuke the cat, and AE seems like a bad idea as it kills the cat as well). Has anybody completed this next phase of the quest series?<br />
<br />
Allakhazam's also lists an item, the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl (range slot, All/All, AC 5, +5 to all attributes, +5 to all resists, +50 HP, +50 mana), as a reward for some stage of the quest, but doesn't specify at what stage it is rewarded. Does anybody know when, if at all, this item is awarded? This item seems really good and is what's keeping us interested in completing the series.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information anybody has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At some point (I believe it's the Captains Quest) you have to attack 2 camps at once...even if you are lvl 60 you can't be in both places at once...so don't skimp on people.<br />
<br />
-----Addl Info------<br />
The Vah Shir have it really nice...after their newbie quest they 'build' a sonic wolf bane weapon using parts from each class...then they have to fight in Hollowshade and they get a upgraded cloak...if they turn in that cloak while doing THIS quest, they get an extra reward - a new cloak:<br />
<br />
Khati Sha Officer's Cloak<br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />
Slot: BACK <br />
AC: 12<br />
STR: +8 DEX: +3 STA: +10 WIS: +8 <br />
AGI: +5 HP: +50 MANA: +50 <br />
WT: 5.0 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: BST <br />
Race: BAR TRL OGR IKS VAH <br />
<br />
A *nice* cloak!  Plus you combine this cloak with the Medallion for an even greater reward (unknown at this time).<br />
<br />
1) A Vah Shir Shaman can do the quest and receive a similar class specific cloak.<br />
<br />
2) the cloaks are wearable by other races, so with enough faction you could theoretically get your Oger Shaman a nice cloak :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">snapdragn, yes, I'd read that we would have to fight in two places at once, and that's why I'd figured we would need two full groups at a minimum. Have you completed this stage of the quests? I'm still not clear on when the Medallion is awarded. Is it after the Captain's Quest (the fourth quest, triggered by the map)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have not completed the quests myself...however, I have become the 'Luclin expert' for my guild, and so I have made it my hobby to know as much as possible about the zones.<br />
<br />
I have a streak of wanderlust in me...I'm always sticking my oger's nose into places it shouldn't be.   Sadly, most of the peeps in my guild (actually most people in EQ) are quite happy with Oasis - LOIO - FM - OT - DL - KC...<br />
<br />
So the more I know about the moon the more I can hopefully make it sound attractive enough to get a group or two of guildies up there with me.  But for now, I haven't had much luck.<br />
<br />
I believe the Captain will reward you with the medal...but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To give you an idea of the difficulty, the last of the war in the forest was described on another forum as &quot;a 10th Ring War on Steroïds&quot;.<br />
<br />
Winning this war you gain a key for the deepest part of Acrylia where is rumored to be no less than 5 ring of fire type spots, designed for very large number of people (like 100...). Oh and: One war is for one key for one person... good luck on these :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, thanks. I didn't have any delusions of being able to do the later quests, as I'll be lucky if I can round up 10-12 people just for the fourth quest. I was just hoping that the Medallion was awarded for the next quest, and not a much later one.</div></div><hr />
