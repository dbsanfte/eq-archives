<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject says it all, where do you go to acquire your 66+ spells by soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This thread wasn't getting any love, so I thought I'd chime in.  I'm sure most of you are aware of this by now, but a great place to get some of your earlier OOW spells are the expeditions in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
You need to talk to the Grand HIstorian who is close to the east zone wall north of the zone-in point.  Simply go up to him and say 'caves' and you will be given an instanced expedition.  Unlike Vxed, this expedition requires three people to start.<br />
<br />
Once you've received the expedition, note the name.  You will either receive one called the watering hole, one called the fire pit, or one called the Murkglider's pit (I think).  The murkglider instance is the one you want.  Once you are in the zone, you will need to traverse the cavern and look for two place-holders: a hideous rat and a tatterwing bat.  The zone itself is very large, but it also follow a very straight forward path, so finding these are very easy.  <br />
<br />
The monsters in the zone consist of rats, bats, and murkgliders.  I was doing this mission the other day and our tank commented, &quot;After 68 levels I'm still fighting rats and bats. =(&quot;  to which I replied, &quot;And you can't even solo these.&quot;  Anyways, the rats and bats are non-KOS but are social and will assist against any combat.  The murkgliders are KOS but undead, so the best way to find the named PH's are to either get a class that can ITU or stock up on potions.  Once you find the first PH (most likely the hideous rat), you can kill spawns to get to the second PH which is roughly two rooms away.  This provides some relief for the boredom that will set in.  Alternatively, you can just wait for the repops to occur as the tunnels between rooms are completely safe.  <br />
<br />
The spawn time is eighteen minutes which is a nice amount of time and should give you a sufficient number of attempts at the re-pop.  Named mobs at this level are pretty easy; they hit for the 500ish range and are completely slowable.  I've heard mention that if a lvl 68 person initiates the expedition that the named are harder and have different loot tables, but I haven't experienced this first hand.  Anyone have any information on this?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope this has helped you all in your spell farming efforts.  Personally, I still have yet to receive one of these spells, but I've seen enough to convince myself that I need to start three-boxing.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kandadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just did firepit last night.  I killed one PH and the named Kyv whatever spawned.  I didn't clear the room.  In the room with the cauldron I went to the hallway opposite from where you come in from the zone in.  There's 1 roamer Dragorn.  Kill him and it's a nice safe spot with only a few pulls to the named.  If you're looking into the room from that hall way you'll see a Dragorn (left), named or PH (center) and a shat-face guy with tail (off screen right).  When you tag the dragorn, the shat-face will come too so here's what I did.  On the dragorn I cast MDecay and VP3.  Then I switched targets to the shat-face and root.  At that point it's a walk in the park.  When those two are dead pull the named and you may get 1 add.  Use the same strat.  The named doesn't summon and he hits for crap.  Named dropped a lesser rune and the shoulders.  I was amazed at how easy this was.  Granted I probably got lucky since I only had 1 PH before the named spawned.  Just for a little perspective I'm 66 with FT 11 and around 4.5k hps and &gt;5k mana.  I was grouped in WoS for a few hours and got nothing, then I go to firepit and get a lesser in under 45 min.  I'll have to keep at it to see if it's consistent but I don't think I'll be grouping for a while...Now I just need to get 67 so I can use this new queer pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kandadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One more thing.  I mapped out Firepit and there are no see invis mobs.  Maybe the 2nd named does but I doubt it.  He's the only mob I haven't seen yet.  Also everything including named are fully slowable until clerics bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do you have the names of the placeholders for the firepit?  I wouldn't mind giving this expedition a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How do you people find PH's without ever seeing the named spawn?  I was just curious if there were certain indicators for spawn points that may be a PH for a named mob, or if you were just told that a particular mob was a PH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy if you check out all the generic mobs names, you find 2 that aren't like the others. They still have generic names but there are only one of each. Like in the murkglider place. You will only see one &quot;a hidious rat&quot; and only one &quot;a tatterwing bat&quot;. Same goes for the other 2 expeditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok :)  That's handy to know!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Go to http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=269\<br />
<br />
That's the beastiary for Dranik's Hollows.  Dranik's Hollows is a consolidation of the three Dranik's expedition zones (Firepit, Wateringhole, Mukglider's).  So all the mobs are mixed together.  To find out what mobs are in which expedition just click on the named mobs and search the forum for the name of the PH.  Also you mapfiend has EQ maps you can download that have the spawn points labeled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ozzyboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">can these zones be triggered solo? or need a grp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhugrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In nobles I found a named who is soloable.<br />
  <br />
an Ukun packleader, he spawns and roams south of the canyon where the murglider schoolleader cave is.<br />
His placeholder is a regular ukun bloodbeast, easy soloable, just root dot, no adds around. Respawntime is 20 minutes or so, not sure.<br />
<br />
Ukun packleader himself summons, hits fast for around 450 + proc, mitigates slow, best get symbol + 9, has not to much hps, fight took me around 4 minutes (without bane). After debuffs disease/poison dots land with little resists, just heal yourself soon enough. He runs at low hp, have root ready.<br />
<br />
Drops some minor items (55hp stuff) and uncommon 66-68 runes.<br />
<br />
Happy camping<br />
<br />
Btw, around the corner is another named spot, but not solo pullable, bring a friend 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do you have a /loc for this Rhugrol? I haven't seen the caves you talk of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Quick head's-up, the tatterwing bat named in the Murkgliders Dranik's Hollow expedition summons, and just like his PH mitigates slows.  I'm not so big on &quot;in teh face&quot; soloing, so I opted to bring in a tank, but I imagine a shaman with good gear and experience in this style of soloing could take him.  He hits for 200-400 per hit, so he outpaces Q.  If you aren't ready for a shaman-tank challenge, I'd recommend avoiding this guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rhugrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">@ Karshak<br />
<br />
Try loc pos 186 neg 753 in NC. Only one roamer there, he is either a placeholder or the ukun packleader, 30 minutes respawtime. <br />
<br />
This camp is boring, you can pull some other mobs for exp, but you'll get adds. Exp isn't good here and named or rune drops are uncommon, but it's a soloable named for runes and thats what this thread is about.<br />
<br />
I usually don't camp here, but if I'm omw to WoS or MPG I check this spot, kill either placeholder or named and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">byside the &quot;an Ukun packleader&quot; i dont think there is any soloable spelldropper in oow.<br />

<br />
<br />
the labaror im  a 65 shaman i know prob not high enough but im going to try and beat down. I know he summons i just would like to know how hard he really hits</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">He can also drop glowing runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Checked Labourer today, he now summons :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">where in ruined city is the labourer ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Trevalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">where in ruined city is the labourer ?<br />
<br />
Laborer hits for around 800 if I remember correctly, but hits fairly fast and mitigates slow to partially. He summons and has two spell effects: a 150 damage/tick dot and a snare, each with a -150 modifer to resist check. This makes it difficult because its difficult to get out of melee range quickly after you get summoned.<br />
<br />
I think soloing this spawn would be very difficult for most shaman.<br />
