<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hanelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I normally try to get in PoP groups if i am going to be on for 2 + hours and do not have to raid (Do not want to waste a groups time). So for those times I am LFG or know I won't be on a long time, any ideas where to go?<br />
<br />
1) Started trying Sanctus Seru (any ideas or camps spots?)<br />
2) Where in Katta can I EXP at 59 and everything is not LB (FYI I am KOS there :) )<br />
3) (No offense) but damn Bards and Druids take the camp spots in PoD that i know of (Rats and Flies any new ones?)<br />
4) have not solo'd Velks yet maybe will try there<br />
<br />

Thanx for any help and suggestions!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not sure, seeing as how i am only ALMOST 50 but, what about guards in the OT outpost...I hear they range from 50-55 some are yellow to me, maybe would be good exp for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velks is easy, if a bit boring, so long as it isn't crowded. I made decent exp there at 59 solo. Beware the random trains but doggie can tank the mobs easily if they're slowed. I made at least a blue an hour there. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Not as exciting as some other camps but it does offer the option to group for some cash items (SCHW, crystal chitin stuff, quest gems) if you get bored soloing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Across from bank in Katta should be pretty well dark blue at your level.  Hell I was there AA'in at 60 and a lot was still dark to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did almost all of level 59 at the firefall zone in Shadeweavers.  The area marked as Unknown Zone in the eqatlas map http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadeweaversthicketmap.html<br />
<br />
The mobs are all dark blue.  They do not see invis, they are non-agro.  Some are casters, some are just melee's.  If the named is up, sinlge pulling him can be tough...  Unless you have some extended range item you will be in agro range of the other mobs when you cast on him, and they will assist.  The named is KOS.<br />
<br />
Loot is non-existant, except for a rare robe off of the named (I sold em for 1-2k aftr giving em away to my friends twinks).  Exp is pretty good solo.<br />
<br />
The casters will try to gate when they get low on health.  The named will also.  The named can summon.  If a caster gates, expect an add. If the named gates.. gate out yourself, or you will be summoned and gang raped by all of his friends.<br />
<br />
The only hard part is getting the named with a full pop.  Once you have the spawn broken up you can kill nonstop with ease.  Spawn times are fast.  I was not able to kill all 4 mobs before they respawned.  I typicaly started at one end, and by the time I got to the 4th mob, the first was respawned.</div></div><hr />
