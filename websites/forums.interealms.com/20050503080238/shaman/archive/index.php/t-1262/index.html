<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While camping seafuries in oot, I happened to turn around and look at the AC island.  Lo and behold, the AC was up.  I asked in /ooc if anyone was on the AC island, no one was.  I killed him and got a ring.  Now I have a jboot MQ to sell, and was wondering how one goes about this.<br />
<br />
1.  Do I get paid in advance?  My friend says it's &quot;standard&quot; to be paid after the person has their jboots.  Of course, he also got cheated out of 2.5 of 5k when he sold his.<br />
<br />
2.  Do I need to provide the shadowed rapier, or the GP?<br />
<br />
3.  Are there any other tips you can offer for making a smooth transaction?  It seems like this kind of thing is ripe for fraud.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally , i would get the money beforehand and the person recieving the boots should supply the rapier and gp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion the person getting the item should pay first. On SolRo at least, people selling MQs of various things almost always require payment in advance.<br />
<br />
And the person getting the boots is responsible for the rapier and the gold, unless you feel like killing shadowmen for a while and prividing the rapier too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Money in advance no ifs ands or buts about it... well i guess unless it is a friend or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The one time I sold a ring for jboots it was money in advance. Unless you or  they specific otherwise the only thing you are providing for the multi is the hard part the ring. If it's a twink i would probably help them get a rapier just so i could make the sale go threw but they need to provide the gp or i just add that to my selling cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get the money up front. It just makes life simpler. If you're doing the MQ for a friend, that's different, but in general, the buyer should be prepared to pay you first. Just my opinion, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Money up front, if you screw it up, refund it all, if they screw it up, tough crap for them.  If there's some bug that you both witness happen, up to you, but generally refund half (you both lost something).  How I've generally done it.</div></div><hr />
