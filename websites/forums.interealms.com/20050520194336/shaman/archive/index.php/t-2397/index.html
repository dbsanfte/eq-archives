There's been roughly 8 billion threads about this very topic. <br />
<br />
Look for them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a bit of a trick question, since the answer is situational.  There are times when WIS is most important (during a big fight when you need to do a mana dump), times when AC is most important (when you're getting a lot of attention and no cleric/torpor is handy), and times when HP are most important (primarily end-game stuff- when clerics/torpor, AC soft caps, Cann5, and high WIS on everything conspire to make HP the next target.)<br />
<br />
By the way, I think you left a few things off the poll that are sometimes more important than any of the three:<br />
<br />
Resists<br />
Regeneration<br />
Mana free damage<br />
<br />
There are times when any of these are more important than any stat.  But to get back to the real point... mmmmm.. cheese! (http://www.butlers-smokehouse.com/enter.html?target=specialty.htm)  (Scroll down to the smoked cheese... I'm eating some of it right now... it's goooood!)</div></div><hr />

In light of the recent caster revamping, I'm reevaluating where resists lie in my lineup.  Unless I'm raid-geared, my resists are poor at best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cheese almost as good as pie.  i think goes  pie &gt; cheese&gt; hp &gt; ac/wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i like pie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What I have noticed is that it depends on your style of play and job on a raid. If your the buffer at a raid then you need Wis +mana and HP. If your out there slowing and debuffing then you need the AC and HP over wis and mana. <br />
<br />
At the same time if your soloing and tanking the mobs you need all of the AC HP you can get. If your in a group and can controll your aggro then your better off with Wis mana gear.<br />
<br />
What I do is I carry 1 pack that just holds opptional gear. If I am getting beat on I put on the ac/hp gear. If I am not then I use the wis/mana hear. My hp's stay pretty stable reguardless of what I change out to. I have 1 hot button page set up for this for quick change. I have the pack on it and the slot that goes to each pieace of gear in the pack. All I have to do is turn to the page open the pack and change out what I need. This also works well for resist gear. Makeing it possable to change out to resists rings, neck, face for a caster. Then back to ac or wis for the next mele mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is quite easy. Get your ac to the softcap. After the softcap, concentrate on HP items. Hint: Many of the endgame type items that people doing major raids will get will frequently have a combination of nice ac, nice HP, nice wis, nice mana, and nice saves. Or at least the three mains for everyday wear. AC, HP, Mana. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, AC at softcap, hp/mana after that since you will likely be at 200+ wis anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It has been said but I agree that this is like saying &quot;what is better ac or resists&quot;  obviously it changes per situation.  I dont know anyone that goes into Cazic with AC gear on now :)  resisting the 540 rains is kinda important.<br />
<br />
*** sorry but side note on cazic.... does anyone even try keeping a friggin pet alive in there any more?  damn dog dies at the first poison rain unless you buff him and then he'll JUST make it through one. ***<br />
<br />
I also agree that you have to get your ac up....then from there you can get your hp up instead.  The way I always thought of the HP/AC/Wis combo was just that if I wasnt alive long enough to cast... what good is all the extra mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh.. I usually dont even bring the dog along if we are fighting the ones that cast that. Bring him out for sewers, blue/green pool tunnel/lower TR but otherwise dont worry bout him at all if fighting alot of casting lizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Where's the HP &gt; Mana(wis) &gt; AC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's a constantly changing situation.  Sticking to just one format for any shaman means your not playing your class to its fullest abilities.  Only time and experience will teach you what works for each scenario.  Oh, btw, Jalepeno &gt; all the rest.<br />
