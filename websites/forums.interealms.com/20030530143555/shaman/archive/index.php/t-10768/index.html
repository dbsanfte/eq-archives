<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also a great idea to do a bazaar search for &quot;Summoned&quot; before you go hunting - magicians can summon a Muzzle of Mardu (30% haste given to pet, stacks with our spell haste), Hand of Ixiblat (50hp weapon, give Fido two) that proc 150dd's - great with HoS, and also Belt of the Magi'Kot, which gives Fido an extra 250hp.  If no Magician traders are selling them in bazaar, see if you can donate for some.  I usually pick up 2-3 sets, in case I have to zone or go LD I'll have extras to give to the next pet I summon.  This stuff makes an amazing difference in Fido's dps and tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

I still get a kick outta AYB jokes and references.  Project Alpha still has some mileage of humor for me. :cool:</div></div><hr />

If the 61 pet procs, those will be sweet.<br />
<br />
Fist of Ixiblat is a level 62 mage spell, btw.  Hook up with FoI, Muzzle of Mardu, and the belt of Magi'Kot and it makes a NOTICEABLE difference in pet effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if this is a serious question, but I'll answer it as one :). You can hand the dog any two one-handed weapons of any type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The difference is noticeable in some cases.  However, you will never increase your pet's output by more than about 25% just by giving him weapons.  Dual wield only makes up about 20% of a melee character's damage, mostly due to the fact that the mainhand swings a lot more often for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
When hunting seafuries for instance, without weapons the seafury would die about ten seconds after plague wore off.  With weapons, it dies a bit before.  Not huge, but enough to make sure I always keep a few rusties in a bag.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried proccing weapons yet, the one time I gave my puppy my gnoll lariat and DH ykesha, I got trained and he died almost immediately.  Give him rusties and he lives forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give your pet two different weapon types, like slashing and crushing and you'll see he does more than just double attack with primary. He doesn't quad often like a mage pet but you'll see his offhand fire quite frequently and sometimes double hit with it.</div></div><hr />

My 55 pet procs with it at least twice every fight with it against Katta guards.  Not sure why your isn't</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question is, is this normal, or was I blessed with a benificial bug after the fall of Grobb. (this all took place right before the frogs took over my neighborhood).  Never noticed Deohgee doin that kind of dmg before.<br />

Hmm, okay, anybody have a possible explanation for this?  Is iamagator's pet just somehow BETTER than mine?  You always get the same level pet now, right?<br />
<br />
I'm not questioning iamagator, if he says they are proccing for him then I'm sure they are... on the other fist, I know I was getting &quot;your pet's will is not sufficient&quot;.<br />
<br />
Iamagator, when did this happen?  I'm talking about several incidents in the past 2-3 weeks.  Maybe it was patched out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I started giving the weaps to my pet over the course of this past week.  I have done this on several occasions and it was procing consistently.  I have not once received the &quot;your will is not sufficient to command this weapon&quot; message.  I see the visual spell effects of the hands of ixiblat procing and get a message something to the effect of &quot;Guard so-and-so's skin is seared by flame&quot;.  I have been giving my pet 2 hands of ixiblat, belt of the magi'kot and a muzzle of mardu.  That combined with my celerity and HoS creates a formidable ally out of my puppy.  He rips through katta guards like nobody's business.<br />
<br />
Not sure why u r not getting similar success from using it but I certainly hope you can get it to work.  You will be quite impressed  :)</div></div><hr />
