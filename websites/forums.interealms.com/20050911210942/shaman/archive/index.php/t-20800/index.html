<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the possiblity of a lvl 65 shaman with mostly full spell book (no Velium strike or Malos) of soloing the camp where this drops in velks?<br />
<br />
If its possible could someone give me a few tips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tough to do because the mobs in that room are SO close together, and there are 5 of them. Plus the dispelling trap in the room outside. If you can get the spawn broken, then it'd be easy, but breaking the spawn woul dbe the hard part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would it be possible with a lvl 65 mage and Shaman Combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went and camped that spot to get my bard twink a lute a few months ago. It was actually pretty easy. The hardest part was actually finding the right room since I had never really been in this zone before.<br />
<br />
There were 5 mobs in the room but 2 of them were light blue so they didn't come on the pull. After camping the area for a couple of hours, it seemed that maybe 1/3 of the mobs would be light blue. <br />
<br />
It might be a little harder if all 5 happen to be dark blue. Just con all 5 and decide if you can tank however many dark blues happen to be in the room. They don't hit that hard really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just use petrifying earth on one of the dark blues when you go for your first pull.  That way you get 1 less mob and a little more control</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did this with my shaman (gear and AAs was a little worse than it is now, but similar - see magelo in sig) and whilst a little challenging its not all that hard.<br />
<br />
The main problem was the dispell trap. This seems to move around, some times it was in the room above kelkar's (where I setup camp) and this made it nearly impossible. Other times it was elsewhere and I could handle it.<br />
<br />
Take a kei + virtue before you go the first time, but be prepared to loose them both. Its entirely doable without so don't worry too much, but its a nice safety buffer whilst you learn it.<br />
<br />
Mobs are moderately resistant, after malos I got some slow resists but only the odd one here and there. Everything is rootable, having VP is a big big plus, spirit call also helps a lot to interrupt casters.<br />
<br />
Take a few sets of mage toys for dogdog, ups dps and casting interrupts a lot. Get tribute points to fill in gaps in focus effects if you have GoD.<br />
<br />
For the 5 mobs in bottom room, pull the mobs to the sides and you won't get all 5, just 2-3. Root one on inc, set pet on one whilst you slow the other. With pet enrage, you can really buy some time to get things under control. Quiessence both dogdog and yourself before the pull just in case.<br />
<br />
Kelkar himself is quite MR resistant, I strongly suggest having disease debuff and slow memmed when you pull him. If you find him there when you arrive, with full spawn in place, I'd get some backup. Yourself and the mage would probably suffice for that, a tank would be a bonus.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the priests casting CH, it can be a real bummer sometimes.</div></div><hr />
