<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I am not twinked, the new &quot;quick&quot; level 1-10 they implemented got me to level 10 with very low defence skill, and I am really feeling it on the AC angle.<br />
<br />
I beleive my defence is about 25 out of a cap of 65.<br />
<br />
So, I am trying to get it to raise, and based on my other chars, I have some assertions I wanted to run by peeps.<br />
<br />
1) Defense skill raises faster on higher cons beating on you<br />
2) Defense raises more often when more than one mob is on you<br />
<br />
Both of these things SEEM to be true, but I have never heard of them being proven true.<br />
<br />
If I am right, grouping a camp with a mix of higher cons and lower cons with pulling 1 or more at a time and tanking, will do more for your defense then fighting solo blues.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
EDIT: One thing tho, is that EQ skills seem to raises faster as they go (up till level 40 at least) so it may start to raise faster and not be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiluvas</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is that you get a &quot;skill increase&quot; check whenever the mob MISSES you.  <br />
<br />
The chance that the &quot;skill increase&quot; goes through is based on your agility.  <br />
<br />
Therefore you want to get an AGI buff if possible, and go find the lowest blue mob you can find, since they will(hopefully) MISS you a lot more than a red/yellow/whatever.  The mob can't be green however, it has to be something that would give you experience, and I'm not sure if the low-blues give skill increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting thinking on the miss. Since Defense is part of Avoidance AC (we think) the to hit/to miss part of the process would be involved.<br />
<br />
However, it seems to be generally accepted with most skills that higher cons seem to raises them faster, ie when you fight reds, alhtough this may be a myth.<br />
<br />
And yes, a light blue would be an xp granting mob, therefore skills would raise, but I find them slow to raise on light blues, but have seen them do so.<br />
<br />
As for the AGI, level 15 baby, should help that alot. VI has stated that AGI does effect defensive skill raises, dodge too, etc, as DEX effects offensive skill raises.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a follow up, I have logging perma-turned on, and every single one of my 30 Defense raises (yes its still only 30) was on a mob miss, not a one on a hit, every single one.<br />
<br />
IN FACT, the message for def raise comes before the miss message a split second, my guess is you are raising the skill during the check, and the raises is applied to the EQ Universe before the miss is.<br />
<br />
So, I am ready to move the Defense raise on miss theory to a Law in my own little world =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalgonar</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have kinda same experience as Crydee does, didn't seem to be as much of the level of the mob as it was of the zone. For example when they raised our defence cap I could tank for hours regular exp mobs and get no skill gains but almost everytime I swam past the seahorses in SG I got a defence skill increase, might be just luck though :).</div></div><hr />
