<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">more awesome feedback. thanks to everyone who has responded, i love that the thread has stayed almost entirely on the subject and has given me a lot to think about. <br />
<br />
went ahead and made myself get spell casting mastery 3 with the aa i had banked, and am now sitting on 1 aa, and thinking i'm probably going to get mc3 + canni5 next and then go on to working on vp3. <br />
<br />
one thing i became curious about...seems to me that on a raid, rather than using /hold for pet, you could just use spirit call to run up dps. the cast timer would basically not matter, and depending on the raid, you may even be able to use the ability multiple times. (lord inquisitor seru comes to mind). any of you use it on the big raid mobs? <br />
<br />
hoping this stays alive for awhile and that people continue to sound off. thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AoW comes to mind as a mob you can use Spirit call on more than once if your dps is low, thats the only one off the top of my head that I can think of.</div></div><hr />
