<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello dare.  I play a level 60 Ogre shaman and I'd like to obtain a JBB, but I'm unsure if it's possible to run around the crypt without agroing the guardians.  I'm interested in soloing Duke Iatol and Herio Grexal.<br />
<br />
Can I evade the guardians and the fight the named skeles in their rooms?  Will the guardians heal the skeles from outside?  Should I attempt to kill the guardians first?  I have epic with pretty good gear (1000 ac 2400 hp's, no torpor).  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 60 you should leave the guardians alone. It's possible, but it is a hassle. <br />
<br />
Here's how you do it.<br />
Invis up and move in in one of the rooms. Don't stop at the door. Move in without hesitating. Kill the PH(or named). After you killed him invis up and move to the next room(that's if you want to clear all 4 spawns). And here's the important point. As long as you stay in the room, the guardians won't assist(won't heal either). <br />
But the named skellies start running, when they get low(PHs don't, just the named ones). If they run and the door opens, you are screwed. If you have a snare proc weapon, keep meleeing till it procs.<br />
<br />
Last advice: Watch snare. Some of the named skeletons are really really mean and sometimes dispel their root/snare and run off, when you thought you had him already.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What kind of invis are we talking about here, regular or IVU?<br />
<br />
I take it that the crypt guardians see this invis but all the other mobs in this area do not?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to evade the crypt guardians for a run to the emporer using this invis?<br />
<br />
Any guidance would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guardians are only ones that wont see you while invis using normal invis. When you run from room to room have to watch to make sure the wandering frog or cube arent in the way. Just open door and look out with invis up if you dont see them run if you do wait till they leave. If they do see you gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IVU (invis vs undead) does not work in the crypt were the majority of mobs are un-dead. makes no sense, but that's the way it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">to bypass the guardain room to go straight for the emp invis is not needed.  if you run straight through the middle of the room the gaurdians will not agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Gal, That was the only room I was worried about :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i think bypassing the guardians by running straight through the middle of the room has to do with your level. i can't see a level 50 running through there with agroing the guardians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can you see a 50shaman trying to solo the crypt either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guardians don't see invis, but the named in 4room and their PH's do.  If you just want to pass 4door to do emp, keep in mind that you have another locked door to get through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaaephod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I wanted to add to this thread about soloing the crypt....<br />
<br />
I have a necro buddy that came with and spent 3 days down there trying for JBB for me, with no luck. I got every single other drop that the Arch Duke gives, except the one I wanted.<br />
<br />
I was in the room, and my necro buddy had to leave, so I thought before he left I would try to see if I could do this solo.<br />
<br />
I am a 59 shaman, and at the time I did not have my epic yet (do now tho :D)<br />
<br />
All I was trying to keep clear was the PH and the Arch duke.<br />
<br />
I learned the hard way, that YES they CAN heal thru the walls, especially if the mob gets too close to the door, I had the PH down to under 1/4 life when root broke and I ran across the room to re root him... bad idea.. he was too close to the door and got a CH from another mob. <br />
<br />
This caused me to be unable to finish off the PH much less ADL if he would have spawned, for lack of mana. (no kei)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just thought I would mention that ...<br />
<br />
JBB is way too expensive to buy, and after all that time in that room, I hardly feel like hanging around in there any more.. maybe someday I'll go back.<br />
<br />
on a side note, I noticed that while I had friends in there and we kept the crypt clear, ADL respawned after every 4th PH... when it was just me and my necro pal, we had a run of over 16 PH's with no ADL spawn..kinda wonder if it didnt have something to do with keeping the other room cleared... oh well.<br />
<br />
