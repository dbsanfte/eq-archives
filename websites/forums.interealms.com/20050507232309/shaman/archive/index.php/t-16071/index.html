<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I have been not playing EQ and feel a strange feeling, likes it's some type of job or something, but this has happened before, it's when I'm burned out.  I have had this problem before (Temporary vacation for 2 weeks) and instead of just letting a week or so go off without logging on I was wondering if other people have had this happen, and if it has what can you do? For me Leveling has just gotten to me, I usually dont have the patience to solo in certain spots, and don't really like tradeskills.  The current guild I'm in also raid's maybe once a week, and its usually an epic raid, (Chardok, occasionally kedge, and whatever other epic mob someone requests) I enjoy questing, but enjoy raiding alot, but im too low to Apply, and I've been having trouble sitting down and sticking in a group and not getting restless by the exp bar not moving as much as i wish it would.  So if you have a serious way to get by a burnout please respond, thanks :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">easiest thing to do is just not log in.  do other things you like to do, or just do nothing and hang out with your friends or something ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I break out a book and bust into console RPGs.  I need to sit down and beat Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic here soon (great game) and after that I will start working on a new game I just got... F-Zero: DX.  Great little racing game.  It keeps me entertained.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just dont play for awhile. this happens to me every once in awhile. then someone just *needs* me for a raid or something and then I fall back into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea it happens. Here's some of my suggestions-<br />
<br />
// in game things to do<br />
-good music when playing. Spinning some of my favorite DJs is a lot of fun when gamin.<br />
-grinding solo in one spot can get boring, break out and explore the world<br />
-farm<br />
-duel<br />
-raid<br />
-dungeon crawl<br />
-gear upgrades (working toward saving up or doing whatever to get that next piece of gear)<br />
-solo trophies (try some toughies on for size, or crawling as deep as you can in a old world dungeon)<br />
<br />
// not in the game<br />
-console classics (nothing like a quick refresher on why you like eq so much then playing some FFx or other console RPG. I still enjoy Shadowrun on the genesis)<br />
-read class message boards<br />
-muck around at allakhazam, post stuff<br />
-anything else you do in RL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buff noobs<br />
<br />
Find someone sub lvl 5, inspect their gear - see if their a real noob<br />
<br />
Babysit them for a while, buffs, heals etc...<br />
<br />
Give them 20 plat - here them go WOW!<br />
<br />
Talk to them explin some things about the game.<br />
<br />
It always amazes me just how grateful someone new to the game is. And for me its just a blast helping someone out.<br />
<br />
I mean do you remember the first time you played EQ? Having someone high lvl help me out would have blown my socks off.</div></div><hr />

I tend to do this about once a month.  I don't plan on doing it, but if I am going to Freeport for some reason or another, I just tend to stop what I was doing to help and watch.  It is really strange to see a level one or two newb being killed by a rat or skeleton.  So, I help them out.<br />
<br />
I also tend to jump around between tasks.  I might get the urge to quest a new item and only do about 45% of the quest and then jump to something else.  It helps me from catching the &quot;ireallyhategrinding&quot; syndrome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loioshh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am kinda in that phase now, <br />
<br />
I have a 65 monk and my shaman just got 65, raiding elementals over and over is uhm... tedious.<br />
<br />
So off I went to kael today, broke into arena to kill some legos and vets to see if I could get some armor for my friends shadowknight, well, I didnt get any armor, but I got a tell from a level 56(?) ranger who was trying to get a head for his helm of the tracker quest, so I invited him to come up, had to clear back spawns for a bit, but once he was there, we mashed out 2 poz's and Kallis Stormcaller or whatever his name was in 1 pull w/out my shaman dropping below 60% mana, he got all 3 heads he needed in one pull, and was so happy he didnt stop w/ the emotes for a good 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Its the small things that remind ya why you spent all that time grinding / gearing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are tired of EQ, I got one word for ya ... XENOGEARS!  :D  If you have a PSX or PS2, rent or buy this game.   It has hands down the most intense and spectacular storyline of any game I have ever played (I collect and have beaten ALL of the Final Fantasy series, Suikoden series, and many more).  If you like sci-fi and/or fantasy, Xenogears will defenately be your metaphoric cup-o-tea.  I know the game from front to back and speeding through it I still spend 80+ hours going through it.<br />
<br />
P.S. Please excuse any spelling errors you may find as I do not have a spell checker yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Console games and a good book will give you some time to chill from EQ. If you've got 3 or 4 good friends that you can get over to the house even breaking out some old board games is fun. I have a regular group that come over and we play Clue, Outburst, Scatergories and Pictionary when we want a night away from EQ.<br />
<br />
Shadowrun from Genesis is one of my all-time fav games, its only reason I still have my Genesis.</div></div><hr />
