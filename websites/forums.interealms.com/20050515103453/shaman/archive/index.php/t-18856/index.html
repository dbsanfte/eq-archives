<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a thread on the PON board disucssing the need to improve the touch of nife spell.  The attempt was made to justify this by comparing various heals of paladin vs the priest classes.<br />
<br />
TON currently heals 1125 hp for 450 mana.  The best direct shaman heal is tnargs which is 1300 hp for 450 mana.<br />

That would be our incomplete heal.  10 seconds, unaffected by focus effects.  It is generally inferior to tnargs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best quote in this thread to show how stupid some people are on the issue:<br />
<br />
paladins need... <br />
1.) a fast healing spell... fast ( 1.0 cast ) spells that do GOOD healing (1500-2200 ) at a high mana cost (600-800), with a moderate reset time ( 5-15 sec)<br />
<br />
2.) a very slow large heal... slow (10.0 cast) thats heals a lot (2500-3000) at a low mana cost (400-600) with no reset time.<br />
<br />
3.) A new Group heal ... fast (2.5) good healing (1500) at high cost (1000-1200) with low reset (10 sec)<br />
<br />
I'm not going to waste my time looking at more of the paladin whine thread about how they get shafted in healing.  I doubt that many really think this, and the vocal minority sure make themselves seem like horribly inept healers, but I don't see that as being very true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sure just give us their group heal and call it even</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wave of Marr is one of the best spells in the game, and more than makes up for any &quot;shortcomings&quot; in their direct healing department.  Seriously, how well do they want to heal?  In a normal mode adventure, if all mobs are brought in to camp already slowed, a paladin is more than enough healing.  I did 7 adventures yesterday with a paladin (best paladin on server and 627aa, so I guess this might be a little out of the ordinary), and I was pulling on every mission.  I'd bring about 5 mobs in at a time (no ench), usually all slowed except maybe 1 or 2, and I rarely had to heal anyone.  The paladin easily grabbed aggro from all of them and was just such a beast of a tank that he barely took any damage.  The mobs running around unmezzed caused a little bit of damage to the other group members, but one wave per pull handled that.  If I screwed up the pull, he hit me with a touch of nife to keep me alive and draw aggro off of me.  I was in awe, really.  If paladins get any more healing upgrades, they're going to be clerics.  I already feel that paladin + ench/beast/bard is a viable basis for a group, and no priest would be required.</div></div><hr />

Situationally paladins are either 3rd or 4th best healers, as are shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you're in potime all experiences out of potime IMO need to be thrown out the window the game isn't designed around 11k paladins with 40% mana save on spells insane weapons insane AC and I'm sure you have insane gear too :) (magelo down on school comps).. <br />
<br />
overall my opinion is that I love the game the way it is atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't go so far as to say it isn't valid.  It isn't the norm, but there is still a sizeable chunk of the community the groups with people this good or almost this good on a regular basis.  I know the majority of people are not in a potime guild, but you still have to consider those that are whenever you suggest any sort of improvement.</div></div><hr />

I did a few adventures with one of the bards in my guild and he said that he's done lots of adventures without priests, even with mediocre paladins.  He pulled groups with the bard slow song and played a hp regen song that was as nearly as good as replenishment.  He told me I didn't need to slow in the group, just spot heal and keep regen on everyone.  He was pretty much right, although we did hit one hitch once on a pull to a crossroads that generated a lot of adds.</div></div><hr />

I kinda agree. Give us 90% rez and they can have all the power of a senior GM to add with their present abilities. That way they can be a priest, hybrid, caster, pure melee, and pet class all at once. Then they can solo Quarm and win the game and never have to rely on anyone else for anything. Then they can stop playing a MMORPG and play Legend of Zelda with a game genie.</div></div><hr />

The paladins have overtaken necros in my book as the most unreasonable class of whiners.  <br />
<br />
They have a groovy thread with preemptive whining.  <br />
<br />
Of course, all class boards have whine threads about GoD AA, and this one is certainly no exception.  Everyone thinks they suck and SOE doesn't care about Class XX.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's so 100% true and I thank my luck every day that I somehow ended up a shaman, where the whining is little and far between.  I don't care if it HAS resulted in a lessening of shaman power relative to other classes.  I don't have to get pissed off beyond all reason every time I check my class board.  That's worth more to me than the ability to move pixels around more effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My favorite part of that thread was when a paladin said our pet was as good as a beastlord pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put simply: every class has people who want outrageous things. I read about 6 class boards and chuckle at all of them when I see it. It may even be more amusing when one class thinks they have a &quot;more reasonable and helpful set of people playing the class&quot; - if you haven't noticed, every class thinks this. ;)<br />
<br />
I could point to threads I've seen here with shaman complaining that they can't tank anything more than &quot;PoV trash mobs&quot; or want double attack, etc. etc. I can point to rangers who would have archery nerfed to gain tanking ability, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whiners&quot; are the easiest people to notice. People don't post very often to say &quot;Thank goodness our class is in such good shape!&quot; That's just not the nature of message boards (or real life - newspapers don't have many stories pointing out that &quot;hey, no one in town was murdered today!&quot;).<br />
<br />
There are exceedingly few paladins who think our healing is somehow in bad shape - at least exceedingly few post if they do think that. Most think our heals fill a niche - emergency heals with fast cast times that are made up for with lower effeciency and/or longer recast time. Our lack of specialization and generally low mana regeneration &amp; healing focus effects (unless you are one of the minority who are uber) guarantee that we aren't going to be very good healers. (Sure, a paladin in plane of time will probably heal better than a shaman who isn't in a raiding guild - just like a shaman in plane of time will probably tank better than I do :)).<br />
<br />
Most of the members of PoN (who post, of course) are happy with where we are now - but like every other class I've seen are VERY unhappy with the AA's and spells being introduced in GoD. Incredibly expensive abilities for very little effect. When you read a lot of class boards, you start to recognize the &quot;sameness&quot; - every board has some really reasonable, helpful people; some people who are very scientifically minded; some people who would be happy no matter what SOE feeds them; some people who are chicken littles and will claim the sky is falling at the slightest provocation; etc.<br />
<br />
It's actually funny to read a bit and start to see, &quot;hey, he's basically our bob. She's basically our mary. Huh, he's going to get banned from here just like we banned George.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have close to 12,000 people registered for PoN. To claim that there is some common &quot;type&quot; of person who posts on a large message board is just stereotyping based on a few people.</div></div><hr />

Since I 2box a paladin/shaman combo, I read both boards daily.  Everything Romidar says is true, most of the PON posts are very helpful.<br />
<br />
I didn't intend this thread to be a look at this freak type event, I was actually wondering if my thoughts were off in left field (from a shaman perspective.  Since I was representing my view on PON as a shaman type view.<br />
<br />
If I got to make the call on the perfect solution, it would be to give our incomplete heal to paladins.  It would be exactly what they're asking for, and as soon as they had it they would realize exactly why most shaman don't use it.<br />

My wife actually 2-boxes a shaman (which is primarily why I frequent these boards) and I know she doesn't use her iCH. My druid uses his all the time, of course and I know I as a paladin would never cast it. I never use Touch of Nife, for that matter - I don't have time to stand around for the 5 seconds to cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">About the only thing keeping Paladins from healing just as well as us in most situations is the fact that they don't generally wear gear that gives them lots of wisdom and FT.  If they dressed like clerics, they would do just fine healing.</div></div><hr />
