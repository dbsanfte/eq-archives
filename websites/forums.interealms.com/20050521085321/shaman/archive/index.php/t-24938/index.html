<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so im not a top level Shamana yet, but i want to get there.<br />
<br />
Ive got some issues with my lvl 49 pet spell???<br />
<br />
I am the only player who picked up the pet spell for the lame pet?<br />
When using pet i very rarely see my pet hit. I get a constant spam of misses, and am wondering is it something i am doing?<br />
I have my pet equipped as best i can, hes buffed as high as possible, and yet he still misses!!!<br />
<br />
This is a regular occurance and i am wondering is it really worth having the pet up at all?<br />
<br />
Oh just a little note, i have been told the closer i stand to my pet the more frequent the hits? is that right or am i that noobie i am falling for some joke?<br />
<br />
I know the pet isnt a tank no matter how you look at it, but surely hes there to help in a tight situation?  Needless to say i DONT depend on he pet for anything...<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer my any ideas as to what to do, or point me in the right direction???<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for listening....</div></div><hr />

<br />
where and what are you fighting that he seems so lame<br />
<br />
the closer standing thing sounds unlikely ( ive never noticed any such thing)<br />
<br />
there is a reason he is often nicknamed speedbump though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in Griegs end last night for instance,<br />
Doing the usual, slows, nukes etc,<br />
I sent my pet in, and in a full group the mobs were dropping, but my pet just seemed to miss everything....<br />
<br />
Im just a frustrated shammy....<br />
<br />
There was a BST in with us, and his pet???<br />
&quot;My pet hits tough and can solo, yours is just a gimp&quot; LOL That remark just didnt help at all.......and not experienced with the game enough for a snappy comeback :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I might be wrong, but I think that at some point the range where you saw the pet miss messages was greater than the range where you saw the pet hit messages for some reason. Meaning if you stood next to the pet you saw both hit and miss messages, if you backed up a bit you could only see the miss messages, and if you backed up a bit more you could not see any of the pet messages. Not 100% sure on this, but if that is indeed the case that may have been what the advice meant. In any case there should not be any difference in pet accuracy whether you are next to it or not (as far as I know at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The miss messages do have a greater range to show up. Therefore it is very easy to end up only seeing miss messages. Also check that you have set the pet hit messages to the chat box you are using. Also remember that our pets are quite a few levels below beastie pets and level helps alot when trying to hit things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest turning off your pet's misses...it will make you feel better.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Silly question.....are my pet hits on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">not to mention mobs in luclin have a generally higher AC and melee do less damage as a whole in that expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with the two posters above, turn off your pet misses and it'll make you feel a lot better.<br />
<br />
When you get your level 61 it gets better, but all the pets before that are a bit lacking.  One thing you can try is casting cripple, it lowers AC which should help your pet hit more and hit closer to max more.  Also make sure your pet has two weapons to dual wield and try to keep IoS+Str+Haste up on the pet.<br />
<br />
But, all in all, get some levels under your belt and enjoy your level 61 pet when you get it.  It's not perfect, but a lot better then it's predicessors  : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah the 61 speedbump is an improvement, he enrages at low health (well he does on those rare occasions when he doesnt get outright ganked) an that buys extra time for heals or whatever.<br />
in a place like GE you could use dog dog as a fairly effective tank as long as you perma torpor him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My shaman is using the 49 pet now.  I'm not having this problem.  Of course, I'm usually in a duo and being &quot;the tank&quot; so I'm always very close to my pet (I arrange it so pet is behind mob).  I turned off pet misses so I actually notice when the pet hits and he hits quite often. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried him in Griegs but he hits fine in Dulak and Torg Mines (the last couple of places I've played).</div></div><hr />

I hunt in Velks Lab, sometimes in group and sometimes solo..I also have noticed that Fido misses less when I stand or sit closer to him while he is tanking. when I sic him on a spider from a ways out, I tend to see more misses and less hit messages..as I move in closer to him, the misses are replaced with more and more hits..I usually equip pup with mage toys,(mask of Mardu and Hands of Ixablat). When I am a distance away, I not only see more miss messages, but less Proc effects from the Hand toys..as I move closer, I see the hits more as well as the proc effects hitting oftener..just my observation.8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just turn off misses AND hits.  Nothing to see any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd leave at least hits on so you can make sure he's on the right mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All melee off except me hitting a mob and a mob hitting me. Everything else is distraction. Well, me hitting the mob is distraction, too, but it's nice to see hits for triple digits with the Catstick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. If you stand closer, you have a greater chance to see the hit messages. The farther away you stand the greater chance you will not see the hit messages.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it appears the range to view &quot;miss&quot; messages it greater, ie, you can be standing in a position where you can view miss messages without seeing hit messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't see it mentioned and just want to be sure.<br />
<br />
Do not forget to give your pet weapons. By default he does not dual wield so giving him two 1h weapons ALMOST doubles his performance!</div></div><hr />

Thanks Gloriana..that is good to know..sometimes when I sit too close, I tend to take more damage than I care to..will distance myself more, now that I know this 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have my pet messages go to their own chat window.  It's only 5 lines high, see-through, at the top of my screen.  It's mostly so I can tell which mob he is on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">HoTT is your friend. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This is even more convenient than hott.  I don't have to target my pet to find out who he's on.  I could always just assist him to find out.  It's more convenient to just be able to glance and see without losing my current target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To each his/her own I guess.  To me it is easier just to hit F1 a couple of times instead of the spam also the target rings from my UI are great for showing what is going down.   I also have all melee turned off as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>shezam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for all the advice, all taken and absorbed.<br />
<br />
I turned off everything apart from pet hits.<br />
Hes quite a toughie in his own little playful way  :p <br />
<br />
I know he will never be a tank, but ahh he will always be my friend  :) <br />
<br />
I love this forum, the first place i go to for advice, and never let down.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i went to  BOT at Deep south and i wanted to try my pet there (lv 67 one) i am lv 70.<br />
<br />
my pet was fully buffed (my self buff) and i pulled a mob there with malos,then i slowed and crippled him,and i rooted him.<br />
<br />
i sent my pet on him,and i only casted quiescence on him,and after all the duration of Q  (about 42 sec) he was still at 90% hp hehe.<br />
i was out of melee range of the mob so he didn t attacked me.<br />
was pet vs mob hehe...................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">How did that work out for you? How long did dogdog take to take down the mob? What was your mana at once the mob was down?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually the pet doesn't hit bad at all.<br />
<br />
For comparison, turn your hits/misses on as well and go &quot;in teh face&quot;; pupper is likely doing far better than you can or will :)</div></div><hr />
