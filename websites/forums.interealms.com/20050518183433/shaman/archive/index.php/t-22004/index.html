<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mirribelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all - this is my first time posting...but I have been lurking around for a little bit.  A bit of my background: Level 65 Shaman attempting to do planar progression with a medium, raid-once-a-week guild, play time is evenings and weekends ('cause yes, I must work to support the habit).  As for gear, I have 1 VT item and a few GoD items everything else is hand-me-downs or purchased.<br />
<br />
My personal problem with most of the proprosed improvements that I see being suggested are the AA quality or OoW additions.  I am not an uber, raid-perpetually player nor can I be.  I have a total of 72 AAs currently and I still feel gimp.  I don't want to be required, because I play this game for enjoyment, to purchase the new expansion or gather a raid force to get to a point to where I am a useful class in this game again.<br />
<br />
Can somebody explain to me why we should only heal better/have a better pet/be useful and fun to play because we've bought another 5 levels of another 15 AAs?  why should I have to buy another expansion for the random chance that I might get a spell that somebody actually wants me to cast?   <br />
<br />
Sorry for my long-windedness, I suppose what I am trying to get at is, can we please request that shamans be made a fun, enjoyable, possible, feasible class to play from the beginning upwards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Generally speaking most shaman feel that we are pretty balanced in early PoP. Stat buffs still matter, slow mitigation is not too bad, fights have a decent duration, MOB DPS is not all that high yet.<br />
<br />
We have issues but they are not nearly as bad as they are in GoD.<br />
<br />
Thus it only makes sense to focus on high-end balance, then see what amount of trickle-down improvement is reasnoable. Note that Quiescene has been increased to heal more HPs/tick already, which is the kind of thing I would expect to happen if we do manage to make any changes to priest balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will take a stab at this.  Increasing power has always been about gaining levels (and aa's), adding equipment and spells.  That is EQ.  Now that being said, there are many ways of enjoying ones self in EQ without being the biggest and baddest shammy on the server.<br />
<br />
My biggest &quot;beef&quot; (and I am in a raiding guild myself) is that the casual player has not historically had access to good equipment or our class defining spells.  The torpor and malo fiasco of a few years ago due to a coding mistake (where they were not available at least on Quellious at ANY price) still irritates the heck out of me. It's one thing not to have the best single target heal, or nuke, or dot...but when your gameplay is COMPLETELY different that is a problem.<br />
<br />
Pumping up equipment in LDON is an excellent start to remedy things as is the proposed solo instanced LDON.<br />
<br />
But, I do feel that spells are a problem. I am in an elemental guild (not time) and I have a heck of a time finding peeps who want to do GOD expeditions so I can get spells.  I can just imagine that the casual player has about 0% of getting ANY no-drop GOD spells, and I think that is unfair and contrary to the best interests of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mirribelle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the responses so far.  <br />
<br />
I guess I really don't feel that shamans are completely fine up to 65 and only broken at higher Planes/GoD content.  <br />
<br />
I can expand a bit more on my concerns.  Personally, I have been turned down for LDoN's because a beastlord became available...I'm talking getting a tell, agreeing to come, then receiving another tell that scratch that, we don't need you any more, got a beasty coming.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I've tried soloing but to do so without dying, I have to do so in the old world which doesn't seem to offer much in the way of xp progression or even money making.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm bored off my bear buns when raiding.  I was the sixth or seventh shaman to the guild...they had all their buffing/debuffing cycles figured out. I get to rarely cast anything but a spot thing here or there.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've been accused of causing a death because I had to take the time to Malos before a slow would stick to a mob.<br />
<br />
I guess I feel like I've made an investment in this game and I would like to continue playing for fun but I'm not happy with the idea that only uber-level people are going to get help and that I have to see what trickles down to me.  I want to be a contributing factor to the game at the point I am now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are being harassed because you are Malx before Slow then you need new friends.<br />
<br />
A bounced Slow can *easily* wipe a group.<br />
<br />
Here's a hypothetical:<br />
<br />
Mob inc.  Cast Turgurs . . . *bounce*<br />
<br />
Aggro has now been pulled from the MT, crap.  Shaman is killed before aggro can be reclaimed.<br />
<br />
Now the mob isnt going to be Slowed . . . at all.<br />
<br />
If your MT is getting wiped in 10 seconds either the Cleric isn't doing his job or you are all in over your heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi Mirrabelle, we all feel your pain about being turned down for this group or that group.  That's the nature of differing content and people's perception of the &quot;perfect group&quot;.<br />
<br />
I really wouldn't worry about those groups who zap you for a beastlord in LDON, they are probably waiting for a elemental tank and cleric and are sitting around on their backsides for 30 min.  Just grab another group and hit it. Making friends and playing well will get you more groups than anything else, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are feeling gimped and if that bothers you then get more AA's and try to get better equipment (focus items).  Now that may sound like a bit of the obvious but the shaman power curve does not flatten out until you hit about 300 aa's and have at least have the lowest level focus items.<br />
<br />

PS: and there are always &quot;backseat drivers&quot; telling you what to do and what not to do.  A thick skin will serve you well in Everquest.</div></div><hr />

I apologize for my bluntness, but where exactly do you not feel useful? By your own admission, you are a casual player who isnt interested in being on the cutting edge. Sorry, but if you WANT to be &quot;all you can be&quot; you buy the expansions and you grind the AA. There are TONS and TONS of places a Shaman can play for &quot;enjoyment&quot; and at 65 with fair gear and all your spells and 70aa be VERY effective. Very very very effective. <br />
I can expand a bit more on my concerns.  Personally, I have been turned down for LDoN's because a beastlord became available...I'm talking getting a tell, agreeing to come, then receiving another tell that scratch that, we don't need you any more, got a beasty coming.<br />
This kind of thing is going to happen, but honestly, as trivial as LDoN Normal is, and with the new upgrades, you can EASILY be the sole healer and slower. And add some DPS and crowd control. Lets see Beastys do all that. <br />
<br />
Personally, I feel that with the new changes I will now be able to be FAR more efficient in LDoN Hard, efficient enough to be sole healer in that format. Sole healer in EP xp groups is now highly doable as well. almost without casting a single Tnargs, I bet. No AAs that I know of affect our HoTs as far increased healing, so no worries about getting all the AAs right away. <br />

The increases to Quies and Blessing of Replenishment are MASSIVE upgrades for every single 65 shaman in the game, raider, non-raider, casual, hardcore. I don't quite see how you feel that the other stuff that we are asking for will help Uber-level more than you, but even if it did, the fact remains, Uber level people doing current end-game content NEED more of an upgrade than the average mid-PoP shaman. Period. Again, I apologize for my bluntness, but I get weary of seeing this same arguement presented in thread after thread. But the bottom line remains the same:<br />
<br />
As is, Shaman are VERY powerful in LDoN Normal, mid-PoP XP groups, farming for any reason (plat, items, tradeskills), and soloing. If Clerics have ONE arguement that I actually support, its that Shaman take their spots in LDoN normal and BoT groups. Because we do. Because we can, even in Bazaar gear with 50 aa. <br />
<br />
You are a group in LDoN, BoT, or Tactics. Just add the other elements you need yourself. Find a tank. Find some DPS. Start pulling. Clerics have the same point with regard to us and this content that we do with regard to the advanced Gates content and the ability to Slow. Why would someone take a cleric into LDoN normal if a Shaman was available, ever? Or a BL for that matter, since there are TONS of DPS classes out there. <br />
<br />
Be the ball. Seriously.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree with what Blazz says with regards to LDoN normals and less than cutting edge content.<br />
<br />
I do LDoN normals *often* with just me, a SK and a Pally.  Yep.  Just 3 of us.  Cake.  Ruj is a GREAT place for that kind of thing, but it can be done in BB as well, and Tak to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
I have a whopping 29 AA's, no Q, no Fo7.  Neither the Pally or the SK are more than bazaar geared . . . I do have 3 pieces of the LOWEST version of LDoN chain armor.  Basically I am not even in the same ballpark as the &quot;uber&quot; Shaman.</div></div><hr />

The upgrades are massive umm no I dont think so. The changes are ok but far from massive. I would agree with you untill you start to hit upper level PoP Shaman do ok. But in hard LDON, even if you are right that Shaman can be the main healer and I am not sure about that, their is a perseptition that we cant so people shy away from taking Shaman.<br />
<br />
As far as Shaman taking groups from Clerics thats just funny and I have never seen a Cleric turned down for a group because someone said we dont need a Cleric we have a shaman it just does not happen. Could a Shaman heal in normal LDON or BoT sure in a pinch but lets not get carried away shaman are not taking groups from clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno, I tend to think that these changes are pretty significant to the newly 65 and lower Shaman.<br />
<br />
Replinishment just went from &quot;I might cast it if I have nothing better to do&quot; to &quot;I really need to get this on everyone&quot;.  I will be pushing hard for L63 now just so I can do it in one cast.</div></div><hr />

Here we have two reasons to only play with good friends who know your class and know what youre supposed to do. Pick-up groups and retards should only be touched if its absolutely vital at the time and then its advisable to use a cattle-prod.<br />
<br />
For LDoN the shaman is great because he can usually heal quite good and have lots of support abilites wich are decent. Especially since slows have a greater value since fights are usually not super fast (atleast not when i play they arent) and you can get adds wich can be trivialized and slowed by a shaman.<br />
<br />
As for being bored in raids, that usually only happens when there are less than more than 4 active shamans on the raid. If you want to have fun, try to slow asap, toss out malos and cripple to left and right, canny like a possessed demon from hell and melee away with your biggest hammer...  :)<br />
<br />
And dont forget to get a bag of pet toys from you resident Mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just mentioning something. When SoE designed GoD they had a choice, taking into account there are casual and hardcore players they had to choose how many aa it would take for each ability. The numbers for which they have consequently been designed for is the hardcore player. Not criticizing it or anything, I just thought it was a curious dilemma and interesting what they had to choose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I main heal in normal LDON on a regular basis.  I don't turn cleric down, I just don't invite them in the first place.  I mean sure, if hes a friend of one of the group or mine np, but I don't seek out a cleric when I put together a Normal Risk LDON.  In normal LDON the cleric is just another guy that I cast FA and haste on.  And if the cleric has time to melee...<br />

Adding a cleric to the group means we are now looking for a bard or enchanter to do a high risk.</div></div><hr />

LDoN normal was trivial for me to be sole healer and slower before Quies was ever upgraded and regen was 25. Now its going to be a total snoozer, for sure. There is no &quot;in a pinch&quot; about it. I used to play the &quot;Lets see if we can do this adventure and I never cast Tnargs&quot; game as it was. Now I doubt I will even need to mem the spell, heh. As for BoT, I can duo there with a decent tank, all day. Heck, now, I bet I can solo there in a couple of the wings where I am resisted less. I could before, but it was work. Now, its just gonna be a walk. 460 points a tic, compared to 325 before. Thats a 33% increase. Thats pretty darn massive if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The only reason the opinion is that &quot;we're only broken at the high end&quot; is simply because the vast majority of Shaman who post on the boards ARE AT the high end of the game.<br />
<br />
I've been relying on clerics to heal groups since 55, and i've been wishing I could do something BESIDES slow since that point, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would wager it's because since they worry about changes at current spell levels trivializing content, they'd rather do it from 66-70, to make that less of an issue.  Also, if they add AA grind to it, it will further separate those who don't need it at their content not bothering from those who NEED it badly in their endgame who will jump for it.<br />
<br />
However, it does these things at the expense of some, who must grind and grind... but perhaps they figure that all people who are Time flagged and deep into GoD have a TON of spare time to grind and won't mind.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they just want your 30 bucks, I dunno, just some ideas.<br />
<br />
From Sudedor: Adding a cleric to the group means we are now looking for a bard or enchanter to do a high risk.<br />
<br />
That is so creepily accurate... I face that situation CONSTANTLY, ugh!<br />
<br />
And hey, now that Replenishment heals 15 more per tick, perhaps I will finally be able to part with my ol' trursty Fungi that I still swap out once and awhile...<br />
<br />
Then again, with the fungi, I will heal SIXTY per tick!  Woo..ho... sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my best ldon normal ever was me, a bard, 2 rogues, a mag, and a ranger.  i slowed on bard pull inc. ranger snared to aggro and they just let him have it. i have LR5 so tanking ldon normals is cake. it was a collect 22, and finished in 22mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sure the upgrades to the BoT, Q and regen are very good, but for named fight in KT i wouldnt count on a hot spell as the healing, i would still do my blast heal, i think the problem is i dont trust a HOT over a blast heal, even if it heal for more, sure its ok if i want a group in bot.. but i dont grind there, and if i did i still wouldnt trust a HOT over blast heal when facing a named.<br />
i dont care if they remove BOT and gimp Q again just give me a heal where i feel useable against a named, im not talking about being the only healer but a a 2nd. healer, that can patch until the CH lands that would rock.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heres the thing. For 280 mana (not counting mana pres, etc) every 30 seconnds you can keep a 420 hp regen shield on a tank. Its not designed to be the complete healing solution at the top end of the game, but man, it sure is close at the middle-lower end of the lvl 65 spectrum. I have not been to KT yet, but from my understanding, if you have another class slowing, these changes + the 2 new spells (both the HoT and the fast Heal) would put you REALLY close to being able to be only healer in those groups. I KNOW I will be able to be sole healer, and Slow, without the new spells, in EP xp content and LDoN Hard now, if I wish too.</div></div><hr />

I've been relying on clerics to heal groups since 55, and i've been wishing I could do something BESIDES slow since that point, as well.<br />
I had no trouble healing my groups at 55 in sebilis, nor did I have trouble at 60 when PoP opened. Sure, it was not always easy but it was not easy for a cleric either.<br />
<br />
Clerics do have an easier time of grouping above their level though, which skews this somewhat.<br />
<br />
Where are/were you playing that you had trouble being a healer?</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
Its not you that sucks, its them.  If they cant fight an unslowed (Early PoP mob I'm guessing)  they dont need to be there.<br />
Malos is is 95% gaurentee slow will stick on MOST mobs.<br />
<br />
Tell whoever said that, I said they suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned above, you can easily take the role of slower+healer in normal LDoN adv. Form your own groups rather than relying on others, get to know a group of people that do LDoN regularly and you'll have a blast, whilst also impressing your new friends what a 65 shm with so-so gear can achieve against mid-level content.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've tried soloing but to do so without dying, I have to do so in the old world which doesn't seem to offer much in the way of xp progression or even money making. <br />
<br />
Well, if you totally want to avoid dying then sure stay out of PoP. But no risk is no fun, and you can't expect to gain much from it. What were you expecting?<br />
<br />
At 58 I was soloing in PoI using Kragg's mending (before stoicism even existed). At 65 I was root-rotting golems in PoV for 7% of an AA per kill, walking all over nightstalkers in PoN to rake in BDs, or in the pit/pigpen in PoTactics (I had quest access) getting similar AA and some ornate, SPs, tactician's bullwark, and other items that sell really well. Lots of shaman have done this, with varying gear, ability, or AAs; its not hard especially if you get VP3 first. Sure you'll die now and then but its worth the rewards, and the loss from dying with GY recovery is practically nil except the downtime getting rezzed.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm bored off my bear buns when raiding. I was the sixth or seventh shaman to the guild...they had all their buffing/debuffing cycles figured out. I get to rarely cast anything but a spot thing here or there.<br />
<br />
Agreed, and all shaman have said for a long time that we stack badly on raids. At least our DoTs stack now though, so you can have a laugh getting summoned on the boss mobs :) Try to get the other shaman to share in the main roles, no reason for the same one or two to be doing everything each time. Most guilds I know won't recruit more shaman once they have 3-4 regulars.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've been accused of causing a death because I had to take the time to Malos before a slow would stick to a mob.<br />
<br />
99% of the time you'll be right to malos first. Malos on inc (v low aggro) and then slow as soon as you can without getting aggro. If you get aggro and go splat from a resist you're little use to anyone (rare exceptions where suicide slow is needed aside). I'd say you were right and they were wrong.<br />
<br />
PS: All the above comments apply pre-GoD with quiessence healing 300/tick. With 430/tick quiessence and 40/tick regen its just got even easier.</div></div><hr />
