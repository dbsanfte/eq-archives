<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking forward to make a Shaman. I have a 65 Magician, but find myself lately only &quot; hunting in the bazaar &quot;.<br />
Im an unguilded player, since im the last one of my guild which does no longer exist,cause all but me dont play EQ any more.<br />
So my Gameplay will be limited to solo,LDoN Adventures and normal Epx groups.<br />
Is Shaman a goood choice in that case?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solo LDoN  or Solo/LDoN ?<br />

Anyway, the shaman is probably one of the best classes in the game for the &quot;casual&quot; player. You are 100% completly self reliant. I cant really think of a class ATM ( just woke up ) that is as self sufficent. Yes a chanter can charm a mob for a billion DPS but what happened if they need a heal ?  I dunno, probably a biased statment..<br />
<br />
fact remains though, for your situation a shaman will be a excellant choice. Good group addition so you will always be wanted in EXP group and self reliance, so you can go and farm good amount of cash for yourself and other alts.  I my self am a unguilded shaman, im very much a lone wolf these days and after a brief period of &quot; *** do i do&quot; i find that im adjusting nad finding things to do and if i wasnt a shaman i would be sitting LFG some where or getting frustrated and logging off.<br />
<br />
Another tip i would give is to start making friends. Dont join their guilds, just make friends. You can have help this way with the things you need and you can help others also which if nothing else gives you something to do. Just take your time, there is a life after guild and its pretty satisfying and stress free. This is coming from a ex-high end raider, so your not alone ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
Forgot to add. Dont give up till 34.  1-34 as a shaman can be a lil tough, but if you have the fortitude to stick it out till you get first pet, it all gets better and better and better. Trust me ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AFAIK you can't solo LDoN. You need a group with at least 3 members.<br />
<br />
For groups a shaman is still a good choice. And with our dots can we still solo at 65 (but group XP will be usualy faster).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are 100% completly self reliant.<br />
So are necros, unless you count having to have a bone chip or peridot for some spells not self reliant. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMO soloing isn't bad until you hit 55 or so.  After that I found myself taking forever to kill stuff that would yield decent xp.  The good thing is you can find a way to duo effectively with any class so you don't have to get a group together if you dont want to.  <br />
<br />
I think the shaman is a great choice for the casual gamer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would think that either a shaman, necro, or druid would be the best choice for a causual solo player who still wanted to group.<br />
<br />
Of those three druids (for heals) and shaman (for slows) would find it easier to get ldon groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am a casual player with a (59) Shaman main.  These days 3 friends and I do LDON adventures - Cleric, Ranger, Wizard and Shaman.  With only four doing the adventures, each is critical to our success, but my friends really dislike having to replace me when not there.  <br />
Sometimes other friends join our core team or someone is not available and pick up others and I fill  different roles:<br />
(Usually) Slow, backup heal <br />
Primary heal (ench slows)<br />
Slow, deal damage - Anathema with BA3 <br />
Deal damage, backup heal (ench slows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The necro class is definitely the most self reliant class. Necros are the best casual gaming class out there imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">choose a necro.  You'll regret it less.  Shaman are a fun class, especially for the content you specify, but the spells are a little out of reach for many casual players (cost) and the gear difference between top tier shaman and more common shaman is creating almost as much of a rift as it has with warriors.  I find gear is less of an issue with int casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm a very casual player, taken me over a year to get to level 57 with my shaman main (although I also have several alts I play for fun).  Can testify that the shaman is still a great class for the slow and steady player.  I can get groups when I want, can start my own if I need to, I solo just fine, and with the new LDoN high dps dots, I can kill stuff just fine (and not break root).  I love having max stats self-buffed, being able to heal myself (got to do the stoicism quest), having a pet, JBB for free dd, canni, haste, slow, regen, sow, invis, etc., etc.  <br />
<br />
True, a necro or druid can solo even better than a shaman, but being a necro is a lonely life and best suited if you plan to solo 99% of the time.  But you can't deny that a necro has a lot of great tools, and rarely dies (FD, pet, etc.).  A druid is not as bad, but I can get a group in 1/10th the time it takes my druid buddy.  Many times I'll get an invite when not even LFG. Just make some friends and play well, and folks will seek you out.  Also, I can do my job and not worry about folding like a house of cards as soon as I get hit, I like being able to take a punch.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, lots of fun.  Some of the 300+ aa time-enabled shaman on this board have issues they would like addressed.  Fortunately, that will never happen to me, I will never see the Plane of Time.  I'll just have to settle for having fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EQ is not for the casual player, I guess you could if you really wanted to. I have recently quit eq, it is great, think of how long it takes you to progress, granted alot quicker then before but still forever. FOr every few lvls you beat going over the same stuff kill kill kill med, you can explore new content on new games! Besides when was the last time sony threw casual players a bone? Maaaybe yekisha, I quit after trying to do a ldon mision in lowerguk. First it takes me almost 45 minutes to put together a group. We then get ourselfs handed to them, I didn't mind but we had to wait for the mision to end for rezzes 30 minutes after the mision ended. So a &quot;quick&quot; ldon mision turns out to be over 3 hours, not too casual. Granted we had a bad bard who was probably ebay'd That's not the point. It's near impossible to play this game just casually, ok repeating my self now. GL to you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, yes and yet no all in one swipe ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
A creative person can solo LDoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think its safe to say you need a group of 3 to get the adventure, after that who can say what happenes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Casual gamer here with a 58 Shaman and a few mid forties alts. I still enjoy the game and yes it is a time sink. I just have not found other online games I enjoy. For me I can still find lots of content to explore as I was not able to go to many dungeons I now can. Duo alot with a Mage but also solo at my leisure. Not in any hurry to get to 65 so perhaps that is why I still enjoy doing what I do.....my 2 coppers.<br />
