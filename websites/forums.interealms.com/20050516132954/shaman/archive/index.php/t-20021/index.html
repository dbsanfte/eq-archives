<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is not an either/or question, nor ment to start a flame war.  I play a Shaman main, and have a low level Chanter alt.  I would like some straight forward input from folks who have played both classes on; strengths and weaknesses, solo and group abilities, high end game applicability, and fun factor.  Since I've got limited experience, I'd like to hear from those at the high end and who two box (which I do).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My experience with an enchanter goes to level 52.  Thats not high end by any means, but it has given me an insight into some of the ins and outs of enchanting.  Since you asked, heres a rundown of my experience.<br />
<br />
Playing an enchanter can be a very frustrating experience at the same time that it can be very rewarding.  There is no other character (other than shaman for me, actually) where I can have such a feeling of accomplishment after locking down, debuffing and controlling a 4+ mob overpull; but all it takes to turn that feeling of success into visions of horror is one boneheaded melee mistargetting or trigger happy caster tossing a rain &quot;by mistake&quot; to ruin the work you have done and probably end your life.  Playing an effective enchanter means always knowing what is happening in your group; anyone can run a buffbot enchanter that occasionally will mez an add.  But it takes attention, persistance and knowledge to run a good enchanter.<br />
<br />
Strengths<br />
- groups will want you<br />
- you are the best class at mana regeneration<br />
- you have the best hastes<br />
- a well played enchanter can make any situation managable<br />
- you are king in dungeons (LDoN has changed that a little; I was refering to older dungeons in earlier expansions)<br />
- Charming can make you the most powerful one on one soloer there is (bards win with swarm kiting though)<br />
<br />
Weaknesses<br />
- groups may only want you for your buffs, not your other skills<br />
- Once you hit 60, your mana regen spells last so long that you might not be needed in groups, only to cast before a group leaves<br />
- Many groups only want to pull singles, or at most doubles.  This makes for a very very bored enchanter.<br />
- you have a few really great buff lines; you will be pestered for those spells every 20 minutes from the moment you get them untill you quit your enchanter<br />
- untill gear begins to make a noticible difference enchanters are the most fragile of the casting classes; it wont take much to turn you into a stain on the ground if you arent carefull<br />
- you will often throw mana away because your mezzes WILL get broken time and again by the same player, whose response will always be &quot;opps, my bad&quot;<br />
<br />
Fun Factor<br />
I enjoyed playing my enchater.  Though sometimes I wanted to strangle a ranger that mistargetted with a bow or a shaman/necro/druid that dotted an add as soon as it came into camp, I found it a very rewarding class.  Grouping is where the enchanter will shine.  While soloing can be very fun, it can also be dangerous and lead to many deaths (16 is my record for one night of soloing)  Soloing my way around Kael and passing other full groups in exp gain/mob kill rates was a blast.  <br />
<br />
Tier 1 and tier 2 can be very very boring for an enchanter as single pulls are so easy to get.  Many times you might find that you can go AFK for 15-20 minutes at a time and as long as you keep hastes up no one will notice.  Places like Droga and veksar are much more fun for an enchanter in their late 40's early 50's because it gives you something to do.  I found early on that crawls were much more entertaining than camping because you will often blunder around a corner into the waiting arms of 5 mobs, and that is just always pure joy for an enchanter.<br />
<br />
My advice?  Try it out.  Take the enchanter up in levels and see what happens.  Although its all but unavuidable, Paladual Caverns can kill any characters joy early on.  Get LDoN groups as fast as you can (level 20). Yes, the exp wont be as good really as PC, but you will have more fun.  I've found that an enchanter takes a certain temprement of player to really enjoy;  Somone that is very detail oriented and almost obsessive makes teh best enchanter because those are the people that will time buffs and mezzes so that you never have to ask for anything because they will be casting it as soon as it flashes or remezzing 2 secs before it wakes.  Im not quite at that level, but I still ran a good enchaner that was always sought after in groups.<br />
<br />
Since you already are a shaman main, I didnt go into that portion of the question.  Dig about the boards a bit and you will find anything and everything that there is to know about the pros and cons of a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats a fairly good summary of the chanter I think. Another note is until you get the component free self rune at 61, keeping yourself runed gets awefully expensive. <br />
<br />
It pretty much got to the point where my wife would only play her chanter grouped with people we knew well because she couldn't take all the idiots constantly breaking mez's or sitting around doing nothing because the group insisted on single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This topic has been discussed several times before, but I cannot find those threads so I'm assuming the topics got pruned.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can really add to the above is that playing an enchanter takes endless patience.  You have to be prepared for any of the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;oops, I DoTed that mob&quot;<br />
&quot;oops, I my bolt spell/arrow woke that mob up as it passed by&quot;<br />
&quot;oops, i had the wrong name in my assist key or spelled it wrong&quot;<br />
&quot;oh shut up, I can tank this no problem, no harm done&quot;<br />
&quot;dont worry about my breaking mez before the tank can target the mob or taunt it, you never seem to get hurt&quot; (while your rune is being eaten)<br />
&quot;sorry, I thought you could handle those two mobs beating on you, you werent even taking damage until near the end there&quot;<br />
&quot;you mean you can't lock down 13 mobs?  i thought you could mez!&quot;<br />
&quot;can I get kei?&quot;<br />
&quot;can I get kei?&quot; (from someone outside your group)<br />
&quot;cant I get kei?&quot; (from someone outside your group, but in the same group as the previous guy)<br />
<br />
The list just goes on.  Be ready for it all.  If you can put up with the hazzards of playing an enchanter, its a very fun class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice post, Thorzion.<br />
<br />
In a good group pulling multiple mobs there is nothing more fun than being the enchanter.<br />
<br />
Good group: Healers that are on you when you need heals (and you WILL need heals.) A MT that all recognize as the MT and who follow the MT instructions on when what to attack. A MT that pays attention to which mob-on-hold to attack next. (I use the &quot;Hail a %T&quot; to let tank know which is next.)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind there are going to be mistakes made. Mistakes. That means every now and then something is going to happen that shouldn't have but did. Be prepared.<br />
<br />
Keep root up for those 'accidental' dots that get cast. Keep stun up for those 'accidental' mez breaks to regain control. Keep gate up for those 'accidental' groups who have no clue what you are trying to do, or can do.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can be a blast to play. If not played in a fast paced, multipull environment they can also be extremely boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I 3-box a lot.  I either use mage/cleric/enchanter or warrior_monk/shaman/enchanter.  In either combo, the enchanter is pretty handy.  I'd say they even stack fairly well with shamans, even with many shared traits.  It's soooooo nice to be able to lock down overpulls I can't imagine playing without it now.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter mana regen (only level 56 so I can cast clarity II on my shaman - it helps a lot and KEI will only be better).  I can get the best possible haste on my melees (only have 34% haste so max haste helps).  With my warrior or mage tanking, I can pull singles all day long.  I can thrown Boon of the Garou on the tank and increase his proc rate and add a lifetap proc.  Lots of handy little things like that.  <br />
<br />
Very handy, but I can definitely imagine how boring it would be in an experience group pulling singles all day long.  They're invaluable in LDoNs or other multi-pull environments and almost useless in single-pull environments.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thorzion does a good job of giving the pros and cons of enchanters.<br />
<br />
As far as two boxing a shaman and enchanter, it really depends on what you are going to be doing.  As stated above, it is pretty trival to box a buffbot type enchanter.  Mez a mob here or there on a double pull, tash, nuke a few times, etc.  It can be pretty handy though to know exactly when a mob is going to be tashed and not have to wait for the enchanter in the group to wake up and do it when you have resistant mobs.<br />
<br />
Two boxing a shaman and enchanter when you are often going to be getting more than two mobs a pull can be challenging (in my opinion anyway).  That would mainly due to both the shaman and enchanter being pretty front heavy on what they do in a battle.  Trying to handle slowing at the same time you are trying to mez can cause some issues.  It is doable of course though with practice.<br />
<br />
Both my shaman and enchanter are 65 and it can be fun to two box them.  I generally prefer not to though if we are doing something difficult, but for normal day to day single/double pull stuff it is pretty easy to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always thought that Necromancers had the best mana regeneration in the game /shrug  Canni 5 may be more, but I don't know...not much on exact numbers :(<br />
<br />
CC and mind buffs vs. Focus....hrmmm doesn't seem like it's much competition really.  But if both classes are played well, and you are in a competent group, the difference is alot less IMO.  Too many peeps addicted to KEI these days.<br />

necro &gt; shaman for personal mana regen<br />
<br />
i think thorizon meant that enchanters are the best at buffing mana regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Necro's mana regen is better i think, having played both post 60. ANd of course necro's spells cost less mana and they can tap both mana and health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chanters are more wanted than shamans probably by a factor of 2 to 1.  Unf there are probably 2 shamans for every 1 enchanter at any given moment.  So go figure.  Enchanter is a more challenging class to play passably.  But shaman played WELL is a truly amazing class.  No other class than a shaman can be total group support all in one player.   <br />
However . . . you may have fun being a chanter too.  And you'll never run out of group invites that is for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Best thing about necro regen is it's constant.  You don't have to stop what you're doing to canni like you do with a shaman.  Can simply lich and then put something else in the spell slot and not worry about it for an hour or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Both are great classes.  I been fortunate to be guilded and a fellow officer with one of the most competent and ballsy chanters I have ever played with.  A well-played chanter is both a challenge and very rewarding.  I regulary group up with this guy, and together with my SK, we have had 8 mobs locked down and mezzed at one time, and survived.  I would have to put that encounter into one of my EQ highlight films.<br />
<br />
I remember reading the quote from the Prima Guide a couple years ago when I started this game...&quot;A shaman is a jack of all trades and a master of none.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, there is some truth, but we are the best at some things.  We're the best slowers, and personally, I believe we are the best at buffing melee.  A Shaman/Taunt Melee duo can go all the way to 65+ easily (my preference is the SK).  It can be done with other combos, but for all-around versatility, I believe we win top spot.<br />
<br />
Personally, I believe it comes down to class knowledge and skill.  There are plenty of suck ass 65 Enchanters and Shamans (as there are in any class).  Level, gear and AA's do NOT equate to skill...it just means you've played long enough to acquire them. <br />
<br />
My favoirte times in this game have been and continue to be with people that know their class, and the abilities of other classes.  Playing and grouping with skilled players is just plain fun, and it continues to amaze me the places just a few well-skilled players can go, and the things they can accomplish.<br />
<br />
Enjoying your class and learning to play it well, is and will always be more important that the inate benefits of the class you're playing.  ****ty players can suck at any class.<br />
<br />
Pick the one you enjoy the most, and learn to play them well (from the perspective of others).  <br />
<br />
There was a time, and I don't know if it really applies as much anymore, when your reputation and skill counted in this game.  Zones were limited, and group spots as well.  People who were competent got the groups.  Others stayed LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>barbelavie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">enchanter have best mana regen in the game that can be applied to someone else<br />
<br />
This is not true at level 64 +.<br />
Bard's Chorus of Marr regens 21 mana/tick (or 22 mana/tick with the Jamfest AA)<br />
Enchanter's Voice of Quellious regens 18 mana/tick<br />
<br />
you have the best hastes<br />
<br />
This is not true at level 64+ either.<br />
Bard's Warsong of Zek is 60% haste. Adds to this Rizlona or Call of The Muse and it makes 90% haste, and raises the haste cap by 30%.<br />
Enchanter's speed of Vallon is 70%haste, and does not raise the haste cap.<br />
Because of the DS and ATK buff thats comes with Warsong, and the 15% DD focus that comes with Rizlona/Muse, these song are very often played by bards.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My first character was a chanter (well, really it was a monk, but he got abandoned early).  I dinged 50 just before Kunark came out, and got to 54 in Karnor's Castle.  That was the end of my chantering days for a long while.  I started a wiz and never looked back ... until LDON.  I have since played the enchanter to 65, almost exclusively in LDON, and I enjoy playing him again.  I have played a shaman to 58 now (no PL, just play).  When I need to pull off something really tough, the chanter or shaman are the classes I look to (depending on level).  I often 2-box my chanter and shaman, and with charm, I can do some pretty amazing stuff.  They are similar in capabilities, but different in style.  As an enchanter, you will die A LOT.  Prepare for it.  I have broken stuff in my home while playing my enchanter.  No other class has drawn that ire out of me.  No other class has given me the thrill that locking down 6 mobs and keeping a charmed beating on a 7th mob does.  Playing an enchanter is a high-risk thrill ride, at least for me.  Playing a shaman competently (and I've learned from y'all) allows you to do a great deal, but for me, does not provide the thrill.  I play all my characters with an element of enchanter, though, since I grew up playing in Cazic Thule, Guk, and SolB.  <br />
<br />
In the end, you have to decide if you thrive in stressful situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally both are fun classes.  I have played both to 65 and 2boxing them is a blast but in a hardcore day I prefer to 2 box my shm/clr and let my friend play the chanter.  Soloing no biggie as most state.<br />
<br />
A shaman worth his due will definitely have an impact on a group.  Just how the class is and a person being able to use it.   Yes we do not have best dots, nukes, or heals but we are the best at being the jack of all trades (barring bards who imo just rule if person a real pro).  Shaman played well turns a group into a lean, mean, non-stop killing machine.  :) <br />
<br />
Enchanter on the other hand is more singular in focus but just as good and/or if not better depending on situation. CC, haste, mana regen, DPS (chanter who knows how to charm and control pet right is just awesome) and some misc stuff is just nice to have.   Yes you will die more with this class but lets face it the invites for groups and high end soloing ability (charm) will makes up for it.<br />
<br />
Myself I like both.  I can play either with and be happy which is a nice thing but ultimately it comes down to what you like.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I play both enc and shm, my shm should ding 65 this next week, halfway thru 64, and my enc is 61.<br />
<br />
I love both classes, and would play enc more if I didn't feel I had to focus on a main.<br />
<br />
I would often play in a trio of enc/nec/shm, and the enc would be held back by mana considerations the most, easily.  Don't be fooled that you'll have 'the best mana regen', everyone has KEI anyways, and even other class-based mana regen which ench does not get.  In any case practicing good mana management is what carries you.  I don't think for a second that class balance did not include mana regen concerns.  Just compare you spell costs and casting times on the shm and enc.  In the end you're getting as much mana regen and leeway as SOE is willing to give you.<br />
<br />
I have a sort of pessimistic view on how things were on ench for awhile:<br />
<br />
I found it kind of annoying to xp the enc past 52 or so, because I felt mostly hobbled.  If you want xp at any reasonable pace then, you have to do planes, and at least the early planes are kinda boring.<br />
<br />
In many groups there wasn't anything to do but boon a melee and haste everyone.  Nobody ever needs anything less than c3, and often they will have a shaman slower.  It wasn't exactly a walk in the park playing slower either, because the casting time for enc slow is long and if you need to tash, then your slow isn't going to land for a long time, since you have to wait a few seconds to tash.  This is compared to my shm that would malo on inc and slow immediately, sometimes taking a hit or two.  If you play shm then enc you will feel the pain I swear it...<br />
<br />
Planes are also a joke for single pulls alot, and wide open spaces.  Most of the time you'll get single pulls, and alot of time on the double or triple pulls if you're group is half-decent they'll have rooted the add before it gets to group anyway.  Eventually this is the preferred way to do it, root or kite adds, even with enc, because you can't mez anything useful once you get to tier2.  If you're fighting in PoV/PoS you probably can't mez any adds because they are too high level, at least until you're 61.<br />
<br />
It was hellish trying to xp my enc from 58 to 60 because it felt like nobody wanted her.  Sometimes I'd have her in a group, and slow/malo/buff out of group on my shm, and patch heal.<br />
<br />
Things are definitely better on the horizon I think for my enc, as far as coming spells and utility as a class, and I expect to be wanted more for group 61+.  I guess every class goes through growing pains in 50's tho eh.<br />
<br />
I feel like SHM has more general utility in a group, but ENC has some crucial abilities that make them so useful and powerful, especially for one grouping things..   Charm, mez, lull, extra slow, best haste, stun are invaluable, compared to shm.<br />
<br />
After its all said and done though, enchanter has charm, and charm wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">man and i was hoping for a pvp thread :p<br />
<br />
OK well both classes are great and most groups are very happy to have either if not both in the group. High end charming is insane in places like tipt or vxed you can basically make a whole group around the pet and use the tank just in case charm breaks. anyways not much else for me to put in that hasn't already been said but Illislight &gt; enchanter i have even seen in action on TZ and i would venture to say he is one of the best enchanters in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">65 Enchanter here with a few AA's (140 or so iirc). 254-4 in LDON. (Working at maxxing my Adventurer's Stone)<br />
<br />
IMO Enchanters are adrenaline junkies. Shaman are more like &quot;old reliable.&quot; But first to address mana regen.<br />
<br />
Applied to SELF, Necro &gt; *. Lich &gt; C5.<br />
<br />
Applied to OTHERS Bard &gt; *.<br />
<br />
For those who say they are &quot;bored&quot; with single pulls...one word - &quot;Charm.&quot;  If you are sitting on your duff dispensing buffs and tashing / slowing single pulls, with an occasional nuke then you are a LOAD on your group.<br />
<br />
LDON is made for the GOOD Enchanter. Again, it is quite possible to allow others to pull, mez the single add, slow and sit down.<br />
<br />
BO-RING.<br />
<br />
Charm something and add 40% of the GROUP'S DPS.  Trust me, you will get KNOWN and you will get invites into LDON groups. (Or GoD groups).<br />
<br />
Shaman are fun no doubt, and a GOOD Shaman with all the toys (I speak post-Kunark and specifically of 'Q') can in a normal LDON act as healer and slower. A BAD Shaman (and oh Lord they are out there - trust me) is a shame. It's like the high school prom queen who let herself go and is in need of weigh watchers.</div></div><hr />
