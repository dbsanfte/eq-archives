A friend recently lended me a account(65 shaman 45AA) so i could play with him. He is out of reach right now and i was wondering if you shammy experts could give me some advises on how to be to the most help in groups. Since ive only leveled a shammy to 45 before and that was like... 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Any advices, what spells to use(i was told that the char had everything i would need in spells) Buffs, doing damage, anything.<br />
<br />
The chars equipment isn't all that good. 2000 hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, all i want to do is get the proper information before starting to exp. I just wanna learn.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Best advice I could give you is to get in lower level groups, like one of the Tier 1 planes till you adjust to the shaman, Its not fair to your group if you join a level 65 group in a higher level zone and they are expecting a certian level from the shaman, and you are not able to provide it.<br />
<br />
That being said, the &quot;Base&quot; shaman is pretty simple, Your main job is to slow mobs, lay on dots if you dont have enough DPS, and patch heal if your healers are running otu of mana constantly.. Everyone is going to tell you how to pay differently, everyone has a different &quot;Style&quot;...<br />
<br />
Buffs you will cast till you hate them.. Focus of the 7th, Sta Buff, Talisman of Diaku, Regen.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I dont care if you have no mana regen, if your group is waiting for YOU to regen mana all the time, your slowing the group down... You have cannie, dont be shy to use it. The cannie dance is the same from cannie1 to cannie5, just bigger chunks at a time... <br />
<br />
dont feel bad throwing Q's out to tanks as they are fighting, or throwing your heals out (They are not super efficient, while some excel at being a main healer of a group, I always feel like there are others out there better suited for the healer role... Namely druids/clerics..) you can fill it in if you have to, but I always feel pressured when I hvae to get a slow off on something thats quadding for 1000+ and trying to slow, and heal before the tank is dead. :)<br />
<br />
Buff your group... Heal your group, Slow the mobs, do Damage for your group, and everyone will love you, keep that mana up, and never be the one the groups waiting on for mana to get back...<br />
<br />
Good luck.. hope it helps some, Im sure most will have different opinions of whats important! :)</div></div><hr />
