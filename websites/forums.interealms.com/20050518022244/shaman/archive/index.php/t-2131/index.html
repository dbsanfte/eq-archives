<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Took me 7 months, but I finally got the damn spell to drop.<br />
<br />
Of course it dropped of a person I have been friends with for 3 years. And to make him let go of the dang scroll I had to bury him in plat.<br />
<br />
Not very heroic, but damnit I was tired of being a poor healer. <br />
<br />
Now on to buisness. <br />
<br />
Here Dragon, Dragon, Dragon !!! <br />
<br />
Watch out Ydelma, I am coming for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I payed 50K. (Gulp)<br />
<br />
I am in debt to friends for a truckload.<br />
<br />
Too damn much money, but it is worth it. It is the game changer. I was pulling for the group (as normal) and after about three hours my buddy Breckenridge told me that if I dont get hurt some he is going to fall asleep. and Instead of trying for singles like I normally would I was pulling 2-3 at a time. <br />
<br />
Simply a sick sick spell. But the only problem is I have to find a spot for it on my 1st bank of commands, and figure out how to mem 12 spells instead of 8. BAH<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats Snoww!  Your torpor plight/blight (pick the word you feel fits best) is suprisingly well known on these boards.  Glad to see it end for you.  Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I won't have to endure what you did to land it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been 60 for 4 months no luck, nice to see that people are getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Friends charged you 50k? :\<br />
Sorry, I'd look for new ones :(<br />
Unless they went out of pocket to get it from some money grubbing tunnel rat.<br />
<br />
But grats on your spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gratz Snoww!<br />
<br />
:) :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Snoww falls into a state of broke  <br />
<br />
Rofl, congrats regardless!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow congrats snoww.  Glad to see you finally got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An old friend of Mine that when the game started played with me alot. Sold me the spell. He had it in the bank for when he hits 60. But his shaman isnt his main anymore. hasnt been for years. <br />
<br />
The 50 K was to him. His shaman is 58 also just to show how close he is. The coin was so he can do some tradeskilling and to break the deaathgrip on the spell. Now that I have got the spell the laws of **** you very much will have two copies of torpor drop in the next few days. One of those copies I will sell back to him for Hmm maybe 50K Maybe 45 K. He has already agreed to buy it if he doesnt get a copy before me.<br />
<br />
I owe my friends because I had 12 K in the bank. Some of them gave me 2K each, but one went up to the seller, and handed him the 50 K. when I tried to give him my 12 K that I had, he canceled the trade and told me &quot;Lets try this again now shall we?&quot; <br />
<br />
So I have 12 K in the bank, and a friend I will just have to bludgon to death next time I see him in real life. <br />
<br />
I don't need new friends. I could'nt find better ones If I tried.<br />
<br />
:Begins to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
:Falls into a state of torpor..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the spell system in EQ is one of the worst things about the game.  torpor is 100% REQUIRED for shamans to even come close to being able to heal adequately.<br />
<br />
correct me if i'm wrong but isn't celestial elixir a vendor purchased spell?  what about the druid heal at level 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The quest is complete...gratz Snoww!</div></div><hr />

I don't know, but they are certainly not as rare or expensive as Torpor.</div></div><hr />
