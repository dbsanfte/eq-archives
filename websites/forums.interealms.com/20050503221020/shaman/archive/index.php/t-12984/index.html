<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Plane of Growth was changed in the last patch to reactivate the Protectors of Growth mobs, which has the practical effect of eliminating PoG as an efficient place for shaman soloing or single group armor and loot farming efforts.  Some would argue this is good to preserve the &quot;integrity&quot; of PoG as a raid zone.  What is the consensus of the shaman community on this change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I voted bad, mainly because the faction hits in that plane often made it hard to get more than 2 or 3 groups total interested in raiding.  The general make up of clerics is mainly high elves that I have noticed (with Dark elves coming in second).<br />
<br />
I can understand the need for raid training grounds but I just see the change making the plane become less utilized rather than more due to the change.  I still think the faction hits will be the death of that zone for raid plans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even though I just started farming PoG, and am upset. This is what was intended. The pogs were always supposed to protect growth...<br />
<br />
This feels like the whole luclin models and horses thing. you werent supposed to be able to use a horse w/o new models on, it just wasnt supposed to work that way, and when things get &quot;fixed&quot; people are outraged. <br />
<br />
If you really think about it it was a bug that people took advantage of... badly... but hey its varents fault to leave something as big as that broken for what? 9 months...<br />
<br />
what im basicly trying to say is /feedback /petetion /rant all you want. this is what the pogs were supposed to be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Suggested reading: http://www.cheese.com/ to go with the whine.<br />
<br />
Protectors were always supposed to make the zone annoying and prevent it from being constantly farmed. The cash drops are so good because they weren't intended to be soloed, at least not without great annoyance from the PoGs. With even a decent group you can still make a crapload of money in not a lot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do have to agree that working as intended is better for the game, just wish that the zone wouldnt go to waste once they fix what was broken.  Prior to the protectors going away and after the exspansions that made PoG outdated, how often were there raids to that particular zone?<br />
<br />
So yeah its good its fixed, but yeah its sad that few will go there anymore.  It was a nice place to take a group of 2, or 3 just to get spell drops without having to resort to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Maybe they will revamp PoG like they are doing PoH and PoF in the future.  I know Tunare could use a facelift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen posts that claim they took out the pogs on purpose. (If that's not true, then disregard the following)<br />
<br />
If that's the case, then putting them back in is not a 'fix'.  Therefore, the claims that this is the way it was intended to be, it was broken, and people were exploiting a bug are unfounded statements and shouldn't be used as ammunition against those that feel it's a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I've only read one post where someone stated they were glad the pogs were put back in because it screwed up their Tunare raid.  Although I may not agree with that poster, it's the only real statement i've read that is based on their personal play.<br />
<br />
I am one of the ones that feel it's a bad thing, at first glance anyways.  I've duo'd up there with my cleric and it's a lot of fun, and a great risk vs reward scenario.  I've yet to get back up there to see how difficult it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They took away the zone-wide aggro on purpose - the fact they were perma-roted with no aggro unless you sat under them for five minutes was kinda buggy, though.<br />
<br />
Funny thing, really... Even with Protectors not en masse attacking every 23 minutes, there were hardly any raids to Plane of Growth. Armor drops are as bad as Kael arena, and only Tunare really drops anything worth having, and she's a little elf-bitch-whore to kill... <br />
<br />
The only reason those trash mobs were put back in is to make the zone totally unusable for any but the most desperate. Most people would rather pay 3k for a Thurg armor MQ than clear Growth and hope for a drop. And everyone else is scared of ruining their elf faction. You KNOW a zone is crap when people won't hunt there because elves like them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have no problem with the decision - it is after all the way the zone was designed and as such is a fix and not a nerf.<br />
<br />
I don't, however, think it was the right decision to make. The Prots are rather annoying and only serve as a disincentive to people who might otherwise wish to hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Korbis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a mistake. Maybe the zone was intended to have these protectors, but I personally have seen that my girlfriend and her guild that isn't really capable of raiding anything were fond of taking a group or two up there and getting armor drops. They had a lot of fun up there.<br />
<br />
So what if some people were soloing one side of the zone. There are better cash farming spots. There are easier spots to get equiv loot, although it's not as fun to farm. It was not over powering or &quot;too good&quot;, it was just too FUN. That's where the Everquest dev team consistantly makes mistakes, they should be trying to make things as fun as possible while not unbalanced rather than as balanced as possible while not unfun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can anyone actually tell me from direct experience since the patch, have the Protectors changed back to zone-wide agro, or is it some intermediate state?<br />
<br />
The big drawback to PoG is the faction - it's the only plane I can think of with faction that adversely affects non-planar areas. Tunare worshippers are the only ones who lose out by hunting in the zone of their goddess, and this makes it hard to get people to raid there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree this change was correct.  This zone was designed to be void of players and useless.  With the PoGs in their non-agro form, the zone was failing to meet its design goal (due their actually being players in the zone).  Bravo for the fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This zone belongs to whichever guild is timing the tunare spawn on your server.  You have no right to inconvenience them by killing their mobs and messing up their spawn timing.  How dare you get decent exp and loot solo or in a small group.  Who do you think you are an enchanter?  A druid?  No, now get back under the thumb of the man, thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whenever they screw up the implementation of something and leave it screwed up for months and months, it becomes a part of the game.  Maybe PoG was &quot;intended&quot; to be a raid-only zone, but they messed up.  It became a decent zone for a small group or solo people to go and farm for cash and money.  When you &quot;fix&quot; something that has been a part of the game for months, all it does is piss people off.  I don't really think anyone is happy about this change.  No one was happy about affliction focus being &quot;fixed&quot;, and no one was happy about the horse/lucling model &quot;fix&quot;, either.  The dev's knew about all three of these &quot;problems&quot; for months, but decided that adding newbie gnome quests and fixing doors in newbie towns was a more important way to spend their time.  Also, all 3 of these changes took something away without giving anything back, which is what I call a NERF.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind at all if the protectors had always done their job.  I wouldn't mind if affliction focus didnt work on debuffs to begin with.  I wouldn't mind if you always had to have luclin models on to use a horse.  But it wasn't always like that.  The devs were lazy and sloppy when they implemented these 3 things, and then were even more lazy by not fixing them for almost a year.  That is what pisses me off more than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to say that this is a change for the better.<br />
<br />
To have a whole high level zone where soloing classes can go and just farm is a little ridiculous.   I am not against soloing, in fact, I love it and can't live without it.  But come on, with the cash coming out of PoG, you have to admit that it was WAY too sweet of a deal.<br />
<br />
I would change one thing though.  I would change their spawning.  I would either make them pop every hour OR I would have one pop every 20 minutes.  That way, people could still solo if they needed too, it would just take a little extra work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have to say that this is a change for the better.<br />
<br />

<br />
You mean like most of the upper tier planes in PoP?  Surely you don't mean balanced zones with chanters in BoT, wizards in PoFire and druids in PoStorms right?<br />
<br />
Oh, I see what you mean, let me rephrase what you said:<br />
<br />
To have a whole high level zone where NON-UBER soloing classes can go and just farm is a little ridiculous.   <br />
<br />
There, that's more descriptive right?<br />
<br />
SOE is the suck.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BTW, I'm nowhere even close to being uber.  Pretty far from it.<br />
<br />
Yes, the upper tier zones in PoP are out of whack too.  I read that post where an UBER wizard was quadding in PoFire.  He was getting something like 86% AA per quad.  Insane in the membrane...<br />
<br />
<br />
...but I thought this thread was about PoG?<br />
<br />
<br />
If we want to bring other zones into the discussion, we can discuss the recent changes to HoH.  Some of the mobs are now starting to summon, so PoG wasn't the only zone that was touched.  The HoH soloers have the same gripes as the PoG soloers.  Why take the only good thing about a zone that is normally empty and make it so that no one will go there anymore?  I agree wholeheartedly with this.  <br />
<br />
I think soloing in PoG should have been harder than it was, and easier than it is.  It is a PLANE for heaven's sake!<br />
<br />
(pun intended)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Voted &quot;who cares?&quot; PoG was not designed to be an XP/loot zone. Surprised the Prots stayed broken as long as they did to be honest. It isn't like they're random pop's, every 30 mins or so you can expect two annoyances that really aren't much more difficult than what the group has been fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Where's the option for :  &quot;Never went there, still will never go there.&quot; ?<br />
<br />
I guess that is a subset of &quot;It's a wash.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Protector bug was NOT intentional as far as SoE's view seems to go, lets clear that up right now.<br />
<br />
By all means link me to a patch message or official statement from an SoE representative if there is one.<br />
<br />
PoG fits in between PoHate/Fear and East/west ToV as an alternative to Kael armor farming spots, icewell keep and Western Wastes.  The drop rate is lower, but the armor doesnt require gems.  It was not intended to be an alternative to hill giants.<br />
<br />
Even farming Hate/Fear for gems carried more risk than PoG, and at a lower reward (Much more addtastic, as well as far nastier mob abilities in some cases).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the PoG change was a terrible move for the game.  Why on earth would Sony mess with a zone just as it was starting to see some use?  Soloing in PoG had a lot of risk associated with it; soloing or duoing there at 62 I had good nights with phat cash and bad nights with gating out or dying.  The zone is different every time because of the long respawn--the mob population and location can be quite different every time depending when areas were last cleared and whether they were all cleared at once.  A fun, challenging, interesting zone with a nice risk vs. reward balance.<br />
<br />
Adding back the PoG's makes it completely inefficient for soloing, so that is out.  Same for a single group in most cases, because an unbreakable spawn of 2 unmezzable, gating and summoning PoG's every 23 mins is basically a real PITA which probably rules it out for most single groups.<br />
<br />
I feel that the Tunare raiders should just deal with any inconvenience from having to share the zone with non-raiders--there are a lot more places for raiding but few zones comparable to pre-change PoG for 60+ soloing and 55+single group use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you was having trouble with getting adds mid fight, your campspot, find a better one.  If you was having trouble with the casters, try using those resistance buffs we have.  If you think mobs that our 61 pet can practically solo slowed with a magekit was a challenge, go back to farming orc belts.  Farming pog wasnt a challenge beyond learning the mobs and decent camp spots, it wasnt fun once the novelty wore of, it was just a horrid grind that netted very nice amounts of PP for very little effort.<br />
<br />
I first started soloing pog when my guild was actively killing Tunare, if she was due I'd head in and get a start on clearing the plane to save us time (And bolster my bank balance).  My warrior has a full set of berserkers, I have a near full set of spirit weavers for the look (missing a bracer of the top of my head), I've equiped several guildies and there alts with PoG armor also.  I've died soloing once (Tried the ancient totem solo, but its guards came with it, after I'd single pulled it a few days before grouped with a mage friend who was bored).  I've had to gate a few times, but that was mostly down to the occasional roaming treant before I figured out how to avoid them totally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What made it a challenge for me to solo at 62 was that usually the place was pretty clear of mobs, because the zone had become so popular.  This meant that the usual safe campspots, which were the most cleared spots, had no mobs.  So I venture out to find the mobs and end up with more adds than I could handle.  This was fun and added a lot of variety to how to hunt the zone.<br />
<br />
The casters are doable solo with good resists, it is the adds that made it a challenge.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the insult on the orc belts, btw, that really helps the discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It is still a good raid training ground.<br />
I had full PoG from raiding there by the time I was 54, the highest person in the guild was 57 at that time and the PoG comming for you made it interesting. <br />
So long as you can set a timer to thier spawn I think it is good that they fixed the broken PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Change was stupid. Why you may ask?<br />
<br />
a)the gear that drops in pog(except off tunare) sucks compared to bazaarable gear that is very affordable nowadays.<br />
<br />
b)Because of faction issues, its difficult, if not nigh impossible to get people who arent already kos to elfs to go there, for some reason people dont want to be kos to the flaming panzies. *shrug*<br />
<br />
c)In regards to A, and B the risk of the PoG's is so not inline with the rewards of the zone as to be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this is a change specificially to coddle the tunare killing guilds who whine and cry if they get a light blue add during the tunare fight. Grats you guys on yet another way to stick it to the little guys. Im sure SOE is enjoying bending them over for you so you can stick it in real well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The Hyena said it best: You KNOW a zone is crap when people won't hunt there because elves like them<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, a post that says it all without the fluff of useless stating of the obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have yet to notice that the elfs dislike me.  I hear they have towns or something, but I have yet to see a reason to go near them.  After seeing a wood elf in Spandex looking red and green chainmail you wouldn't either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The zone wide agro is a huge mistake.  I rarely see more then seven people in the zone and frequently am alone when I go there.  The difficulty of getting rezes there makes it dangerous to solo and acts to make the risk reward appropriate.<br />
<br />
With the return of the PoGs to zone wide agro, the risk reward is no longer appropriate.  Soloing there will be less lucrative then farming HG's.  And since the mass blue diamond drops in PoP (werewolf camp in PoN comes to mind where a bard can solo and get upwards of 5 to 10 BDs in a session) the cash in PoG is mearly good.  For a group to farm for cash I have had much better success in 4C in Cazic.<br />
<br />
Now all that PoG will be is a zone to outfit twinks.  If that much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just another example of SOE uncreatively &quot;over-controlling&quot; their player base...and succeeding in making another zone worthless to all but the larger guilds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">*sigh*<br />
<br />
make a PoG2 then with tunare in it so you cash farmers dont screw over the guilds trying to use the zone as it was designed.<br />
<br />
I bet most of the folks that voted it was a bad change are all keibabys from late luclin.<br />
<br />
:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I voted 'Yes it was a good change, but I would have voted yes &amp; no if it was an option.<br />
I would have rather them just lower the drop rate on gems/jewelry than add the PoGs I guess. <br />
PoG has been an underused zone and still is IMO, unless Tunare is up. Practically the only class that solo's in there are Shaman because a high majority of the mobs summon, if not it would be completely full of non-Tunare worshipping Wizards quading.<br />
<br />
The armor was so rare to drop in PoG and most of it isn't anywhere near as good some of the armor you can get in the bazaar now days.<br />
<br />
Maybe if they made the PoG Class armor droppable and kept the Protectors in.... :confused: Its so rare to drop anyways.<br />
<br />
Now IMO, PoG will be used for Tunare raids ONLY. Maybe that is how it was originally intended. Now,not many group/groups will want to go to PoG because of the Protectors, Tunare Faction, rare armor drop rate, and slow experience compared to PoP. Druids, Rangers, and Paladins are pretty much excluded because no class armor drops for them anyways.<br />
<br />
But regardless it was a 'Fix' even if it took them over 9 months to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Honestly, I never knew PoG was even broken.  When i left a year and a half ago there were still the rare PoG raids being done but the zone for the most part was empty.  A week ago, a monk approached me to duo with him in PoG.  I told him there was no way we could duo it due to the protectors.  When I saw that the prots were broken but had been fixed i kicked myself repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Personally, i think PoG, and all the other old world planes need  a HUGE revamp.  SOE seems to forget that since plane of fear, hate, and sky were added they also added 15 more levels, and 5 with PoG.  Neither of those zones should be considered raid zones anymore, especially fear and hate.  I remember before kunark when they added PoSky that the loot there would make the current loot look like rusty weapons.  When it did come out it made rusty weapons look like planar loot compared to PoSky.<br />
<br />
I also think that the faction hits alone have made PoG a no no zone.  A cleric guildmate of mine went on a raid to PoG about 2 years ago.  In about 4 kills he became kos with not only the zone but with his home city and even his godess.  It must be really lonely knowing that not only do your own race hate you but your own diety as well.  He posted on the SOE and cleric message boards asking for help in regaining his faction with his own race, and 2 years later he is still as kos as he was when he left PoG.  When you become KoS with the elves you are kos for LIFE.  That in itself is good enough reason why no one hunts there.  The Protectors just add to the aggravation.  I would personally like to see them being taken out, or at least kept on a leash while SOE decides how to revamp the zone.</div></div><hr />
