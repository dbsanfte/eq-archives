<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">DISCLAIMER: If you don't like rants or whining, skip this - thanks.<br />
<br />
Should have probably put this in the grey, but wanted to have people think about it.<br />
<br />
Whoever decided to keep the fizzle active for trivial quest combines, you sir (or lady) are an IDIOT.<br />
<br />
Let's see:<br />
I spent 2 days to get tailoring above trivial (incl. buffer) for fifth shawl and another 3 days for getting the 80 (no typo - 80, go figure) components.<br />
<br />
With 115 trivial and 130 skill and a geerlok i should be above normal failures (136 or so calculated). But NO &quot;you lack the skill ...&quot; BLAH BLAH.<br />
<br />
Take this together with the week spent on first 4 shawls, that is a wasted total of 2 weeks of gametime for nothing, cause hell will freeze over, before i try this quest again.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong:<br />
- when i make an error and loose, no problem<br />
- when i try with low skill and loose, no problem.<br />
<br />
But when i wanted to gamble roulette or something, i would drive to Las Vegas, you gd $%&amp;$(&amp;(. How any designer with half a brain can think it is FUN to farm and farm for hours, days and weeks and then loose, because the &amp;/&amp;(&amp;/ RNG doesn't like you, is beyond me.<br />
<br />
So in summary for any designer reading this:<br />
GET A CLUE already after years of trying.<br />
<br />
For those fizzling for example at even later shawls, i can only try to imagine your pain ..., i really really pity you.<br />
<br />
For those realizing the obvious: yes, i am pissed it hit me this time, no need to state it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if it makes ya feel any better i failed the 6th shawl 8 times =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can certainly sympathize with you.  While I had no significant failures during all of the combines to get to where I am now with my shawls (simply waiting to do my Iceclad walk), I HAVE felt the pain of the ridiculous tradeskill system.  <br />
<br />
Always a 5% chance of failure no matter what the trivial OR what your skill level....BAH!  That is such crap.  I routinely fail upwards of 40% of the time making potions that are trivial to me.  How can they justify or explain this?  I cetainly hope they get this right with EQ2 especially with the advent of the Tradeskill class.  If the pain that is felt with regards to tradeskills in EQ is felt in EQ2 then I can only imagine what a major flop that game will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I feel your pain.  This quest is a pain in the ass, but the reward is oh so good.  Don't let the shawl win.  Pick up that thread and needle and give it another try.  Might as well get your skill up to 158 before you try again, though, since you're going to need it later on, anyways.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the 5th shawl is the most annoying.  It took me longer than any other shawl, and was the biggest pain in the ass.  Farming velks was more annoying even than farming geos for the 8th shawl, and then the glowing wurm bile part was just ass.  If you can pass this one, you're gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if it makes ya feel any better i failed the 6th shawl 8 times =D<br />
I failed the 6th one ten times :p  However gathering the components for that one only takes a few hours.  Failing the 5th or 7th shawl sucks, I hear you.  What combine exactly did you fail on?  You say 115 trivial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feeling a bit better, thanks  :( <br />
<br />
Was the final combine of 5th shawl combining shawl 4 and the 5 other bile combinations. According to eqtraders it's trivial 115 and in my experience that site is very accurate most times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me ask this;  I see you're level 65.  I assume you have Can V and torpor/Q.  Why spend all the time on Shawl when there are other items that are more useful to you that take the same time or less, such as the Spirit Wracked Cord.  Not only is this a better item, but you can move it from one slot to another when you get a better item.  I see Coldain Shawl as a cleric/druid kinda item....  Go to Droga! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Appreciate any hints, Finaljustice - even in my current mood ;) <br />
<br />
According to site info cord is a very rare item or a quest on chardok faction?<br />
<br />
What i was looking forward - no torpor/Q yet - about shawl was the buff extension (no other level IV extension item atm and rather looking for affliction efficiency actually) together with a FT3 bonus and the good stats. Sure cords HP-stats are far superior, but counting all plus/minus together i don't see the big advantage.<br />
<br />
Have to link magelo someday, as such things depend mostly on current gear of course imo.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it's a quest on Chardok faction...   This means killing a lot of Droga Goggos, more if you hunt Chardok.  The faction's a long, crappy business, but it's an item you'll ALWAYS wear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did the same thing you did Sharok.  158 tailoring with geerlok.  All that farming gone in a single click :( .  The only things that make it a bit more bearable are that I got one extra bile wurm on a run to Velks, and that with the extra Velk's farming, I should have more than enough velium to complete the 8th shawl armor.  And I will have Cann 5 shortly to speed my killing speed.<br />
<br />
I really think there is some RNG karma built into EQ.  I get a GM alchemy trophy(180 skill, 200+ triv) in one try, I fail the 5th shawl(158+5% skill, 115 triv).  Get 10 points of tailoring in 20 combines, get 0 points of pottery after 60 combines.  I hope I lose some rolls before I do more combines for the shawl, maybe that will balance things out enough :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I feel your pain  :( <br />
<br />
My guild mate also failed that combine.  And hes a pretty casual player so it took him forever to gather up the components again.  The biles are the biggest pain in the but to find imo &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The shawl is the probably best solo/1 groupable shoulder item you're ever going to see.  SWC is awesome, but there are no bracers/arms that come even close to the shawl.  So stick the swc in one of those slots, and the shawl on the shoulder.</div></div><hr />

They did address this at the last fan faire and said it was something they were looking into, but we all know what that means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah, what are you people talking about. I own a place that makes clothing, our workers only make 1 good shirt for every 200 shirts they make. They have been making them for 10 years now. 8 hours a day = 1 good shirt :-p<br />
<br />
I always thought the fizzle rates in EQ blow hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FJ is the typical impatient uberguilder.  Don't listen to him, stick with the shawl; you'll have a great item and a sense of accomplishment.  Don't be a l33t d00d.  FYI though, neither the shawl or EE3/4 items work on torpor / quiescence - only VT / ele planes loot does.  The shawl is 20% extension vs. 15% for EE items.  SWC is a great wrist item anyway, although with my particular setup I'll be putting it on my arms.  Just need the angry goblin now &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm a typical Uberguilder?  Damn, SOMEBODY screwed me on that ODS that I got sitting in my shoulder slot, then!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know this has been posted elsewhere, but it's a lot easier to find the glowing biles by waiting until nightfall and looking for the shardwurms that glow.  I found it easier if I used an external camera view and circled around 360 degrees while running a straight line from velks to the dorf caves.  I had the best luck on all three 5th shawls I've done looking for the wurms south of the caves, they're a lot easier to kill quickly and any of them can drop the bile.<br />
<br />
Hang in there - I found 5th to be way easier than 4th (even using pet trick I still always seem to get that **** death squad...) -- I feel for people that don't know how to use the pet, it must be pure misery for them!<br />
<br />
If you're planning on re-farming Velks threads I'd suggest doing it now.  On Test they're playing with expanded level ranges for 60+ characters to get experience in other zones (at 63 many of the Seb boks are dark blue again).  And the higher end spiders are dark blue again -- so Velks will be a 24/7 grindfest for 65 solos again once that ports to prod (though the new group exp bonus may actually discourage soloing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Let me ask this;  I see you're level 65.  I assume you have Can V and torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
Not all of us who are lvl 65 have even seen these spells yet.  I've seen torpor drop once in 4 years.  That friend of the officers who hardly played sure loved it.  Since I was the only shaman who showed for 90%+ of the raids, I felt I had to leave them shortly after.  I haven't even been able to win anything to turn in for spells yet, other than for a lvl 61-62 spell or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am really sorry to hear you fizzled on 5th shawl after getting beyond 95% success rate. The farming for the 5th shawl is outrageous and mindnumbing. Two camps with relatively rare drops on the same creatures again and again and again. <br />
<br />
Multiple fails on 6th shawl are common, since the combine for the shawl is over 200 skill. On the other hand, the camping is for 1 or 2 of several different items which are generally experience camps or do not take all that long. Manticore Manes, Frost Giant Beard, and even Drakkel Dire Wolf Whiskers have come pretty quickly. Siren Hairs are streaky--first two came easy, second two took a long time. While I have spent quite a bit of time getting components for 6th shawl, and have failed twice so far, I have not minded the camps. <br />
<br />
Finally, tradeskills and tradeskill quests are enormously difficult compared to other EQ tasks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tailoring to 158.<br />
<br />
Slaughter the young shardwurms south of the caves, it is not hard to gather a bunch of biles there.<br />
<br />
One o in lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The whole concept of the trivial failure code is assinine. There is no reason that I should fail at a combine when my skill is more than 100 points over the trivial.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah that definitely falls into the sucks category. I've had some very interesting fails in stuff but none that painful. When doing the shawls I failed one of the armor combines for the 8th. Go figure i was 250 skill smith + 15% skill mod item. Yet I didn't fail any of the other combines. Doing the 7th shawl I failed the first jc combine turning all the store bought components into rubble yet got all the harder combines using the rare components just fine.<br />
<br />
I sudder to think of how many blue diamonds I turned into nothing in various steps while doing cultural. That really hurt when they where 2k each before pop came out.<br />
<br />
The 8th shawl is definitely a bit of work to get but in the end it's a very nice peice of gear that most people will be wearing for a long time. I'm finally looking to replace mine but I used it well for a long time.<br />
<br />
O and more to the topic at hand my poor enchanter did that step 3 times =(. Failed the first combine at like ~110 skill. Failed the second at ~ 130 skill. Finally got the third but damm was i tired of velks and GD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would just like to say that finaljustice is completely off-base in calling the 8th shawl a druid/cleric item.  Like most people that say FT isn't very good for us, he doesn't actually have any (accidental ft2 doesnt count).  I'm at FT13, thanks to 8th shawl, ft3 boots, and some other raid goodies.  I have to say, I really love it.  I do sacrifice some HP on my boots and shoulders for those 6 FT, but I feel it is worth it.<br />
<br />
There are some times when you just do not have time to cannibalize.  Any raid where people are taking AE damage and you are blast healing / quiescencing people, you most likely do not have time to use canni4. I certainly dont.  In the time it takes me to cast canni4, I could have healed someone.  In situations like this, FT is golden, and helps you and your raid much much more than 50hp does.<br />
<br />
It isn't just raids where it helps.  Most of my soloing is done in tactics against ogres.  I keep blood of saryrn and breath of ulthor up constantly.  It takes me about 6 minutes to kill an ogre.  With ft13 and mc3, I regen 160 mana a minute.  In the 6 minutes it takes me to kill an ogre, my ft gives me back 960 mana, without me having to cast cannibalize.  With my grummus shield, that is at least 2 blood of saryrns.  That is nothing to scoff at, imho.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you, but I miss KEI when I don't have it.  I certainly do not need it to be function, and I most definately do not leave my group to run to nexus or any other such retardedness, but I do really love kei.  My FT is basically like a kei that stacks with kei.  That is really good, if you ask me.  Certainly better than a few HP.<br />
<br />
On top of the FT you get from the shawl, you also get a 20% buff extension.  That isn't a life-changing bonus, but it is really nice.  When a raid is over, shaman buffs are always the last to fade, thanks to SCRM and shawl.  In groups, I can keep ferine up on 4 people easily, and haste and regen last a good damn long time, so I don't have to recast them so much.<br />
<br />
As for the spirit wracked chord quest....<br />
<br />
That's up to you.  I am not an HP zealot like FJ and many other crucibal readers.  I enjoy having a high HP, but I have come to realize that mana and FT is a very important part of being a shaman.  The SWC does not have a single bit of mana on it.  100hp and some stamina is good.  I would gladly wear it in my arms or wrist slot... for now.  Right now, my arms and wrist slot sucks.  Sooner are later (very soon, most likely) I will be getting upgrades for all those slots that are at least 75hp/75mana.  Once that happens, SWC will be worthless to me.  100hp and aura of battle is nice, but not having any mana at all sucks.<br />
<br />
The SWC quest itself is pretty hard, but the faction work is just plain brutal, especially for a shaman.  We aren't very good at killing greenies.  All that work for something without any mana at all just isn't worth it to me.  I would wear it for now, but I would upgrade it too soon.  If you aren't in a raiding guild and will probably never have a raid obtained item in those slots, it might be worth it for you.  Not for me, though.</div></div><hr />

I like FJ and definately respect his opinion.  However, in this case, I thought he was wrong.  I didn't say anything bad about him, I just said I felt he was wrong /shrug<br />

Whoever called him an impatient uberguilder is funny, though :)  Anyone that does the SWC is definately not impatient, and by the looks his magelo, his guild is exactly where I am:  Just starting VT.  That's not uber.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">the longest, crappiest quest in the game<br />
I enjoyed the quest, to each his own I guess...  Its too bad that you can't understand the concept that others may not feel the same way you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's actually possible to disagree with someone without climbing on the fence and starting yelling  ;) Something that is often enough forgotten, even on this fine board. Just a sidenote. Edit to be more clear: that's not directed to Jinhelm here - just a general remark.<br />
<br />
Call me crazy, but generally i like the concept and realisation of the shawl quests a lot. It has a nice (imo) storyline, some well written sub quests with many details. For example i really enjoyed part 3 with the cooking and part 4 with rescuing the brave scout.<br />
<br />
I just find it quite sad, that this is coupled with a insane risk vs reward (or in this case effort vs reward) concept, the usual timesink philosophy and this spiced up with some lottery game.<br />
<br />
I like quests with:<br />
- good storyline and background<br />
- maybe some riddle to solve<br />
- a more or less difficult task to fulfill<br />
  (a hint for designer: collecting crap_item_01 183 times is NO task, it's an insult to every intelligent person)<br />
- a reward, when the task is done. No if, no when - just hand me over my gd price, thanks.<br />
  (additional hint for designer: the reward should fit the necessary efforts and/or risk/danger,<br />
   i know, this is shocking news for EQ designers, so hopefully i could help a bit ....).<br />
<br />
If you couldn't guess  ;)  - i am still pissed. But i think, i will take some months and do some XP grind or something completely different and come back (very) later to this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The road to master the tradeskills may be long but it can be fun. All it takes is a plan. The Shawl quest is not the problem, it is the trivial failure code that is the debil. Why should a smith with skill of 200 fail 5% of the time at making metal bits. In fact, what is the point of the trivial number in the first place. It does not seem to indicate anything other than you can't learn anything from practicing the skill but wouldn't still failing 40% of the time indicate more practice and learning is needed? My suggestion is that everyone feedback SOE daily until they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>HermanaCruzadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree that the failures are annoying...I failed several times on my Alchemy Trophy as well, which really annoyed me with a max skill and a philosopher's stone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, Finaljustice may not like the shawl quest, but it's also a nice precursor to the earring quest.  I just finished it last week.  Lot of work, but god, it's a sweet earring.  Requires 220 skill MINIMUM before mods to get Gimel to talk to you about each part of the quest.  Takes all 7 tradeskills--smithing, jewelcraft, pottery, tailoring, fletching, baking, and brewing.  I'd STRONGLY recommend 240 (240+5% mod = 252) in fletching and tailoring.  I went ahead and got 240 in everything but pottery (222).<br />
<br />
The result--<br />

<br />
I failed the tailoring combine 4 times.  Each combine takes 3 saps, which are rare drop.  I once spent 18 hours camping with not a single sap.  So believe me, I feel your pain on failing combines. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you look at the Coldain Shawl quest, I still don't think it's worth the herculean effort required to raise all the TS's to the right level.  I applaud them for creating the Aid Grimel quest, to require you to put some more effort and come up with a GOD-LIKE item.  TS's are often time- and money-sinks and completely underappreciated, it's good to see proper reward for effort (plus the 0wt bags from GM items are great too!)</div></div><hr />

My question is,<br />

&quot;How would you know if you have never done tradeskills?&quot;<br />
<br />
I checked your magelo and you've listed the other skills you have mastered.  I dont see one that is tradeskill related.<br />

Im having a blast doing the quest as well as raising my tradeskills at the same time.  Just because you THINK its pain in the arse doesnt make it so for all.<br />

&quot;How would you know if you have never done tradeskills?&quot;<br />
<br />
I checked your magelo and you've listed the other skills you have mastered.  I dont see one that is tradeskill related.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im having a blast doing the quest as well as raising my tradeskills at the same time.  Just because you THINK its pain in the arse doesnt make it so for all.<br />

/boggle<br />
you REALLY think that all my TS's are at 0?  And yes, I've done the quest to the 5th shawl.  I've never updated my TS's in Magelo, because I didn't think it vital.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand why I'm being vilified because I have a different opinion.  My response to your last sentence is:  just because you had a blast doing the quest, why would you think I had to have one too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">2 weeks?  That's it?<br />
<br />
Geez, it took me 3 months to finish that thing.  Started the first shawl at level 54, and was 60 by the time I was ready for my 8th shawl final battle.  Mind you, I solo'd everything up to the last battle, except for the runed shell in SG.  But don't get too frustrated about 2 weeks, it's still a long road from there.  <br />
<br />
Also, SWC are a very nice item, especially when used TOGETHER with the 8th shawl.  I'm currently on a questing mission that, hopefully, will see me nab my SWC, 10th Ring, and Garzicor earring in the next couple months.  Put those together with an 8th shawl and an epic, it makes for a pretty nice accomplishment journal.  <br />
<br />
I'm a quest junkie, though  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Actually, based on the information you provided in your magelo,  I assumed you had no prior experience with tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Though I dont think you are being vilified, you've placed yourself in the minority by stating that;<br />
<br />
a) SWC is a better item than 8th Shawl.<br />
b) calling it the longest and crappiest quest in game (without having completed it)<br />
c) saying it requires a herculean effort<br />
<br />
The majority seem to disagree.<br />
<br />
Again referring to your magelo, you havent done the SWC either (unless my assumption is wrong and you value your wolf caller's bracer over the SWC).<br />
<br />
Conclusion, I dont think many value your opinion on the matter based on your lack of experience with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well, Finaljustice may not like the shawl quest, but it's also a nice precursor to the earring quest.  I just finished it last week.  Lot of work, but god, it's a sweet earring.  Requires 220 skill MINIMUM before mods to get Gimel to talk to you about each part of the quest.  Takes all 7 tradeskills--smithing, jewelcraft, pottery, tailoring, fletching, baking, and brewing.  I'd STRONGLY recommend 240 (240+5% mod = 252) in fletching and tailoring.  I went ahead and got 240 in everything but pottery (222).<br />
<br />
The result--<br />
<br />
Signet of the Arcane<br />
+25 AC +25 Str +25 Sta +25 Agi +25 Dex +25 Wis +25 Int +15 vsMg +15 vsFire +15 vsCold +15 vsPos +15 vsDis +130 HP +150 Mana +1.50 Wt<br />
Effects: FT3 and Preservation of Xegony.<br />
<br />
I failed the tailoring combine 4 times.  Each combine takes 3 saps, which are rare drop.  I once spent 18 hours camping with not a single sap.  So believe me, I feel your pain on failing combines. :(<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen that is the mother of all quests. 18aa points, unthinkable numbers of combines, rediculously rare drops and the ability to fail almost any of the combines. Not to mention the massive flagging requirements. This is by far the longest and most difficult quest in the game to date. Thank god i'm almost done with it =)<br />
<br />
As far as the shawl goes it's a very nice peice. A good amount of ft, which never hurts, a good focus effect and nice enough stats all around. The cords definitely do have more hps which is nice and AoB for regen never hurt but it also has 2 other slots (3 if you want to count each bracer slot seperate) that it can go in besides shoulders. Odds are the 8th shawl is better than what your currently using in one of those other slots. So shawl on the shoulders and cords in that slot = best option.<br />
<br />
As far as the ft goes ft isn't a bad thing thats for sure. Currently maxed in ft personally but for shaman I don't think it's worth sacrificing other stats for. If you are burning mana so fast that you can't stop to cann you'd be better off with a bigger mana pool than a couple points at best of mana regen. Personally I'd never wear and never did wear slime boots, bot belt, CT ft necklace or a variety of other simular items. That doesn't mean ft is worthless or that I'd avoid ft items. I'm still wearing my 8th shawl. I wore white dragon scale boots till i upgraded them to emp slippers.<br />
<br />
My test has always been are the stats good enough otherwise that I would at least consider wearing the item if it didn't have ft or wear it with out FT at all. Which is where the bot belt, slime boots and ct necklace fail. I wouldn't touch any of them if they didn't have ft on them so the ft alone isn't enough to make me interested in them. 8th shawl on the other hand has descent saves, descent hps/mana on it and a nice focus effect. So i'd definitely have considered wearing it with out the ft on it and probably would have over my granite spaulders with out the ft on it. The FT is just a bit extra to push it over the top or the icing on the cake so to speak.<br />
<br />
I don't currently wear any ft items that I wouldn't be wearing otherwise yet I'm still at ft 17 and thats probably going to go up even further. Eventually ft is common place on items and you just end up with a fair amount of it with out really having to try. Till then sure pick up some of the nice ones like the 8th shawl but i'd stay clear of the just ft items like slime boots and such. Shaman can do just fine with out em.</div></div><hr />

 7) Tradeskills <br />
<br />
We will be looking at the chance of failure for tradeskill recipes. We are aware of the concerns of trades folk in EverQuest, and it is on our schedule to review things such as the fact that masters of trade skills can fail the easiest recipes. That doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to change it, but we will most certainly look it over - and probably will change it :) . <br />

And as or JINHIEM!  Boy howdy... you're in the wrong message board, bro.  Shamen are a MELEE class, screw ft.  You need only a great 2hb, Rabid Bear, Hastened Rabidity, some HP and AC and you beat the game!<br />

BTW... we all hate anyone with wisdom higher than STA... even the tradeskillers. So you better invest those AA's in Innate Sta.<br />

The kinds of shaman that get off knowing they have more HP than the tank of their group ;).<br />

He was making coffee one morning and didn't get the basket with the coffee grounds closed tightly enough and made a pot of coffee all over the counter and floor, with grounds everywhere.<br />

Something I find funny is that many drumans actually end up with less mana than shamans who have a focus on hitpoints.  Their 20wis gear has no direct mana on it ;)  I tradeskill as well; I have a relatively cheap druman outfit in the bank for tradeskilling, although I try not to get inspected while wearing it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the Royal Kromrif Blood solo'able, and where exactly in Kael does that drop?  I'm guessing it was on one of the giants down in the Tormax area beyond the icebridge leading into his throneroom?<br />
<br />
The problem I have there, is those giants up in the alcove rooms just past that icebridge.   It's been so long since I've been in there I don't remember there names, but there's one that drops Cloak of the Maelstorm that's really annoying, and I'm not sure I could solo him, even with torpor.<br />
<br />
If memory serves, the others that give Dain faction hits beyond him are just as bad.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which - I was absolute rock-bottom Dain faction (killed him several times), before moving to Maelin Starpyre and deciding to start this quest.  I'm currently warmly again to Coldain, and have just finished my 5th shawl, but Dain's still scowling -- any ideas?<br />
<br />
I have a few friends that moved to Maelin with me, but as yet I haven't joined a guild there, let alone a Tormax capable guild, so he's not an option for now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Okotona I hate to say it but this HP/ac thing isn't just pulled out of the asses of the shamans here. It's how it has to be done if you plan to get your shaman anywhere. Even when you are in exp groups in PoP, when you hit 65 you're going to be slowing stuff that hits in the range of 600-700. When you get a resist, that mob wont give a rats ass what your mana pool is, much less what your wisdom is.<br />
<br />
letting the tank build up aggro? not a chance, the few times I kick back and slow lackadaisically I get scolded by party members. They expect me to get hit, they expect me right up there with the melees slowing the instant it is pulled and taking damage so the load on the cleric is easier. Thats my job. And like I said, neither my party members, the mob, or even me care what my mana pool or wisdom are. They just want me to be able to take the hits from a resist and not have to CR</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Yup, and I slow early enough to where I get hit/aggro every pull. I like showing off a shaman's ability to take aggro. <br />
<br />
There is a certain balance to be achieved, imo. I like having enough mana to solo PoV fiends and what not, with only my crappy BoN, E-bolt, and epic dots ;). I also love being able to take a few hits from 2nd/3rd tier mobs.<br />
<br />
I won't be one of the shamen with 355 Wis anytime soon, and I won't be one with 150 Wis and 1200 AC either.<br />
