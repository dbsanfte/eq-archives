<br />
hard to be conlusive with archery dmg being so variable but its really nice, plus has new graphic. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venture</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on one Mujaki attempt, which failed.  I don't know much, but here's what I saw.<br />
<br />
It is one of the scripted encounters in Nightmare, started by Etumer (you can read the story in a series of books in the Library).  You get to bring four groups into a large courtyard with some graves in it.  &quot;Servants of Mujaki&quot; start coming out of the graves and walking to an untargettable Mujaki, where they mount horses.  <br />
<br />
Our force split in two and tried to kill as many Servants as possible before they reached their mounts.  The Servants didn't seem to be all that tough (blue to 61) but there are a LOT of them: 36 total, and they start coming out of the graves two at a time eventually.  The plan was for each group to pull the Servants coming out of one of the three graves, leaving the third one alone.  Unfortunately the second team did not understand this and tried pulling the third grave as well, which caused them to wipe out.  Both sides had to stop pulling to recover, and the end result was 24 Servants made it through.<br />
<br />
At that point Mujaki and the Servants respawned as targettable versions.   Our Monks went out and tried to split him, but we ended up with Mujaki and at least half a dozen Servants stampeding into camp.  I was trampled instantly, and the raid wiped out shortly thereafter.  I did hear someone say in /rsay that Mujaki had been slowed; no idea if that was true or not.  In the short barrage I took, the top hit from a Servant was 473, and Mujaki himself hit for 871.  No idea how many hit points they have.<br />
<br />
It looks like an interesting encounter.  I would guess the key is having enough DPS to kill all the Servants before they mount up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If PoP ends up being like all of the other expansions, they'll end up pulling the drop rate of this thing down to nonexistant soon.  Like lots of folks have said, they may not based on the level of the mobs involved, but still.....<br />
<br />
Anyone out there successfully pulled off this fight and won the bow that wants to talk about the general scenario?  I'm going to be begging and pleading with my guild to help go after this sucker, but I can use all the info  possible before I go get us all killed repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have all the info you need 2 posts up.  Most of the fun in a new expansion is trying and learning new things, and with this expansion wiping out means a 15 minute wait instead of an involved CR :)<br />
<br />
So far the events in this expansion have been as fun or better than the 10th ring war, I'm loving it.  <br />
<br />
As far as this bow getting nerfed, I doubt it.  Mujaki is a reasonable encounter for the rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is event is pretty fun, although my group was partially wiped out.   We had one of our spare raid groups come help us out while we picked up.<br />
<br />
You just need to kill the servants before they approach the platform.     The key is also to arrange groups, make sure they're pretty independant.<br />

Horsemen = the suck<br />
<br />
Once you have finished th waves, and didnt let any servants get through.   You have yourself a solo Mujaki who isn't too hard, flurries, hits for 700's, AE fear.   Nothing too hard if you've ever touched Ntov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malvesti</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we tried this, there were actually several horses in the courtyard area.  They were 62 or 63.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to clear them out of the CY before triggering Etumer?  Or are they also part of the servant spawns?<br />
<br />
And, anyone have a map site for PON?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
