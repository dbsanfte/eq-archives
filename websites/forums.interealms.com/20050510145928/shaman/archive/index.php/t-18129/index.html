<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tasbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I plan to take my guild to try manaetic prototypes.<br />
I need some info for these mobs please.<br />
<br />
I searched net and didnt managed to find where can i find them in the factory. Which way to go in factory to find them?<br />
<br />
There are 3 prototypes: IX,X,XI. Does it means a difficulty rank? IX easier than X easier than XI?<br />
How easier they are compared to Xanamech?<br />
<br />
Thanks to post all tips for these mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Once entering factory go straight forward and you get to a cross-section. Prototypes are in 3 separate rooms linked to this cross-section. I think all Prototypes can banish their main target into one of the 2 other rooms. And all Prototypes have AE spells. 800dmg dd AE or something.<br />
<br />
Prototypes can drop a nice shoulder item with beneficial haste. I am still using that shoulder item, and our guild has killed Quarm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They're really easy to get to...  In the factory, you'll first enter a big room with a gnome.  Straight ahead (south) is a hall with Clockwork Golems.  you need to clear into there, and then the golems are in 3 rooms there - one to the east, west, and south.<br />
<br />
I haven't really noticed much difference in difficulty between the three.  They all banish, so be prepared to go through a few thanks. ;)<br />
<br />
Can't comment on difficulty vs Xanamech, as I've never fought him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The above description of their locations is correct.<br />
<br />
I have been on a few Proto raids and as far as i know they don't get any harder, they are just labelled that way.<br />
<br />
They have an AE which you can get the details of on Ala's and some info<br />
<br />
Manaetic Prototype IX  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10253) <br />
Manaetic Prototype X  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10254) <br />
Manaetic Prototype XI  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10255) <br />
<br />
Their AE is a DOT i think, nothing to worry about really if your raid buffed.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that your MT will get banished into the room of another Proto. That MT must not try and run back to find the raid or you will train and all die, he must die. We usually send a Monk to go fetch the corpse and res, rebuff before moving on.<br />
<br />
You never said what level your guild/raid force is and how well equipped you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a very good point about the MT not trying to get back.  Both for the obvious reason of him training you, and because I've also seen it where if the MT gets close enough to the one you're fighting, it'll run out of the room to attack him, and when it does that, more often than not it poofs back to the center with full HP.  Not fun.  Anyone who gets banished just needs to die in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">use pets<br />
<br />
It is by far the eaises way to kill them.  Our guild has been farming them once a week now and we use every and all pets we can.. .. yes even the the druids get thier little bears out.  <br />
<br />
Our poor melee just stand there and pluck arrows, and some times we let them hit it...   I have yet to be able to slow them even after Malos/malosinia.  It is not a big deal they die pretty quick anyway.<br />
<br />
These aslo drop a very nice IH4 item and as mentioned befor a very nice spell haste shoulder item.<br />
<br />
These are a walk in the park compared to Xanamech..  Hardly ever lose a person to these guys and hardley ever a pet either...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tasbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all for these advices.<br />
<br />
Our guild raid team is about 4 groups composed 2 level 65, 1 group 60+ and 1 group 55+.<br />
<br />
We use to kill DS, Zelnithak, farming HOT (a lot!!), did Vindic (once or 2- wish we could do more), Servitor (so easy that we abuse of him....), and Telko.<br />
Completed many epics.<br />
<br />
Wiped on Trial PONb (lacked of enchanter this night - was 3rd or 4th wave)<br />
Wiped on our 1st try on Xanamech (hope we ll manage soon to take our revenge !!)<br />
<br />
We plan mini-bosses in BoT tower, Xana, PoNb, RC, Velk, Vindic (more), and Vakshiz.<br />
<br />
Never gone to NTOV from now. Maybe we should add Aerin and Rag 1/2 in SSRA. Klandi and Zandli maybe too, but do their loots worth it really if we skip VT keys?<br />
<br />
And i like to add those Proto for their interesting loots that should upgrade many of our guildies stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I really should have paid more attention but we used kill them out of order so only the first banishing sent that person to a spawned room. Think we did X, IX then XI. And we usually had a SK tanking until banishment so she could FD and not have to be rebuffed. Then she'd just sit in the next room and wait for us. <br />
<br />
They're super easy compared to Xanamech. The only reason we would ever lose people (beyond the banished) was because of human stupidity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never found them easily slowable, but they are all turgur slowable, and like most mobs they get significantly easier after the first couple of runs.  We had a pattern we did as well, so after the first kill, the person would be banished to an emtpy room, just pay attention and record what happened so you know for your next run.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the deal on agro is as I was never banished, but several times, the main tank showed back up after running out of the other room, with no adds, maybe we just did a great job clearing.  The AE is a pita for melee since it snares.  Protos are definitely a great target for all healers in the guild, every one of them needs a proto hat and shoulder item.<br />
<br />
Using just pets on them sounds a little too protective, they arent that tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've even ended up tanking them once or twice after a few melee's got banished. I personally find them to be a real blast. Only thing that sucks is getting 4 of the damn ENC only drops in one night out of the 6 drops total. Think that happened to us 2 or 3 times. <br />
<br />
The shoulder is the best drop and seems to be the rarest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thought the enc only wand dropped every time off every proto.  I might be mistaken but several times we've had no enc that needed so theyrotted/got destroyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">we were lucky enough to get either the ih4 helm or shoulders at least on each one. On our last run all 3 dropped a hat and shoulder each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damn, that is luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">These guys are fun. Got the shoulders, my guild disbanded before i could get the helm. Would really love to get a helm for him though.</div></div><hr />
