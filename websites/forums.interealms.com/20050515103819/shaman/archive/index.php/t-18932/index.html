Yesterdays news :D<br />
But seriously...after all this time, I wouldn't consider 12 more mana for 30 more hps much of an upgrade.  I was thinking more along the lines of 400 hps 200 mana...that would be a real upgrade imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Basically it looks like they want to give an &quot;upgrade&quot; to canniballize 4 that is the same level, and has a worse conversion ratio.  Basically it takes ~30 more hp and gives ~12 more mana (subject to change in subsequent updates).  They're slightly off base with this &quot;upgrade&quot; and in no way should this be our new &quot;Ancient&quot; spell if they're giving every class a new one... Most caster classes are getting an upgraded nuke (1300-1800ish damage range on them), paladins look to be getting the shaft with a new Brell's line of spells that gives 80 LESS hp than BSS.  Necros are looking to get an even NICER leach spell which gives 60 mana for 76hp every tic.  Rangers will be getting a SMALL upgrade to SoT (12atk and like 25hp, whoop de frickin do).  Hell, they are looking to add over 500hp to strike of solusek on the wizard ancient, pushing it to 3288 damage.  SKs are getting the shaft also by adding 40 damage to an ancient Z's bite, yet not adding any hp or mana to the recourse.  Beastmaters are getting a small upgrade to their Spiritual vigor adding a few hp and minimal atk.<br />
<br />
Basically if you're not getting an nuke with these &quot;ancient&quot; spells, you're getting the shaft.<br />
<br />
p.s.  I like this fast cast slow they want to add with GoD, would be nice being dis based but cannot complain... will be nice when I get my dream weapon and don't need to worry bout loading Turgur's anymore.  Basically I will be keeping this loaded instead of malos (which I seldom bother even casting) in exp groups.</div></div><hr />

That's HIGHER than Canni III and we know how often that fizzles compared to IV. I'm going to guess this isn't going to get you mana back any faster than Cann IV on average.

<br />
wow, i can cast quin all day and not even need to use any canni, natural regen keeps it up, now the quick heal that drains alot, but quin is nothing.<br />
i heal groups in easy ldon with quin and odd quick or 2k heal, and slow, and if target not nearly dead once done this bane it, and i only need to use canni 5 to keep mana nearly full. course i have enc buffs up and sometime beast too, and a self 3mana/tick buff, but no ft.<br />
i never said i dont use it, i said hardly ever need to. but as pointed out this &quot;upgrade&quot; at the moment isnt really one. and i just thought whats the point of a new one when i done use it that much and the one we have is fine. (though if they made it 400hp for 300 mana then maybe)<br />
<br />
however, back to point at popu say i normally wait and see but these spells they giving at the moment lack thought and dont seem to be things we really need, hence my origonal post.</div></div><hr />

I have never memed a canni spell since the instant I got Cani5.<br />
<br />
I never run out of mana, unless I chain cast Tnargg's with BoR (with no spell haste it takes alot longer and I don't run out).<br />
<br />
I really couldn't justify spending the time during a fight casting Canni4 when I could be doing something to help the figth (top off group members, nuke, etc).</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
That is an appropriate strategy for a bot, which is one of the reasons that bot shamans suck so hard, but your laziness is causing you to miss out on about 1/2 of your potential mana regen.<br />
<br />
Don't know about you, but I can ALWAYS use more mana, even if it gets burned with a low damage/efficiency nuke.<br />
<br />
Just remember: a well-played shaman will generally be casting almost non-stop. Stop casting, and you might as well be another druid sitting on his ass waiting on that blue bar.</div></div><hr />

Re-read the posts. We were debating using canni4 between canni5, not staying FM w/o using canni5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has gotta just be a placeholder stat.  I mean...it's worse than canni 4 in all respects...it'd make no sense to add.<br />
<br />
I second the call for a 400 hp(maybe increase the mana ratio so it'd be like 280mana or so...look at the god damn lich line at 65 for necros*) canni with similar casting stats to canni 4.<br />

BoR + spell haste IV!  Don't leave home without it.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well i dont know where you find time to do all  that you say you do, i agree with Kaeth and Gruog,  most groups i go with kill mobs in a quick time, cdertain less than 1 mintue for the harder stuff and 30 sec for easy ldon. if i cast bane which if 30 sec duration it wears off just as mobs dies or not atall even on hard.<br />
<br />
malo is 5 sec (good to cast on harder mobs) slow is 3 sec  also rem they you got the time for gems to come back in that time too, after this mob already alast 1/3 dead  also assumeing not resist.<br />
then tank need a quin 6 sec cast so you used  15 sec already  you nuke ? that 8 secs, mob nearly dead next mob inc slow that? and you canni 4 too? 2.5 sec plus gem reset time? <br />
<br />
now bor helps but it only reduces 10%  which on say 30 secs is  3 sec  total time saved , that is half a nuke or 1 canni. but as you not a computer it unlikely that you react fast enough to use all that 3 sec yu can of course have a focus effect too but that does add much more maybe a second or 2. and when you killing stuff quick it still dont leave you time to do much.<br />
<br />
with the groups i get i just dont have time to canni4 , which why canni 5 so good. because by the time i slow (and maloed depending on situation) drop heal if healing , or some damage if not, the next mob is here rinse repeat. as it is i can keep mana bar up to about 80% with canni5 unless something like loads of pulls etc and i need to use quick heal, if this happens i will justdebuff and slow  and wait till mana get up again. but useuall dot are out the question it just wasting mana for very little damage as mob dead before the dot does a tick or 2.  and nuke then is better. <br />
<br />
which made me realise what it is we need, not bigger better dots , but quicker cast recast dots and faster acting but same damage.. maybe a faster canni would help? one that take .5 sec to cast and recover be more useful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I really couldn't justify spending the time during a fight casting Canni4 when I could be doing something to help the figth (top off group members, nuke, etc).<br />
I didn't actually mean I am clicking canni 4 at the beginning or middle of a fight, its more like: slow, cast Q on whoever, back up...Rain, Rain(or VS/SoT)...canni canni canni, or more canni depending on any resisted spells that I have to make up for by casting again.  I would really like to know how plausible it is to do a fast paced ldon without ever having to use canni 4.  And what natural regen are you referring to when you talk about it covering the cost of Q?  FT15 is only 150 mana per minute, you can't use a horse and I generally have VoQ up as well.  Also, in almost all cases, by the time Canni V refreshes, I am missing roughly 25% of my mana bar..slightly more than what Canni V would cover...and this was after all the canni 4.<br />
<br />
That is odd because the only nuke I use has such a long cast time I rarely have time for canni 4 :P<br />
I agree..VS is so slow that if you cast it a second time, you will almost regain all the mana it took to cast your first one before the second hits.  And that's with spell haste and bor/aor.  The thing is though, if you want to do fast damage, you are going to rain once and then SoT once or twice, just depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Don't know about you, but I can ALWAYS use more mana, even if it gets burned with a low damage/efficiency nuke.<br />
<br />

<br />
When I am put as curer/healer in a cleric group I have have to wait for the stuff to hit them and then my mana goes down fast. And I can not waste the time to can IV so i push the Can V button and go again.<br />
So A bigger Can V would be more then welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have have to wait for the stuff to hit them and then my mana goes down fast.<br />
I'm confused as why you aren't using canni 4 between the &quot;waiting&quot;....<br />
Also your situation looks differen't, it sounds to me like you are talking about a Time or LDON raid encounter, not an xp group or LDON adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Also your situation looks differen't, it sounds to me like you are talking about a Time or LDON raid encounter, not an xp group or LDON adventure.<br />
<br />
True it is a raid situation. <br />
<br />
Xp groups I am always FM.<br />
Cast bane and pull, run up and down, repeat.<br />
The mana spend is back by then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">it was mainly for exp group i thinking though usefull spells for group would help raids too, and sure in raids on named i will burn most my mana bar and then if need to get fm quick canni would be used while waiting for new canni 5.<br />
<br />
however, i must say that the orignal thread has now kinda been lost which is that the spells as they stand arnt good enough to use. sure if they gave a canni 6 that did 400 hp to give 200 to 300 mana it might be more useful, or  a similar canni but with very quick cast/recast. <br />
<br />
and at the end of the day if i could find time to cast canni i probably would. and well played shaman styles will vary. i tend not to cast more than 1 damage spell per mob mainly cos by the time i do cast it the mob is dead or nearly dead. sometimes i dont even do that cause i had to slow ..especially in easy 3 or 4 mobs that pulled, i usualy manage to dot the last 2 or 3 though depending how quick they die. in an exp group, <br />
in a raid i be casting dots rains and dd.. being careful not to over agro which asy with 4 dots going:)<br />
<br />
i would say their nothing wrong with the style you play, i just find it hard to cast canni too much cause of the speed things are played at in an exp group.<br />
<br />
but the point is none the new spells are really worth getting in there current forms and different spells which dont over power but would be just as usefull are easily come up with just see all the other threads poeple come up with all sort of ideas..<br />
<br />
one i like was rabid bear turning out pets into a rabid bear and becomeing much muich better pets for a short period , abit like spirit call ie for 60 sec and reuse 15 mins or so.<br />
new dots like bane ie 30 sec max. new dd poison. or a new curse type dd?<br />
a new pet at 65 to make use of new pet aa?<br />
better quin, or group versions of heals?<br />
and mainly faster casting, and for dots faster acting ,versions of spells we have.<br />
<br />
but this is just my point of veiw that the spell as stand arnt great at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Xp groups I am always FM.<br />
Cast bane and pull, run up and down, repeat.<br />
The mana spend is back by then<br />
In EP xp groups I a) malos/slow b) cast bane c) help heal d) nuke<br />
In Ldon groups I a) slow b) do not cast bane, because it's still too slow and isn't good on multiple mobs c) help heal d) nuke<br />
On raids I a) malos/slow b) help heal c) buff/rebuff d)VS/SoT/Tears trash mobs<br />
e) malos/slow, heal, buff/rebuff,ultor, pox, bane, tears, torrent on bosses<br />
<br />
You must have some AA and gear that I've never heard of that reduces the cost of each spell by approximately 75% mana if you always have so much to spend.  Then again TA saves you 250 mana each mob (counting resists)...and that adds up to a lot.  Did you always have as much mana before TA?<br />
<br />
 but as you not a computer it unlikely that you react fast enough to use all that 3 sec yu can of course have a focus effect too but that does add much more maybe a second or 2. and when you killing stuff quick it still dont leave you time to do much.<br />
<br />
with the groups i get i just dont have time to canni4 , which why canni 5 so good. because by the time i slow (and maloed depending on situation) drop heal if healing , or some damage if not, the next mob is here rinse repeat.<br />
It takes less than 45 sec on average to kill a mob with just about any group..pick up or guild.  It only takes me 2.2 seconds to slow....then I have 2.25 refresh..  Cast a 3 second Q...2.25 refresh...cast Tears..4.5 sec...2.25 refresh ...I have plenty of time to get another nuke and a few canni's off before the next mob.  And yes, I am constantly watching my spell gems and I am constantly clicking, almost like a bard.  It really &quot;seems&quot; like some of you are of the mentality &quot;I'm a shaman, my job is to slow and if I really have to, heal..and on occasion nuke if we have more than 60 seconds left.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yeah, this thread was somewhat derailed from the origional topic, but my concerns were about the need of a better canni(4) upgrade than the one they are showing so far...that in turn led to &quot;w-t-f who uses anything but the AA anymore? Omgz n00b!&quot; (More or less)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Seems the discussion on cann stratifies the way the rest of our arguments seem to.  The top people have plenty of mana, the rest dont.  Even those who aren't all that far from the high end could use more. Thats where the value of another cann is, for the less than uber folks.  A slightly higher ratio and a (hopefully much) larger hp cost would be wonderful for those folks, like me, who must cann constantly to maintain mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">better ways to get mana is always good, and the whole canni or not is a red herring.<br />
<br />
outta the spells i see the new canni is possible the best idea, but there are so many other things that could have been done.but if you havent got the canni 5 aa then obviously a new canni will be good for you. to be honest i more concern about 2 new slows which arnt very good.<br />
<br />
hopefully the new canni and slow will change to be higher hp/mana and just a single slow that is 75% but casts much quicker and less resisted. then these would be ok spells . with a 3rd spell perhaps and new pet or an attack/skill helper for mellee buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Alot of people seem to think if you're not canni4ing, you arent doing much in your groups.  I can personally chain rain/nuke throughout most fights with just canniAA.  I rarely mem canni4, more often that not, it's a detriment to me as I might need to throw in a fast heal.  <br />
<br />
Everyone has different gear and such.  Certainly alot of people out there with better and worse than mine but in exp groups I can malos, slow, chain rain/nuke and CC without ever running low on mana in most cases.  But to each his/her own.<br />
<br />
If the canni they have atm is added to the game, I won't be using it often at all, some of you may.   I would definately use a canni with the same cast/reuse time as canni 4 that was a reasonable upgrade to what we have now, like 100 more hp/40-50 more mana but not this one.</div></div><hr />

Makes a lot of sense to me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I find it amusing how some of the better geared shaman argue that FT(15) is just as important for a shaman as it is for every other casting class...yet also argue about the usefullness of canni..which is essentially FT 60 (when you include regeneration and healing costs).  Makes a lot of sense to me.<br />

I have FT 9 + MC3 + Can5, and in guild groups I usually have (at least) KEI, Nine, and Domination, and am often grouped with a necro who will be casting mind wrack (300 mana tap) and the group lifetap (that spell rocks), and I still manage to hover between 50-70ish mana.  But then, I am the main slower/malo'er and I consider it a personal mission to nuke each mob at least twice before its dead.<br />
<br />
There are some classes that are limited more by aggro shedding ability than mana regen (e.g. really high-end wizzies), but the shaman is not among them.  There is ALWAYS something more that I could be casting if I had the mana.<br />

On the 300 hp for 175 spell, remember that it would only be cast once, which does make it better.  Its not a huge margin, but the cast/recast on Can4 are the main limitations as it is, and this suggested spell would deal with that.</div></div><hr />

This is a slightly better ratio than the origional suggestion, but over time you still get less mana than you do with the current canni 4.  You don't have to click as much, but you get what you click for I guess.</div></div><hr />
