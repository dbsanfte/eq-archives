<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">here is my experience in soloing and the never ending hunt for some good killing grounds.<br />
<br />
XP mostly:<br />
PoJ was my most hunted area for solo 57-65 for reg and aa xp.  Post 57 the rats and sentries dont add anymore.  Sentries/goalers are good aa even at 65 if you only have a few mins to kill before a raid or something.  You can even make a few pp doin it cause sentries/goalers drop diamonds sometimes.  NOTE: You can not use your dog till new one at 61 i think it is, because your puppy IS below 57 and WILL get adds on you, Pre new pet use good ol fashioned root/rot.<br />
<br />
PoN is decent too on the hedge side near the OZ.  Nettlings and Vexed banchies (think that is what they are called) arent that bad.  Can be a lil mana draining if they resist too much (undead banchies dont do well with our poison/disease DoTs, so dog-dog and epic/nukes will be a good chunk of dmg.)<br />
<br />
Loot(pp mostly)/not so bad XP:<br />
<br />
Acrylia Cavers, innner area isnt bad.  Dont have a whole lot of experience in the inner area, mostly camp IZ area for Acrylia chain stuff and PP.<br />

<br />
Tenebrous Mts (TM) ROCK imho.  The vamp castle is decent xp, and good PP farming (or equip for a lower lvl twink maybe).  A few things that sell very well in bazaar drop there too, like some katar that sells for about 5k. To SEE the vamps you MUST have SEE INVIS of somekind up(acumen works well). <br />
The castle there has 3 floors, first one is mostly green to a 65, some still LB.  Singles are easy post 60 for the most part.  But killing 2 at a time is more efficient.  Malo(s) is a MUST on these as they are undead and seem to have kind of a high resist.  But after you land malo(s) (or what ever other malo line you have atm) it should be cake to land just about anything else.  There is one named that stays on the first floor Xenithen Sterbla (i think that one is him) is a mage wo a pet. ALL the named are IMMUNE to root/snare.  so Malo(s) and rot.  This is where your pet might come in handy if he can keep taunt off of you long enough to land a DoT or 2.  There is another named that paths from the second floor to the first makes a round about the bottom and goes back up.  Renaldok Masric is his name i belive, he is a wizzy.  <br />
<br />
The second floor has Coterie Generals which are ALL LB/DB to 65, they hit a lil harder and can be harder to land stuff on aside from malo(s).  There is a named up there too that does not move. Trilexior Aeridia i think he is.  He's cake too.<br />
<br />
Third floor mob is a CHANTER, he tashes a LOT so be ready with disinfecting aura (at least i do).  I might have the names of the named mixed up, but there are 4 named that are soloable, 1 on first floor, 1 paths from 2nd to 1st, 1 on 2nd and 1 on 3rd right at the top of the stairs. all the named are lvl 50.  BECAREFUL again there is another named in on the top floor on a balcony i belive that is HARD (Heratius Grolden i think), i have not ever atempted him solo as i have heard nasty things about him, so i have been content with my 4 named guys.<br />

<br />
Another zone that i found to be kinda fun (found out about it shard hunting) is Katta Castellum.<br />
The only place i hunted in this zone was the CY, you zone in(when you zone in from TM), go forward there are some hedges on your right, go though the opening HUGGING the Right wall of the hedges to a BIG CY area, go to the BACK wall of this area.  Nothing spawns there or paths there.  No mobs see invis on your way there excpet for Tobala Honeyjar  who is in the middle of the garden area and is easy to avoid by HUGGING the hedge wall :) .  That druid B**** is not someone you want to mess with ,even at 65 she's not pleasant, and not meant to be killed as she is a quest NPC.  Centurians are your target here.  They range from green to DB to 65.  This is mostly a loot camp for vendor trash pp. or camping for VT shards(counts as SSeru shard).  AA xp here isnt horrible.  I know that a 52 rog i was here with (just a tag along friend) found the reg xp to be great, so maybe this zone is good for PLing too.<br />

<br />
That is about all i can think of atm :) and i think my post as rambled on a lot that i will stop here for now :) .   I hope i have provided enough info on these areas for you guys, and any corrections or additions would be great.  I am still looking for places to solo atm too :)</div></div><hr />
