<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think that Spell Casting Subtlety should be an AA that can be turned on and off rather than passive. I know that other shaman and necros and such encounter times where it hinders their performance rather than helps. Kiting mobs hi hi. Just wanted to see what you guys thought, maybe the devs would like to see some /feedback. I don't think it would be too hard to implement. Thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can still get agro as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Back when I kited at tables groups, I could easily keep agro with poison dots + bane. Thats with Crit Aff 3 and SCS3. I can honestly say I have never had a problem with getting agro whatsoever, and if I did, I could just mem Cripple and toss one in every other dot, its low mana and quick cast, uber agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This was a question I had as well - while it would be nice to not have quite the insane aggro we generate at times... there are many times that a shaman yanking aggro off a chanter or cleric can spell the difference of victory or defeat. <br />
I held of on getting this AA because I wasn't sure how easily I could yank a mob with SCS3....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With SCS3 can you cast slow on inc before tank engages but after puller does and not get aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if its a shadowknight or pally ;p if its a warrior expect to still get smacked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/hijack on<br />
Don't you hate that when you slow a mob it rarely aggros you if it is being tanked, but if you bounce that slow they wanna eat you alive?<br />
/hijack off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, I'd much rather grab aggro with a slow that lands rather than a slow that resists.  But it would be nice to be able to turn SCS on/off depending on the situation.  I don't actually have it yet, but if you need to grab aggro fast, will slow+cripple really do it with SCS3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCS is available to SK's too, and some were unfortunate enough to buy it when our aggro was so insane that even with SCS3, we had superfluous aggro for tanking... there's now a huge flamewar on SKO as to whether or not changing it should be on our top 10 list.  <br />
<br />
Making it a toggle would change it from detrimental to useful for SK's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have never had a problem getting aggro if I want it. Granted, I only have scs1 so far, but cant see how scs3 will make much of a difference if you  are really trying (lol). Or maybe I'm grouping with warriors to much  :p</div></div><hr />
