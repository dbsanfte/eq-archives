Sorry Wilu, but I have to ask (/devilsadvocatemode=on)...<br />
<br />
How does someone elses use of utilities like that take away from your enjoyment of the game other than the psychological state such acts put you in? How does it affect you and your ability to play this game the way you want to?<br />
<br />
Honestly curious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cabilis has water, as do many starting cities.  Drowning is common among true newbies.  (Well, I did anyways).  Cabilis also has quite a few monsters in the city as well.  Froglok slaves that will attack you, mosquitoes in some of the caverns, skeletons and other things.  The only ones easily found (or that find you easily) are the frogloks as you head towards the Field of Bone.  The others are in places that most don't normally go.  Like the area where the Enchanter epic mob is.<br />
<br />
So safety in the starting cities is always suspect.  :)<br />

As for this zone... Not sure it is the Frog city, as it does not appear to be froggy enough.  But then that last screenshot shows the shell thingy.  Unless the shell thingy is related to the Gromzek story line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be brutally honest Val you're right , I cant think of a justified reason but because the very fact that this zone isnt even in the game yet and yet here we have pictures of the entire map including any hidden areas and direct routes say to the big boss chamber just screams wrong and cheat.<br />
<br />
I just think that content is getting consumed at way to fast a pace as it its, do we really want to see more spoilers  before its even released ?<br />
<br />
Content is there to be found by in game methods, people actually adventuring and questing to find out info (initially) , innacurate handdrawn maps and rumour breathe life into a persistant world not clinical data analysis.<br />
<br />
Im the type of adventurer that like to get my group together and go off into the unknown , my greatest single moment in eq was the first time my group headed off to Kaesora in Kunarks release week, we literally stumbled across the dungeon and had it to ourselves crawling it from top to bottom , falling down holes and generally not having a clue what we were getting into , but heres the best part NEITHER DID ANYONE ELSE. We we're 'the first' (on Veehsan anyway)  to descover that little bit of content.<br />
<br />
Theres precious little mystery left in the game lets not go that one step further.</div></div><hr />

Here is my part with your quote ... it is in the game ... it's on my hard drive and everyone else's that pre-purchased LoY today ... which puts in squarely in the game.   This is a outcome of the online purchasing and pre downloading situation.   <br />
<br />
Sony very rountinely directs people to open files and edit them.   Open text files and read them.    UI files and modify them.    This is a zone file and is sitting in the same place as everything else.   If someone was sniffing or pulling things off Sony's servers, I would completely agree that would be wrong.   But since it's downloaded to each persons PC ... per purchasing a licensed copy of LoY ... then the user has the rights to view that file.<br />
<br />
On the other hand ... it is a spoiler and should be labled as such for anyone that doesn't notice what the subject of this post is about ... ie something to come.</div></div><hr />

Either way, I have edited the topic to include the &quot;spoiler&quot; warning so that anyone not wishing to compromise their gaming experience, doesnt have to.<br />

I say this with the utmost respect, but to add alittle logic into this quote...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sony very rountinely directs people to open files and edit them. Open text files and read them. UI files and modify them. This is a zone file and is sitting in the same place as everything else. If someone was sniffing or pulling things off Sony's servers, I would completely agree that would be wrong. But since it's downloaded to each persons PC ... per purchasing a licensed copy of LoY ... then the user has the rights to view that file.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sony dose not, nor ever will, advise anyone to use a zone view( downloadable on the site &quot;Hackersquest..c'mon...think about it :) ) to roam around zones. Especially zones that at the very least are not 'open' to the public yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Evel<br />
<br />
I equate the differance between a zone viewer and a text editor in this reqard.    Sony also doesn't offer or instruction clients in what photo editor to use when working  screen shots.    And to take this a bit futher ... Sony states per the EULA the following:<br />
<br />
'You may not reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Software except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law&quot;.     I read this to mean that you can't break into the code ... tools or not.    But it does not say that you can't view the files installed.    I will agree that someone taking screen shots of the game and posting them on a public site may be breaking the EULA ... but that's a far cry from saying you can't view a file on your hard drive.    <br />
<br />
to roam around zones. Especially zones that at the very least are not 'open' to the public yet. <br />
<br />
What's key to this is WHERE the roaming is taking place ... a owner of the software doesn't view these files off the server ... they do it off their own hard drives.    The files aren't locked ... they just require the right application to view them.    They ARE open to the public ... today ... because the second you purchase LoY and start downloading them to your Hard Drive they fall under the EULA.   They aren't playable ... that's certainly true ... but the local files are just that ... local.   View them at your own pleasure ... post them to a public site at your own risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">ok, just to clear up some confusion on the legality of the pictures. (not that Im a lawer, but it doesnt take a lawer to make a deduction from common sense)<br />
<br />
There is no company on the planet that can make any piece of software that writes ANYTHING to my hard drive that has ANY legal grounds for telling me I cannot view the files as I see fit.<br />
<br />
Yes they can tell me I cannot Reverse Engineer (change functionality to the extent not provided in the original), Disassemble ( generate source code where there was none provided) or Decompile ( similar to disassemble), but VIEWING the data can be done at my discretion.  period.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm the anal retentive type of person that is so afraid of virii that i personally check every file. I find this new .s3d file. Hmm, lets see if its really an .s3d, I load it up in a tool that is able to view .s3d files.   voila... its valid.  (not that this is me, nor that this was the reason i viewed the file, just making a point)<br />
<br />
Any file on my computer is open to scrutiny by anyone that happens to use this computer.<br />
<br />
If they (Sony) were really concerned about people seeing this zone before it was officially in-game, they would not have sent it out yet.  They know of these tools. <br />
<br />
Dont fool yourself, there is nothing in the EULA saying you cannot view the files in the everquest directory, and as was said earlier, I'ts never been Sony/Verant's stance that the directory should be left alone, there are several user-editable files in there that offer options that currently have no interface in game...<br />
<br />
The only valid point this thread has is that the pictures may ruin someones gaming experience the first time in the zone. And for that I apologise (kinda)... heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) How do I get the zone viewer to give more than 1 fps, and get textures onto all the models? Bleah.<br />

1) My hard disk, my files. Period.<br />
Not according to the EULA. In a nutshell you're only &quot;leasing&quot; those files. They remain the property of SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Not according to the EULA. In a nutshell you're only &quot;leasing&quot; those files. They remain the property of SOE. <br />
<br />
Yes but the point some are trying to make is ... You can't view these files even if they are on your hard drive ... leased software or whatnot.   <br />
<br />
Viewing these files doesn't require breaking into them, unlocking encryption , or even editing the file.    It's as simple as ... start program ... run viewer ... click on open file ... TaDa!.    <br />
<br />
So what is the difference between viewing the file in question and say EQUI files, or .Txt files, or even .INI files?   Nothing ... because you use a editor ** Not provided by Sony ** to open/view/edit those files.    The files get to your hard drive because you purchase LoY and Sony pushes those files to your hard drive during logon.  <br />
<br />
Don't get confused on this ... this is not sniffing packets or hacking Sony servers ... it's viewing unlocked files legally installed by the vendor via a viewer application.    <br />
<br />
That's the viewing part ... posting that information on a public web site is another issue.   There are copyright laws that come into play concerning the posting of images and content on public sites.    But Sony has commonly allowed this to take place ... AKA Screen shots ... and has even programmed a tool into the client interface to allow this function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Content is there to be found by in game methods, people actually adventuring and questing to find out info (initially) <br />
Spoiler sites have been online with full information since before beta.  They get the information available within a day or two of release of any expansion.  You'll be happy to note though that there is no information about monsters, vendors, drops, weapons, armor, or quests since all of that is handled server-side.<br />
<br />
EULA's do not hold up in court.  You go to the store, pay money, get a box that has manuals, CD, and whatever inside.  You don't sign a legal agreement.  It looks like a sale - in a judge's eyes it's a sale (like buying a book).  Also - the EULA isn't available to you before you open the box, and you can't return the software once it's opened.  EQ's EULA would be less likely than most to hold up.  HOWEVER, if SOE decides you violated their EULA - you would most likely be banned from EQ, which would leave you with little recourse other than to buy a new copy if you wanted to continue playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Regardless of the legal mumbo jumbo , use some common sense. <br />
<br />
Can you honestly not see that viewing game content with a 3rd party utility is clearly not  the manner in which its intended, can you honestly say Sony WANT or at the very least dont care if we do this ? and before its even open for use FFS !<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">IF ... and clearly there is a IF here ... Sony had elected to offer the new UI interface files prior to allowing it to work &quot;ingame&quot; ... would you be saying the same thing.   Sony came out and told people ... go get these files ... open them ... edit them the way you want.   <br />
<br />
It's not common sense ... it's do you want to know spoiler information.    That's the choice that a person has in this new environment since we are getting Pre-Production information directly from Sony prior to LoY &quot;Official&quot; go-live.    <br />
<br />
Take it for what you want ... but these files can be looked at by the client.<br />

But,  I would not think any less of someone who did.  It really isn't any different than looking at a spoiler site.  If someone else wants to spoil the excitement of discovery for themselves, let them go for it.<br />

<br />
I realize this is only an opinion and the use of a third party program to wander freely around unpopulated zones is neither detectable nor punishable by SOE. One could spin this, with pieces of the EULA, to make it seem as if its -not- an exploit, but I think if you really thought deeply about what an &quot;exploit&quot; is, you'd agree that its just that...EULA or not.<br />

On the grounds of what's moral or not in EQ ... viewing just about anything outside the Game world off web sites (including this site) could be considered an exploit in the purest sense of the game.    <br />
<br />
But really this is all beside the point … the question was &quot;Is viewing these files against rules&quot; ... not the moral high or low road of the act.   The single act of viewing the files … nothing else … at least from my perspective.<br />
<br />
In fact, I clearly stated that I thought the information on this post was a spoiler and should be noted as such.    To carry it a bit further, it's possible that it’s against Sony policies to post these images on a public site.   If you want me to say it’s an exploit … sure it’s an exploit to view information outside the bounds of the game … other than what Sony wants you to see.<br />
<br />
But I will stand by my opinion of saying that viewing legally purchased files isn't illegal in its concept … but I will add that it is most likely an exploit to use the information.    Sad thing is … after getting to this point in the post … one has viewed the evil fruit of exploitation by seeing these pre-released images.   Try putting the genie back into the bottle.</div></div><hr />

re-read my post and consider it...put the pieces together and really think about it. Third party program-unopened zone-free of mobs...it -is- an &quot;exploit&quot; I can pull up the definition if you'd like ;) ......just dont go directly to the justification spin as most do. As with Fascaser though, you have your opinion and I respect it.<br />
<br />
The maps you see on map sites...Id say a great majority(especially in the earlier days of EQ) were plotted by the pioneers of a zone that did take the risk. I mean, its a subtle difference...but its still a matter of just breezing though a danger free zone to get comfortable with the lay out(with viewer) as opposed to using a map that someone went throughout the trouble  and danger of figuring out....or you taking the risk yourself.<br />

*Evel stops and ponders this, then is startled with the realization...*<br />
<br />

<br />
The point was that some people don't like other people spoiling their enjoyment of finding out what these zones look like.....how it became a legal argument I'll never know.<br />

Sometimes I think that people post on these boards just so they can prove other people wrong. I think these boards are about discussion, not about intelligence wars.</div></div><hr />
