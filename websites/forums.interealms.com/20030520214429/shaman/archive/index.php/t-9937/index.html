<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seriously, this place is sweet exp spot at 62.    Sure when I died at first I lost the exp totally, but I made it up within 20 minutes easily.   Tons of blues, and NO competition for the camps whatsoever.   I finally have a cleric parked there now too, so I can just AA exp and not worry about anything else.    Quite nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was one of the best exp spots before PoP for us, since we are one of (maybe the only?) class that can easily solo aiw3/aiw4/stomples.  My biggest problem was fear of dying, since it is a real pain to get a rezz there.  If you have a cleric parked there, though, that would alleviate that problem :)<br />
<br />
It's definately a fun zone, even though I think the exp is outdated now.  In the first few days of PoP i discovered I could get much better exp by root dotting things in the POD castle courtyard, and decided to rebind.  And POV group exp is much much better, for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I can't wait to finish my boots up and move on, but I am quite pleased for now with the exp as it is more than I am used to getting while working on quests (except Vervacity quest which is UNREAL exp in seru solo, but that is a painful solo job there :))<br />
<br />
<br />
  There are a couple druids I have seen clearing as far as Glonk4, no twins4 yert, but they use charmed Grink2 to pull it off.   The  druid I assisted in getting to PoM has done stomples on me a couple times ruining my attempt to slowly (VERY SLOWLY) work up to ally DoM faction :)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Oh, and he looted the blue throne I would need to finish boots now and gave it to a friend thinking I needed a black..... :(  damnit :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thrones are easy get, white crown is the worst thing in the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finally got Stomples to give up a blue throne.    Now pretty much done with the plane except ocasional Stomles kills I think.   Still got 5 white thrones to throw away somewhere....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And a question on this....how hard is the actual quest to get my SS boots (shananigans).  Been staring hard at it for a bit now and I think that once I ding at least once more, I might ride piggyback with another guild that is doing that area so that I can go to that area....Going to suck if I die...but I will try to bind somehwhere safe just in case.<br />
<br />
Can I get summoned in ToV if I lose my corpse somewhere in NToV....can't remember exactly, but I think that the answer is no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">val, the answer is yes, you can get your corpse summoned. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In order for corpse summon in ToV, the necro/SK must be in the room you port into ToV at, only some certain spot in there works (probably the evac point).<br />
<br />
   Sorta confusing calling the Sham Shennanigan SS with the armor from HoT being called Skyshrine armor ;)    Forgot that they had the same abbreviation till I saw your post.<br />
<br />
   As for how hard, if you can't solo stomples (hits about 350 triple) then your chances at thrones drops dramatically.   Doing him requires torpor and some nice gear, preferable also Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
   3 minute root also helps a ton for AiW4 twins.   If you want to practice at what kind of pull that is go solo the entrance guys in CT, then imagine that with no zoneout nearby just in case things go wrong :(     It isn't hard when you get used to it, but not everyone likes doing 2 summoning mobs at once.<br />
<br />
   If you got those 2, probably take you a month of solid hunting to get the drops you need, but your luck may vary considerably (white crown and blue throne will take forever).   if you can't do stomples you may as well plan on nearly 4 months, and if you can't even do the twins then I don't see you getting them before you get sick of the zone unless you are VERY lucky or buy your cards in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Getting the doll for the armor requires a ton of work as well, or random luck.    Need to farm the plane for parts of the words of wealth.   You'll need a ton of them to make a gift box, then just pray either you get shaman on first try or that someone with a shaman doll is interested in trading with you.    Depending on your luck again, this could take you a couple months in addition to getting your thrones.</div></div><hr />
