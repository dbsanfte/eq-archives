<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>butuglia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a 65 shaman. My son plays a 51 Beastlord. My third account has a 55 monk and a 41 Ranger on it. We want to play together, level, have fun etc nothing to extreme. I will box the shaman using hotkeys and play the other directly. We would probably not add others in our group.  Our main goal besides leveling the Beastlord would be to have fun in all types of zones that are &quot;forgotten&quot;. Probably not a lot of pop if at all. I'll go to time if i wanna do dat. <br />
<br />
Which class would you choose to fill out this little fun group. I will not start and play up another character so its either the Monk or Ranger. I appreciate your input on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Monk. He is higher level than Beastlord you are trying to raise. A Time enabled shaman has Q, so can heal BST and MNK with little attention. The ranger's outdoor skills are quite offset by th emonk's pulling and splitting skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger.  Harmony, tracking, snare, damage shield, ATK buffs, hp buffs, nukes, /disc weaponshield, and later on... AM3 and EQ.  No question, ranger.<br />
<br />
Indoor... the bst can pull via pet-agro.  Works quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>butuglia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funny the same things i am thinking of.. Obviously a tough choice, that is why i asked for differing opinions. And yes my spell book is full. I am leaning towards the monk just because he is already 55 and i dont have to pl the ranger. BTW both of them have maxed skills for their level and are bazaar twinked nothing major.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Minitiki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in my view it really depends on what you want. Do you want to be able to kill faster? then I'd go with ranger. However in &quot;some&quot; underpopulated zones the monk might be better as beastlords may not be able to pull in &quot;some&quot; situations where the monk might shine.<br />
<br />
I do think the ranger might offer more in terms of spells/snare/DPS but it really depends on what you want, It is a tough call and I'm not sure what to say. I would probably go ranger myself if these were my two choices. (ranger can kite adds etc..)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Ranger no doubt.<br />
<br />
Just for the fact of the Snare, how many times has a shammy had a mod run off after a root broke and brought some friends with?<br />
<br />
Not to mention some Attack Buff and another healer (not very good) but when shammy is oom anything helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make a shadowknight, dps, snare and tank all in one nice package, and they can be gnomes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ranger.  Harmony, tracking, snare, damage shield, ATK buffs, hp buffs, nukes, /disc weaponshield, and later on... AM3 and EQ.  No question, ranger.<br />

<br />
Have to agree.  The only thing better MIGHT be a SK.</div></div><hr />
