<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mr. Zen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I wanted to see if I could get some adise on the best way to get the rest of my epic done.  I am a level 54 Ranger, I have been working on my epic since level 50 and two AA points. I belong to a smallish guild who has just started raiding places like Kael and is going througha raid learning process.  They will not be able to help with my epic, and honestly every one in the guild is so hungry for help on there class specific quests that I dont think my epic is going to be dealt with for quite some time. <br />
<br />
Through my epic trials I have been on several CoM raids where I lost rolls for the JR.  I have tried organizing some raids in CoM (5 all together) only to have the rogue not show up or not have any chanters or slowers or clerics other times so I'm kind of discouraged on that part and sick of wasting everyones time. Ill get back to it again later on lol.   I somehow was able to get up enough friends and peeps in the zone to do the Karana part and make the hardened mixture and get the tin bowl.  From there i did all the solo parts that I could. After that I kind of gave up for a while thinking that I wouldnt have a chance without a good guild with nothing to do supporting me. But just recently I my luck changed a bit when somone kind of out of the blue asked if I wanted to join their raid force in the hole to do the ranger and shammy epics. I jumped on it, and actually was able to get the soul bound hammer!  Sooooo, now I have a soulbound hammer and the receipt that I need to hand in to that TD guy for his grocery list (just havent got around to running to TD again) I think he gives my some pattern or something, anyway after that and a few more solo things I will either have to grab a JR, do VSR, or do the PoA part. <br />
<br />
My questions are ass follows: <br />
<br />
1. The obvious question is should I still give up until I have a proper amount of help? or am I far enough into the quest that I should still move ahead.<br />
<br />
2. What techniques can I use to do any of these parts without a guild, (ie.. sit in the zone and beg for help) <br />
<br />
3. What part, of the parts I have left, do I have the best chance at getting without a guild? If thats even possible. I'm thinking its not possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you guys in advance and I'm sorry its such a long post<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tefon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest proposing a  Weekly Epic Night and/or a Weekly Quest night, where everyone on helps each other out on epics and/or quests.  <br />
<br />
Propose Epic Night to your guild and offer to coordinate it,everyone will appreciate it and it will bring your guild closer together.   Also, you can schedule who gets what from a CoM raid, etc depending on what remaining pieces they need to finish their epic, no more randoms, but set the expectations up front.<br />
<br />
The downside is the random spawn mobs, but once people start helping each other out more, pickup groups for random mobs will come.<br />
<br />
Also, help guild clerics get rez sticks it will make your raids recover so much faster from a wipeout, plus they will then help you on your epics.</div></div><hr />

 That is your decision, really.  I think you can move ahead from where you are.<br />
<br />
2. What techniques can I use to do any of these parts without a guild, (ie.. sit in the zone and beg for help) <br />
Join the /auction channel on your server and buy the parts you need (Jade Reaver, Sphere of Swirling Colour MQ, VSR Stone MQ).  Save every pp you have to do this.<br />
<br />
3. What part, of the parts I have left, do I have the best chance at getting without a guild? If thats even possible. I'm thinking its not possible. <br />
You can do eveything I suggest without a guild... you just need $.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mr. Zen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tefon, that is a great idea.  I will present it to my guild, but I think that they are concentrating on learning how to raid effeciently.   The average age in my guild is 45 and the range is 20 to 61. There are about 66 memebers in the guild.  I am actually one of the highest levels if you can believe it at 54.  So maybe after they raid a few more times ill propose weekly epic night.  I'm an officer but I'm not the Raid Leader.  I believe he has his own adjenda. <br />
<br />
Haroun Zehra, thats also a great and doable idea, even though I would rather be able to say I finnished my epic quest instead of buying the parts and MQing. But I am not above doing that at all, and I will be saving my plats for buying parts I cant get.  I think the PoA stone will most deffinately be needing to be baught.  The rest I would really like to hold out on until I start looking really silly being 61 and using a lammy/centi combo lol. <br />
<br />
I would also like to ask anyone who is in a guild able to do epics in Terris Thule that they keep me in mind and send a tell if they are doing something for one of their Rangers epics that I might have a chance to aquire one of the parts I'm missing.  I am sorry to ask this, I just feel like I dont have a heck of a lot of options. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vindikael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One thing to consider is that there are many guilds which are in similar situations as your's. The logical thing to do is surf the websites and message boards for your server and see which guilds are involved in coalitions or councils. While your guild may not be strong enough to do a PoA raid, a few groups for yours, a few groups from another and another may be the firepower you need. <br />
<br />
It is tough to organize and will require a lot of work but it will open up doors for you that were once closed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trolalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got bored of the exp grind so I decided to start doing the leg work for my epic. With PoP I was able to forage all the components for the Hardened mixture in about an hour(you have to love the PoP stones) Next went to Surefall Glade and turned in the Rose of Firona, then to FM to turn in the picture to the human Skelly, skelly took a while, man that thing moves fast and I kept getting jumped by giaints. Next it was back to SG to turn the the locket. Did the batwing quest in Felwithe to get faction to Amible then off to Timouous Deep to Alrik. Ran back and forth and now I have the pattern.<br />
I just did start of the quest in Burning Woods last night with Telin and I got the worn note ( I'm only level 46 and wasn't sure if he would talk to me but he did) Went to Gfay and Faelin was up, got the ring. Now if I can only find Giz, I spent 6 hours in Kith and never saw him on tracking.<br />
<br />
Point of post is that if you go ahead and do all the solo stuff first you might get lucky and find people to help with the raid stuff later or buy a MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as MQ go, PoA takes a good size force. If you cant find a guild raiding there, i would multi for no more than 5k. <br />
<br />
JR, DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!! I cant state that enough! There are few things in this game that tick me off worse than seeing some pally auction a reaver off for 20K!!! Really does not take that big of a force. Even if you can get only one group up, you can still try pulling the front one. Two or three groups and you will rock. Took me like 4 trips to finally get my reaver. <br />
<br />
VSR, i didnt do this part with my guild. I use to hunt in KC alot and one day a Ranger said he was up, and him and i convinced half the zone to help us out. Had a total of 18 people total and it was cake.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I bought my jade reaver, sue me.  The only JR that dropped on any trip to CoM went to some jackass pally's TWINK DRUID because of miscommunication within my guildmates.  I had everything else except that POS JR (guildy who misunderstood the stuff going on in /gu had the VZ stone to MQ with me, I had everything else including SSoC, and all that crap).<br />
<br />
Does it suck having to pay 20k to get a JR for your epic?  Sure.  But what sucks more?  Having to pay for your JR?  Or being 1 piece away from swifty while everyone else in your guild is messing around in the new planes?  Sure, they're supportive and helpful, and we don't raid all the time, but there comes a time when constantly going to CoM and having nothing drop tries the patience of everyone.<br />
<br />
And to be quite honest, I'll have to go back anyway sometime, 'cause I two box with a druid and if I want her epic'd then I need another bloody jade reaver.  I lack the patience, and the playtime, to sit around waiting for 1 to drop, let alone 2.<br />
<br />
Buy it, don't buy it, do what suits your playstyle.  At least I didn't buy my runed scout's BP, won that drop fair and square.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greymarch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Buy the Jade Reaver.  Its droppable, so it is perfectly legal, and honorable to buy one, despite what the EQ junkies on these messageboards say.  The Reaver camp in CoM is perpetually camped, and the reaver drops very infrequently there, so the easiest way to get one is to buy it at the bazaar.  On the Mith Marr server the Jade reaver currently sells for 10 to 14k.  Its worth every penny.<br />
<br />
In fact, here are the typical prices for various parts of the ranger epic quest on the Mith Marr server:<br />
<br />
1. Glowing Green Stone MQ (from VSR): 10k<br />
2. Jade Reaver: 12k<br />
3. Swirling Sphere of Color MQ: 5k<br />
<br />
You do the math.  10k + 12k + 5K = a very cheap way to get an item that provides +30 attack, and +40% haste!   Imagine if a 13/21 weapon with 40% haste, +15str, and +30 atk was auctioned in the bazaar; it would sell for 150k to 200k easy.<br />
<br />
Trust me, most rangers nowadays solve their epic by spending the cash, not camping rare mobs for ultra-rare drops.  Capitalism is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PhyrexDarkmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Equiping people with epics is one of the first steps of moving a guild forward onto bigger and better things.  Rangers and rogues have fairly easy epics to complete (well not counting EC but EC doesn't really help guild as much) and that means a big jump in the overall DPS of the guild on raids.  If your guild wants to move past Kael towards HoT and such you will need these epics.  Try explaining this to your guild raid leader.  <br />
<br />
Plus I would have never bought bought my JR.  Besides the fact I am always broke, it makes me sick to see people charge so much for a weapon that really on has 1 use, epic completion.  How many times have you actually seen someone using a JR as their main weapon, never cause they suck.  Next time you see a mage doing this, camp their cloak pegasus cloak for MQ and charge them an arm and a leg for it or any other piece this can be done with.  What sickens me even more is seeing rangers and druids charging these prices.  <br />
<br />
As far as the SSoC goes, just try talking to people.  Many high level guilds that raid PoA often save these and are looking to dumb them just for bank space.  I had a couple offers to MQ for free.  Heck I even screwed mine up and had the same person MQ it for me twice.  <br />
<br />
For VSR, if your camping in KC guilds coming in to kill him usually will annouce it.  Politely ask them if they are going to loot both.  You may get lucky and get a free one.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mr. Zen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doh, i forgot to post the result on this thread!<br />
<br />
<br />
I was able to organize pickup groups and semi raids for most of my Epic:) I only had to purchase the MQ for the SSoC from PoA.  And I actually owe that the the Glade.  A very kind Glade memeber offered the MQ for free (you know who you are Tal....) I paid him some plat for his time anyway it was the least I could do.  The rest I looted without a guild supporting me.  The result was a LONG AWAITED Swiftwind!!!:D <br />
<br />
Thank you all for the great advise though.  The Glade Rocks!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It was the least I could do man. The last time we went to PoA to grab some mage crowns and wingblades at least 6 of them dropped. I picked one up purposely to MQ with anyone who needed one, because I know alot of the smaller guilds can't muster up the forces to do a full PoA raid.</div></div><hr />
