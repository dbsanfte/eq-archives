<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, iv'e seen loads of shaman wearing these in there magelos etc and i presumed it was a high level quest or mob drop but i noticed that people around my level (43) had them. I wondering how can can i obtain these and if i can do it (pretty crappy gear, no twink). If your gonna give me a allkzham link please tell me what zone the quest starts in because i am not a member so i can't use the search function, thnx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are an early reward in our epic quest, from killing black dire and turning in his pelt to SPirit in EJ.  check out quest boards and stuff about epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was considering hiring a hit squad to take out black dire so I could get those boots pre-30.  The shaman epic is not that hard to do until you get to the CoM part.<br />
<br />
The test of Patience can be done solo at &lt;20 with enduring breath spell and invis to animals.  Did it myself at 21.<br />
<br />
Envy, Woe and Marr's Promise are all droppable and can be bought in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
You can get to the Black Dire part for a couple of hundred plat and a couple of hours of running around.<br />
<br />
The trip through Emerald Jungle to do the turn-ins might be a little exciting at less than 30 though but invis should make it easily doable at 29 solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Black Dire is a pain.  He is in Mist Moore Castle located behind the ramp leading up to the castle.  He is not single pullable untill upper 50s almost 60.    As I understand at lower levels you pull him back to near zone in, root him then zone.  When you zone back he is there all alone for you to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If Black Dire is not up you need to kill the Mistmoore Advisor who spawns in the castle. (Wears and drops Advisor Robe).<br />
<br />
If you are on Xev send my Monk a tell. We'll get you those boots. Nothing I enjoy more than picking up easy RoS faction while whacking misguided Inkies and getting someone those booties.<br />
<br />
I can 'almost' solo him unslowed, but your healing would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used my ranger/necro duo to take out Dire, he's not too bad.  Just hits hard for an old-world mob and has fairly high resists.  Pretty much zero regen, so if you can get him at the zone and need to regroup, he should be sitting there when you get back.<br />
<br />
All in all, a very easy kill as far as these things go.  I had to do it twice because I neglected to check faction before turning in my first fur.  The second time I just had my necro feign-rot him with lifetaps, since he resisted a lot of other dots, including Splurt.<br />
<br />
I got my boots pre-30, and I was very glad that I did.  Better than jboots, and free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanx for the offer Faern but i'm on AB server, guild will help though. Also what faction will need to do turn in and can a barb do it without faction work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also what faction will need to do turn in and can a barb do it without faction work?<br />
<br />
Truespirit faction, faction you raise through the actual epic quest, so first you need to do all preliminary steps to gain enough faction for boots turnin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">56 is the magic number to single pull him else the other wolves add and they will ruin any solo attempt given how much they resist for a light blues. I couldn't land a dot on BD so I just sat back and healed puppy the whole fight which took over 5 minutes -- had to reapply turgurs.<br />
<br />
I've never been one to worry about finishing quests on time so it was no big deal for me to wait till 56. Hell I'm still not done with epic and I solo just fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got my boots at 34 they are a life changing item.<br />
When bored and runnign thru a zone u leave autorun on and just run and click them really fast. If it's night u are like a blazing comet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My boots just saved my ass for first time last night. Running to ToV and a dragon aoe dispelled my SoE. I click the boots and run like hell.<br />
<br />
Did black dire the first time with me at 52 and my monk friend at 54. Was easy to single pull him with a long range weapon at 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">did him with 50 monk and 52 shaman.  Hardest part was killing advisor to pop him lol.  Lots to pull in that castle.<br />
<br />
To pull BD I bound right inside the zone at MM, and went invis to BD.  Monk waited at zone.  I cast slow on BD - all the crap there agroed ... took a HT etc and gated to zone with less than 2 bubbles of health left.  Quick heal - then BD and friends came.  Rooted BD, zoned , zoned back and he was alone and slowed.<br />
Slow landed first time.  Root was resisted on occasion - did not try anything else.  Let monk do all the work - i just healed.<br />
<br />
Was nto too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You don't even need to root the BD, at least not when i did it half a year ago.<br />
Just pull him to zone with all the green trash and zone out.<br />
The yard trash will leave, but he will stay at the zone out alone eagerly expecting You to kill him  :D</div></div><hr />

beautiful<br />
<br />
I used to jump off of the bridge in Shar Vahl just to hear the newbies Ohhh and Ahhh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Heh was tooling around in MM helping the wife's mage get her power of water for epic with my retired 65 shaman.   In comes this 50 shaman hoping to get BD but she had the worse luck on the mob (LDs, lack of people, etc).  I told her to head to where he spawns (well near there..base of ramp into Entyi area) and wait there.  I cleared both mobs then the gargs and Entyi real fast.  After that I pulled with slow, sicked dogdog on it, dropped the Dogdog Manabomb and used my JBB.  Under 1 minute the mob is dead and she has the pelt.  :)   I love doing that kill still at 65 and been long done my epic. rofl  <br />
<br />
Those boots still sit in my inventory and I still use them constantly (hate when sow wears off on pulling).   Great boots.  Definitely worth the effort of getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LISIMBA_SHAKIR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I heard of people do this for other classes since you can click from inventory and the quest is based on faction. Anyone know if this is true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great Item to have no matter what level you are. I got mineat level 17 With the help of a 57 Shaman and a 60 Shaman. BD was a breeze but EJ was a bit rough. When I got to Spirit in Ej He would not speak to me but I handed him the pelt and got my Boots. I was amazed when I was able to use them at 17! They made life more fun than you could imagine. I had no fear. I was level 17 and took on a tainted wooly mammoth in EF adn killed him. Once I got Canni I killed him and the corrupt that spawns back to back. Why you ask? Because I knew I could kite them around all day with no fear of SOW going. canni and Iksar regen BP + Black Fur Boots = Wet Dreams at that level. GOD I LOVE EVERYONE.</div></div><hr />
