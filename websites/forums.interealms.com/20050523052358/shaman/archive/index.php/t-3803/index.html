<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that Verant will allow characters to be transferred (naked) from a nonZek to a Zek (or vice versa), are people going to use this option? <br />
<br />
From just reading the posts on the Crucible, i seem to see alot of bored and even retired lvl60's on nonZek servers. Would transfer to a pvp server make the game fun for you again? Would it be worth loosing friends and gear?  And will people with wrecked reps use this service to start clean?<br />
<br />
Just interested in getting some feeling for what sort of interest there is in these type of character moves.<br />
<br />
Would you do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">kinda OT: my old opinion of zek players was that they were just a bunch of griefers that were immature jerks.<br />
<br />
However, after seeing many fine posters here with a 'Zek' server in their sig I've changed my opinion, and realized that they are just normal, usually decent people that play on a different server than me.  So good job to ALL the Zek players here at the crucible for changing my mind about you guys.<br />
<br />
back OT:<br />
If Im bored with EQ, I'm not going to spend $50 on the game and hope that a server change will allow me to have fun.  I don't think very many people will use this service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Zek play is broken. This is going to hurt the zek servers far more than it will help them. I already know four level 55+ players from my old home server (Rallos Zek) who are leaving the server for good thanks to this change. Their rationale is that it'll be far easier to gear up a naked toon on a Blue Server than it would be to gear the same toon were he to transfer naked to a red server.<br />
<br />
It's a one-way street out of the zeks and people will jump at the opportunity.<br />
<br />
Except perhaps bored uber manaburn wizards. They don't need gear to meditate in a pvp-immune zone, pop out, gank some gear, then nexus gate back. I suppose you'll see more naked manaburners coming to a zek near you! That should hasten the exodus, especially on Rallos (coin + item loot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soupy, I agree with you, but I think the blade has two edges.<br />
<br />
Just like people who are fed up with pvp that disturbs their exping will move to a nonZek server, there are nonZek players who are fed up with ubermob rotations, overcrowding and waiting lists. <br />
<br />
Fungus grove rarely has more than three players in it on my server. NToV dragons can stay up for days. Same goes for Dain, Yelinak and Tormax.<br />
<br />
Im not loosing any sleep over people who move away from a Zek. I probably didnt enjoy their company very much to begin with. What really sparks my interest is whether there will be any fullguild moves from nonZek to Zek servers. Could use some fresh bodies with the blood still pumping in them to fill out the servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
True, I can see manaburn wizzies moving to Rallos just to make ebay cash. /boggle manaburn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of these years they'll nerf manaburn or instagate for PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats the catch isn't.  Would it be worth it? If they had this service 8 months ago I would probably do it or at least considered it seriously. (I have since quit, RZ burn out :( ) Gear isn't that big of deal, but loosing your friends is. I have learned that in reality eq is a fairly boring game in itself. Its having your friends and the team work that make it special. <br />
<br />
In general though, there is a possibly for problems. I figure alot of people will transfer off the Zeks, the problem is how many will transfer to a Zek? Numbers on blue servers are huge and if a fraction of people decide goto a Zek you maybe filling up those 3 servers quickly with a bunch of people with their own ideas how pvp should be, instead of the strange pvp politics that are on the Zeks now :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Couldn't you just transfer to legends and then hop to a Zek server for 10 dollars less plus keep your gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfornately it doesn't work that way. You can hop to Legends in full gear, but once there they only let you hop back to your old server with you stuff. Only characters that can choose the server they goto are those created on Legends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While I can &quot; sorta &quot; see why they wouldn't allow a Bue to transfer to a red with full requipment, the reverse is sort of odd.<br />
<br />
Actually upon second thought, the whole &quot; pay money for a limited number of keystrokes - oh but you can't bring anything with you - thanks time sink&quot; is odd.<br />
<br />
Also, isn't this one of those &quot; never gonna happen &quot; things from way back?<br />
