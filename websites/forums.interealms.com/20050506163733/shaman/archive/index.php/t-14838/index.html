<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have Can 5 and recently bought spirit call.  Not the most useful AA but definately the most fun.<br />
<br />
Now I am setting up for the grind to get to Elder and more useful AA's.<br />
<br />
My current path plan from 27 AA is:<br />
<br />
SCR 3<br />
SCRM<br />
QB2 (have haste of mithaniel item)<br />
Alchemy master 1 (slightly quicker than rabid bear for the last 2 points of class)<br />
<br />
I am a moderate hp addict.  Been wanting to get ND 3 for along time, but always though the hp increase was based on your naked base hp and sta buffs only. <br />
<br />
My base hp (naked) is about 1260, add in 115 points of sta when dressed in normal gear at about 3 hp per stamina gives 1710 hp adjustable by ND or 171 addional hp unbuffed with nd 3. Somewhat more buffed, when I hit the sta cap of 265. <br />
<br />
With gear I have 2606 hp unbuffed at lvl 62. <br />
<br />
171 hp is a fair chunk of hp's but its not unreasonable that I could get that in gear upgrades while working on the buff aa's. <br />
<br />
I ran tests using my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=274246) that shows that unbuffed I get:<br />
<br />
51 more hp at ND 1<br />
129 more hp at ND 2<br />
259 more hp at ND 3<br />
<br />
Which seems to indicate that the hp increase uses geared, but unbuffed hp as your base. <br />
<br />
Have other shamn found this to be true?  259 unbuffed, and 279 hp full buffed is nothing to sneeze at and may be worth putting off my other AA plans to pursue. Gets me in ear shot of my next hp goal of 3 k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Have 2 aa that will be spent tonight on either nd 1 or scr 1.  Feel fre to critique my magelo as well, keeping in mind I like a balanced path with ac buffable to 1200, Wis around 200, resists over 100, and as many hitpoints as I can squeeze into those constraints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ND is a great AA. It works with gear, but not &quot;hp buffs&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well....I guess the first question that I would have to ask is... Why do you care about getting your elder title so bad.  Yeah, I got mine, but it wasn't a focal point and I got it when I wanted the AAs and they corresponded to it.  Which, total coicidence ended up being at 69 AAs.  It brings me back to a shaman that I know that hurried up and got his elder title at I think 43 AAs.  And I had to ask him what he spent his AAs on.  And of course, to get it that early you have to take some of the non-useful but fun AAs.  So, I ask you....do you want the title and non-useful but fun AAs early...or would you rather pursue something that will actually affect your gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that since you already got True Spirit that you like the fun AAs..and there is nothing wrong with that.  I personally went for the route that would increase my abilities as a shaman more so.  Which means...after canni5, I spent 2 points each on SCR and SCM before I decided that ND3 was the way to go.  Getting an extra 250+ hps was awesome and it really helps alot, especially when canni5ing.  After ND3, I finally went and finished SCR and then got QB1 and then SCRM to finish out my Elder (I did MGB in there after SCR1 and SCM1 cause I was in a guild that really needed it)<br />
<br />
BTW...I kept myself around 200 wis buffed and that was my comfortable level for a while until the gear started getting better and with it, my resists finally started going back up.  I had hit my stamina and wisdom cap and that is when I decided that it would be best to train Planar Power....and that was the only reason that I decided to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I play on Firiona Vie, the rp server, so part of the reason to make Elder is storyline for my character.  Yes I do like the fun stuff, had also thought of one level of critical heals and nukes for that reason. <br />
<br />
Also why I am getting AA at 62 (was 60 til can 5 and exp changes) and not racing to 65. In a good week I can get 4-5 AA in a slow week 1.  So none of this is going to happen any time real soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am under the impression that canni v is the best AA for a shaman to get, followed VERY closely by scm.. just raw power wise not taking &quot;fun&quot; or specialy cases under consideration, this should be the case so think about that. My AA plan =<br />
regen3<br />
run3<br />
mc3<br />
canni v<br />
scm3<br />
rc1<br />
ca3<br />
lr5<br />
<br />
but that's because I don't have a lot of aa to spend and I need the most bang for the buck.. hey if he quads for 1200 all I need is 1 miss for 1200 hps gained! after lr5 I will probably go and do nd though =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got Cann5 and now I'm working towards SCR3/SCRM, but I did pause to put 2 points toward RC1 just so I have SOME way to get rid of freaking curses, even if it takes a couple uses.  Remove Curse is just not worth the money with all these other spells to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SCM would be very nice but I tend to float in mana as it is with torpor and can5, if you dont have torpor then scm will be more important early. <br />
<br />
Example: Crazy bard pulled a huge train on a run to trak, was 7 juggernauts, 2 Reet Knight, and 1 Reet wizard.  Group was 62 monk, 62 shaman (me), 62 bard, and 59 enchanter. We had shaman buffs only.<br />
<br />
I had to chain cast tnargs on the enchanter about half the time of  the fight as well as keeping everything slowed, everyone else healed, occasional root parking, and dots on the active mob. Fight lasted for 5 canni 5's. <br />
<br />
I ended at full mana and health was full on everyone. Had less than 40 mana for maybe 10 percent of the fight and never went below 20 percent. Enchanter was able to keep things mezzed for the most part but seemed to always have at least one mob on him most times. <br />
<br />
So for me, with can 5 and torpor I dont see a huge need for additional mana savings as the number one priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCM is not a requirement.  I had 100 aa before I got it (101 - 112), and really haven't noticed a huge difference afterwards.<br />
<br />
QB2/3, and SCRM are huge bonuses though.  1800 on every torpor/Q you cast is incredible, even when grouping I cast around a Q per fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the original question, take your unbuffed hp + 10%, and that's what you'll have with nd3.  I got scr1, then qb2, then nd3.  It's quite handy, especially if you're right around the threshold for can5, you want as many hp as possible for using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is really a good point.. my perspective was is a little skewed because I raid a lot and the mob usually throws 2k aes that doesn't let me feel safe canni v and I really don't have time to do anything but tnargs (no time to even canni 4).. but in general I do agree in that sense or xp groups scm is a waste when you can slow, dot chain nuke, heal and still be &gt; 60 m the whole time.. I was main healer (not slower) in pov ec last night and I was clocking 120 dps + 12 from pet and I kept avatar up on 2/3 melee (I had voq though)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OMG!  I wish i could do ND100, it is one of the best AA's we get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate reading these posts :) everytime I think I have my AA path set I read one of these posts &amp; start questioning what I was planning...<br />
<br />
Sofar I have run3, regen3, mc3, canni5 &amp; 5 aa pts banked on the way to MGB.<br />
<br />
From there I was thinking SCR/M for max buff duration. Next I had ca3 (funny thing is I can't find ca3 listed as a shammy aa ability on a casterrelams or a couple of other shammy info pages... is it actaully natural innate agility 3 then onto LRx?) &amp; LR5 on my list followed by RC3 then maybe ND3.<br />
<br />
Do you figure LR5 &gt; ND3 or other way around. Canni5 might be a bit tight for me to use self buffed, right about 3k hps, but with a virtue I get upto around 4500k hp. I find myself with virtue more time than not because I group 95% of the time, so thats why I was going to invest in LR5 before ND3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed Kaneex. I guess the question of the necessity is how good your HP gear is and if you are mostly raiding/grouping or soloing/duoing. I mostly solo/duo and my max self-buffed used to be around 2300 hp. With that few hp, I could not safely use canni 5 during a fight. 80k of gear later plus ND3 I'm at 3100 hp self buffed, and can safely Cann5 during a fight and now I'm swimming in mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Since this thread is active, I'll ask this here. When do you get the first tick increase with Q and scr? I am at scr2, and thinking maybe I should do nd3 next cause my equip is not the greatest, and I could use a bit more padding for can5. I had already decided to do scrm first cause I like the long lasting buffs, and want the big Q. I would think I should be getting and extra tick at scr2, but havent checked it yet as I just trained it before I logged last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ND3 is really great not just because you get extra hp, but because it works so well together with Cann 5.  <br />
<br />
When you have the extra hp buffer, you can Canni more during fights without drawing low hp aggro.  That's a big deal, and it's a hard to measure benefit of ND3.  <br />
<br />
If you already have a ton of hp, then maybe you don't need that, but getting ND3 helped pushed my hp over the threshold, so I can Canni 5 without being at full health and not draw unwanted aggro or be especially vulnerable.  <br />
<br />
SCM is not in the same universe as Cann 5.  If I had it to do over again, I might not even get it again.  I didn't have it, then I got it, and I don't notice any particular difference whatsoever.  I'm sure there is some, but it's not enough to be noticeable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do you figure LR5 &gt; ND3 or other way around <br />
<br />
ND3 is better. As a shaman, most of the damage you take should be self inflicted, LR doesn't help with canni damage or AE. Plus ND3 is 12 pts for improvement, LR costs 27 with CA3 thrown in.<br />
<br />
When do you get the first tick increase with Q and scr? <br />
<br />
SCR3 is 25% increase, Q is 4 ticks. 4 * 1.25 = 5 ticks, meaning you're guaranteed an extra tick at SCR 3. SCRM is a 50% increase, 4 * 1.5 = 6 ticks, so SCRM is another guaranteed tick. The way EQ works though, it's possible to see extra ticks before this depending on when the spell lands.<br />
<br />
Hope that's not too confusing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Think of it this way.....200-250hps is the equivalent of 2-3 pieces of good HP gear for most people.<br />
ND3 is arguably the best thing we get after Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ND3 is nice altho how nice depends on your gear. It seems kinda strange but the worse your gear is the more useful it is for you even tho you get more hps from it as you get more gear. The reason I say it's better the worse you gear is because it gives you room to work with for cann v. With 3k hps self buffed your kinda in the middle there. That enough to be able to cann v safely but not enough that you have a lot to spare if your somewhat hurt. By the time you get to 3 or 4 k unbuffed it's not that big a deal other than bragging rights. If on the other hand your under 2khps unbuffed it's great.<br />
<br />
I've personally found SCM to be a noticable savings on mana altho I never felt like I was hurting for mana in the first place.<br />
<br />
SCRM is great. Making focus last longer especially on MGB is nice. Making q last longer is even better. With maxed aa's and the right focus q becomes a very efficient heal you can use on anyone. Slow yes but very efficient. Ferine avatar lasting longer is also nice.<br />
<br />
CA/LR seems to be nice. Personally I've never parsed any numbers but my feeling tells me I sure seem to survive aggro easier now that I've gotten it and yes it is combat agility. It was added after the fact just like ND for all classes so the sites probably just didn't update thier info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What taraddar said makes sense. I have pretty crappy gear and so I got ND3 right after Canni5. I have no regrets. Working toward SCRM, if that is your option, is also a very good choice.<br />
<br />
Why are you so eager to make Elder? I just dinged AA 200 and am still Venerable. The class-specific abilities suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After cana5 I went for the fun* Spirit Call AA. I did ND3 after that and didnt regret it a bit; I love it; the 250 hps does make a difirence if your gear doesnt take you to over 3k. If you have about 2500hps and cana5 in a middle of the fight in group, the mob is instantly on your arse for low hp agro. <br />
<br />
Once you have about 3k hps 4k mana (unbuffed) and cani5 you pretty much have limitless amount of mana in groups or raids. Rocks for soloing as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What taraddar said makes sense. I have pretty crappy gear and so I got ND3 right after Canni5. I have no regrets. Working toward SCRM, if that is your option, is also a very good choice.<br />

<br />
200 aa seems a bit excessive to me. Personally I didn't hit elder till about 90ish aa's. For me it was Cann v, MGB, Quick buff 2 and scrm that got me my title and I still haven't gotten any new ones since that point but I wouldn't want to skip any of those. It does take a while to get there with the prereqs for cann v and scrm but all worth while skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">like I said also...I think that the trouble that I was having wasn't soo much having not enough mana...it was more like always running out of hps (damn mobs quadding me in the 800s and not getting healed).  So, that is why when it came down to it..I went after SCM1 just after canni5..then I realized that I didn't need more mana..I needed hps...so I went ND3 then decided that since I was dying too much..I went after CA3/LR5 (of course...hit the SCRM first for better torpor/Q).  It has made a huge difference too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tolban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just wondering, what are the AA ability Titles after Venerable?  And what are the requirements for each title?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got my elder title before 60aa's and I felt I spent on the most useful aa's to me at the time (mgb, scrm, qb1 and cannV - all tops in my book).<br />
<br />
I disagree that nd is more important than scr3/scrm.  Q, Haste, FA, any buff for that matter being longer is better than more hp.  I cast buffs constantly every day I group, every time I play (anything that can cause me to do less work (scrm) is a good thing, guess Im a man of convenience).  Really, how often would having 250 more hp save your life?  Especially in PoP.<br />
<br />
So far I have died a grand total of once from low hp agro when a majority of my buffs had run out and I didnt notice, and that was when I had 2200 hp or less unbuffed, maybe if I soloed that would be a different story, but when grouping, how often do you find yourself without a druid or cleric hp buff and focus/sta?  My answer is very very few times, and that should give you enough to cannV whenever you need to, I often cannV when mobs are in camp.<br />
<br />
I even went scm3 before nd3, though nd is now my next focus (dont get me wrong, I do value hp and acknowlege that hp are very important, just not as beneficial as things that I use all the time).  10% savings on every single spell I cast seems more important to me than the risk of dying once every half year or so because I happened to miss my buffs drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Elder is the class title for shamans (and druids and beastlords for that matter). It requires that you spend 24 points in class abilities.</div></div><hr />

We recently did the Carprin ring in CoD. I had 4954 HP during that event.<br />
<br />
One of the mobs did a 5k AoE life drain. *SPLAT*<br />
<br />
I bought some new gear, started working on ND, and while I only have ND2 right now, I had 5337 HP on a raid 2 nights ago.  ND3, which I hope to have today, should add at least another 160 HP to that.<br />
<br />
I will survive next time we do Carprin.<br />
<br />
I got my AA's in this order. RS3, Regen3, HG1, SCF1, SCM2, MC3, Cana V, SCM3, SCRM, MGB, QB3, RC1. Working on ND3 right now, and CA/LR will be next. Not real sure what I will get after that. Lots of things that I want to get still.</div></div><hr />

Nothing in the caprin event has an ae like that. There are 2 mobs that proc a 5k life tap but no ae. <br />
<br />
Even with the 160 more hps you aren't likely to survive.<br />
1) the mob hits for over 1k so if a hit goes with that proc, your still dead.<br />
2) low health aggro is still likely to eat you even if you just get hit by a proc =)<br />
<br />
Best way to survive is not to get aggro on those 2 guys cause they will eat almost anyone rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I may be wrong, but the way ND works is basically increasing your stamina multiplier. for a 65 if I recall correctly the modifier is something like 3.5 hitpoints per stamina, before you hit the soft cap. Natural Durability training will make that number higher, so each point of stamina returns more hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Thus your ND when naked at 100 stamina will return much less of a bonus than when you are dressed and at 200 stamina. I am not sure if buffs have the same effect on ND as stamina on your equipment.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but your wrong.<br />
ND works as a multiplier for anything but pure hps buffs. IE aego, focus, brells, Skin like x etc.<br />
<br />
Sta from gear and buffs. + hps from gear and your base hps are all modified by ND. Anyone with the aa can easily confirm this. Take a peice of gear with no sta on it or sta buffed enough that your maxed either way and take it on an off. Watch your hps change. I can do that with my aow ring. I get 110 hps from equiping the ring because the 10% bonus from nd works on the 100hps from the ring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Do you figure LR5 &gt; ND3 or other way around <br />
<br />
ND3 is better. As a shaman, most of the damage you take should be self inflicted, LR doesn't help with canni damage or AE. Plus ND3 is 12 pts for improvement, LR costs 27 with CA3 thrown in.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't agree with this statement at all, &quot;most of the damage you take should be self inflicted&quot; what does that mean? HPs is needed so that the mob won't kill you after you canni v.. if you are in a situation where the mob is never hitting you (ie you can canni v and not get low hps aggro) then you are golden anyway.. a shaman with bad gear has about 4500 hps with virtue+bss.. ie me :) now if mobs are not gonna hit me, then nd3 gives me 210 more hps = 4700.. who cares? also who cares about lr5 the mob is not hitting me so I should really invest in healing and nuking and avoid all that stuff!? <br />
<br />
In reality most mobs I fight quad for 800-&gt;1300 so that's 3200-&gt;5200 damage.. I NEED them to miss me once specially the 1300 hitters so that makes it 2400-&gt;3900 meaning I got life to spare before sr hits me! So ro didn't miss and I died period, that extra 200 was not going to do anything.. if he did miss me, I would have gone at least 1 more round and died afterwards meaning 5k damage saved from someone else.. RZtW had to go at me for 2 rounds meaning a lot of damage was saved off of someone else! figure if the mob hits for more than nd gives you life, then lr is better because 1 miss &gt; that much life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We recently did the Carprin ring in CoD. I had 4954 HP during that event.<br />
<br />
One of the mobs did a 5k AoE life drain. *SPLAT*<br />
<br />
<br />
something is wrong with this statement,.. must have been a HT to you.. an AoE like that will probably drop even the best guild on the best server.. AoE, whatever caster is not dead is summoned and killed, then the tanks with 5k left will not get heals.. even if it doesn't the first time, the 2nd or 3rd will surely wipe out the crew... I might be wrong, but I really doubt it, my guild is in the elementals right now and I am sure we would die if we faced a 5k aoe atm..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">It's not an AE, it's a single target life drain proc.  It's not 5k either, it's at most 3k =).  Still too much for us to handle in most circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">You're both right.  Some have a 3k lifetap proc, and some have a 5k lifetap proc.  There is, however, no AE in the entire carprin cycle.</div></div><hr />
