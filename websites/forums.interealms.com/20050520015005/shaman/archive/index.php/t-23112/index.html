<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current main is a 57 magician but I am getting tired of the class because our pets get chewed up in about 15 seconds due to our weak heals and the fact that we have no way to slow down the mobs dps.<br />
<br />
My alt is a 53 shaman and im much happier soloing, with the 75 percent slow plus the buffs i put on dog dog I can actually let the pet tank much better than my mages pet could dream of.Plus if there is an add I can just root and slow them till I kill the first one.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I love pet classes that can solo well since all I ever do is solo and my question is, can dog dog still tank at lvl 65 soloing?I dont like the root rot tactic or tanking myself, I just have fun letting my pet slowly chew thru a mobs hp while i Just sit back throwing heals and using canni plus a dot or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not really, our pet is more of a &quot;companion&quot;  then a &quot;pet&quot;   your best bet is to re roll a beastlord or a necro   they got good pets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a 51 beastlord, but I like the shaman much more since I can root adds plus I dont much care for melee classes.I also have a 49 necro but they are lousy at pet tanking for the same reasons a mage is, unless your fighting undead.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman I just wanted to know if I can still pet cleric at 65, right now it works great with the lvl 49 dod dog in POD and similiar zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">our 61 pet can probably just about tank stuff in POJ, but after that it gets chewed up too fast even with slowed mobs.  Mag and bst pet are alot stronger, and if you like a pet class probably a beast is better. for soloing shaman mainly either root/rot or stand toe to toe (if they can) and rot, with pet helping with damage.<br />
<br />
mainly shaman pet is just a little more dps.<br />
<br />
you cant pet cleric at 65, least anywhere you get ok exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Simple answer, no.  Having just dinged 65 a few days ago, I can tell you that once you get past PoJ/PoI and into places like PoV and BoT, the mobs just hit too hard and the pets hp are too low (even with buffs) for doggy to tank.  You will spend more time healing the pet and trying to keep it alive than it will be worth.  If you solo in PoV for example (where I do now as a level 65 with 11 aa's) you will root and rot.  I put the dog in guard mode in case I get an add, he acts like a speed bump so I have time to VP the add.  IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 65 I can solo the SS wing in BoT, and I let my pet tank.  I just buff with Fo7, Regen, SLTW, FA and keep quiesence on him.  Pet weapons help as well.  It may take a while to kill this way but the xp is better than most places, unless you have access to PoF where you wont need to worry about solo'ing.  Same strat can be used in PoT and PoV as well, but your pet wont last long in Tactics against the diakus.  Just have to do a little testing with the different mobs in the zones and get a feel for what you can do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pet has tanked for me in the following zones:<br />

<br />
Just a guess he could probably tank in pretty much any tier one plane, although I haven't spent any time in tier one planes recently.<br />
<br />
By tank I mean I pull 2 blue con mobs put pet on one and kill the other without having to worry too much about him dying off.<br />
<br />
If you want pet to tank is plane of fire, or Kod'Taz then you are smoking crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a 65 Mage a lot will change when you get Son of Rathe. That thing is a beast. Add to that you can always summon up pet toys anytime you want. ;)<br />
<br />
Though when soloing in places where mob dps is too high for healing you can chain pet. With the earth pet if you do it right the mob will be rooted for the few seconds that you're in between pets. Get summoning haste items and an item with reclaim energy so you get mana back from killing your pet making it more mana effecient. <br />
<br />
Though you can't slow mobs you will have some great burst DPS to make up for it.<br />
<br />
Earth pets work pretty good for handling an add too. If you get two mobs on a pull Earth pets tend to root one mob then go after the other. <br />
<br />
A 65 Shaman can have dogdog tank in a lot of older content, the same places a Mage can solo. Only Mages can often take down mobs much much faster due to higher DPS.<br />
<br />
Where Shamans have an edge is in tougher content that Mages can't solo (Higher PoP zones and GoD) but the way we solo there is by root rotting. If dogdog is up, we only have him up to act as a speed bump.</div></div><hr />

Yup, that's a good list of where I let dogdog tank (&amp; tier1 PoP).  :)  He's a stopgap tank in Tactics.  Buffed &amp; with a Q on, he can last until Q wears out plus 5-10 seconds, which is plenty long enough for me to get control of a rough situation that would have killed me w/o him being there.  On tough pulls where I'm expecting adds, I Q dogdog and myself beforehand and let 'er rip.  Whenever I'm grouped with a druid on adventures, I always ask for a 9 for him, which greatly enhances his survivability and doesn't cost a peridot.  Good use of /pet hold can keep him alive as an off-tank in cases where you normally might just write him off.<br />
<br />
Is our 61 pet a mean tanking machine like a 65 Mage's pet?  No.  But he can serve as a tank with the improved Q reliably enough that pet tanking dark blue cons can be an effective (if somewhat Beastlordesque) strategy for getting exp.  I personally hardly ever use him to tank instead of myself (except temporarily to get slow in), but different strokes for different folks. :D  Pet tanking start-finish the way a mage solos isn't a widely used method for most shaman.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As others have said, Tier 1 PoP is probably the limit of where our pet can tank full time. After that, you'll find that it's good for letting you get slow and get a few dots off when soloing, with diminishing returns as you progress.<br />

I would ask why do you want your pet to tank 60+?  All my combat on my shaman has either been root rotting or tanking whatever mob it is we are fighting after slowing it, and using dogdog to give me slow-time.  I see the shaman's primary modes of dealing with mobs solo are straight up tanking or root-rotting, and trying to use the pet-tank isn't as efficient.<br />
<br />
I've always seen my shaman as a poor but very functional tank especially surrounded by all other pure casters, and as a casual player I have sub-VT gear and about 50aa.<br />
<br />
I think of my shaman as the tank and the dog as the distraction, like an SK does I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pet can tank lots of stuff w/ Q on it<br />
<br />
A lot of things can tank with Q on them.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">anything your pet can tank you can tank must better in TEH FACE<br />
<br />
factor in the fact that your pet cant taunt any combination of dots off you<br />
<br />
if you're using pet to tank when you solo 1)you're wasting mana healing pet too much 2)you're wasting time not doing enough DPS<br />
<br />
either way if you find that you're happy with your pet's ability to tank for you in zones XYZ, you're just not soloing very effectively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not that I want him to tank, but dogdog has off-tanked slowed mobs in PoD, CoD, PoV with a Q on him with no prob... he at least runs good interference on over-pulls if you get him Q'd fast.  An occasional Tnarg's to overcome RNG spotty damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Dog-Dog is inferior to tanking monsters yourself. After around level 60, unless you are leveling in teh old world, the dog poofs after about 2 rounds of combat. You can heal him and keep up with it for longer periods of time, but it is extremely mana-inefficient. Remember also that coming from a mage to a shaman your loss of DPS will be HUGE. My shaman, before I quit, could solo giants in Bastion of Thunder. 'Could' meaning he was capable of doing it without dying. Each one took about 10 minutes though because my only tools were DoT's that chewed up way more mana than they were worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok...but dog dog still does the job...hence the answer to the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">not really, our pet is more of a &quot;companion&quot;  then a &quot;pet&quot;   your best bet is to re roll a beastlord or a necro   they got good pets<br />
<br />
I don't understand this saying people use.  Is it just because the spells call them spiritual companions in text, or do you think that a companion is weaker than a pet?  To me companion is someone of equal status that is with you, and a pet is something lower in power than you.  Let's say I was married to a 400 pound, 7 foot woman named Bertha, and she was my companion for life.  And we have a pet kitty cat named Mister Fluffywuffums.  <br />
<br />
One's a pet, one's a companion.  Which do you think is tougher?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;I would ask why do you want your pet to tank 60+? &quot;<br />
<br />
I let dog dog tank because I enjoy playing pet cleric, Its fun for me.Melee and root rotting on the other hand are quite boring.The second I start playing EQ to be efficient I will quit the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In reality, the shaman is a much better tank than dogdog.<br />
<br />
When I solo, I tank for dogdog.  I'm a much better tank than dogdog because I last WAY longer than him, and it allows him to attack from behind, which increases his melee dps a little.<br />
<br />
The only real time I let dogdog tank--provided it's not an OH %#$%!!! moment--is on incoming, when he tanks the unslowed mob as I slow it.  If slow bounces and he manages to hold agro, he usually enrages when they beat him into low hp, and he enrage tanks the mob til I get it slowed and wade into melee range to take the mob off him.  It works fairly well.<br />
<br />
He also pulls the job of off tanking adds til I get them slowed and root parked.<br />
<br />
So, if you want a tank, look more into doing the tanking yourself.  You'll be better at it, and it's much more fun.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The answer here depends on what you consider tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im 65. As a example, last night i was doing VP quests and puppy was tanking very well for me in chardokB. Properly buffed and equiped, puppy isnt that bad at all. Make sure you buff his AC and his AGI. They seem to make a considerable difference to him.<br />
<br />
But pretty much anything in tier 2 or higher PoP, he is a very short speed bump in the way of any mob that wants to east you. In that equation he is just a mana free DoT to help the DPS of the group your in. But lets face it, if your in tier 2 PoP content, soloing isnt the way to go anyway, grouping is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I understand you not wanting to melee, 'cause that is boring, and I think I understand the method of play you are most interested in.  I would caution against using your shaman this way, because in the end our pets are worse than shadowknight pets (there are some threads to that effect around here somewhere).<br />
<br />
Also, you might not have gathered, when people say they are tanking with their shaman 60+, they usually don't mean they have auto attack on AFAIK.  I never did, it was pointless, but I suppose a shaman with a haste belt and an elemental weapon, buffed, would melee.  <br />
<br />
Also I think a shaman 'tanking' is kind of natural, from playstyle, for our class.  We slow the mob, and we have HoT, and we have madd agro from our dots, so you can't help but tank it,unless you are root rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wouldn't let dog dog tank anything if I could help it, because frankly I hate resummoning, rebuffing, and requiping him. I'd much rather be spending the mana needed to heal him to do dps. <br />
<br />
My gear isn't exactly great and I still tank in solro (not solo mind you, need another healer with my gear). On the other hand unless he engrages dog dog is nothing more then a wolf-fur throw rug for a 65 mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think people are calling the pet a &quot;companion&quot; because of some BS put out by Sony in words to that effect. I think this was their answer to &quot;why isn't doggy tougher?&quot;<br />
<br />
Due to the pain of keeping him alive I was one of those shamans that never had my pet up, but recently I have changed my ways and he is always there. More for his tanking ability than his dps. Basically he will keep an add from a bad pull or similar busy for a few seconds. Those vital few seconds where i can root/slow/Spirit call the mob.<br />
<br />
On the DPS side of things I've noticed equipping him with the mage fire/ice proccing combo and hasting him helps a lot. However he only has around 2k HP so in PoP/GoD he dies very fast.<br />
<br />
When I act as puller in hard ldons, a good cleric will heal my pet to keep himalive for the next pull. That works well.<br />
<br />
If you want a pet that can truly tank and heal him etc, go for Beastlord as a class imho. That's what they do all the way up to  lvl 65. /yawn<br />
<br />
I wouldn't give up my doggy for the world now, but you have to look after him!</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, that's pretty much it. At some point in the past, in response to a question to CS about why shaman pet sucked so badly in comparison to all the other classes (except druids--and their &quot;companion&quot; was added to the game much later) with pets, the response was something along the lines of &quot;Shaman were never supposed to have a pet, your dog is a companion.&quot; Pretty much the same answer we got when we asked why our Invis spell sucked....&quot;Shaman weren't supposed to have invis at all, it was a mistake, so leave it alone or we might take it away again!&quot; and our single fire-based spell....&quot;That was a mistake, shaman were never supposed to have any fire-based spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to wonder just how much of what a shaman is, is based on &quot;mistakes.&quot;<br />

Just wondering, if it's not a pet but a companion, why do they give us pet specific spells like Spirit Quickening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I agree with the others that using the pet to tank is no longer the most efficient way to solo at 65.<br />
<br />
But to answer the question, the pet is pretty capable when buffed up and you have Q to keep him alive.  For example, my pooch was offtanking a level 60 add in the nobles area of Veksar the other night for several minutes while we dealt with the other mobs.  A couple of Q's kept him going.  Not bad at all, really.<br />
<br />
I also used to use him for pet tanking while soloing in Plane of Growth back in the day.</div></div><hr />
