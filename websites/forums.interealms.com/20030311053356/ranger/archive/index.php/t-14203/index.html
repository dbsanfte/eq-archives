<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at 163 in fletching. I have hit the wall. I am spending a lot, making a lot of arrows and getting NO increase in points. I have repeatedly read about people who have Dex at 200...220...even 255, but when I ask guildmates what kind of stuff I can buy the will give me 100 Dex points they laugh.How can I get my dex way up?<br />
<br />
I have heard of a Geerlok device. I have read that people use them to level up more successfully in fletching by using one. I am not sure what it is nor where I can get one. Clearly vendors do not sell them, so I assume they are tinkered. When I have one, what do I do with it? How will this thing help me fletch more successfully?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Geerlock improves combine success rates, it does not increase the rate you gain skill.<br />
<br />
There's a separate thread listing Dex gear, do a search for it and buy the best stuff you can afford.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rather than checking the listing posted here, go and do two things. <br />
<br />
First, check your bazaar, for any cheap dex gear.  Get what you need from there.<br />
<br />
Second, tether an enchanter by you when you do a fletching session, and get a Boon of the Garou.  this short term buff adds 100 dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aradel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or bug a high level shamen for a longer +70 dex buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DEX, DEX, DEX.  It's all about the DEX.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
A Geerlok tool (which is tinkered by gnome players) increases your effective skill.  All this does is give you better success rates.  It DOES NOT change the rate of skillups.<br />
<br />
DEX increases the rate of skillups.  Especially 255+.<br />
<br />
Click on my name in my sig for my Magelo profile, then go to the &quot;BIO&quot; section and look for &quot;Mianu's Profile&quot;.  That's my wife's setup, and she has a separate profile for Fletching Gear.  That gear may give you some ideas for upgrades.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you get a DEX buff, get one from a Shaman (group Focus is nice).  DO NOT get Boon of the Garou from an enchanter unless you are FAR AWAY from all NPC's that will kill you in werewolf form.</div></div><hr />
