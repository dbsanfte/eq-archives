<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The salty air and streaming light startled the eleven maiden awake. Sounds from the harbor and smells of sizzling meat jolted her into reality, that this was not the open plains and quiet streams she was used to camping by. The familiar sounds of soft rumbling snores reassured her that all was well in her world. Quietly Zelfani rose from the rumpled bed and gazed at her handsome warrior husband, so peaceful as last she thought. She quietly slipped on her soft tunic and breeches, tugged on her golden boots, then headed to the window. <br />
<br />
The harbor was rousing to the morning activities. Sailors and travelers assembling on the docks awaiting the familiar hail “BOAT!!”. The sounds of the vendors warming up their vocal cords for a long day of chanting became a distant drone as her thoughts started to drift to the past adventures. How different this is from the Plane of Air from which we just spent the past couple of days in she thought. There you can almost reach out and touch the moon. The air is so crisp and clean. The sounds are so sharp and distinctive. The lure of death and danger looms at every movement. <br />
<br />
Slowly aches from recently healed wounds and shadows of horrid deaths forced her to move about the room. She gazed upon Rizz’s weapon sheath and there was the prize. The Spiroc Wingblade glistened aching to see battle and to wet itself in the enemy’s blood. Yet, there lurked a mystical glow around it that hinted at a far deeper purpose. The purpose that sent this brave warrior and his many friends to the far off plane. Soon she thought, soon my love, you will fulfill your destiny. <br />
<br />
A soft knocking at the door roused her to the portal. A young lad bearing a tray of sweetmeats, drinks and a cup of steaming brew brought a quick smile to the suddenly hungry maiden’s lips. She picked up a shiny platinum coin and slipped into the lad’s hands. The gasp from his lips brought a quick smile as she lifted the tray from his hands. The little servant stared at the coin and tried to speak. Zelf closed his fingers over the coin and said quietly, “bring a bath and fresh brew when the master arises and it is all yours.” Excitedly the lad bobbed his head in agreement and dashed down the stairs.<br />
<br />
She gathered a small plate of bits of meat, egg, and fruits and with her cup of brew returned to the window ledge. As she nibbled on the tasty morsels her thoughts returned to the past days events. The those who stood and fought bravely, to those who died countless times to ensure the success of the raid, the ones who offered their fortunes to support the raid and the new friends who blindly accepted the challenge and followed the one known as RIZZ. <br />
<br />
A sudden weariness crept over her as she thought of the many trips the wizards Jlove and Nindalf made to get the raid force ready. Then later to be joined by Adelrune. She thought of the sullen task those with the mystical skills to summon the dead preformed tirelessly, Sarconus, Jice, Nafton, and Razma. She knew in her heart that with out them, the raid was lost from the beginning. She remembered the sweet songs being played by the bards, Aiela and Znich, who kept everyone’s spirits alive and well charged. An ache in her shoulder, reminded her of the soft healing touch the raid clerics performed over and over again, sometimes without a thank you, Hammerstalker, Knarlz, Boroque, Klayla, Cshae, Samani, and Jordyne. A quick smile was summoned as she remembered gathering the mod rods quickly supplied by our mage, Bemidian. He seemed to always be ready to help with his special skills.<br />
<br />
A slight tremor reminded her of the tranquil soft breezes that cleared the thoughts of raid force and addled the thoughts of the foes. The enchanters stood brave and fearless against the mightiest of demons, often paying with their lives. Daelen, Sinfutura, and Burien were to be commended for their gallant efforts. A slight frown crinkled Zelf’s forehead as she thought of the taxing work Blumgan preformed without so much as a whimper. She knew he worked swiftly and with no concern for his own will being yet knew her friend Vhela longed to complete the journey she had started with the raid force. Next time my friend she thought, next time.<br />
<br />
A sudden crash down below startled the druidess. She jumped up and set ready to cast as in battle. She called out, “Sup Heal on Zelfani!!” The sounds of her own voice jolted her to reality. Quickly she looked at her sleeping prince. He was still wrapped in the arms of slumber. A shiver ran down her spine as she recalled hearing those words by her druid friends, Klydon, Animalore,and Boogahz. She knew the anxiety that was felt as cast after cast was made to keep group members alive only to see them fall in battle. She knew the feelings of success when the targets lived and the pain when they fell. There were the rogues, Bagfra and Bobcats, ready to ply their skills and swords. A casual thought to Bagfra and his quest for his lost pants. Hmmm she wondered, was that Burien who had them last?? <br />
<br />
A movement down below caught her eye. A young lad was jumping and trying to kick a dock post. A muffled chuckle rose as she wondered if many seasons ago that could have been Chmee as he set his path to being a humble monk. She knew he had learned much from a guild elder who started the raid but was unable to finish, Ryutono. He was always there in spirit. Another lad jumped in with a stick. He struck a stance as if to do battle with the budding monk. Ahh, the warrior blood boils at a young age she thought. The warriors who fought that day, Rizz, Waran, Wulfran, Larain, Tannin, and Sinda, so eager to slay the beast. Who willingly and fearlessly challenged each beast with their swords and skill knowing that darkness was always a reality. The paladins who challenged the evil with their swords of righteousness, Drolgin, Lianna, Kilap, and Snydaen. Their purity of mind made them a formable force. <br />
<br />
Whoosh!! The air around Zelfani’s head was quickly disturbed as a leather glove was tossed just behind her head. With a startled look, her first thought was to the ranger, Valforth, who with his quickness and sharp shooting skills pulled many targets safely to their deaths. There was also Nolani who with her ranger skills assisted in the kills. Her eyes followed the flight path of the glove, knowing where it would hail from, to see her warrior price awake among the pile of blankets. A quick smile found its way to her lips as she bounded across the room to his outstretched arms. <br />
<br />
The memories of the battles in Air were set aside as the two rumbled amongst the bedding. Yet the heroes of the past days events arose to walk proudly on the grounds of Norrath. Keepers of the Elements carved out another building block for it to continue to grow upon. New challenges lie ahead as more quests are completed and monsters are to fall. Yet together and with our friends, we did what was scoffed at by many and we did it with great success due to the outstanding efforts of those who participated. Friends come and go, our memories of our victories with them will remain forever. Let us all remember each with pride and know that on those days, each one in the Plane of Air was truly a Keeper at heart.<br />
<br />
Soon there is pounding upon the door and the sound of dorfs, already well into their drinks, bring the reality of the world back into the haven of the small room. Rizz calls out, “Downstairs you drunken sots and call for a keg of the house finest to be tapped. I will be there in seconds if I can pry the fair lady Zelf off my poor bones.” A round of hearty laughter is heard among the cheers as the hearty group stumbled and rolled down the inn stairs. Calls to the innkeeper for the best ales in the house could be heard up the stairs. The rumpled warrior smiled to his love, and said, “I must go, there are songs to be sung and battles to be refought. Come join us love and as we celebrate.” Together the couple rose to join the revelry as the call went out to the guild to come and join the fun.</div></div><hr />
