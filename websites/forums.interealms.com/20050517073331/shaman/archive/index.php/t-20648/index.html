&quot;Just helped Aaaze today getting his PoF piece and seems Sony has changed the PoF part a bit. Now, instead of spawning Ireblind from the death of any normal scarelings, a mob called &quot;Enraged Imp&quot; is spawned. It's spawning from scareling death is still random and we got it spawned at around our 12th scareling kill. The &quot;Enraged Imp&quot; is a big red imp model like Ireblind and is non-aggro. No AE, no RE, no flurry, no spells, just straight forward melee damage. Hp is more of a scareling but not that much, think about 10k hp or so. Upon it's death it spawns Ireblind directly though. Guess they added a non-aggro spawn in the step to avoid people doing other classes' epic getting wiped from Ireblind. Anyway, without Ireblind surprise spawning, this could be good for us too, since we can clear Fear old style with killing scarelings first and keep the Enraged Imp till we have the camp area cleared before spawning Ireblind for kill.&quot;<br />

I saw this guy spawn when we went into Fear to get my tear this week. Not being too familiar with Fear, I wasn't sure if it was a new mob or not. I am pretty sure he agro'd us, but we were fighting a lot of mobs at the time. As the Ireblind was already up when we went in, he didn't spawn from this guy once he went down. We had managed to avoid the Ireblind, which I believe was along the west wall, by clearing from the south.<br />
<br />
Definitely good info to know for next time.</div></div><hr />
