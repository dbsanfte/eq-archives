<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok basically with that amount of cash you can buy jack****. =) All i can recommend atm is try to buy a set of banded and remember ac/hp over wis due to cannibalize line of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, 150 plat is not a whole lot, and you will not be able to buy any major upgrades with that, but do not despair.<br />
<br />
First, lets get some perspective here: <br />
<br />
At your level, wisdom is almost irrelevant. Every point of +wisdom will, at level 8, give you a bit less than 2 points of additional mana! So, getting +wisdom items is not really a high priority. Certainly, +wis does not take priority over +mana or +hp or even, in my opinion, AC.<br />
<br />
Ok, as for upgrades...first, it is important to get something in every slot - and even if that &quot;something&quot; is just AC, thats fine. If necessary, make yourself some patchwork, or do the boots / belt / quests from the miller twins outside Surefall. Do the Initiate Symbol Quest from Halas / Qeynos. Even putting patchwork armor in a spare slot will make a difference to your PvE ability<br />
<br />
Ok, once you have something in every slot, then you should head to the bazaar. There are often great bargains to be picked up in the bazaar - gear that used to go for literally hundreds of plat can sell nowadays for very little - basically, spend some time in the /bazaar window with the shaman filter going through each slot. you should be able to find a few pieces that have AC and some +stats or + resists that are only in the 20 - 50 plat range<br />
<br />
if you want to make some good money while you are in the bazaar, farm silks and pelts and sell them in trader mode while you are looking for gear.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would buy blackened alloy armor in preference over banded armor - similar AC, less weight and often a few +stats too. People used to buy banded for the Totemic Armor quests when they got to level 20+, but these days, Totemic armor has been superceded by so many other armors that are easier and/or cheaper to obtain, so most people don't even bother with the Totemic Quests, which is, IMO, a pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">See if you can pick up a Charred Guardian Shield in the Bazaar.  Should be cheap enough for you.  AC 12 9 wisdom if I recall correctly but its been a very very long time since I equipped one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What race are ya?  Can you get some friends to UGuk?  If so Kill the Giant Heart Spider, pick up a Chiton Shell Protector (Think Banded BP + 10poison+ and a Chiton Shell Shield (Red and Black thing with +10 poison too)...plus keepin the spiders clear will get you some nice low level sellables, and silks.<br />
<br />
If your a Troll (and why wouldn'y ya be?), do the froglok skin mask and Inny necklace quests(halfling skin mask is a fun bonus).</div></div><hr />
