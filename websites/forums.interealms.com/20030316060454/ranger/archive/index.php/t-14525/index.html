<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>transer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the Trueshot Long bow quest you give Jyle Windshot<br />
a small lantern for Treant Wood. I got wood shavings<br />
is this the same thing?<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naomiy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im not exactly sure. It has been a long time since I did that quest. I do know that there is a fake Jyle Windshot that wont give you the right items if you give him lanterns. You shoudl get treant wood. And keep giving him lanterns until you get a treant heart. It's used to upgrade your bow later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, it is Treant Wood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, if you do it enough you'll also get a heart with is used in teh raincaller quest i believe.  might as well get one while you are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are TWO of him in Freeport. The one you want is in the Hog Callers Inn i do believe. It is the one in WFP with the brewing barrel right next to the door if that helps any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes, he has a twin and go for the one WFP by the Inn, I turned in a few extra lanterns and got a Treant heart which I saved for the Raincaller Bow quest/update.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jnyman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What level should I be before I try this quest, and what skil in fletching should I have before I attempt to make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could probably take the Rogue Clockwork and Runaway Clockwork spiders at around level 12, but to fletch the bow you should probaly get your Fletching up to around 130 or higher before you attempt it. Just be sure to stock-up on the parts needed. Get as much Treant Wood as you can, then on the boatride back from Freeport get off at Sister Island and get as many Kiola Nuts as you can carry, hopefully making it back on the boat before it takes off again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flea_2010</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fletched my TRUESHOT LONGBOW at level 22 with a fletching of just 80, on my first attempt.  Had all the compponents and sat in the Ranger guild fletching non-stop for about 90 minutes and was going blind making arrows, tried the combine and BAM! You have created a new item: TRUESHOT LONGBOW.<br />
<br />
Have read a lot about making the bow and there aren't any definites.  Totally random on the attempt to combine. Have seen rangers sub 50 in fletching make it and rangers with upwards of 100 in fletching fail.  Logic suggests, the higher your fletching, the higher your probability in making it.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you get enough goods to have 4-5 attemtps at making the bow.<br />
<br />
I have all of the pieces you need for the TRUESHOT LONGBOW quest, except maybe the spiderling silks which are easy to acquire.  Send me a TELL if you are on the TERRIS THULE server and I will give you the goods, so you can attempt to make the bow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is what's funny is that with my raw Fletching at 203 and using a Geerlock, I have a better success rate making Shaped Shadewood Compound Bows than I do making Trueshots. Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another possible way of doing this is by going to the Karanas and track down the necro in the zone, because you know he is killing treants. That is how I got all my stuff when I did it as I was camping the Thunderhoof fella who drops the quiver.</div></div><hr />
