<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i am currently lvl 61 and this is my gear<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=536791 <br />
<br />
I currently know that this is the gear i wish to acheive (an acheivable goal too)<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=629427 <br />
<br />
Some of the stuff i can aquire through my guild (which does raid hot/vindi easily).  I am currently flagged for PoV/PoS but all that means is i can mad exp. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to find out where all u other shamans make ur plat from.  I'm dirt poor seriously, and i need to find a way to make plat yet still have fun playing when i'm doing it.  I realize one good way would be to farm items, but where can i do this solo and safely?  <br />
<br />
I currently have spell:malo so slowing any mob shouldn't be difficult so any suggestions would be great.  Please tell me the plat making secrets!!!! Bah and don't try to sell it to me in no book (lol remember those).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My favorite two cash spots are plane of growth and the NG (guard) camp in sebilis.  The latter is usually camped but PoG generally has plenty of mobs for me.  Both camps drop alot of gems and such that you sell to vendors, so make sure you have a pair of opal-encrusted steins (25cha each) and buff your charisma when selling.  Also, some vendors don't pay as much as others so be sure to 'shop around'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went to Droga last night and used DS potions to AE the place .. walked out a few hours later with about 500p+ hehe.<br />
<br />
But you don't really want to do that cause it's tedious (not exactly boring!).  I would suggest camping PoG or Sebilis, maybe Chardok for some bazaar fodder.  Another good place to check out is Nadox, as there are some nice mid to upper level drops as well as gems and FS-type weapons you can sell.  Also some excellent gear drops in Torgiran Mines if you know where to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not the best soloer ~ I grouped all my exp to 49 and about 2/3 of it since then.  But I'm soloing quite easily in Nadox.  I find I get about 100p worth of sellables / blue on average not counting the sellable neck I got since I equipped it.  The mobs I'm fighting at the zonein would I think be too low but if you move in they should still be dark blue.  Also the drops for pure blood are here so it is a good zone to get to know.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i lasoo the flying cow in west karana and milk pp from its udder   <br />
<br />
(rare spawn in the north of the zone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to &quot;buy low/sell for higher&quot; in the bazaar.<br />
I.e. buy an iksar regen BP for 4kpp, sell for 7kpp.<br />
or buy Malo/Torpor for 5kpp and resell for 30kpp. $$<br />
Obviously you may need to start small depending on how much plat you have. Also never be afraid to send someone a tell offering EVEN LESS than what they are asking....<br />
<br />
Takes awhile to learn the prices of stuff.<br />
It used to be more fun in the old days of the East Commons Tunnel.<br />
<br />
Now days I make plat from selling Tae Ew Shields/Barbarian Cultural Armor/etc/etc.<br />
<br />
However it took me 2 months of no exping to get from smithing 188 to max mod skill (thankfully I got a +10% smithing belt so 230 skill is max mod skill for me).<br />
<br />
You could pharm Ice Giants in Permafrost or you could make plat from doing low level tradeskill combines (i.e. Celestial essences cost like 2 plat to make and sell for 7 plat each... sell 1000 = 5kpp profit). Lots of clicking involved though!!<br />
Other stuff you could learn to make easily are: Leather Padding or maybe Heady Kiola's.<br />
Just make sure you get a decent number of skill points (like maybe 20 or 30 for low skill items) over the item's trivial to cut down failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhugrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a tank friend or two and camp ft3 boots in cazic thule, easy as a duo. With a bit luck you can get a pair in 4 hours, sell for 60k pp in bazaar, bingo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ft3 boots? little more info on where they drop etc please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">eheh i do the slow and steady way lol I sell sow potions and whatever i am skilling up on with the alchemy at the time. . its slow but put a bunch on the mule overnight they always sell out and i make 200-400pp a night on that. . I do it ~ 2 times a week.  I also go to Everfrost and do IG's as well as lvled in OOT killlin' Seafurys for a long time to get gems for loots and Gornit for pp. Hmm what else. . Oh yeah! I now farm in Dulak . . even when camps are full the gems and the weapons sell real weell, 2 hrs = 400pp for me eaach time no fail. . now thats going solo of corse. . . :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Find a rogue, and duo the crypt in Sebilis. Only worth while if you can stay a good while (3-4 hrs maybe), but you have the chance of getting some really good stuff, including malo and torpor from the Emperor if you are really lucky.<br />
<br />
ODS - ~10k<br />
JBB - ~20k<br />
Heiro cloak - ~12k<br />
Numerous other bits for a few hundred pp each<br />
Gems to sell to vendors<br />
<br />
A lot depends on luck, but go there a few times and your time will come. And when the rogue can't make it, NG and DHall/Disco 1 offer good cash from gems. I made about 2600pp from one KEI's worth of soloing NG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FT3 boots are in the cazic thule sewers, boots of flowing slime.  Pretty decent as far as droppable items go and can go for quite a bit, sold my pair when i upgraded for 75k.  Was almost enough inspiration to farm them duo style as I know people who do this and make mad amounts of cash between that and mosquito leg earring (drops in same camp) along with the other gimp loots each name can drop.  This was my favorite camp to be before PoP... but now.. the exp return isnt that great and the names are too infrequent to justify farming imo.  But i'm not on the poor boy special atm either :)</div></div><hr />
