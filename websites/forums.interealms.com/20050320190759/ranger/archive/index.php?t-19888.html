<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pitchelo</div><div class="date">03-11-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No group chats, no zone chats, no direct tells of any kind unless its through rare magic items, spells,  or familiars. <br />
<br />
Make shouts have a longer range than /say obviously, but not throughout a whole zone. This would make spying on others viable, browsing through a bazaar more fun, chat spam less of a problem, and overall make things more realistic.<br />
<br />
Of course, this would annoy a lot of people and make it harder to keep track of friends, so maybe it would be better suited to a roleplaying server or something.<br />
<br />
Some interesting things could come from this though.<br />
<br />
Mail system: Bards/rangers/rogues could have a profession, delivering messages to people. Tracking would be essential!<br />
<br />
Familiars: You could send your familiar to speak with someone else, different familiars would travel at various speeds and differing intelligence would affect how many words/letters you could send. Druids/rangers/magic users would benefit greatly from this.<br />
<br />
Spying: Stealthy characters could eavesdrop on other people/guilds/groups. <br />
<br />
Travel: if you get lost, you cant just shout for directions or /tell that friend with a second comp to go look up a map for you. This would be a good thing for roleplaying rangers who could get to know a zone and check their tracking for people who may get lost and show them around. <br />
<br />
Best of all: Nobody shouts DING!!!! and if they do, youre probably too far away to hear it.</div></div><hr />

I tried the FV server for a while, but found the constant shouting, /oocing, /auctioning, etc. killed the roleplaying feel. Sure, you can turn the channels off so you don't have to listen, but if everyone else is talking in them, the overall atmosphere isn't going to be RP. <br />

OMG, OMG! I completely forgot about those!<br />

<br />
Yes, I'm all in favor of a &quot;true&quot; roleplaying environment and I like these suggestions. Hell, I'd kinda like it if they'd do that for the new server coming up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevandal</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That all sounds like a great idea.<br />
<br />
It would be awesome, except they should make the bazaar be able to hear everyones auction / shout, and certain other zones open like that.  Also, I think everyone on your buddy list should be able to communicate freely.  And guild too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then people would just add whomever they want to send a tell to their friends list then remove them afterwards Nevandal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celadreal</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love this, it makes meeting people, unless you know them in RL and can give them a call, a happy coincidence. It would definitly be more of a roleplay server thing. I would love being able  to walk through the forest and stumble upon someone lost and lead them out. Also this would help GM events so when one starts we dont see all of Norrath flocking to the site of the GM event if your lucky enough to be there when it happens well... your lucky. I would like to see a mail system though, in towns there is a place that you can go to send out a letter via carrier pigeon. It takes a couple of hours for the  pigeon to land on the person's shoulder and give the message. This would help for people who wanted to organize the guild  together, it would take longer and it would be much harder to get the entire guild together but it would possible. You could also keep up with friends and arrange meetings, again it would take longer but that eliminates the little chit-chatting that the elimination of special communication wanted. also special close quarters chatting could exist like whispering (it has the same range as saying only you can speak with someone individually it they are close enough by whispering to them.) and perhaps others would see a whisper emote like you avatar cupping their hand near their mouth and leaning over towards someone.</div></div><hr />
