<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about one of the following to options:<br />
<br />
1) An AA disc that will allow our next DoT to be AoE. This will work the same was that Torrent of Poison works, but will hit up to 4 mobs if there are 4, Will stack the DoT 2 times on 2 mobs, or 3 times on 1 mob. Disc refresh every 12 minutes.<br />
<br />
2) Give us a Poison and Disease DoT to do the above.<br />
<br />
And while you are at it. Since Sony have forced the shaman to spend their hard earned money buying LoY to quest a spell that was taken away so they are forced to spend money and time to get it back. AND, at the same time in giving Druids and Clerics a 1 spell cure to the entire shaman DoT attack, why not give us a cure to every single Druid/Cleric DoT in a single spell to compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well first off Clr dots are undead only so it would pretty much be useless to have a cure for it. Druid dots are another matter tho.<br />
<br />
Has for the dot I think that would be way over powered. Has is you can already stack.. Blood, Bane, EB, Breath, Pox, plague, then throw in the mutt and 5 SC pets. This is depending on your LV, Spells you have and AA's of corse. And if they did give us something like this it would problly have a very low damage like say 20hp a tick per wave for a max of 60hp per tick, and with a very long cast time that would make it faily well useless.<br />
<br />
just my 2 copper :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While there may be a couple of instances where this might be useful, in general i dont think its a good idea. Especially when yo uget to the level where everything summons when its hurt enough (around 97% health). You would ae dot, which not only would break chanters mezzing the off target mobs, it would gain you a ton of aggro and when the dot did enough damage all of the mobs would start summoning you at once. <br />
<br />
Interesting idea, but count me out on this one.</div></div><hr />
