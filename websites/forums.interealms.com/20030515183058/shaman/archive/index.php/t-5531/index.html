Xilniov is the name.  He is like the thought horror fiends in the deep.  A named that spawns in Echo Caverns. Class enchanter and supposedly level 52 to 55?  Not sure....<br />

<br />
Thought it would be fun and a challenge to see if I could solo him.  From other posts says that he hits for about 250 and not sure if he can be slowed.  He also has the regular enchanter pluses like mez etc.   Anyone ever try this guy he is a triggered spawn maybe wasn't sure on the details.  Killed the taskmaster 4 times and no pop.   Looked like something fun to do, but not sure if I will die or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>revere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was warned, by a monk who I had seen working this spot for xp for 3 levels, that there was a chance that this guy would spawn if you clear all the skellies around the Taskmaster.<br />
<br />
I never did,  cos I was chicken, and he never popped, so give it a go and GL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hunted the Taskmaster and skellies at 51-52 .  Great exp, lousy cash.<br />
<br />
Xil spawned three times for me, conned white at 52 each time.  He will despawn in something like 15 to 20 mins.  I have been told that it would be pretty foolish to try to solo this guy.  <br />
<br />
The link above has a post about 7 low 50's getting waxed by him about 2 tries out of 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK, Xilinov does not spawn based on the presence of absence of the skellies/taskmaster.  I have seen the Taskmaster spawn after Xilnov is up, and both were there until Xilnov despawned (about 15 mins is my guess).<br />
<br />
I have seen Xilnov 5 - 6 times,  on one occasion a regular Thought Horror spawned, then despawned and Xilnov popped immediatly after.  Only seen that one time, other times Xilnov has popped alone.<br />
<br />
Fought one time, group of high 40/low 50s, plus a 60 druid that was passing through. We died quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have fought him before and offer this advice, he charms!  I learned that the hard way and killed 2 of my group mates.  After that incident we just let him despawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to hunt the Taskmaster, and I have seen ugly Xil four times. Each time he was red red red at 48.<br />
<br />
I hear he is one tough nasty guy, can wipe out a single group of upper 50's with no problem, and that he charms. I also hear he has no good loot worth speaking of.<br />
<br />
I personally think to let sleeping dogs lie.... he despawns in 15 minutes, after buffing Tasky and the skellies, so when he popped on me, I just let him depop and killed other things for 15.<br />
