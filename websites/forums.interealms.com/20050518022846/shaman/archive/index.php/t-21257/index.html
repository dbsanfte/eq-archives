<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Several times now I've seen people arguing about our role in EQ - currently the &quot;I don't want to heal&quot; thread is a good example.<br />
<br />
I want to see how our *official* class description has changed over the years.  I dug out my old Kunark manual last night and I'll be posting our description from that manual.  It's a lot shorter than our current one, but it definitly says we are healers. <br />
<br />
If you have any of the old manuals laying around or somewhere online please post the Shaman description here.  THANKS!<br />
<br />
Current Description:<br />
<br />
Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<br />
<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.</div></div><hr />

Shaman.  Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races.  Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.</div></div><hr />

The shaman class is like one of those all purpose camping knives: the kind that has the can opener AND both types of screwdrivers AND a 3 inch saw that can cut down small trees. Shaman has a wide array of skills and abilities. There are very few situations where being a shaman doesnt come in handy.<br />
<br />
YOu need a healer? A shaman can do the trick. You need someone to go toe-to-toe with the big uglies? A shaman has the HP to take the punches. How about fingerwaggling some damage in a pitched battle? The is also on the resume. Frankly they are moe at home covering the defensive, clerical side of things, but thats a general inclination, not a genuine restriction.<br />
<br />
Infact the only real restriction is that the shaman is available for only a few races: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre and Troll. As these aren the most popular races, not many people explore shamanhood, but its well worth a try. Keep in mind that a shaman is a religious character - no such thing as a agnostic shaman - but that doesnt have to be a main feature of his interaction with others. &quot; My god is not for the likes of you &quot; is a perfectly viable attitude, depending onthe diety you follow.<br />
<br />
One of the best things about being a shaman is that you are very useful in a party and quite functional as a solo character. In a group nomatter what is needed, a shaman can be part ( if not all ) of the solution. Indiviualy, a shaman can hold his own: fight his own fights, heal his own wounds, make his own way in the world.<br />
<br />
Normaly the shaman's flexability ( as well as the fact that healers are almost universally popular ) would make it a excellant class for a new player to chose, but this is not necessarily the case. The problem is that the Barbarian can be tricky to get started, Ogers and Trolls are unweildy to role play for people not used to it. Also ogres and trolls are not generaly well recieved in most cities, which can be a little disheartening if your not well versed in the politics of norrath.<br />
<br />
Still, Shamans still have a rich variety of choices and abilities at their disposal, and definetly worth the time it takes to bring one up to their full potential.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BTW snap i find your version very sexist ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Velious description is the same as the Kunark one.<br />
<br />
Still digging for my SoL book, but not having any luck yet.  LDoN manual did not have class descriptions in it, but I have the feeling that the online descriptions changed between the release of PoP and the release of LDoN.  Its possible that there was an updated desciption in the SoL manual, but I'm a geek and always read the manual and I dont remember there being a focus change from healing to worthless stat buffs.<br />
<br />
I wonder whats in that box over there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BTW snap i find your version very sexist ;)<br />
<br />
Thats not sexism, but a direct quotation.  All the class descriptions had different pronouns.<br />
<br />
From my Kunark Manual:<br />
<br />
Bard: HE<br />
Cleric: SHE<br />
Druid: HE<br />
Enchanter: SHE<br />
Magician: none<br />
Monk: SHE<br />
Necromancer: HE<br />
Paladin: SHE<br />
Ranger: HE<br />
Rogue:SHE<br />
Shadow Knight: HE<br />
SHaman: SHE<br />
Warrior: HE<br />
Wizard SHE<br />
<br />
Strange that Macigian was the only genderless description.  Instead of he or she, &quot;a magician&quot; was used in place of a gender pronoun.<br />
<br />
Its split 6 he's and 6 she's, with magician the odd 'man' out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From OFFICAL Prima Kunark Guide:<br />
<br />
Shamans are a stranger class.  One of the most versatile classes in EverQuest, they can do a bit of everything, from melee to all manner of casting.  Shamans are not as equipped as some other classes at striking their enimies directly, but they are far more effective in wearing them down with disease, poison, and other debilitating effects.  Shamans are also more effective than druids at buffing themselves and others through quickness/alacrity, ability buffs and utility enhancements.  They can also melee better than any other priest class.<br />
<br />
Spells are the stock-in-trade of a Shaman.  Without them, the Shaman is little more than mrat for any monster.  Acquire spells as soon as you can, and as often as you can, no matter how inconvenient it may seem.  The &quot;save money, buy spell, save money&quot; cycle may seem repetitive, but when your spellbook is full and monsters topple before you, you will realize the value of this strategy.<br />
<br />
The most important spells to a SHaman are those that focus on defense.  Spells that heal or buff stats and attributes are the Shaman's forte.  Keep a good number of buffing spells memorized, especially in a party.  They can make a big difference when cast on an already tough Warrior.  Do not, however, neglect the healing spells, which should also be a priority for you in group-based combat.  Shamans are most widely sought for their healing, and secondly for their modifying spells.  Concentrate on both, but remember that the best-healing Shaman is the most usefull.<br />
<br />
In addition to defense, Shamans recieve a few offensive spells.  These spells are nice supplements to group combat, but are most often cast in small parties or while soloing a monster.  In a large party, the offensive spells are mostly a waste of mana.  Leave the major spell damage to the pure casting classes.  They can deal much more damage, and your skills are better concentrated on preparation and healing, where you excel.<br />
<br />
Armor and weapons are tempting prospects, but they are usually only secondary tools.  Spells are the strength of a wise Shaman, and they should be used with great care.  Focus largely upon your spells, and you will be able to overcome most obstacles that stand in your way.<br />

Yer but just like an all purpose camping knife they introduce a  new improved model and your old one gets all rusty sitting in the drawer.<br />
Cans now have ringpulls so you dont need can openers anymore.<br />
The 2 types of screw that your screwdrivers fitted are now obsolete.<br />
The 3&quot; saw can now barely scratch a bit of bark off let alone cut down a whole tree.<br />
<br />
Only time you ever see this old camping knife now is when you take it out the drawer and say to people &quot;In its prime this knife was the king of the block&quot;<br />
