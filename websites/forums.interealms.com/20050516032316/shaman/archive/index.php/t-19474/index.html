<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this on the cleric board.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte text changed on Test: <br />
<br />
9161 Secondary Forte <br />
9162 This ability allows you to advance a second arcane specialization past the limit of 50. After acquiring this ability, the next specialization to go over 50 becomes your secondary forte. The second specialization is limited to a maximum skill of 100.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, for only 10 AA's you can raise a second spec by 50 friggen points. This is the only new AA I was remotely looking forward too. So currently the only AA I plan on getting anytime soon is SCS which is a Luclin AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flicking through the eqstr_us.txt file on Test shows that:<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhanced Rabidity has vanished - it didn't make it onto Lucy, but I was still hoping for a decent upgrade to Rabid Bear (that new cleric AA would have made a good starting point, IMO).<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit Speed, Wolf Pack and Consumption have also gone - IIRC they were listed as shaman abilities if you used the /alt activate xxx method of testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's also no sign of Ancient Fury or Rabid Companion (the pet fluff AAs - I was planning snap them up as a way of getting free, added DPS), although the Rabid Companion spells are still up on Test (as are the two extra Spirit Call ranks).<br />
<br />
Of the other AAs, Call of the Ancients, Pet Affinity, Critical Affliction and Persistent Casting are all still listed, as is Secondary Forte of course.<br />
<br />
I know people will think it strange, but I'm looking forward to the &quot;fun&quot; AAs (the pet related ones and Enhanced Rabidity), and the fact that the latter has vanished comes as a bit of a blow.<br />
<br />
Oh well, only another 9 days or so until all is revealed!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know people are not supposed to pick through the files and parse and such. But ****ing with the expectations and screwing around with thier playerbase is just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
How are we to trust the developers. We don't know them. We have been handed crap several times over and been told no no.. it is tasty and filling and good.!<br />
<br />
I know I sound bitter over a silly little game. But after 5 years of playing this silly little game and more hours than I can reasonably shrug off. Well it bothers me that SoE thinks that they have any consumer confidence at all. <br />
<br />
All in all I would just like to say.  F SoE.  F thier chincy ass, mealy mouthed, whack a mole, catering to the lowest denominator, management of a game and hobby that was at one time a revalation. <br />
<br />
Now Everquest is a broken down used up trollop whoring itself out on the street for a quick few bucks.  Damn shame  really is.<br />
<br />
And yeah yeah Just quit. I know.  Bitter burned out old bear muttering to myself in a corner and such. But honestly Is the game more fun now than it was before? I never hear any glowing stories about last week when we roxxored (Insert mob here)  <br />
<br />
All I ever hear are the stories of the good old days, when the game was less about arcade gratification and managed expectations. and DPS and more about Adventure, discovery, and camradire that was formed between brave souls who ventured out to find what a dangerous world had in store. <br />
<br />
Sone online entertainment might have the best moneymaker on the block. But the soul left a long time ago and now all that is there is the addiction built upon the shoulders of better men and women who made the real everquest game. <br />
<br />
Damn Never type at 4 am. Makes me meloncholy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well you dont have to quite, you can still get the fun of the last expansions, just dont buy GoD. If  enough poeple feel that way, i bet yer SoE will change it alot after it comes out to get people to play..corse problem is alot poeple will buy GoD regardless, like they did LOY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The second specialization is limited to a maximum skill of 100.<br />
<br />
Wow... from droolworthy to utterly useless in 0.3 seconds. That's a new record, even for SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">darkpaw, not sure if you magelo is current but i don't understand how you could not be looking forward to some AAs you don't have.  You don't even have the defencive line finished.  i am still looking forward to AAs and i am about to hit 300....<br />
<br />
i like a couple of the new AA in GoD, and stuff like crit dots could prove to be intresting.  The aa cost of a little obsine...</div></div><hr />

Why not?  LoY was a great expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't see the point in only limited 2nd specialization to 100. However I don't fully understand specialization I thought 200 in a specialization was equivalent of an extra 10% mana saving on the certain skill spells +less fizzles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh theres definately a lot of old AA's I still want to get, but I was really hoping for something semi useful out of this set too. I had no AA when pop came out but didn't mean it didn't give me a lot of stuff to look forward too. <br />
<br />
This gives me nothing at all to look forward too.</div></div><hr />

I got something like 230ish AA, I have every AA I want. I am not looking forward to more. Maybe put more points into Fury of Magic or some healing ... that's about it.</div></div><hr />

There will never EVER be another game that will replace that feeling in the back of my neck I experienced my first 3 months of EQ. Its gone forever, and I am so glad I got to experience this game before Alakazams and Crucible and Lucys. <br />
<br />
Bleys says out of character &quot;Pulling from the house (in Unrest)&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why not?  LoY was a great expansion.<br />
<br />
I personally love LoY, but it added no High End raiding content. I highly doubt GoD will add enough to keep the top guilds on most servers busy for long. <br />
<br />
Its a very distinct possibilty they are &quot;holding back&quot; a lot of stuff they have and saving it for EQ2. More expansions like LoY are not going to keep people playing EQ1, no matter what. The game has an ending right now, it really does. If they don't raise the bar on that ending, EQ1 will become insufferable. As it is, there is something like 9 guilds EP flagged on my server, and another couple in Sol Ro. Its ridiculous, and it will only get worse as the year goes by. <br />
<br />
Dont underestimate SOEs desire to drive as many of the higher end hardcore type players into EQ2 because there is just &quot;nothing to do&quot; in EQ1. While I may not be a TRUE hardcore guy (was, stopped a while, came back, EP flagged, few raids a week now, 2nd account, never stopped paying for the first even on &quot;break&quot;, etc etc) players like me and my guildies and the other &quot;Top 10&quot; guilds on my server are their bread-and-butter. We pay every month. We buy second (or more) accounts. If SOE cannot attract this type of player out of EQ1 and into EQ2, then EQ2 will just end up like the other &quot;EQ Killers&quot;, alive, kicking some, but not a truly viable threat. Granted its all the same company, but they have a rather HUGE investment to pay off in EQ2, and they are gonna need bodies. <br />
<br />
Sorry, didnt mean to make this a rant on EQ2, just pointing out that SOE is probably not gonna toss ANYONE more the a few skimpy bones for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">should be said though that if they are thinking that way they are stabbing themselves in the back, as eq2 release date is going backwards fast and wont be out till least mid summer or later, which give a  good 5 months to fill, this expansion wont do that and other games are coming out which will attract players and eq will just loose them, most likely forever if the other games actually work well and do what they say.<br />
<br />
and from what i heard of eq2 from the offical site eq2 doesnt sound like a game i want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had twelve aa saved up yesterday.  I was thinking about the GoD AAs.  Now I have HA3, and AHA1.   :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ah yeah, and every new game that comes out is hyped as the one that is going to finally overtake EQ as the top game.  Hmm.. who is still number 1???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zorlac is so weak, only 230 AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why not?  LoY was a great expansion.<br />
 I still havent bought LoY, I still feel that the map and guild management function should have been added for free. They are the only functions from LoY that I want.</div></div><hr />
