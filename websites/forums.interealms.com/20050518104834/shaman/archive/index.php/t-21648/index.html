This gains you a free shield.  Below that code is another code you have to enter on the provided web page for a chance at the eq2 beta.<br />

But it also can be placed on the back and in the range slot. If I had an untwinked toon then this would be a real nice back item or range slot item. I might even be tempted to use it as a shield for a while.<br />
<br />
I also saw this in everfrost at the wayfarer camp available for 8 APs. And was amazed at something of this quality for so few points.<br />
<br />
You may not like it, but I would definately put it on one of my new toons if I was starting one from scratch. At least it would be a gear slot I wouldn't have to worry about for a while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Even the dirt poorest untwinked toon will be able to buy a better item than this in virtually no time at all.  Mudflation has made far better items than this cost next to nothing by now on every single server.<br />
<br />
The only thing about it that's not horrible are the disease and poison saves and perhaps the 10 AC, since many range slots don't have any AC.  But that would still render it basically of use only when you need those saves.  <br />
<br />
To be fair, though, a brand new toon has to deal with lots of mobs that use poison and disease in their newbie grounds -- rats have disease, snakes have poison, etc.<br />
<br />
Spend a little while killing spiders and spiderlings while leveling and sell the silks, though, and you'll have a better range slot or back slot extremely quickly.<br />
<br />
So ...the shield is better than nothing for a complete newbie to the game with absolutely not a cent to his name -- but not by very much, and not for long.<br />
<br />
However, it is free, so you can't complain you were overcharged or had to work way too hard to get it.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't PC Gamer mag cost about $4.95?  Granted not a lot and I don't know the $ to PP conversion ratio over at Yantis (inc), but $4.95 buys me a meal at Hardees or a six pack of beer or 4 ones can be slipped into a young ladies bikini...er.....<br />

Every time you purchase a Sony product, you get credits ( depends on price of course )<br />
Then you can go to a Merchant ( which is located in OoW of course )<br />
and can buy &quot;uber&quot; items.<br />

... AND you get a magazine which is OK.  Buying the mag for the shield is dumb ... buying the mag for the mag and gettign a shield is kinda cool.  Really though, I just had to requote this as it's too funny.</div></div><hr />

Isnt this perhaps the type of player the promotion is aimed at ?<br />
EQ may get new subscribers out of this and PCG gets probably the more popular part of the promotion to increase sales as in EQ2 beta places.<br />

I'm sure trolls and frogloks can co-exist together in the same town.  Except for Fred, frogs give Fred gas, if Fred goes and gets along with the frogs then Fred won't be co-existing with the other trolls.<br />
<br />
Btw, stupid question from an ignorant barbarian here.  Dabarshers were the guards right?  Do the trolls have their own guards still?</div></div><hr />

Seeing that it has a faction mod of 200 it probably just raises you from indiff to amiable or whatever the next step up is but might not work on those vendors deisgned to not sell to you.<br />

Not possible. Merchants are each on different factions, there isn't one &quot;merchant&quot; faction.</div></div><hr />
