Nothing special, just a auto refreshing live cam's from in game. Kinda neat though.<br />
<br />
I thought the guild chat was particualry interesting.</div></div><hr />

Rather, click on this link here. Possibly some of you have already seen and read this, but those who have not, check it out. Be prepared, it's LONG. But so far, most detailed as well.</div></div><hr />

I had read that before, but read it again and picked up something I'd missed before: in the discussion on gnomes it mentioned that a gnome city was planned to be introduced later as an instanced dungeon.  I am hoping that instances in WoW do not necessitate the bizarre dps-race, with the 90 minutes timer, that killed LDoN stone dead for me.</div></div><hr />

see post #92 (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15526&amp;page=5&amp;pp=20) From what Whizzbang says, you can take as long as you want to go through an instanced dungeon. I think Sony put the timer on their dungeons to keep enough server space free so that they wouldn't run out of space, whereas bizzard don't seem to think that will be an issue.<br />
<br />
I've also read in that thread somewhere that the dungoes sometimes re-pop but it depends of the type of dungeon, sometimes in a few mins after killing, others hours or days.</div></div><hr />

Thats great: I was so disappointed when LDoN gave me the instanced dungeons that I'd been wanting for years but then ruined them with the crappy dps fest adventure format.  The instanced dungeons in WoW sound more like instanced versions of Guk and Sebilis - fantastic.<br />

Thanks for the link Haleice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only one word can describe what I've seen and read of WoW, and thats wow. Its beautiful, its gonna put the questing back into mmorpg, and its going to be so much fun discovering a whole new world all over again. And based on the fact that different quests for different races will be implemented then character creation will actually matter again.</div></div><hr />
