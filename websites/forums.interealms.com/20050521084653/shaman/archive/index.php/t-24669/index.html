<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm beginning to think this is a worthless spell.  I really can't tell any difference in using it or not.  If it's working at all saving 1 hit in 50 (or whatever it does) just doesn't matter.  <br />
<br />
If it did something like reduce the max hit by up to 7% with an average of 3.5% it would be worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it should make us mitigate mobs to balance out the mitigates in slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to make this spell worth casting it has to mean that the cleric has to heal less, now over a long fight (talking hours) with pretty even damage it would. however over fights we actually do it means very little, ie the cleric or druid or even us will see very little ( almost none) difference between someone with sense or without. i knew this is beta. (theres a joke in there somewhere?! actually possible several:))</div></div><hr />

What else is a long grind session?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, remember.. it's only 7%, it's not something you can probly detect visually or &quot;feel&quot; like some people like to say.  For example, would you be able to notice a 7% haste increase without parsing?  It's something that, if it's truly implemented to increased avoidance by 7%, it would be an &quot;over time&quot; thing.  7% would basically round out to a 1/14 chance of missing.  So once every 14 mob swings, they miss you.  It's just not something that will jump out at you, but will make a slight difference over time, and would prob be helpful against those big raid targets that hit for 2000+...  every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
Probly the only way to determine anything is if someone does some extensive parsing.  /shoots his hand up --- Not it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You cannot detect it visually, although when my war is tanking 1k htting mobs I certainly notice a difference over time. No idea what is does and I don't care, but it does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What else is a long grind session?<br />
<br />
well it a series of short fights, not one long one. each fight is seperate and as such the cleric will have generally healed the tank to full before the next one starts, as such a long grind session isnt just one long fight, and thats where poeple get alot wrong with calculations ,  think of it this way if i bought a huge amount of lottery tickets then proceded to play them each card is still a seperate game, and has the same chance to win as the one before or the next one, although maybe not the best way to describe it maybe you get the point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've already seen several times where the MT or a person in my group has gotten beaten on and dropped to low life only to have them healed a second later and live through it. <br />
<br />
Most often I've seen close calls on raid fights and all these times they've had Sense up.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there really is no telling if the extra calculation from Sense is what allowed the player to avoid a death blow from the mob but it's better to be safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some parses though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The 7% is actually a focus type so 0 to 7% with an average of 3.5%.  Or an average of 1 additional miss in about 30 hits theoretically.</div></div><hr />

chances are that without sense they would have survived too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a focus type. The description is &quot;Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by 7%&quot;, which is the same as some melee discs (just of smaller magnitude). When you fight something your chance of avoiding a hit is determined by the values of your avoidance and the mobs accuracy. What the spell does is increase that chance by 7%. So, if your unbuffed chance to avoid was 50%, the buff would change that to 50*1.07 = 53.5%. Likewise, if your chance to avoid was 5% or close to that then the buff would change it to 5*1.07 = 5.35%, ie it would appear to do nothing.<br />
<br />
For most mobs it will reduce the damage taken by the tank by about 3-4%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The night I got the spell... We spent all night fighting in PoFire.  My brother's SK was the Main tank the whole night.  We were fighting at C2 and he was doing just fine.  We played till he leveled and was able to buy the next level of shield blocking.<br />
<br />
Before we took off for the night, I ran tubby over to hand in the rune and came back to buff him with Sense.  So now in a matter of a couple minutes  he went from being 67 to 68 and bought another 3% better defense from shield block 2.  Add in the fact that I give another 7% defense and guess what happened.... for the next hour he got smoked.  We were all like &quot;What on earth just happened? Leveling, buying a defensive AA and having a new stacking defensive spell doesnt make you a BETTER tank?&quot;  Even if it's the RNG just screwing with us it's crap that it doesnt make a bigger difference when you add those three things together.<br />
<br />
I think it's crap.  That said I keep it up on everyone at all times in raids or single groups.  If it saves someone 1 time a night, it's worth casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, I would say that the only feel I have gotten from the spell is much like the above when I catch agro.  LR5, Dodge 1 shoulders, step one of the Omens LR line and I would swear I get hit more when I have the spell up.<br />
<br />
I know sounds odd, but if that is truly the case a parse would show it easily.<br />
<br />
And now for totally offtopic, don't ya think our new agility spell should perhaps have some actual agility in it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
have you seen the AGI parses?<br />
the short version is anything less than 100 agi is totally worthless (as opposed to completely worthless which is where the devs seem to have a problem in comunication)<br />
do you know anyone who is actually short 100 agi unbuffed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree agility is useless but since most of the warriors in my guild still request it I give it to them just to make them happy.  And since Sense doest actually give any agi they ask me for both wrulon and sense now.  I'd be happy if they just put the same amount of agi that wrulon gives into sense, save them a buff slot and me having to cast 2 agi buffs on dumb barbarian warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know everyone here loves to bash AGI, and I do too :)  But I do feel compelled to point out that it does add to AC.  It adds very miniscule amounts of AC, but most of the tank-types I know are AC whores, and they'll take every last point they can get.  So I kind of think it's one of those &quot;one man's trash&quot; kind of deals: we think it's garbage, but it's not unreasonable for the tanks to want it.<br />
<br />
Of course, even with that in mind, I'm pretty sure all the parses someone did awhile ago showed that the AC gained didn't do crap.  And I suspect if someone parses out SoS they will find the same thing.  My theory is just that SoE created this spell line to only be a &quot;feel good&quot; buff (well, maybe they didn't intentionally create it as such originally, but it became that and they aren't changing it in OoW).  But until someone runs parses (I would, but I still haven't figured out how to make the game run on my (Linux) machine yet) all our arguments are going to be anecdotal, ie. no better than Rytan logic.<br />
<br />
Worthless or not though, I think the idea of adding Agi to SoS is great, because whether or not these buffs do anything people are still going to ask for them, and it would be nice to be able to cast one less buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the amount of raid buffs these days, even with the added buff slots via AA, I don't think it will ever be worth the miniscule (if any) gain to cast AGI ever again in my life.  I've refused to cast it now for well over a year now at least.  <br />
<br />
I'll try to do some parsing on it soon, because I'm definitely quite curious myself.  My instincts are telling me that I'm seeing more quad's + bashes missed than have without SoSense, but I want to verify it.  How does not having it run on your Linux box effect parsing btw? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Agi also increases the Endurance pool.  Might matter for low level toons but I'm not aware of any high level melee that didn't have enough endurance to do abilities.<br />
<br />
Tugela, I'm not knowledgeable on melee avoidance stuff.  I was wondering though whether the increase for Sense works like you said (50 x 1.07 = 53.5%)  or whether it would work as a stack (50 + 7 = 57%)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i can answer that its 7% onto whatever your actually percentage is (if its is in percentage?)  so if you have 50% adding 7% to that is the same as * 1.07.<br />
<br />
but as i said that depends on whether actualy avoidance is a percentage? and not done some other way. also  its 7% of certain chance to avoid? that chance might be small anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mobs have a set to-hit rate. I remember the early GoD mobs having a hit rate of about 90%. This hit rate used to be modified by your agi, by avoidance mods, but most importantly by your LEVEL. So yeah, as people have said already, Sense will redeuce the chance to be hit by 7% of whatever it was. <br />
Don't mistake this with dodge, parry, block etc. Those skills will only kick in when the mob already had a succesful to-hit roll.</div></div><hr />
