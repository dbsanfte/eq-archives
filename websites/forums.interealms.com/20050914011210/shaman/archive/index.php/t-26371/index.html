<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been trying to figure out whats the fastest/easiest and best way to get crystals (without buying/trading for them). <br />
<br />
Seems like the Mission &quot; Grounding drakes &quot; a 15 collect is the best so far, I tried some others but they take more time. <br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated as to what missions you choose and tactics. <br />
<br />
Going to try &quot;Infested&quot;  kill 4 named spiders and see how that goes.<br />
<br />
Is there any links that can give us more information about DON, Maps/strategies/locations etc etc<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, one day I ran though &quot;Death Comes Swiftly&quot;, aka kill the spiders in the Ascent, three times in two hours. <br />
<br />
And one day, we spent four hours before giving up. Yes, you read that right. Even swapped out toons after one wipe. <br />
<br />
I don't know if that was because we really sucked one day, or because the second try was after the patch.  Both were pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

38 crystals<br />
Average time 40 - 55 minutes depending on group<br />
healer, slower, dps, dps, dps, solid tank (in other words make a group and a shaman can heal in here w/ some grunting - cleric  or druid makes it a happier group)<br />
<br />
Kill 10 crevice spiders<br />
Kill 5 warder spiders<br />
Kill Lava mistress<br />
<br />
Zone in<br />
<br />
Clear large room in front of you by pulling to zin.  With tank pulling, you can expect a few 2 pulls (pumas, leopards, crevice spiders).  OT or if the tank is hp heavy (11K above), have them hold agro on both.<br />
<br />
Move to the right up the ramp and hold.<br />
<br />
Clear up to next level area.  Same pulling - some 2 pulls.  <br />
<br />
Pull up to the first cave entrance on the right (archway with 2 spiders guarding).  Pull to entrance until you can move to the big area.<br />
<br />
Clear this room. <br />
<br />
At this point you now have either completed the 10 crevice spiders (or are close like 8) and a couple of warder spiders.  This room will hold the rest of the spiders.<br />
<br />
When cleared, move into the room.  The Lava Mistress is in  small alcove on the right. Pull her out of the room (zone out is there and you can accidently get zoned). Has a small annoying dot.  Fixed with RGC or 2 blasts of Nadox.<br />
<br />
Kill Lava Mistress - receive token and crystals.<br />
<br />
Move into the Lava Mistress alcove.  On the right cave wall is a dark looking area (like it should be a tunnel but isn't).  Invis up ... Click on dark area .. zone out.  Or TL to Lavastorm, sell, split, turn in token and repeat process.<br />
<br />
My static group has farmed this enough so that I currently have 4 of the focus aug's that I wanted. Take friends, catch up on news, joke, enjoy.  This one is a snap.<br />
<br />
Now someone give us a new one to enjoy.  We have done a good portion of them, but find ourselves coming back to this one for the ease of grabbing 38 crystals.  Creator is ok - but overall takes more time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I havn't done and DoNs since the patch, but Drake Eggs from the evil side used to be really easy, so unless it got changed it is a good one.  Its in The Ascent.  You go in, clear the trash from the bottom (and from the lil cave at the bottem where spiders like to be../shudder).  Invis up, go up till you find 'A Drake' (usualy 2 side by side)...kill em.  Hope they drop what you need, if not..simply invis to the next set, rinse an repeat.  When you get the drake eggs, 3 mobs pop at the IZ, the named you have to kill and 2 guards.  Split out the named and kill him and you win.  Me and my husband (70 time/ikkinz geared monk) duo this all the time (getting a 3rd in the group so we can get the mission).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on group makeup really.<br />
<br />
With a decent group, Death Comes Swiftly is great :)  but there is respawn, so if group is slow, can be a little tougher.<br />
<br />
Killing drakes is one that is easy, but a little inefficient.  Its nice that I can easily 3box it when bored.<br />
<br />
Infested is easy if you have a good puller.  Used to be much easier, but there are see invis now that the puller has to deal with if you just want to pull w/out killing all the trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are there any truly soloable missions that can net crystals, or does every crystal-award thing pretty much require at least a duo (I am evil, BTW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">a trio, you can't get in without a three person group, I believe.<br />
<br />
but the &quot;Drake Eggs&quot; mission is soloable, and rather quickly, especially by a necro who can FD pull singles.</div></div><hr />
