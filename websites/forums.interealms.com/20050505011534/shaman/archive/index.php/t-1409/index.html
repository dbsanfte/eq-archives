<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of buy a horse (8k one) coz of the benefit from the medding while standing. But i've heard that you must turn on the SOL model (i meant the char model) in order to get this benefit. Can any one prove this?<br />
I dun like the new model of troll:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You just have to turn on new models to see yourself (or anyone else) on the horse. Otherwise you just see them standing and moving slowly (if it's a slow horse).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, I did it and bought myself a tan gay horse the other day, 8300p or something. I turned on ogre models, turned off horse models. Now I can cast my horse, and still be at sow speed. most cool. My problem is, I have noticed no mana regen when standing and being mounted on my horse. Is there anyone out there who can explain the procedure to me, either here or in private messages? I just don't get it. (I am an ogre, use small words please <br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I broke down and bought a cheap horse for my 52 Shaman since Ive been in ME a lot lately.<br />
<br />
Dinged 53 last night.<br />
<br />
And while standing, I started getting messages about my meditation skill going up.  So I know Im medding while standing is still working.<br />
<br />
However, I did notice sometimes my mana bar would appear stuck and not be going up.  But the second I cast a spell, it would skyrocket up.<br />
<br />
Basically the same problem about a mobs health from far away not showing dropping, but in reverse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree corlathist<br />
<br />
Here's the deal:  If you're standing still and not swinging a weapon, you're medding.  If your mana bar gets frozen, it doesn't mean you're not medding... cast one cann (or any other spell) and it will update itself.  Very weird to cast a big DoT and watch the mana bar go UP.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info. will try it later :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feid Mei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was too curious, so i bought one over the weekend.<br />
Soooooo nice.<br />
No more canni dance while soloing outside!</div></div><hr />
