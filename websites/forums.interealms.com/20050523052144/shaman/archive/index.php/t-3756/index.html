<br />
DoTs now do full damage to a mob that runs in any direction?  I thought Vi said, and I quote, &quot;It will be a cold day in hell when we even think about letting you losers see mobs take full damage from dots if they are running towards.  Bunch of wussy punks who think they can kite like our much more highly favored class, the druids!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still not enough to get me to come back, but it's interesting to see VI go back on things that they said they'd never do.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will neuter ourselves with a rusty spoon before we ever implement npcs that can bind players in towns!&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's changed back to the way it was... so basically they removed a nerf they implemented a LONG time ago. Probably to encourage the classes that use DOT's to pursue AA (ie keep people in the game).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, I remember that it used to be that way.  I also remember shamans putting up the good fight to get it changed back on the old Abashi boards.  And the reply was always &quot;Go to hell, lousy stinking whiny shaman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll finally give ogres ultravision like it said they were supposed to have in the original manual (one of the things that made me choose an ogre).  Lying bastards.  Heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brad left, Esther left, and a couple of others too.<br />

As someone said (on this board iirc) in regards to the changes made and new attitude at fan fair:<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing what happens when you get rid of the dead weight.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sometimes they make a change that goes to far.  Regardless of what you think of Brad, and the Vision, the game has lasted longer than any other game I can think of.   I like a bone every now and then, but eventually they will kill EQ by making it to easy.  Of course, this is probably part of their plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they should make a server that is based purely on Brads Vision, they already have made lowly populated servers of other reasons; SZ, FV, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really missed the time when Brad and crew was responsible for EQ. I can remember as it was yesterday:<br />
- 60% XP penalties for some classes. Even though those classes pretty much sucked compared to real damage dealers.<br />
- Quests that forced you to camp 4 days for one green mob that maybe drops your item you need. Of course you had to compete with druids who were farming it for money.<br />
- 190 people in LGuK.<br />
- Working as intended.<br />
- Ultimate hatred for customers. Hey look, I am a ranger with a Fiery Avenger but you won't get it. Or hey I am the UK rep of SOE, I know what customers want because they are dumb.<br />
- Abashi, nuff' said.<br />
- Countless lies and misinformation about game mechanics. Ugh sure ... pets take NO XP grouped, really, I tell you the truth. Thanks to ShowEQ for really telling the truth about many lies.<br />
<br />
The game is not made easier, but made less tedious. The new crew, despite them being still incompetent, have made tenfolds the positive changes to the game, something that wouldn't have happend with Brad and Abashi the Jackass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Four letters easily explain all these changes:  DAoC.<br />
<br />
DAoC is the first real competition EQ has had, and notice VI is &quot;borrowing&quot; some of DAoC's more attractive game features and adopting them to fit EQ (to name a few -- interface features, low level corpses respawning fully-equipped, horses, and, to a degree, AA).<br />
<br />
IMO, DAoC is the best thing to ever happen to EQ.  When faced with real competition, the winners are us, the players.</div></div><hr />

ROFL!!!<br />
<br />
I played DaoC for a short (very short) time. How anyone can say DaoC was any competition for EQ is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Everything was a yawn in DaoC.  Tradeskills, quests, PvP, grouping, exploring, you name it, and you can yawn at it. Nothing of any substance in DaoC at all.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I don't buy DaoC being responsible for the changes that have been occurring in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">DAoC is the suck.. I got to level 25 on my cleric and found out it didn't get any less boring. EQ has all sorts of weird terrians, mountains lava caverns snow giants dragons, DAoC was... fields and fields of green grass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DAoC is dead in the water. I left EQ over a year ago to play DAoC....needless to say I am back in my old home, Halas. I played on Morgan Le Fey server on DAoC and it and Merlin Server were the highest populated servers with a peak usage of 2500-3000 people. Just before I left a few weeks ago, peak usage on Morgan Le Fey server was less about 700.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what it is, but EQ has something DAoC never had.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know...there are no BARBARIAN SHAMAN in Camelot !!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Despite personal preferences (I didn't like it, either, BTW), DAoC is is a bigger concern for VI than you may think.  <br />
<br />
At first, VI was really sweating as people jumped ship to go to DAoC.  So they started to bend over backwards to keep their customers.  <br />
Of course, people have since returned to EQ, but who knows?  DAoC could make a move some day that could lure EQ players away again, and I think that's what EQ is trying to make sure never happens.  <br />
I mean, come on.  Why do you think they are suddenly giving us all this stuff we've been asking for for so long?  They want to make sure we stay with EQ and not go to the competition.<br />
DAoC is still very much alive and kicking; Shadowbane and Asheron's Call 2 are looming on the horizon; EQ is an aging game (people are getting burnt out), and VI knows this all too well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ is an aging game (people are getting burnt out), and VI knows this all too well. <br />
<br />
In what way should VI be concerned about DaoC? Seriously... DaoC can't even come close to EQ, no matter how hard they try.<br />
<br />
EQ Aging? Sure, 3 years+ and still over 400k subscribers. And still expanding the game.<br />
<br />
EQ will be around long after DaoC is dead.<br />
<br />
I'm not a person to heap praise on anything, but in the experiences I have had with online games... I really don't see anything coming close to EQ for a very long time.</div></div><hr />

Famous last words.<br />
<br />
VI is responding to DAoC. VI responded to Anarchy Online. (Hybrid changes).<br />
<br />
No doubt DAoC has some advantages over EQ. And EQ has a lot of things going for it that DAoC doesn't.  But DAoC isn't going away. They just added 2-3 new servers. <br />
<br />
WoW is coming out. As well as Shadowbane (finally). Horizons is on the..horizon as is SWG.  Oh and let's not forget EQII. There are many other games coming out each looking for their niche.<br />
<br />
EQ's number of new subscriptions / month has slowed dramatically. Personally I don't think there are 400,000 active accounts, and certainly accounts are getting recycled.<br />
<br />
Next 18 months will be fun to watch.</div></div><hr />

This comment is absolutely mind-boggling.<br />
<br />
OMFG they are actually putting in features and improvements that make people want to continue playing??  How dare they make it fun!!<br />
<br />
UO instituted the tradition of &quot;Vision Conquers Fun&quot;, and exactly the same thing happened back then:  the original Vision holders (Raph Koster et. al.) had to leave before the Dev team started removing structural barriers to fun built into the game design itself.  This is just history repeating itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree with Rodahn: these changes have been made because of the emergence of DAoC and other MMORPGs. It's not that these other games are currently serious competitors for Everquest, but Sony is trying to not make the mistake that every company does which is ignore the competition until it's too late. Better to put Mythic out of business now rather than wait for DAoC II, etc. Look at IBM vs. AMD, or Nintendo vs. Sony, or Glide vs. D3D for examples of companies realizing too late that there was real competition sneaking up.<br />
<br />
Worlds of Warcraft, baby: this will be the first true competition for Sony. At E3 it made SWG look like some college CS project in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Where people aren't thinking straight is just because EQ hasn't lost all of it's subscribers does NOT mean DAoC or any other mmorpg hasn't been gaining some all this time.  I'm sure there's many people playing DAoC who have never played EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">one of the questions that i liked to raise in DAoC before i came back to eq was 'has anyone here played EQ?'  What surprised me the most is that rarely anyone i played with played EQ, some people didnt even know what EQ was, one guy said 'hey is that the new PvP server?' i was very shocked, i know that if many of those people tried EQ they would like it and convert to EQism from DAoC.<br />

The OP was talking about DAoC's features that EQ ripped, thus making it more efficient, playable and ergo popular. Not content, FEATURES! Return to bind point upon dieing? Thank DAoC. Getting wrong quest items returned to you upon hand-in? Thank DAoC. Soulbinders? Thank DAoC. VI should be giving Mythic a little kickback for being the best thing to happen to EQ. Vi should be kissing Mythic's A$$ and thanking them for making them even more hideously rich than ever before. Kissing their A$$ I tell you! A$$! A$$!! A$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
