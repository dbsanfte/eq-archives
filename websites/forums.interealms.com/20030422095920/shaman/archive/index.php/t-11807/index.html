<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious if it is possible For a Barbarian Shaman can do the iksar Cudgel quest with the new illusion pots. (I have no idea how illusion works, just wishfull thinking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my alchemy isn't high enough to think about it yet.. but it seems likely..<br />
<br />
you can get iksar meat in dulak pretty commonly off the dock guardians.. blood too if you're goin for a tae ew shield (they're toasty)..<br />
<br />
nayway.. if you got a high alchemy skill.. give it a shot and let us know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">read this thread The Cudgel Quests For Good Races (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=8900), as a barbarian, you'll need to do a lot of faction work AND use the illusion.<br />
<br />
Illusion Iksar eliminates their racial hatred of you, but they still won't like your deity much, so faction work is also needed. An Enchanter's shared illusion and the illusion potion have the same effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">iirc, the Tae Ew armor using the Scale Temper, which requires iksar blood in it, among some other things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok i went to check out the turn in for the first cudgel last night and i had a friend that is iksar target all NPC's so i could assist and con them. all but one was warmly to ally with iksar illusion on but one. I went into the room and up stairs to go down through the tower to go for the first skulls and i had a npc that was conned before warmly attack me? i looked back to see if my illusion had droped but i did not see a message about it! this NPC was a SK are they on the same faction as the necros? and if not how do i raise that faction or can i? i guess i will just have to stay off the upper floors and go through the sewers to get the skulls. any help would be appriciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, there's a necro-faction mob upstairs I believe. He got me once too by aggroing me, chain aggroing the SK mobs which HT'd me for like, 900 or 1100 or something. Just stay invis at all times :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The necro is Librarian Zimor, on the top floor of the center tower above the shaman guild. Can't really see him unless you climb up (which is very difficult with that one ladder being in the wrong position.)</div></div><hr />
