<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my black fur boots today....weeeee :)<br />
<br />
We did it with me 44 shaman, 42 cleric and 53 druid<br />
<br />
took us about 20 to 25 mins to kite him, felt like a real epic fight.<br />
Both cleric and druid died once during the fight.<br />
<br />
Now I have been runing around spaming my boots everywhere :) damn they are nice.<br />
<br />
Gonna log on again now and spam some more before I rape the bed.<br />
<br />
Gnite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats pretty impressive, I couldnt land any spell on him at 54, not even the disease slow after 3 tries.<br />
<br />
Although I must say it would have been a hell of a lot easier with a melee, the monk I was with killed him only needing about 5 heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actully got the second malisment in on him, after that I could hold him rooted every 5th root and the druid could dot him.<br />
<br />
Never got s slow in on him, gave up after 6 try or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cucullen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had problems as well. First time 2 died due to other mobs. Second time I went with a 60 tank. Got a slow on black dire the 3rd try and healed the tank twice. Lesson I learned, take a high lvl tank or lots of them with you and just heal. Don't waster your mana casting on Black Dire. Oh yeah and I'm lvl 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is Dire triggered or is he just on a spawn timer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's like on a 4 hour spawn(I think) or you can trigger him by killing the advisor.  He despawns after like a half hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's very impressive, that you got him at that level with no melee in the group. <br />
<br />
My advice to anyone trying to do it is to bring a melee or two along. He's much easier to beat down than he is to cast on. However, I will comment that he is not remotely unslowable or anything like that. I brought a 60 bard and a 60 cleric to take him down (the shaman's my alt), and found to my surprise, after reading these threads, that the 60 bard stuck about half the slows he cast on Black Dire with no MR debuffing at all. But that's at L 60. I'd guess that a L 50ish shaman could probably slow him with tash and mal* stuck on him. But of course you still want a melee to tank him if you can arrange it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not here to brag or anything, and I dunno if you will believe me, but I just soloed the black dire today, Im lvl 45 and have pretty nice stuff though JBB, Fungi, Fungi staff, RBG and had aego on, but hey, I soloed him =), and dont ask me how I did it cause I would have all the shammys there killing him, gonna turn enough pelts to get my faction up to Ally and help all shammys in guild to get their booties 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There was really no other point to that post than to brag.  ;)  ...and why would you care if other shamans did it the same way?  It's not like you're gonna get rich selling black fur boots or anything.  If I had to guess though, it involved lev and the jbb.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, i landed my slow first try at level 47, couldn't have taken it without it since me group was all around the same level...Most of my 420 DD spell landed the whole fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oddly I had the same results.  I took myself (58 shaman) a 57 ranger friend and a 56 cleric friend.  I pulled Black Dire with plague but it was resisted... the ranger taunted him off of me and I slowed him on the first try.  I just sat back and nuked after that.<br />

<br />
P.S.  Yes I know I am 58 and should have gotten this done a long time ago, but I was just not hard pressed for my epic.  Suddenly I find myself interested.  Anyone wanna do the hole on Terris Thule? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would just like to pass on some knowledge I gained to those who might need it about this encounter.  <br />
<br />
My main is a 60sk with nice ToV gear and Primal weps so he's no slouch.  I thought by bringing him to Mistmoore was actually overkill for this mob.  As it turns out it was all he could handle and then some.  I had no trouble clearing out all the blood wolves and other mobs in the area and going in and wiping out the library including the advisor to spawn the black dire.  Pulled the black dire with darkness which stuck on him np.  But I was caught totally off guard when he started laying into me with his double 170's, and pretty fast too.  With only Gheal to back me up I finally had to leechcurse his butt and harmtouch him to get the fight overwith before I got my butt handed to me.  <br />
<br />
I just wanted to give these details so some others would be aware of the difficulty of meleeing this mob down.  Just to respond to an earlier post, I'm not gonna say for sure that it's impossible for a 45 shaman to solo this but I would have to see it to believe it.  Even if you are kiting him around and nuking him with JBB, how the heck did you manage to not get a ton of adds while doing it?  Just curious.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nm =) the name looks close</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Are you sure you don't have me mixed up with someone else?  I'm on Mith Marr and when I took out the black dire the other day I had the only 2 people in the zone and never got a tell from anyone asking for help killing him for someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He's like on a 4 hour spawn(I think) or you can trigger him by killing the advisor. He despawns after like a half hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean he will spawn all by himself every 4 hours but if you don't feel like waiting you can force spawn by killing advisor?<br />
<br />
Or... does it mean the advisor is on a 4 hour timer and you HAVE to kill advisor to spawn BD?<br />
<br />
also what level does it take to single pull black dire without harmony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cragnorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well Molgar, on the issue of pulling him single.  I didn't try because I was forwarned by a friend that even though he can be pulled single by a high level, you should kill the blood wolves first if you are gonna spawn him since he &quot;calls&quot; them to his aid.  When I went after him I cleared the whole area first and then went up to the library invis and cleared out the advisor room.  Then I came back down and had the whole area to fight him without any adds.  As soon as I engaged him he did say something like &quot;come to my aid my friends&quot;, or something like that.  He's tough enough, no sense in trying him along with all the wolves still up if you don't have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zazk Buffurbootay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did this with a group of friends - 60 drood, 60 cler 60 shammy 59 tank 58 wizzie and me. Monk single pulled. Slowed, malo'd no assistance was called for from BD and he was down within 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>topsecret</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">l45 shm on nameless here, question, i have the black dire wolf from a raid our guild did in mm, i understand that the pelt is used for our shm epic, i have read that you also need a gem for part of getting boots, where can i find the gem, and can i do this to get boots before i officially start epic? any feedback would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">At level 45, you can do all of the quest leading up to the black dire part solo.  Doing the black dire part early is impossible if you don't have high enough True Spirit faction, and if you haven't done any of the epic quest, you probably don't have it high enough.<br />
<br />
Go do the quest.  There are tons of spoilers out there, or you can just start in Rathe Mountains.  There is a guy in the cyclops valley that starts the quest, I think, been about 2 years since I did it.<br />
<br />
If you can get a friend druid that can port and track for you, you can have the quest completed to your fancy new boots in a few hours.  If you bind yourself at the firepots, you can do it in maybe 4-5 hours, assuming you get help finding the wandering spirit in west karana (that zone sucks so bad!).<br />
<br />
The quest gets hard right after you get the boots.  :)</div></div><hr />
