<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akurra</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hail all, I was wondering what would be a good animal for me to solo. I don't know if i can solo anything else very well, my archery's not that good (at 105) and i forgot to practice conjur so my DoT's completely unreliable right now. I've been doin snow cougars in IC. While they're gettin pretty easy and the XP isn't horrible, it seems to be slowing down a bit. So what do i do, continue with the cats till 39 or try somethin else. I'd love to group up in dungeons, I play only sparingly, and the xp's not as good, and on my server (torvonnilous) everyone wants to hunt outdoors so there's no one anywhere (maybe with the exception of Lguk, but i don't know if i'm a good level for that). So help me out great guru's of ranger knowledge. What did you find most effective at my level?</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of good animals to hunt there.   Tigers and pandas and gorillas will all be blue to you.  They can all be fear kited nicely.  And while you're there you can do the Swiftclaw Sash quest and the Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furian</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have Luclin, try fear-kiting the blue-con zelniaks or large Zelniaks in Dawnshroud Peaks.  I personally say do the zelniaks until they go light blue simply cause they have about 2/3 at best the HP of the large and were giving half a blue exp still at 39. At 40 the blue Zelniaks are giving a little less, but they are still worth doing just cause they are so easy to kill.  Just snare, fear and go to it, no Zelniaks/large zelniaks add and as a ranger I've never had to worry about 99% of the wolves either (there's one or two that will attack and to me the wolves seem to be a bit underconned). The loot however is just non-existent, so if you are looking for that too, you'll have to go elsewhere like tenebrous mountains and get in a group, supposed to be some good loot there. Best of Luck.<br />
