<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my shaman's 62 now.  I have access to tier 3 etc obviously with the opening of the planes, (which i still dont like) but i'm not sure if 65 &gt; aa cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Can you guys throw some advice?  What would you do?  AA at 62 to aa canni? Or rush to 65.  Rushing to 65 for the 65 spells isn't going to be a viable option as my cash flow doesn't flow in so well... so advice? :P<br />
<br />
I was thinking, AA canni or at least VP could be worth sinking some aa's into....<br />
<br />
I was going to go with the 65 crunch just for resist rates and such however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think your play style should have a lot to do with your decision.  At least it did for me.  I leveled to 61 to get my new pet and then I switched to full AAs.  I’m half an AA from MCIII and then I’ll need 5 AAs for Canni 5.  I had thought about leveling to 65 first, but I’m in a small guild and I rarely go to the planes.  So Canni 5 is worth more to me than four more levels.  So if you in a position where hitting 65 will do you a lot of good you might as well go for it.  But if not, or if gaining those three levels will take you a long time, you might consider getting Canni 5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you already have Torpor, Canni 5 is an option, if not, just shoot for 65 to get Q then Canni 5.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is incredible but I found 65 a breath of fresh air not having to grind through slow moving levels anymore. Working on AA's feels so much quicker at 65 that it will take you no time to get those AA's up. Also if cash flow is slow you may as well take your time as much as you can to save coin for Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd got to 65 before worrying about AA's, except in one situation. If you typically group with friends that are significantly lower level than you are, and you won't get decent (any?) exp in the places they can effectively exp once you're L 65. But unless that's the case, I'd go with L 65 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I stopped at 62 and did AA to Canni 5, but that was before Tier 2/3 was opened up and I did not have any flags.  It made sense then, because 62 is plenty high for exp in the Tier 1 planes.  Once Tier 2/3 opened, I zoomed to 65 and found the AA experience and loot and groups much much better.  If I were at 62 today, I would just level to 65 before much AA.  It really is easier at 65.  The spells will come along too, have faith )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level &gt; all<br />
<br />
Get to 65 then worry about everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hit 62 and just needed a breather from the constant slow grind for levels. At 62 I didn't have too much trouble getting a group in BoT.... it all depended on group needs for slowers and slower availability... (hah, rocket science in action). If there were higher shaman around I would just head off to another zone. But, I got canni V pretty quickly and then headed off to 65. If you are doing BoT or Tactics fairly regularly you will get your fair share of chances to obtain ornate, or runes (less often). By the time you hit 65 you will hopefully have at least most of your 63/64 spells and maybe a couple of 65's.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it again I would probably go the same route. It just depends how much you get annoyed with the more arduous level grind. On the other hand, now I am 65 there isn't anything but aa so it doesn't matter. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went to 65, and still dont have canni 5 just yet.   If you have topor/malo, i'd stop for canni 5.  Wish i had.<br />
<br />
But like everyone else has said, its situational.   You in a raiding guild? if so you'll need Fo7 and boar.  Plus the levels will help with slow resists.  <br />
<br />
That said, mana regen still isnt a problem for me  at 65 without canni 5.<br />
Must be insane with it, seemings how canni 4 keeps me FM unless im soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I stayed at 62 for 100+ AA's and was very glad I did.  The AA's went faster as I was usually fighting white, yellow or red cons and, since I had Topor and Malo, got me canni V and MGB quickly.  If you raid especially, getting MGB is such a relief.  Anyway, you can also focus on damage avoidance and damage mitigation AA's which I found to be extremely useful at any level.  I never found a difference getting a group either although may people argued with me that I would have trouble.  Also, after you sit at 62 for awhile, you'll probably get the bug to level which will make it all that much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you solo much, canni 5 first.  If you level slow (don't exp much), canni 5 first.  If you raid a lot, 65 first.  If you are sick and tired of having your buffs overwritten and/or your debuffs resisted, 65 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, hi all!  I always say this but I think few folks really catch on.  Get to 65 so you can get better quality groups.  Then just do LDON and relax and you won't even break a sweat and the exp will roll in.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">after thinking about it for a little while, I say go straight for canni, then level up. Canni 5 adds a HUGE impact on levelling, probably moreso than quiescence would. Your levelling will go much faster when you have the constant mana flow of cann5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tried to stop at 61 and do Canni 5, but it took SOOOOOOO long to get AA's then.  I decided to stop and work on 65 and then get Canni 5.  In my case it was the right decision.  I get groups fast now, usually within 5 minutes of turning on LFG.  AA's go MUCH faster.   I like Canni 5, don't get me wrong, but I like being 65 a lot better.  <br />
<br />
By the way I have no 65 spells, and won't for a bit, but I also make more money at 65, so I will get them much  faster than I would have if I waited to level to 65 until after I got them. I do have the vast majority of 64 and lower, though.<br />
<br />
Just my experience as a really new level 65 - think I dinged 2-3 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Methinks leveling to 65 isn't going to guarantee better quality groups.<br />
<br />
I leveled to 60 and did AA until I had Cann5 and SCRM, and I haven't regretted it one bit.  I can't even imagine how much it would suck trying to get through those 60+ levels without Cann5.  I didn't get that many more resists on Malo'd mobs at 60 than I do now at 65, and the journey from 60 was a very pleasant one.  <br />
<br />
That said, there's obviously not an exclusively right way to level.  If you figure that you're eventually going to be 65 and have Cann5 and the other AAs, your &quot;best&quot; progression path is just the one that meets your priorities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ratoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd go for lvl 65 (unless your friends that you group with are the same level as you are).  Seem to find some good groups of 65s who need a slower (well still get some not so good).  <br />
<br />
Another reason would be you'd be getting more points for LDON raids (if you are into that thing).  Granted grinding to 65 really suxs, after that XP flows..its nice to see every kill in LDON getting a percent or a kill in BoT getting like 3 percent).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On my SK I did the straight to 65 route (stop for run3 only). So for the shaman I wanted to grab a few usefull aa first.  Did run3/regen3 before/during level 60, and spaced MC out from 61-62.  I refused to leave 62 before getting canny.   My only regret now...not getting canny sooner!  The utility of this spell is just too great.  Of course now I'll be heading the rest of the way to 65 asap, but that is one stop I am very glad to have made.<br />
<br />
But as previous posts have said, it's really about your play style, speed, etc.  Straight to 65 vs stopping for canny, really no 'right or wrong' choice there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I stopped at 52ish and got run3/regen3 (this was before PoP and max level was 60) it made sense then because i was soloing and to get good exp meant leveling in seb and it wasnt really all that much faster than what i was doing.<br />
<br />
I stopped again at 63 (new haste--otherwise would have stopped at 62) and got canni5.  Sole reason is the fact i had tons of hp and not enough time to canni so it just made sense.<br />
<br />
I never had problems finding groups at any level, but then i always leveled with friends.  It probably makes a difference now...i notice a ton of 65 shaman running around compared to 3 months ago when i quit for a while.  I noticed absolutely no difference in resists at 62/63/64/65 in tier1/2/3 planes, despite what people claim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am 62 now and stopped to get canna (got it last night actually) and I grind in BoT and XP is awesome as I often fight white and yellow cons. I rarely get resisited after malo. I am now 50/50 xp for level/AA and figure by the time I get to 65 I will have the other AA's I need. Don't have any rush to get to 65 really as I don't have a guild and easily find groups most times. Even had a few all 65 LDoN groups (except me) that was almost like being PL'd hehe. Sick exp I tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Guess i should throw some extra info in.<br />
<br />
I am the leader of my guild.  We raid velious mostly now (lower end stuff), and have 1 65 shaman with fo7 etc.  Buff wise.... I'm not all that worried.<br />
<br />
The level grind / aa grind I know all about.  This is actually an alt, I have a 65 bard as a main.   Though for bards, level was &gt; all as there was really no class changing abilities besides fading memories.<br />
<br />
I was really just wondering if the ability was worth waiting to 65. Really won't take long to grind to 65 I suppose.  I might just do that first.  I get more out of seeing a ding than saying &quot; gah .. 8 more to go...&quot; I guess.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the advice guys n gals, really appreciate it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think there's a right or wrong answer, and I don't think you'll regret it whichever way you do it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I did the AAs for Canni V between level 61 and 62. (I started at 61, then when they opened up the tier 3 zones, I levelled to 62 before carrying on with AA).<br />
<br />
I never really had a problem getting a group, though it probably is a little easier at 65. It doesn't really take long to go through 60-65 though in tier 2/3 of PoP. One factor is - at 61/62 I was getting groups quickly, but more in PoV, only getting groups in HoH and BoT when there were no higher level shamans lfg. At 65, I was more likely to get a group in tier 3, where spectrals drop, and runes can sometimes.<br />
<br />
You do get a bonus for fighting yellows/whites, and you might find this a good reason to stop at 60/61 to AA. I know I did an AA in 50 minutes at IC in PoV at 61 in a flying group, and have fought there at 65 with a similar pace of kills (keeping both caves clear) and the exp rate wasn't as good.<br />
<br />
When I hit 65, I didn't have any 65 spells, and precious few of my 63/64 ones. I did notice fewer resists, though, and I had a few more HP and mana - so I'd recommend getting to 65 straight after canni V if not before, regardless of what spells you have. Once you have the level, the spells will be easier to get.</div></div><hr />
