<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fyful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I have completed up to the point where I have the boots.  I have been told by many shaman that all the other parts are busy work for faction.  I was told to do the test of wisdom 10 extra times or until faction is maxed out.  Then go get the tear and complete the rest.  I honestly think this is true, but have not tried it yet.  What's the word on the street?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol just do the whole quest. Its almost the easiest in the game and it will work if you do it correctly. Why mess with what works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Krakster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was guilty of feeling the urge to &quot;skip&quot; as I had done the epic with friends on their shamans many times on my past characters. Did everything right until the woe/envy part and did that 3-4 times. Finally decided i was tired of running around, Took a group of 60's and me and we finished it in Hole/COM within a few hours.<br />
<br />
The Hole/COM have changed a lot since Luclin came out.  They have become such trivial zones.  3-4 raid parties of the old have been reduced to one really good group encounters..<br />
<br />
Do the epic, have fun with it. Once you have the tear from fear, Every single piece is triggered (Most mobs are less than half a real time day too)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It worked the way you describe up to a couple of pathces ago for sure.  Something has changed in the last couple of patches, and now there *appears* to be a faction &quot;range&quot; for certain steps.  <br />
Specifically the Ghiosk books hand-in is rumored to have a range.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it is all heresay and rumors so no one knows for sure if it is still working the same as before.  Using the faction &quot;workaround&quot; is risky at the moment for this reason.<br />
<br />
Oh, if ya hadn't noticed it will also get you flamed out the wazoo on this board. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just do your epic and don't risk fooking your truespirit faction up.  The hardest part of the entire quest is getting your student's log (the TRUE test of patience).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some people don't have 3 groups of friends to help them finish their epic...<br />
<br />
skipping with faction WORKS, I just did it 2 days ago, there is NO risk, it is the EASIEST way..  and I did the final rak battle with 2 magicians and 1 cleric np, there is no need to waste everyone else's time cause you want your freackin epic the &quot;RIGHT&quot; way... sheez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fine if you want to cheat, go ahead and cheat. Don't come here bragging about it and expect a pat on the back though.</div></div><hr />
