<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You might have taken a look at my other thread and I've decided to come back to eq (already) but for a while play an alt. I wanted to just do tons of DPS, and I decided that I would prefer for it to be a caster, just because I find their versatility (and Gate) fun and useful. So from what I've gathered the two main dps casting classes are Necros, Wiz's, and Mages. However the necro DoT's are more geared for the Solo game than the Group game, which is not necessarily what I want. Ideally I'd like both solo and group DPS power, but of course there arent that many classes that can do that.<br />
<br />
Anyways I'm rambling. Necro is a no, but I can't decide between Wiz or Mage. I know both have good nukes and good AE stuff, while the mages are slightly weaker as a sacrifice for the pet. Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My wife's secondary is a mage. She started a wiz but just wasn't happy with it and from what I've seen wiz almost as bad as necro's at getting groups sometimes. Seems to me that the mage is much more fun and much more versitile although that is from limited experience. I have always liked classes with pets and the mage summon'd stuff can be very nice too. <br />
<br />
And one last thing to consider:<br />
<br />
A Wiz out of mana is as useful as a corpse.<br />
<br />
A Mag out of mana can still contribute nicely with pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started an iksar Necromancer not long ago. Have him up to lvl 56 currently. Having a bit of fun duel comping him and my shaman. He has decent DPS and between the two of them they have a metric ton of utility spells and abilities. Can't wait to get him to 59+ for spec pets and much better DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I hate to say it but as my main is a level 58 Wiz I would have to say Mage.  I love my Wiz but unless you have a group of friends to group with or can raid with him your going to spend most of your time running in circles when you want XP.  <br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong I play 3 peeps over 50 at this time (Wiz 58, Monk 55, Shammy 51) so I have a clue as to more than one class and they ALL can be great fun to play but your ability to get groups with a wiz, frankly, sucks ass.  Wizards have the worst mana regen off all casters (they get the least class specific buffs  to help) and most dependent on pure mana.  I just got a JBB for my shamman and she can now nuke more often and longer than my wizard ever could.  I'm sure my wiz has a higher DPS but if i ever tried to use mana like my shammy i would be kicked out of groups before they said &quot;Hi&quot;. <br />
<br />
Mana  usage/thought is tougher on a wiz, aggro can be just as bad as a shammy and you HAVE to get it once in awhile with no AC and less HP it can be fun :) Your jobs are going to be snaring, nuking, CC, EVACing, Porting and Inviser (about the only &quot;buff&quot; you have).  <br />
<br />
The one thing thats going to take getting used too on the Mage is no inate root.  That is probably the spell i cast most often behind slow on the shammy.  The pets are awsome and the stuff you can conjure is great.  I see more mages getting groups than wizards.<br />
<br />
So while I wouldn't trade mine for the world, being a Wiz is not for the faint of heart nor those that want groups<br />

I think if you're looking for pure sustained DPS, magicians make wizards look like bambi.  Wizards probably have the edge at several levels in burst DPS (where you don't care if you go OOM)<br />
<br />
I've played a wizard to level 50 and so far am not at all impressed by his sustained damage.  In fact, I think it may be one of the lower sustained damage classes in the game.</div></div><hr />
