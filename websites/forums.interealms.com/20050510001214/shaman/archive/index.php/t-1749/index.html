<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">besides that info in the other threads, I have felt gear is a personal taste and most of those ideas either compliment or go full force against the grain of what I do or like to wear.<br />
<br />
My personal goal is to have matching armor actually, but I always look for hp then ac then wisdom then resistances in that order now.<br />
<br />
you will also have a full bag or 5 or gear to swap out to do certain things like bagging a few pieces of JB armor for the effect when mana is tight or the RH BP or VP hammer etc...<br />
<br />
so equipment is always and will always be a personal taste and also include what you can afford or be lucky enough to win.<br />
<br />
What I did long ago was never listen to these kinds of threads but rather go to web sites and do searches for certain gear based on their attributes.<br />
<br />
IE: shaman usable, tribunal usable, neck slot, modifies HP, hp mod between 25-125, non-legends, magic-lore but NOT no-drop<br />
<br />
that is a pretty good search to find shaman twink gear imo, add the no drop stuff if your in a raiding guild and make a wish list and stick to it, but keep in mind one great item might make you dump some resistance stuff in your bag or change the &quot;need&quot; for another item on your wish list.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped a little bit, but check out alakazams or eqmaps since they have a great search function.</div></div><hr />
