<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, we have finally decided to leave SolA and go for a new location. I ported over our three lizzy types last night so that they could go home for the first time in many levels for a visit to Cabilis. I will see about getting Calon a port over or at least take the boat. <br />
<br />
We had a discussion last night as to where to next.. I think a return to Kunark is certain and the locations brought up were Drolga or Dalnir. Both will offer a good test for us and for me in particular as an enchanter. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I did not ding last night (3 blues short), so no clarity or aug yet.. IF (this is a big if) I get a chance, I will see what I can do to get there by next Tuesday. <br />
<br />
So post below where you would like to go.. Dalnir and Drolga are the two places that were brought up or if you have an alternate location, lets hear that as well.. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drolga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Kly, what classes you have now for your group(s)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hard question to answer accurately.. :)<br />
<br />
The following have been recent attendies..<br />
<br />
Griss 28 Monk<br />
Lassha 28 Warrior<br />
Terackia 29 Ranger<br />
Calon 28 Chanter<br />
Draganite 30 Druid<br />
Beridian 28 Bard<br />
Morsisa 26 Shaman<br />
Bomar 28 Cleric<br />
Overflow 30 Shaman<br />
<br />
In addition, we have had some others come by, but they are primaries that have pretty much leveled past us..<br />
<br />
Morgrym 35 (36?) Necro<br />
Noggulbok 35 Warrior<br />
<br />
We also hope to pick up Weezee on a semi regular basis (29 cleric). Cyrssi had also mentioned joining with us every once in a while with Brig (chanter) and/or Elan (rogue) when we got caught up to them in levels. <br />
<br />
Anyone else is welcome to join us and not all the above normally show up every week. Even if you are leveling someone through, you are welcome to join us while you are of a compatible level. We form up groups with what we have and go have some fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brigadiir is 2 blues shy of 31, and Elandarielle is somewhere in 35. Briggy is in Kunark atm, and I can easily get Elan there if you have need of her services. I can't commit to next week though, as I have signed up for the raid to ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I won't be attending, but if I were my vote would go to Drolga.  The exp is awesome, there is a good chance at some nice loot, and Dalnir gives me nightmares :D If you've got any kind of decent enchanter (and Kly plays a pretty mean chanter), Drolga is a great place to soak up some exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Droga, mmmmmm.<br />
This was my second favorite of the midlevel Kunark dungeons (Kaesora being my favorite).  You all will love it there.  There is also some very nice loot out of it, two big ones are:<br />
<br />
Shroud of Nature - the premeir Druid Chest peice outside of planes/velious (or trackanon).  I got it at mid-thirties and wore it to 55.<br />
<br />
Idol of the Thorned - ok this is very rare, but the peice rocks for melee.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the place is just plain fun.  The mobs include some of the tough mob types, including wizards and SKs and there are lots of them.  Kly wrote a peice on it for the journal.  It was a good read and should be on our front page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm, well it looks like you could use a warrior then =) What time does everyone meet? Ravi can be there as a Cleric =) Of course these are the chars we are playing the most of as of late and are close to 33 each. Is that too high?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">33 should be ok.<br />
<br />
Start time is 7 PM CST at the location we are planning on fighting at or a nearby meeting place. (If we wind up doing Drolga, it will be near the FM/OT zone). We generally play for 3 to 3 1/2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Send me a PM with a night you would like to level Calon.  I will be glad to help if I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Darn, ok ... by the time you guys are done we are just logging in. Maybe we can get another group for later that nite there.</div></div><hr />
