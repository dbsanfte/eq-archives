<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My situation - I have spent my 6 basic points, 2 AA's on RC1 (well worth it), and 2 points on MC1.  I have 2 points in the bank.  It would take me 13 more points to get Cann V from here.  I am in a raiding guild that does get rune drops, but I have to be 65 to roll on them, so I have incentive to level, but I hate to sit on those 2 unspent AA's while I level to 65 - they should be working for me.  On the other hand, Cann V is a major upgrade and I'd love to have it.<br />
<br />
So my options as I see them:<br />
<br />
1. Ignore the 2 unspent AA and finish levelling to 65.  Pluses: I get to 65 as fast as possible.  Minuses: 2 unspent AA's not doing me any good until then.<br />
<br />
2. Get 2 more AA, buy MC2, then level to 65.  Pluses: I get to use the extra mana regen while levelling, and I'm that much closer to Cann V.  Minuses: Delay in reaching lvl 65.<br />
<br />
3. Buy another useful skill that costs 2 AA with the AA that I have, then level to 65.  Radiant Cure 2 comes to mind, I love RC1.  Pluses: I get the benefits of the AA's while levelling.  Minuses: I have to earn 15 AA's after hitting 65 instead of 13.<br />
<br />
One other option, that I've already rejected, is to earn one more AA and buy Virulent Paralysis 1 for mob placement and crowd control.  Problem is I don't want to spend the time earning the AA when that XP could get me most of the way to level 64 (I'm tired of dragging the average level of my guild's raids down :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AA's aren't that hard to get once you're 65, I'd say spend 2 frivilous points in Healing Gift. You never know when a crit heal with Tnarg's for 2400+ points or so can make a huge difference in keeping a tank or cleric alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get to 65.  People will invite you to groups more often, even if you do suck.  You'll be free to work AA as long as you like then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get to 65.  People will invite you to groups more often, even if you do suck.  You'll be free to work AA as long as you like then.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's why I rejected the VP idea and 2 of the 3 options I listed get me straight to 65.<br />
<br />
OK, let's knock out option 2 since I didn't like the idea of having to get 2 more AA's to proceed anyway.  So should I spend the AA's or save them?<br />
<br />
Hadn't thought of getting Healing Gift.  It doesn't go off that often, does it?  RC2 would mean a significantly better chance of removing annoying DOTs and adverse effects.  Does HG work with Kragg's Mending?  Because I almost never use Tnarg's, and I thought it didn't work with Kragg's.</div></div><hr />

Not from what I've read.  <br />

<br />
Radiant Cure <br />
Refresh time 3:00 require level 61 no previous ability required. <br />
This ability grants its wielder the ability to cure their party of many afflictions, poison, curese, and harmful magics. You may train in the ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65.  You can train a max of 3 levels in this skill at a cost of 2 points per rank.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the sites I've seen agree with this.  Don't have handy access to the game right now or I'd double check it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nope - is definately 4 aa for RC2, it is why I have been putting it off for a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">100% certain Radiant Cure is a 2/4/6 skill.<br />
<br />
I love virulent paralysis (I know some shaman who consider it a waste though, so maybe I'm crazy), but levels &gt;&gt; all.  If you were within a handful of points from Can5, I'd say go for it, but with that many left just get your levels.  The thing is.. once you get 65.. you won't have dilemmas like this any more.  You'll be so glad you just grinded the 2 remaining levels, and can focus on AA forever :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those sites are wrong. RC is 2/4/6. Already bought the first level and can tell the second level is 4 so i'm guessing at 6 for the third.<br />
<br />
If your already 63 like your sig says I'd say screw it and save the aa's for now. 60-65 can be done in less than a week if you really work at it. 63-65 can be done in a day or 2 given enough time and luck to get into good groups.<br />
<br />
The best skill shaman get period cann v. Anything that you spend before that is a mistake. Save those 2 aa's and just get to 65 asap and then start working on MC for cann v.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OK, several people agree, must be true then.  I'll believe personal experience over a website any day.  Too bad.<br />

<br />
<br />
Heh maybe so except I only get about 3 hours a day to play, about 4-5 days a week, and two of those days are generally spent raiding with my guild, and another 1-2 will be spent hunting for shards for VT keys or helping my wife farm tradeskill pieces or helping friends with quests...<br />
<br />
I'm halfway through 63 now, and in a good group I can do a yellow in about 2 hours, but it's hard to get a good group because I don't play long enough and can't commit to a 6-hour grind.  I figure it's going to take me 8-10 weeks to hit 65, maybe more.<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW I had my AA's wrong (just got back from vacation, everything is a blur) - I have MC2 already + 2 AA's extra.  That means it'd be 4 more AA's to get to a stopping point, which would take way longer than I'd want to spend.  OTOH once I get to 65 I'll just have 9 AA's to Cann V.</div></div><hr />
