<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 33 Shaman on Kane Bayle that I'd like to 50+ asap.  So far I've pretty much grouped my way up, but is this the fastest way to level?<br />
<br />
I've been hunting all over the place, hhk, Paw, Feerott in groups and xp seems okay.  I tried to solo a bit in MS but xp didnt seem to move much.<br />
<br />
I prefer to group, but if I can solo and level faster anywhere I would do so, main problem are my melee skills suck due to being a healer most of my life :(  so I'm guessing a spot of solo work may do me some good.<br />
<br />
This is my first Shammy, but I've had other chars to 55+ but not played a youngster in some time so I'm a bit out of touch with lower zones.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated thanks :)<br />
Also not, I'm not twinked in any way, so no uber gear to help me out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I say grouping is your best bet.<br />
<br />
I solo'd alot at your lvl, and never found anything that was better exp than good groups.<br />
<br />
Try getting groups to go to lower guk, paw, kedge, places like that. <br />
<br />
Good luck :)<br />
<br />
Oh Crystal Caverns also has decent exp for your lvl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Groups give faster exp. unless you have very good equipment.  However, you might want to solo a bit once you reach your high 30s to ensure you max out defence.<br />
<br />
If at 45+ you get a jbb then soloing will become faster than the average group for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never found grouping to yield faster exp than solo'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To those who say soloing is faster, could you give a few hints as to where exactly?<br />
<br />
Also obtaining a jbb isnt going to be easy on Kane Bayle.  People are too busy leveling to be bothered about items.<br />
<br />
And like I said, my equipment pretty much sucks at the mo, mainly Ornate with a CGS and velium spear :/ oh and a soiled breachclout.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">34-36 i solo'd OT, then moved to SOLB for mostly groupin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally find soloing or duoing giving alot more exp then full groups, Unless of course you have a kick ass group but the odds on that are slim, my odds anyway.  <br />
<br />
Also I was a little twinked so that helped in soloing, not crazy twinked but good enough to make the levels go alittle faster.<br />
<br />
Why solo is better then group most of the time?  Well since you have a few 55+ characters I dont think I have to explain it to you hehe but we all know on how groups can be time consuming forming the groups, afk's, waiting, gathering, getting the right classes, etc..<br />
<br />
You also want to solo half of each level to keep your defence and other skills maxed, especially defence.<br />
<br />
At your level I was doing OT till 44 next to the skyfire zone, as an evil class its a big plus with the sarnak braid quest as it gives you nice exp, plus the porting hammer.<br />
<br />
At 44 I did the Spider camp in Nurga, at 47 I did Spirocs in TD, at 51 I did Seafuries in OOT till 55 with Gornit inbetween, helped raise my JBB cash.  At 55 I went to Katta till 56 then went to Highkeep till 59, at 59 my current level I am doing Katta again with a Necro partner getting about a blue every 90mins or so.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again the only thing I change is Highkeep, this place is mucho experience hehe I would of started this as early as possible, I am guessing maybe level 51+.<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope this info is helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail Xara,<br />
<br />
Grouping is much faster post 29. I’ve been soloing with my Shaman in Maros Saru and its painfully slow; I’m trying to get that coveted level 34 :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A good solo-er who can get in a zone can make FAR faster xp from level 44+. Our &quot;hunting grounds&quot; forums on this board are full of tips for solo spots, as are the similar forums on the mage, monk, wizard, necro and druid boards. If you are having trouble finding solo spots, you're just not looking at these boards. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, here are a few of my favorite spots: <br />
<br />
I have yet to find a group that can match the experience gained by solling Golras in Timorous Deep from levels 30 to 39. The downtime associated with grouping KILLS your overall rate of gain. If you were to hunt there and log out there from 30 to 39, you'd tear through these levels. Bind at the firepots to bank.<br />
<br />
From level 40 to 47, nothing could be spiders in Nurga, but  I hear they've been nerfi-fied, probably because they were such a sweet exploit for necromancers and Verant got sick of monitoring them. I don't know what to tell you to hunt at 47 now.<br />
<br />
47 to 50 was a hard time for me. I did Kedge Keep. Good spot if you can handle water well, but not one of my favorites.<br />
<br />
From 50 to 54, do Wizards in Neriak Third Gate. Plenty of posts on this board and on the Mage board explaining this camp.<br />
<br />
From 54 to 57 HHK is where it's at. See our own forums for info on this camp spot.<br />
<br />
From 57 to 60 the Basement of HS can't be beat. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for advice guys, guess I should haul my butt over to OT for a few levels then :)<br />
<br />
I'll be working up my monk on a second pc soon, so will have a nice duo thing going, but am waiting to get to around 39-44 first with my shammy, mainly so I still have the option of grouping with my guild, who are mainly 30-40 at the mo.<br />
<br />
I've read a fair few posts on soloing a shammy, any final tips before I go?:D <br />
<br />
I guess in OT it's root/rot then slow and melee a bit?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks for the help, it's much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Xara.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess in OT it's root/rot then slow and melee a bit?  <br />
<br />
Never have I used this technic unless I had an add in my pull in which case I would DOT/Root the add while I work on the other.<br />
<br />
I always tank the mobs while Slowed, so in this case I would pull with disease dot, Slow as Incoming, then cast posion Dot or 2 while tanking.<br />
<br />
Suggestion, if your 33 you might want to group as it might be more efficient regardless of my post above since you are not twinked and your defence skills are lacking.  <br />
<br />
33 can be a pain, at 34 you gets so much better for you soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Solo is just faster.  No I don't have JBB or fungi.<br />
<br />
But it's so darn freaking boring and grouping is much safer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I spent my 30's in guk, and it seemed to fly by pretty fast. 40's same place, switching to sol b every now and then for something new. Post 50, group in HS if you can, or OS. 56 + solo in HS or OS.Or group there if you wish too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think the most efficient xp is in a dungeon with a trio, the best being the following:<br />
<br />
Shaman (you)<br />
Monk (FD pull, damage output)<br />
Rogue (Damage output)<br />
<br />
Make sure the Rogue knows what he's doing so he doesn't pull aggro, keep you and the monk in regen, hp buff, haste on monk/rogue.<br />
<br />
In a monk/shaman duo I do awesome for xp, a lot more than I can manage solo.  Unless you talk per kill, then sure, solo is better, but sure isn't faster.  But XP per hour duo/trio would be the best.<br />
<br />
Generally when you go to bigger groups you have too much firepower and not enough mobs.  The duo/trio makes this less of an issue.<br />
<br />
The key also is a 'GOOD' group/duo/trio.  Anything else and you may be wasting your time...</div></div><hr />

Bind at the firepots to bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is assuming Timorous Deep is still bugged and you can still bind there...  (Just make sure you bind up above on the spires and not in the pot room itself.  This gives you fast access to TD when you want it.)<br />
<br />
If not its a no bind zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think a shaman below level 34 will probably get experience faster in a good group or partial group (2-4). If you get decent gear, then when you get the pet, soloing will go decently fast and if you get a jbb at (or by) 45, then soloing will be really fast. From levels 45-49 I got experience as fast, if not faster, solo than I did grouped even though the groups were pretty good. Sharing experience with 5 other people though takes its toll. Whatever you do, group or solo, make sure you take enough of a beating each level to keep defense maxxed out. It only gets harder the higher you get. I was lucky in that I'd read alot on these boards, so I made it a priority to max out defense. Best advice I ever heard on how to play a shaman. As far as zones to level in go, paludal is supposed to be great in the twenties (only hearsay as I never hunted here in my twenties), dawnshroud peaks is good in the thirties, echo caverns is awesome in the 40s and even somewhat decent at 50ish (if you camp taskmaster room - taskmaster and skellies). I don't know the best zones for the lowbie levels. I took the beaten path for the most part, since I was a complete newbie then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's all about he grouping post 29.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This past Friday I was two yellows into lv47. With my trusty dawg and JBB, I soloed the entire weekend. By Sunday at 7:30pm, I finally reached lv49. The first part of the weekend I was hunting HG at the Rathe Mountains. After a few hours, there were too many high level people taking all the giants. I then traveled to Maiden's Eye. Nobody really was in that zone so I left. After feeling pretty down, I went down to the Dreadlands. I was surprised to see that there was still a lot of dark blue mobs there. So I spent Sat and Sun soloing outside of KC. The only mob that almost got me killed a few times were those annoying Ravishing Drolvargs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you kill one mob you get X exp.<br />
If you kill one mob with a friend in group you get half of X exp.<br />
If you kill one mob with 2 friends in group you get one third of X exp.<br />
<br />
...and so on.<br />
<br />
To maximize exp, you want to find the highest rate of kills with the fewest number of group mates.  For example...<br />
<br />
Solo you kill 10 things in 20 minutes.<br />
With one partner you kill 22 things in 20 minutes.<br />
With two partners you kill 28 things in 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Here, the optimum group is the second... work with one partner.  Adding more people may make it easier, and provide a cushion if a pull goes bad, but in the long run it hurts exp. rate.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, hunt indoors if at all possible.  The exp bonus from dungeons adds up quickly.<br />
<br />
Good dungeons to two man...<br />
<br />
SolB.<br />
Guk.<br />
Chardok.<br />
CC and ToFS.<br />
Hole (near the top).<br />
Areas of Permafrost.</div></div><hr />
