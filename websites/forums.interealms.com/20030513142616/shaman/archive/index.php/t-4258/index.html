<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok am trying to find a little solid info on where the mob who drops these, Tae Ew Hunter,  spawns at in the maze. I have killed in there more than I care to admit, and have yet to see him. Really just need to know what area of the maze to kill so I can force this bastage to spawn... thanks lots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont know about the legs, but do you solo/duo in the maze?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We usually camp at spires in the maze, but when we kill hunter we usually move down to 'campfire' room, which is south-ish from spires, and he is a short pull from there (next room south I think, 3 spawn).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gronk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes a monk and I duo in the maze, gets interesting on nameds but normal mobs are pretty much cake... and yes I can solo the single spawns of the maze as long as they aren't rain makers, or the large raptor, dreadfang's ph...<br />
<br />
so you said he spawned in the fire room for you ? thanks will try camping there a little heavier, have only seen tae ew bloodfiend spawn in there so far, maybe just bad luck on my part. thanks</div></div><hr />
