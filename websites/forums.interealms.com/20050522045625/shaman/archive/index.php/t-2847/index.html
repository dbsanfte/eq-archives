<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi was just curious if you can kick or bash in bear form. Also are there any other benefits to being a bear, besides looking liking one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can not bash,  and shaman, as far as I know, can't kick regardless  (bear form is self only).   I am not sure about the extend of the lev 55 spell, but the lev 34 one gives 5 wis, and 1hp/tick regen, as well as infravision.  I assume there are added benefits to the Greater Bearform.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans cant kick or bash in bearform. We lose ability to slam when we arent barb/troll/ogre. Bearform gives increased wisdom and hp regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I want to kick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So we can slam in bear form though?  just not kick or bash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman cannot kick or bash ever.   While in Bear form you are no longer a Barbarian, Troll or Ogre and you lose the ability to Slam because bears do not have it innately.  Kitties &amp; Leezards never have the ability to Slam so there's no change there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was rabid bearing a shroom in FG once, and it &quot;shroomed&quot; me.<br />
Well, after shroom form wore off, I was in barbarian form, with rabid bear effects still on, and was able to slam.  Of course, the RB effect wore off normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cast regular bear form on yourself, then use rabid bear form.<br />
<br />
Voila.  When the rabid bear wears off, you still have the extra wisdom from normal bear form, but you are able to bash.<br />
