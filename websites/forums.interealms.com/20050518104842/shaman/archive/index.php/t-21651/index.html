We have all 4 medals, but 2 people in our group have not completed a PoJ Trial yet.  I don't want to waste 2 spots if you need to have completed a trial for this.<br />

Thanks for the info.<br />

You can.  I completed the alternate access quest yesterday and my cleric is able to zone in to Tactics.  He does not have his PoV/PoS flag (he does have his HoH flag, and he is unable to zone in to HoH because he lacks the Trial - go figure).</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's an alternate to the regular access route of killing raid mobs... eg poi behemoth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The person handing in the medallions needs to have completed a PoJ trial and have Storms access - after all, it's &quot;alternate access&quot; but it's in a zone that you originally needed to be flagged to get in to.<br />
<br />
Other people in their group will recieve the flag, whether or not they've done a PoJ trial, the PoJ requirement is only for the guy doing the quest.<br />
<br />
Open to being proven wrong, but I've seen several medallions eaten when turned in by someone who didn't have the right flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Forum posts for the Assist Wembly quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2292) on Alla's assert that you need good enough faction for Wembly to talk to you in order to hand in the medallion quarters successfully. The forum for Wembly the Forlorn (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10260) says he's probably on Askr the Lost faction; killing giants in Storms (or BoT?) will gain his favor. If you haven't killed any giants and don't have faction; he'll eat your turn-ins. Talk to him.</div></div><hr />
