Fire / Arcane is a good strategy for general grouping due to it's burst damage.<br />
<br />
I have a 60 warrior on WoW and those are the basics, from what my level 60 brethern tell me.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what choose, Instant Arcane Explosion (IAE) is a MUST.<br />

Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started a mage alt recently and got it to 26 so far.  You will defintely want at least 18 points in arcane so you can get the instant AE (MUST have) and evocation.  The rest is up to you whether you want fire or ice.  I think fire does more damage and might be faster when you are grinding.  All the mages in my guild are now ice specced because of raids like Molten Core and Onyxia.  Ice also seems viable in PvP.  I am going to go 31 arcane and 20 fire to level and probably spec to ice once I get 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What is so good about the ice spec Jin? I just do not see the point besides the quicker refresh on frost nova.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Juujuu had a good build here.  Can't remember if he went 100% Arcane or not, but I am following his to the 't'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know much about mages but for high end PvE all of our mages are ice specced.  Ice has some good skills like the Ice Block, thats pretty much a paladin DA shield except you cant move and I think it removes aggro from you.  There's also that one skill that is like a preparation for ice skills.</div></div><hr />

At the moment, that's what I'm doing still.  I'm 56 now.  Pyroblast is a nice big nuke.  If I want to kill something fast, I pull with fireball, pop instant, pop 35% damage, pyroblast, fireblast, cone of cold, then arcane missle.  That will kill almost anything.  If the mob is level 51 or so, I'll kill the mob after the cone of cold.<br />
<br />
Maybe when I start doing stuff in Molten Core, or other areas that are immune to fire damage more often I'll think about changing to some frost talents so I can refresh my ice root.<br />
At the moment my build posted above is going quite fine.<br />
The only thing I changed was going with Improved Fireblast instead of going with Impact.<br />
I use fireblast and arcane explosion when in close range all the time, and faster recast on fireblast just works out better overall.<br />
I can do an fireblast then arcane missle then fireblast<br />
