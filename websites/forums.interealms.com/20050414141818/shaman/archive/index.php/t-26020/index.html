<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi - just need some advice.<br />
<br />
I currently have wicked bone atlatl and earring of ethical uncertainty for my spell haste. <br />
<br />
I am looking to swap out the atlatl whilst retaining beneficial spell haste. I have the points to buy the SHV DoN augment.<br />
<br />
My question is, whats the max amount quiessence can be 'hasted' for? Since SHV &lt; atlatl effect, what level of Quick buff do I need to exceed or match that effect? (currently have no QB AA)<br />
<br />
The atlatl will need to go soon, especially when (if!) i ever get the oow version.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
Ash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">50% Spell Haste is the max from Focus and AAs. I'm not sure if Cleric SH buffs are overcap or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Atlatl is 20% spell haste, reducing by 1% each level over 65 (1% being 5% of the original effect).  So it has full efffect on Quiescence, but will only be 15% haste on Spiritual Serenity.  Quick Buff AA speeds up buff spells by 10%/25%/50%, with no level limit.  <br />
<br />
50% is the maximum possible haste that can be applied to any spell.  This limit applies to all spell haste, from AA, foci, and buffs (specifically cleric buffs, but there's also the CBQ clicky).  Because of this limit, lots of shamans stop at Quick Buff rank 2, 25%, because a basic focus and cleric buff get them to the cap of 50%.  You have to choose what you're aiming for.  If you get a really good bene spell haste focus, then only QuickBuff2 is needed to get max haste on buffs.  If you have less than the best focus, then QB3 will provide a functional pickup in cast time.  Enough added haste to justify 9aa?  That's up to you.<br />
<br />
Personally, capping Quickbuff is the next thing on my list, I'm doing the last rank of OoW healing crits atm.  Having max haste on Serenity is worth it to me, and I'm having a B*TCH of a time finding a level 70 bene spell haste focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Itemization for spell haste(Especially beneficial) for shamans, along with many other classes, is sub par.<br />
<br />
The cost to max QB3 (3/6/9 IIRC) is 18 AAs, at, say  an hour and a half an AA(easy slow solo speed on PoM hobbits) would be 27 hours, the amount of time to find beneficial spell haste focus, and the number of times to beg a cleric for their spell haste buff==(forever)<br />
<br />
It really is a nice AA, right up there with VP, ASC2, and max buff extension.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, consider your play style before choosing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I've never found QB3 to be worth anything. QB 2 is nice and where I stopped. My logic is simple really. I always want a spell haste focus of some sort or another for things other than buffs so qb3 vs qb2 doesn't effect what focus's I want on my gear and in my case doesn't offer any benifit at all.<br />
<br />
Ever since spell haste came out it was on my list of focuses i wanted to have. Benificial spell haste for things like heals (yoppa's and daulada's), gate, summon pet etc. Main one of corse being heals. It just also happens to cover buffs too. Detrimental spell haste for slow, malo and dots/nukes. slow and malo being the most important of corse.<br />
<br />
Personally I started off with agnar's earring for 18% spell haste on everything. Eventually picked up a fennin belt for 30% benificial spell haste and then finally Ikkinz 2 shoulders for 23% detrimental spell haste. Now i'm looking to pick up a new benifical spell haste so I can upgrade my belt. But either way you slice it I'm not going to be with out a spell haste focus of some sort that would cover buffs. Even the most basic spell haste 5 is 15%. Combined with qb2 thats 40% spell haste. Cleric buff is enough to max you out when you have it to make the difference between qb2 and qb3 nothing. Even with out the cleric buff 9aa's for 10% spell haste on buffs just doesn't seem worth while to me. As you get better spell haste focus's the situation just gets worse. Currently I've got enough spell haste that even level 70 buffs are maxed out with just focus and qb2 with out cleric buff.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll get it eventually but at this point I'm at almost 600aa's and no sign of that point on the horizon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that would be you, Taraddar?  Right, back to the actual discussion, which is from the perspective of dude with Wicked Bone Atlatl, not Gleaming Mesh Girdle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I said even if I was stuck with just a Spell haste 5 augment I'd still have some form of spell haste and wouldn't find QB3 useful enough to justify the cost. Yeah I've got it easy since I've got a nice spell haste item.<br />
<br />
In his case i'd gets qb 2 aa and the Spell haste 5 aug. That gives him 15% spell haste for everything and 40% for buffs which puts him ahead of the wicked bone.</div></div><hr />
