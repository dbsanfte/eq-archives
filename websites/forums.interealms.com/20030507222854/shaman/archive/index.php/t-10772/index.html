<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of starting a froglok shaman and going to sell gear off two characters I have which should give me the amount of approximately 8-9k. <br />
<br />
First, I'd like to say please don't be mad at me and my sympathy goes out to the trolls and the fact the frogloks started in that city. I wish we had our own. But I digress.....<br />
<br />
1.What Pierce weapon? ( I have a 1hb and 2hb already)?<br />
2.What is the foci II item name which give extended buff?<br />
3.What is the foci II item name which give extended dot's?<br />
4.Is there any suggestions on armor around the foci items that would be within my budget and good on AC?<br />
5.Honestly, can a deticated casual player shaman solo with mediocore gear and no guild to 60th? I'm familiar with root/rot tactics.<br />
<br />
Please - the one subject I don't want to talk about is the price of our high level spells and rate of which they drop. I'm well aware of this grave dilema. I plan to stay at 55th lvl with all full xp into aa points. One day I should have saved up enough to purchase the spells I need to be a productive shaman. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At low level a Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate would be a huge advantage and it will last you well into your 40s and beyond.  I would start with that and then just go to the bazaar and look for deals.  If you're patient you can find some great equipment for bargain prices.<br />
<br />
A couple of Velium Fire Wedding Rings would be very nice, or you could get one and do the PoP Collector quest for the Fine Antique Ring with Mana Preservation 2.  Very easy and you can buy all the needed items for a song in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Jaundiced Bone items are a bargain for straight AC gear but you may want more stats at the begining of your career.  JB will come into it's own as you level up though so it's not such a bad idea for the medium to long term.<br />
<br />
What you should actually get depends a lot on what is available on your server and for how much.  There are a lot of minor variables between server economies that are hard to predict untill you actually see them in action.<br />
<br />
And yes you can solo all the way to the 50's with purchaseable equipment.  My first Shaman went to 51 with 90% solo and small groups.  My guild was more social than raid capable.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the wonderfull world of being a Shaman (eventhough you STOLE my city)<br />
<br />
Iksar regen BP, is Huge, Ry'Gor is very nice for most other slots.  Ac 6  65 Hp rings are HUGE ( i wore mine until lev 63)<br />
<br />
REIF ( Rune Etched Icewurm Fang) is the BEST piercer until you get your epic.  <br />
<br />
Ikky BP                       3500<br />
REIF                           2000<br />
2 rings                       700<br />
Bunch of Ry'Gor          500<br />
Assorted stuff ( spider fur belt, Mammoth Cloak, Tribal War boots, Tattered Mantle, Wyvern Mask, Forrest Loops) <br />
<br />
                                 2000<br />
<br />
Grand Total              8700<br />
<br />
<br />
Idividual mileage my vary, you might get some deals.  This gear shoud serve you well into your late 40s early 50s<br />
