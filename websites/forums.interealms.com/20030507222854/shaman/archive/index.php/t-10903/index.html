<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I just dinged level 34 yesterday with my shammy and I got my new pup to. I'm in need of a new shoulder item and I was looking at some of the profiles from magelo. I've noticed that the Elder Wolf Hide seems to be a popular choice for the shoulder slot. So i did some research and found out that it drops from a named wolf called Ghowik in Hollowshade Moor that's around level 30 so I'm thinking cool I gotta get that. My question is should it be a easy kill for me at 34 with my pup? I got 1100 hit points self buffed and if I can't solo because of the adds I here that hang around him I can bring my wife's 33 beastlord and a friend who is a 36 warrior. Should I or we have any problems and if you've camped this mob what level were you and what plan did you use to go after him? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At your level, I doubt you'll be able to clear the cave of mobs - you'll need to play this one without your pet.  Invis up, head to the back of the cave where he is (PH is a sonic packleader), and position yourself so you are right next to the rock that sticks out and the back of the cave.  With the right positioning, the only mob that aggros will be Ghowlik.  I'd estimate his HPs to be in the region of 1600, one Bane kills him.<br />
<br />
He will run when low on health, and he is highly resistant to root, so you'll want to finish him with a nuke.  Otherwise,  looting the body will aggro several wolves, if he goes too far.<br />
<br />
Will be difficult solo at 34, and more than one person may cause issues with adds.  The Elder wolf hide is either an uncommon or rare drop, and the PH seems to be up 75% of the time.  The mob is on a 12 minute cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ghowlik is a mean mofo for his level and would be a tough fight but doable at level 34, ASSUMING a single pull or no other spawns up...the problem with HSM mobs is that the static spawns around him or his PH points pop VERY fast, around the 2 min mark maybe less, thus making getting to him challangeing if your a level that can kil him for exp.<br />
Even for my 50 ranger he seemed to be a failry good fight, reducing himn to 80ish % hit points plus granting him 2 adds to deal with.<br />
The hide is a rare drop, took me 4-5 kills to get it and a total of 13 spawns of Ghowlik or his PH. Its a nice shoulder slot, I wore one for many levels shortly after Luclin came out (got lucky when i was exploring the new zones).<br />
Good luck and have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't Sonic Wolves see thru invis or are the ones in the cave different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The didnt see through Cameo nor did they see through my hide skill on my ranger; the ones that are at the entrance of the cave are occasionally perma rooted ones....guardians I believe, part of some on-going war in HSM, all of them summon (owl bears, grimlings and sonic wolves; having 10 grimling defenders backstabbing you ouch) and I believe that some do see invis.<br />
In any case, my ranger did the camp just fine at 50 sitting right on the spawn point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I talked to some other guys we group with last night and they said they'd help out on Ghowlik. So with that being said should a group of 5, including a now 37 warrior with around 1700 hit points, a 33 beastlord with around 1200 hit points, my self a 34 shaman with around 1100 hit points, a 30 shadow night and a 30 necromancer with around a 1000 hit points each with all pets up have any problem owning that cave and Ghowlik? I guess what I'm asking/saying is do we have the fire power to get the job done? Because I want that hide. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I chose the invis up and hide at the back of the cave option @ 34, altho after 15 PH's and 10 ghwoliks i gave up and bought one for 800pp (that was a one off price on AB, usually 1500pp+).<br />
<br />
As someone has already posted, invis up and be sure to have sow and position yourself next to the big rock that sticks out of the wall (your back against the cave wall). I cast slow and then melee'd and nuked..he takes some nuking and will run. One problem is there is a roaming wolf that does a circuit of the cave, attack ghwolik or PH once the roamer just gets clear as it will be coming back round towards the end of the fight and it can be close thing to invis up again or loot and run.<br />
<br />
I had to run for the grimiling forest zone several times but with sow it's an easy evac.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with whatever method you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the group you mentioned you should be able to pull out of the cave with no problems at all.  If you could find a cleric it would make it almost too easy.  I can solo the wolves at level 24, just not quickly enough to empty the cave. <br />
<br />
There are three wolves in the entrance tunnel and two more inside that you need to take out to be able to single pull Ghowlick/Packleader so you need to be able to kill 6 wolves every 12 minutes.  Should be cake with the DPS of the group you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Sonic Wolves hit fast and run at near SoW speed,  as the groups shaman you're main duty will be slowing.  The respawn rate in the cave is pretty fast so you must be in a mana conservation mode and work efficiently if you want to pull from outside.<br />
<br />
Most of the wanderers in the area come out of the cave so they should not present too much of a problem.  If they do just move up on the hill and pull back to there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well we did it! It was a trial and error thing but in the end I got the hide. We went in saturday night and died about 2 times, not everyone but 2 or 3 of our group, no cleric that time. So we tried again sunday morning this time with a cleric. All in all we had me a 35 shaman, 34 beastlord, 37 warrior, 30 shadow knight, 35 cleric and a 36 paladin and no one died at all. We cleared and cleared the cave at least 5 times, after 5 packleaders and what seemed like hundreds of sonic wolfs Ghowlik popped and I pulled him out along with about 4 sonic wolfs that just seem to never stop popping. Well after the first kill Ghowik dropped the Elder Wolf Hide! So now I can say I have nice shoulder item for my 35 shammy. Thanks for all the help and advice guys. Later...</div></div><hr />
