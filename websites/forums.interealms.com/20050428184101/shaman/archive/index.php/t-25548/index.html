<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok well Im now 44 on both shaman and druid...stranglethorn is old hat all quests done that dont take a entire group (IE: elites) and Im having problems figuring out where to go to set up for 45 to 50....<br />
<br />
Ive looked on Alakazams... the zones they say that are good for 44 to 46 have like 2 or 3 quests and they all end in a elite full group quest...at least from what I read.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts are appreciated <br />
tks</div></div><hr />

The Zul'Farrak instance is there too and has about 5 elite quests.  Boss drops some decent weapons too.  Otherwise loot is pretty poor but the exp is fantastic.  The Gadzetgan goblins offer quite a few non elite quests as well.  Also make sure you go to the port village, Stormweadle I think is the name, east of town and get the quests there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also Feralas has a bunch of quests for that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, I'd avoid The Hinterlands.  This zone sucks more than desolace.  Crappy quests, no horde town or merchants, TWO alliance posts, and monsters litered everywhere so you are garantueed to get adds.</div></div><hr />
