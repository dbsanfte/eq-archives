<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is a contribution I made to my guild's fiction thread. This was written a few months ago when I hit level 60. If you've ever grouped with me you would be aware that I have a reputation as being slightly pungent. Hope you enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
The pain throbbed down to my bones as the world around me became that much clearer. I looked up in time to see Capernicus crest the hill and hear his shout, “Make ready your blades my friends, I’m bringing a Crystalline Golem to the Party!”<br />
<br />
I felt my drogmoor shift beneath my feet as he caught the golem’s scent and I briefly left the plane in search of my spirit world counterpart’s power. I awoke but a few seconds later, forced that surge of power into my hands and called forth a debilitating cloud of insects upon the unwary crystal beast. “Slowed a Crystalline Golem!” I called out to the group as the mob reached Capernicus. He called upon his god in the same instant and a sharp crack rang out across the valley, stunning the beast for a few seconds. Those few seconds would be the last peace it would know. <br />
<br />
It shook it’s head to resume it’s attack on Capernicus and a devastating attack on it’s being began. Two cats of immense size and power pounced onto the golem with speed no mortal should know. My own companion sensing the carnage to come, lept into the fray. Claws of flesh and steal ripped into the crystal rending terrifying screeches of agony. Not but a moment later a deadly rain of fire broke out above it’s head and I channeled my energy once again to conjure a deceptively deadly poison in the beasts very veins. My long friend Enomdar let loose a last mighty fireball at the center of the beast and it shattered into many tiny pieces.<br />
<br />
As quickly as it begun it stopped. In that calm, I felt a tug on my soul. My training took over and I allowed myself to leave my body in search of the greater truth. I floated out across the plains and into the foggy void, the very fabric of space and time that binds our troubled lands together. The fog cleared and I found myself standing before my Lord Mithaniel Marr. I drew to one knee and lowered my head in humility. As I rose I felt a new awareness about me. A clarity not before available had bestowed upon me, and at that very moment the fog drifted in and the visions began.<br />
<br />
I more felt than sensed my surroundings at first. With the fog so thick I could smell the battle before I could see it and I was in the thick of it. Orcs. Dozens of them surrounded me, but I realized then that I was not in control. It was not me, but me, watching through the eyes of another. A short curved blade slashed and hacked at the Orcs in front of me spilling their putrid smelling blood to the earth I could not see. A healing touch balanced the pain of their assault in a precarious struggle between life and death. I drew on the power I held within and attempted to focus the power of this warrior’s spirit. And focus it I did. The warrior parried and then his next attack was ferocious indeed, with deadly accuracy he dispatched his nearest foe. The battle waged on even as the fog grew tighter around me.<br />
<br />
When the fog lifted again I was moving through a hall. A hall of the dead cursed with eternal unrest. Ahead a terrible ghoul shrieked it’s unholy greeting and a new blade met met my foe. This one was longer, straighter and with a thirst to relieve the undead of their hunger to end life. As the ghoul fell to the blade’s wrath another appeared, and another. This warrior and his mighty blade would surely fall to the attack. I saw the sweat drip from my forehead and realized I had no fear. I called on my Lord Mithaniel Marr and he granted my host his very Avatar. Power beyond that of ordinary mortals and even my ability to focus surged in the warrior’s soul. The fog crept in again as the valiant warrior plunged his blade into a fourth and fifth.<br />
<br />
My fingers flexed on the bridal before I had fully revived and I knew I had returned to the Plane of Valor. Strange visions I had seen and I knew I had been chosen as one of the few Oracles of Lord Mithaniel Marr. I wondered about the young warrior in my visions, would he return to teach me more? I looked down at the puppy beneath my feet and channeled my energy upon him, focusing him as I had the young warrior. “Make ready your blades my friends, I’m bringing a Crystalline Golem to the Party!”<br />
<br />
I farted.</div></div><hr />
