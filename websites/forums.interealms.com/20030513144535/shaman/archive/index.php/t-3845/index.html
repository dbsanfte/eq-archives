The arisen iksar is quoted to be &quot;around level 50&quot; in the walkthrough.  He is not 'around' level 50, he's a tough S.O.B.who is pretty damn MR, summons, and has a bunch of Hp's.<br />
<br />
I did the hand-in with a 55 druid friend, figuring he didn't summon so we could kite him up and down the beach.  Boy were we wrong.  Granted my druid friend nuked a bit prematurely....but the arisen summoned him, whacked him hard, spanked dogdog and then me while I was still working on slowing him.<br />
<br />
Bring a real tank.  Bring healing power..bring a wizzy nuker.  Probably as a full group we wouldn't have had a problem..my epic DID do visible damage before I got whacked.  <br />
<br />
Damn..took me months to finally get around to getting a s.wing group together..now I gotta go BACK and get another dusty skull (which only drops off the cryptkeeper skelly, the big one. The glowing skulls are the random drops)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did this awhile back with a rogue and a cleric...was pretty much all we needed. rogue tanked, cleric healed, and i got resisted alot =/<br />
wasn't an overly long fight, basically i came along for buffs, etc<br />
(fyi this was before i had a HS key, the rogue offered to MQ it for me since he basically lived in HS and had all the skulls)<br />
and yes he does summon, and HT, and is ratherly nasty if unprepared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
East wing ad two drop at same time, south wing I never saw one.<br />
<br />
Im on morell Thule as well and REALLY need a group to do the last battle.<br />
<br />
Between down time, patches, and a dead modem, Im still trying to get this raid done.<br />

mercuratrayin, 53 shaman, order of the white hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also did this part with just a 60 rogue and I think it was a 56 cleric at the time. I just buffed and tried to see about slowing, never did get him slowed. Think the cleric had about 30 mana when we killed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I participated in his kill with a full pick-up group 50-55 of 1 chanter, 1 cleric, and 4 (!) shamans.  Mostly the 4 dog pets beat it down.  Cold nukes and undead nukes work, poison and disease and magic don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did this part a while back, but landed slow right after Malosini hit.  I would suggest setting up a group to the left of the Oracle a good distance down the beach to avoid aggro issues.  Park yourself by the Oracle with pet and when the Arisen pops, send in the pet and fall back to your party.  This gives you a short bit of time to land debuffs while pet gets eaten.<br />
<br />
It took me about 2 weeks to get all my skulls together and I did not look forward to repeating that, so I brought 4 friends to the fight:<br />
<br />
L60 roguer<br />
L60 monk<br />
L60 cleric<br />
MB weezard (was bored)<br />
<br />
Overkill is ALWAYS better for quests IMO.</div></div><hr />
