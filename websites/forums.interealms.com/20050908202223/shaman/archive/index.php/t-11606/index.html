The inventory slots in the hotkeys were specifically adapted for shaman and what I personally had for my shaman, but they can be modified if you chose.  In the inventory XML file you can find the appropriate &quot;EQType&quot; number that corresponds with each inventory slot.  From there, just open up the hotbuttons file, scroll down to the portion with the inventory slots, and replace the number in &lt;EQtype&gt;#&lt;/EQtype&gt; with whatever slot you'd like.<br />
