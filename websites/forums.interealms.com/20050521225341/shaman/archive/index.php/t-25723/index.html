<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Without a magelo it's hard to tell where you could solo.  But, from 65-70 there are a few easy spots:<br />
<br />
Droga  - do the named all across the zone for ok XP and profit.  Plenty of guides to this in the forums.<br />
<br />
Nobles Causeway - There are a couple of spots where you can solo.  Avoid the named unless you have good gear and AAs. They summon.<br />
<br />
Bloodfields - Lots of spots to root rot here.  Inside the tunnels you can pet pull the Dragorn.  In the fields find a safe spot and tag the wanderers.  They don't hit that hard so not bad even if you grab one that summons.<br />
<br />
One spot I used is to go through the tunnel and out into the 1st field (be sure and go through the courtyard).  Hang a right and follow the wall to an aclove.  This area is safe from pathers and has a decent number of mobs to pull to it.<br />
<br />
Harbinger's Spire - You can camp the mobs in the first floor.  Stick with the dragorns.  There are many camps here and a variety of named.  There are several threads on camping / farming this zone.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief - Camp the castle wall and 1st couple rooms of th castle.  Goal is to get the research components for RGC.  That spell still sells quick at 60k.<br />
<br />
You can also still get good experience soloing in PoValor, PoTactics, PoFire, etc.  There are threads on all of these zones in the forums.<br />
