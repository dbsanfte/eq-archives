<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like grouping -- grouping makes the game fun!  But sometimes you just need an evening to yourself and tradeskilling is not on the menu.  I was wondering if people had some recommendations on the places for best Solo XP.  Mebbie even a sequence ).  As I see it nothing I've seen can beat tables in PoFire.  The first castle is nice, and still very solo-able, the GY and 1st field in PoFire is &quot;ok&quot; ... but seems pretty slow in comparison;  plus there's the non-rootable mobs that can scare the bejeezus outta you =).  PoEarth -- Everything(?) summons.  PoWater -- lots more wanderers ( or so it seems ), plus the difficulty of the water zone ( floating, casting interruptions ) has kept me from soloing there.  PoAir seems impossible as well!  While I've grouped in GoD (mostly for trials) I've done very little solo there.<br />

again, this is not a mathmatical analysis -- just what it's felt like.  Does anyone have advice/suggestion/recommendations?  Please, edit the list and include locales that you've found to be superior/inferior or whatever.  I'm Kod`Taz flagged but haven't done anything there yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've soloed the first mobs in Yxxta at the zoneline..<br />
They break VP quiet often and break root now and then..<br />
Pull with Malicous Decay and VP.. If VP gets resisted run for the zoneline.<br />
Debuff with Malosinia and root with Petrifying Earth..<br />
Slow it just to be safe.<br />
Start dotting it and reapply root now and then..<br />
They havn't got many Hp's and give 10% AAxp..<br />
<br />
Not a good place to solo, but will get your adrenaline pumping for sure :)<br />
And it's a pain in the butt to get to aswell.. and don't expect to get a rezz there easily.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did the Hraquis down at what I'm calling the fishlord camp as suggested by qhor.  It was a little tricky to pull and not get totally killed .... until I started casting Malicious Decay at nearly max range and then virulent paralysis soon after.  Because of the float and their quick hitting speed once they hit you it's quite likely you're going to be dead, just too many darn interrupts.  ~8 min kills worth about 4 blue bubs ( still using classic UI ) and almost no down time for mana.  Might go faster with KEI/VoQ, but it's not likely you're going to get too many refreshes if you camp down there for a while ;)<br />
<br />
So Tables still reigns for speed of access but Fishlord camp gives as good XP and you won't have people calling out &quot;Campcheck&quot; every 2 mins.  Plus, I think I got Soapstone(x2), Kelp Strands(x5) and Chunk of E'cian Ice(x2) after 90 mins of camping. <br />
<br />
 I did my best to only pull the Scouts and Hunters... any advice on the others?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, the experience per hour at tables is definitely superior to hraquis, due to the fact that it's so mindlessly easy. i find the hraquis camp more entertaining though.<br />
<br />
feel free to pull any of the hraquis mob types.  the mystics (shaman mobs) will likely malo you and attempt to land a few dots.  the magi (mage mobs) will try to malosinia you and toss a few fire and magic nukes.  the faith wardens (cleric mobs) will try to land a few magic based nukes and run themselves out of mana before they're low enough to ch (usually).  any shaman with a mix of vt / elemental or better gear and self resist buffs up should basically resist all spells cast on them by the hraquis.  the only thing you should worry about with the casters is them dispelling themselves and removing your root; however with the number of debuffs and dots you'll have on them, it's unlikely they'll hit the root on the odd occasion they even cast dispel.<br />
<br />
you basically nailed the pull strategy i use.  keep a clicky invis item out (chardok ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5733) or ct mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27830)), invis up after a kill, snoop around until you see a lonely hraquis, malicious decay it, swim back to the fishlord, and spam your vp key until the mob's in range/line of sight.<br />
<br />
oh, i'd advise against pulling the crabs since they're highly resistant and innately quad... vp and magic-based roots alike will break long before they run their full duration.  they're nice exp in groups though, and drop stuff for the crab food (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29775).</div></div><hr />

PoW Camps (http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ctoni/reef_all.jpg)<br />
 I put a `lil star where I pretty much set up.  To get there from zone in, INVIS UP! then take a left through the big #3, then a right to get to the #8 ... at the spot where my cut-n-past skills totally stunk, prior to the &quot;Drop Down&quot; is where you'll get the wandering, see-invis Triloun Champion.  Wait for him to head back down the east fork ( away from you ) then zip down following the purple dashed line up to the red star.  You'll be near the Fishlord guy, but he won't aggro you -- doesn't even assist if you bring mobs that you're fighting next to him.<br />
<br />
BTW, I've been using the left fork because in the little hraquis hut at the bottom there's only one mob.  If you were to chose the right fork there are two mobs in that hut .... and I havn't been able to pull only one solo.<br />

Good luck!<br />

<br />
I go a bit past the castle to the NW corner and pull golems there.<br />
<br />
Virtually always single pulls, unless you get careless and get a spider add.  About 7% AA per kill.  Takes a while though, they have some HP.  I haven't been back there since getting Fire access, but I levelled up from 62-65 there almost exclusively.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well let me tell you how it went for me. I get buffed up pretty good in pok and head to PoWater, invis up, and head in. Swimming through the first room slowly i noticed the small frog sees invis... and he noticed me aswell lol. To make it short, its impossible to cast gate while getting hit underwater hehe... Anyway i got a rez and gave up for the night, next time  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the frogs are a trap mob, they despawn like 15 minutes after spawning<br />
<br />
usually nothing will see invis until you hit your first champion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">First night I hunted in PoWater one of the 2 entrance mobs (triloun guardians) could see invis.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ok went back last night to the Hraqui camp...woo it was scary down there (and the reguna's see invis).<br />
<br />
Pulled the first hraqi in the little hut, did fine on root rot, got the promised 4 blues of AAXP - amazing exp.<br />
<br />
For my second mob I tried pulling from the big room, got a single but by the time I swam back past Fishlord to my camp spot he was behind me and I couldn't VP him before he pasted me.<br />
<br />
So...I'm fully intending to come back and get this spot down, seems like a) dangerous and b) great xp.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
What is the aggro range of the Hraquis?  Large small tiny?  Not sure how close they can be to each other if I try to pull one.<br />
<br />
I was using Extended Range IV tribute, but I was having a problem targetting and seeing things down there...should I use Acumen to see farter? I'm an ogre so I already have infravision.<br />
<br />
Do you pull all the way back to the camp site every time, or is it safe to fight on the wall of the main chamber (going off zazrha's description)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah ... them buggers can swim fast.  Once more here's the play by play.  Another Map (http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ctoni/fishlord.jpg) <br />
<br />
Step 1.  Get to camp  :p <br />
Step 2.  Move to the Red Star pull spot.<br />
Step 3.  Cast Malicious Decay on the hraquis in the `lil hut<br />
Step 4.  Immediately use Virulent Paralysis 3 while facing the Yellow Star<br />
Step 5.  Root Rot right there.....<br />
<br />
--Or--<br />
<br />
Step 5.  Cast bane, epic, whatever .... then with about 30 secs left on VP move back to Black Star.<br />
Step 6.  Once VP refreshes and you get announcement &quot;Your VP has worn off&quot; start spamming VP again so you catch mob before it gets to you.<br />
Step 7.  Root Rot <br />
Step 8.  Profit.<br />
<br />
Be careful that you don't get smooshed up against a wall and start to duck ... cuz then you won't be able to cast and while you're wondering what's wrong the baddie will come and kill you.<br />
<br />
Now that the `lil hut is cleared it's a bit harder to target and have line of sight.  For the 2nd - 6th I usually move up to the Yellow Star pull spot and do the same steps as above -- except I then face the RED Star when I cast VP.  By the 5th - 6th the guy in the `lil hut has respawned and we just start anew.<br />
<br />
I just feel safer being over by the Fishlord guy, not that I've ever had adds at the Red or Yellow once I've successfully pulled 1 ... but better safe than sorry.  <br />
<br />
How close is too close for a single pull?  I don't really know, but if they're farther apart than the two in the RIGHT `lil hut, they're probably safe to single.  But look out for the Hraquis Chieftan he wanders and seems to have a much larger aggro range, can be rooted, but summons :(.  It's just safer for them to path close to you than pull from beyond this pretend &quot;No Pull Line&quot;  I WANT to pull them again from their `lil huts ... but they just get me dead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it's moderately safe to fight on the wall, but i usually stand right at the fishlord and try to pin the mobs down below in the tunnel, just outside the big room with the masses of hraquis.<br />
<br />
use acumen for sure if you don't have faerune.<br />
<br />
the agro range of the hraquis is a bit lower than average i guess, not as tiny as a doomfire's, but certainly not huge.<br />
<br />
only the &quot;ancient regrua guardian&quot; or &quot;regrua sentinel&quot; see invis, the lower level trash regruas actually don't... so just watch out for the big beastly regrua who roams into the mouth of the first tunnel on the left as you look down into the big room from the fishlord spot.<br />
<br />
yeah i guess pull with malicious decay, haul ass to somewhere near the fishlord, and sneeze 'em.  definitely be casting decay from max or near max cast range to give yourself the most possible time to get to camp... then mash the VP button until it casts.<br />
<br />
it's definitely dangerous rewarding and fun :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok tried it again last night, got another waterlogged corpse for my efforts. :)<br />
<br />
Pulled the first Hraqui with no problems (just like before).  With new info from Zazra I grabbed a second one, he manged to hit me once but I got him locked down no problems.  <br />
<br />
Then I got stupid.<br />
<br />
Root Rot was running fine, but when the mob was down to around 4% I decided to let BoU kill him off and I didn't want to use VP since he was almost dead.  BoU fades and so it's up to the Curse of the Spirits to kill the mob.  The mob is at *0%* percent health, I am clicking my ornate pants *every* tick to keep him rooted.  Somehow he breaks root, warps on top of me and beats me down in 2 seconds.  So I died because I was too cheap to cast another Bane. I was more upset about  losing the 4 blues of AAxp and the tradeskill drop than the reg exp loss from the death.<br />
<br />
A) last night the Gorlinin The Wise dude was up in the western side of the Reef.  Is it possible to squeeze past him?  I ended up going to the east (there was a group clearing out all the Trilouns) and weaving my way past the see invis Champion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do 1 AA every 30-35 mins at Tables..<br />
<br />
This is how I do it:<br />
<br />
If you dont have Dot focus items get a Ceramic Gavel of Justice (Will save mana when dotting).<br />
You will also need Affliction Haste IV and Burning Affliction 4. You can get this at your local tribute master.<br />
Easiest way to get trib points is by making Forged Picks. Material for combine costs 2pp, it's trivial smithing at 49 and will give you 320trib a piece.<br />
8 backpacks of Picks will yield about 38000trib points.<br />
<br />
Be sure you buy VP3. Do this as early as possible cause AA's at tables is easy to get. You will be able to buy all the other stuff you need pretty quick afterwards.<br />
<br />
I got 2 spellsets I use.<br />
1: Solo Debuff<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Malosinia<br />
-Malicious Decay<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
2: Solo Burn<br />
-Bane<br />
-Anathema<br />
-Odium<br />
-Breath of Ultor<br />
-Blood of Saryrn<br />
-Quiencense<br />
-Pox of Bertoxxulous (this breaks root.. I'll explain further down)<br />
-Canni IV<br />
<br />
Make 2 hotbuttons for them:<br />
/loadspellset solo debuff<br />
/loadspellset solo burn<br />
<br />
K, this is how you optimize the kill.<br />
<br />
Load &quot;Solo Debuff&quot; spellset.<br />
<br />
Keep max distance to target.<br />
Cast Malicious Decay (This will lower dis resists to be able to land VP3, and it will guarantee VP to hold its full duration. It will not get resisted)<br />
Cast Malosinia (This is rarely resisted. Max amount of times I've got resists is about 5 times in a row. There is no need to malos before, you will only waste mana that way, and precious dot time.)<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Press hotkey to load spellset &quot;Solo Burn&quot;<br />
Cast Breath of Ultor<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
At this stage Bane will run out.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Now press Canni V<br />
Target yourself and smack on a Quicense.<br />
Now be sure to click VP3 now and check how long time is left until it refresh. You got one tick to reapply it after it refreshes.<br />
At this stage Bane will run out again.<br />
Cast Bane<br />
Cast Blood of Saryrn<br />
Now reapply VP3.<br />
Cast Anathema<br />
Cast Odium<br />
Etc. etc..<br />
<br />
When you feel safe and got all this timed in you can add in the Epic from start of the dot chain. It will wear of just before you VP3 the mob the second time. So reapply it after that if you want added dps.<br />
Also if you feel like risking it some.. If you time it right and keep an eye out for how long VP3 got left before it breaks, you can add and extra dot. Pox of Bertoxxulous. This will break VP3, so be sure to cast it when VP3 only got 5 sec left before refreshing. And be sure to be at max distance before you do it. Pox will break VP3 but since VP3 refreshed during the time you cast it you will be able to reapply it directly after.<br />
With BA4 and Crit Aff 3 AA I usally dot the tables mobs down in 3min 30sec.<br />
Canni up as fast ass possible after kill and you should be able to DING an AA every 50 mins or so. (Or even faster if you got good manaregen and stuff.)<br />
<br />
/Cheers<br />

I assume that the fort you are talking about is the first castle that you crossed and were fighting by the bridge? If so, it's easy. Ignore the casters as they are a pain and single pull at your leisure. The two guards at the foot of the stairs  are easy to pull, once they are gone you should stand at the top of the stairs on the landing and pull the wanderers. From there it's easier than it appears. The agro range is smaller than a gnats testicles. Just stand at the top of the stairs that lead down to the courtyard at either the left or right side and target the nearest guard there. You can single pull those although it wouldn't seem possible. Pull them out of the castle to along side the wall. You shouldn't get any trains this way and you shouldn't run out of spawns.<br />
<br />
Best thing you can do is make the run to castle 2. If you are having no issues soloing at castle 1 you will be fine at castle 2. It's the same method. There are a few threads talking about castle 2 on this board.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, Karshak.  I'll probably mess around at the first castle for a while till I get used to soloing here.  I just got VP3 last night and I would definitely like to practice using it before I take on red mobs.  ;)<br />
<br />
Any idea if the named in the first castle are soloable?  I'm assuming not but just curious.<br />

<br />
If memory serves me correctly the names in field 1 aren't hard and don't summon, but i'm thinking they can't be rooted, so they would be a pain to solo.  But grab a druid (eeew) and snare kite them, just be warned said druid can also solo these, so you have to ask them for help, the reverse probably won't happen.</div></div><hr />
