<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just recently added finishing blow to my aa skills because i wanted to get it and haveing 4 points saved up was killing me not spending it :)  anyway reading here on the glade it says FB is restricted to lv 47 mobs and below. i haven't been able to find info on this level restrictment anywhere else.  if anyone could offer some info on that i'd be thankful.<br />
<br />
ok here's my question, i haven't seen a FB on any of the bodyguards in EW in more than 4 hours of killing them, so if the level restriction holds true these guys must be above lv 47, does anyone know what level they are?  or is it that my FB skill dosen't like me?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bodyguards are L50 every time. More hp than standard on a L50 mob but they make up for it by hitting like wimps. Cept Stoneberg of course. <br />
<br />
Side Note. Stoneberg is immune to the stun part of the Salindrite Dagger proc while the other three are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KujaHawkwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two questions, are these dorfs on Coldain faction, and if not, what level must you be to solo there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the dwarfs aren't on coldain... and don't give any hits...<br />
<br />
<br />
i could do them at 60... but i didn't find it all that great, but than again my DPS wasn't so hot solo w/o the swifty or eyepatch... but with the harmony nerf i havn't been there and pulling them might be a problem<br />
<br />
<br />
once they were slowed, sometimes it seemed like i was gaining more HPs that i was losing with Chloro + FoN... so with a fungi and or earthcaller the camp i assume would be completely trivial</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had FB kick in for the Captain only, but not the others.  My guess is that FB will only work for mobs below level 50 and that aren't snared -- and I'm pretty sure the other dorfs are 50+...<br />
<br />
With the harmony &quot;fix&quot;, forget about soloing this place efficiently anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dart, with Swiftwind and LSoEE, fully self buffed and using harmony to pull, I could solo the bodyguards (except stoneberg) at 54.  It took most of my mana in heals and wasn't an efficient means of soloing at all, but I could do it.<br />
<br />
However, with the Harmony nerf, I'm not gonna try again at all (unless the new harmony, when it comes in, gives no aggro on a resist); and then not until the upper 50's at a minimum).</div></div><hr />
