<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!<br />
<br />
Anyone have info on how to get to the new GoD zones, only been in three of them Neadria, Natimbi and one more I dont recall the name of. <br />
<br />
How do you get to ferubi and barindu? Would also be nice to get some advice on how hard these zones are in comparison to old pop zones/ hard ldons.<br />
<br />
And whcih zones requires &quot;flags&quot; e.g. completed expiditions?<br />
<br />
Thx!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">these are entered through the next zone past natimbi...from natimbi magus zone in you lev/invis and follow the right wall all the way up the hills to a castle looking thing. go up the steps and through.  you will zone.  the ferbi zone is straight and to the left of the big bubble. go through the doors and head in.  the hanging guardens zone is straight and to the right of the big bubble.  head through the doors and in.  eq toolbox has maps...<br />
<br />
I call the hidden temple and hanging guardens, zone of rape and zone of rape 2.  hidden temple is a summon CR half the time if you wipe there and hanging guarden trash flurries for over 1k...i highly doubt you will be doing any reliable soloing in either of these zones since the mobs summon and slow is midiagted.  these zones have some decent drops but if you are trying to run through and invis falls, 1 bash while you run to a zone means you die.  have fun =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From my own personal experience...<br />
Ferubi is just nasty wrong.  I went in buffed (had 4k self buffed then), saw a mob wander up and it decided to aggro me (was invis) and proceeded to thrash me and send me back to the soulbinder in about 2 seconds time.  Ran back got a rez and have yet to go back.  Mean stuff there..<br />
<br />
Barindu...if you are going to be travelling out and about int he zone...my suggestion is you had better pray to whatever god that your invis does not drop.  And if it does..may it be in a safe spot.  Only safe spot I know of in barindu, aside of the Qinimi zone, is right behind the pipe for the instanced zones.<br />
Yes, mobs mitigate slow.  Yes, they will thrash you if they touch you. Yes, the ones with pets suck.  Yes, gaters suck. Yes, the nocs are not snarable (or rootable afaik). No, they do not summon (from what I have seen).  Yes, we can solo there.<br />
<br />
Been soloing the Qinimi side of Barindu inhopes of getting the ring to drop..no luck thus far.  Yeah it takes awhile to kill a single mob, but the xp is average and you have the chance at a damn nice ft2 ring should it drop.  You'll need a ton of mana and/or fast regen to do it.  I go, and prefer to have Virtue, Focus, Boar, Wrulan, KEI and a PR buff up always, along with my furry speedbump.  Grab a mob via Malos (if you have it), sic the speedbump to absorb a couple hits, root, back dogdog off (if he's alive), slow, drop BoUltor in, then BoSaryrn, re-root (i use greater immo for fast cast), cani a few times til saryrn drops, reapply, reroot, cani again..and repeat as DoTs drop.<br />
I do everything I can to keep a mob from touching me and do a fine job of keeping things permarooted.  same as any other non-summoning mob.  Can also use Bane if you have the mana regen for it as well.<br />
I'm average geared imo...and handle it fairly easily.<br />

the ones with pets im still fiddling with..trying to get a set way to effectively kill them without doing both at once since they have that nasty proc and hit hard..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have to cross the zone, Qinimi to get to Ferubi, Barindu and some other zone that escapes me atm. Qinimi is at the northern end of Natimbi. Lev and invis up and head up the hill in a northerly direction. You will cross a ravine (actually to cliffs) and enter a ruined building. Follow the wall to your right (kind of a zigzag pattern) and you will zone into Qinimi. You can download maps of the GoD zones from eqtoolbox, which will probably be much better than my directions, also. I don't have much information on the mobs though as my machine was having issues there until recently so I haven't been there much yet. Good luck to you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
If you have graphics problems or trouble in forest zones, move your clipping way back (to 20-30%) before zoning in to Natimbi.  I kept crashing multiple times there, though I was fine in Qinimi, Ferubi, and Barindu.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend soloing in Ferubi.  Soloing in the zone NEXT to Natimbi would be doable, though not very practical in my opinion.  That darn chaos claws proc is a pain the bearbutt.<br />
<br />
Corpse Retrieval in many of these zones can be very difficult.  I'd recommend a group until you get used to things.  The graphics on the new monsters and NPCs are kind of neat, and the building architecture is also quite different than most of the rest of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Avoid Ferubi. Nuff said. For soloing that is, a group could probably do ok here, provided they didn't get into any of the raid encounters which exist in the southern half of the zone. Impossible to solo though. Everything sees invis and can tear through you in about 4 seconds..<br />
<br />
And the 3 zones that sprout off of Qinimi are Ferubi, Barindu, and Riwwi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tardis420</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been playing around in Barindu, the entrance mobs are doable, but take a little time to kill.Still havent found a good way to kill the ones with pets.Any of the others so far are root rottable.Gotten a few diamonds and saphires so far as loot goes.Anyone have any ideas on how to take out the ones with pets.<br />

nm on the ones with pets, figured this out myself.<br />
Easiest way I have found is to start off with malos, sick dog and then root mob, root its pet and slow both.After that dot pet to death doesnt have may hitpoints, throw spirit call in for good measure. When pet dead just deal with main mob as ussual and root rot.Be carefull the warmedic gates so fight em as close to spawn point as possible</div></div><hr />
