<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone duo in pop , have acces to 65 shaman/cleric<br />
i can 3 box but i personally hate it so would rather not.<br />
Anywhere i can safely duo,  HoH Bot is preferable due to less chance of train ?<br />
Just wonderd IF i went defense root could i reasonabley duo anywhere, Equipment is reasonable for weapons use Ahbs/Vrs combo, just finishing VT keys as a guild so hopefully a few more upgrades onthe way in next couple of weeks.<br />
Kinda sick of soloing frogs in pos for AA's while i need solo time :0<br />
Any suggestions i see celt says he duo's with his cleric in HoH ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SolidHead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing beats out HoH for duoing possibilities. Static mobs, stable pull rate and change (very rare) of spectal droping.Tactics is even better but a strech with 2 characters ( I died way to many times while trying to pull that off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A guy in my guild duos in various new planes with a cleric and druid... both are now 63 or 64, but he was doing this at 60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I duo in Valor with my 63 chanter. I tried in Storms, but I don't have CoD yet, so I couldn't charm anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive found that if, in the event that Im in the mood to duo, duoing with a druid, mage or monk tends to suffice...  I usually get better XP solo however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Solo or duo in the basements.<br />
<br />
Harmony split the guards, snare, and either root 'n' shoot, or just kite him down the long ends of the room.<br />
<br />
Duoing is possible with almost any other class easily and with any class with a bit more effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd really suggest the zonein to CoD as a duo spot with a shaman.  Stuff in CoD hits pretty soft, comparitively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kinda bored of root and shoot, yeh is good xp but uber frogs are perm camped now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I duo with a cleric friend quite a bit.  Melee is fine but I hate switching in EC for slows and not having haste.  <br />
<br />
So, usually I 2 box an enc for slows and buffs.  And well, since they are there and have CoD I might as well use it right?<br />
<br />
So pet tanks and I stand back and bow.  <br />
<br />
Cleric is still helpful since I am not as quick to debuff and recharm when 2boxing, and I like not having to keep switching pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Storm and Valor are both viable duoing options.  I duo with my shammy in PoV on frogs all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Feregal Foreverlost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">while i'm not in the tier 2 and above planes yet, i have found that the best XP around duo'ed is playing root/dot with my bard guildie.  kinda dull, but as long as you snare/root the mob, and keep it fairly still, yer friendly neighborhood bard can dot it while you plink it as well...easy, EASY xp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On my first day back in eq (after getting pov tagged) I went and duoed with a 65 chanter friend of mine and got nearly 3 full alt points in about 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I didn't exp much in pop before I took my last break, so I was like !!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I duo every night with my shaman brother lvl 65 270ish AA's VT/seru Gear. He tanks while I blast with bow, course he has all his defensive skills maxed, but thats the way we been exping since I got AM3/EQ about 7 months ago. We also did it at the beginning of PoP when he only had 180 ish AA, HoH guards slowed =orc pawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>daadwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have duo'd in PoD many times...with sham and cleric not very quick or rewarding.<br />
<br />
Now with my druid friend...xp rolls in easy.<br />
<br />
He charms a Rat and we go to town...I nuke and shoot...rat keeps aggro...I have yet to take more than one yellow health drop...every once in a while i need to spot heal the druid while hes recharming...but damn this is such an easy duo there its unbelievable...try it.<br />
<br />
Hes 61 not sure what level druid spell hes using to charm, never played one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xeratul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if it wasn't for the effin' invisible from far-away spiders in valor, it'd be a cinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm... ranger/enchanter duo in PoP at level 65...  details? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">once enchanter gets command of druzzil its pretty easy for an enchanter to solo by themselfs, but with a ranger/druid they can snare the so it doesnt eat the enchanter as quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As stated above, Crypt of Decay duoing with a Shaman is an excellent option and quite effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bleh... anything that's in my ability? O.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">something I figured out bored one day in Valor(also works in storms) this might of changed as I havent done it about 2 months, the moat around Valor between grass/wasteland. Make sure you have lev up snare the mob while it still on land, pull it into the moat. Your arrows will still hit it, but you can kite it over the water  with no fear of getting adds.  I one thing I did notice was dont get to far away or the mobs will start to regen as if they were standing still, but thats been the case since about the beginning of Luclin, but this is crap exp compared to any decent group in valor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. didnt really feel like posting this b/c im sure once soe gets wind of this, it will be nerfed rather quickly, but since they have 2 all water zones ingame im not sure how they could nerf it, suppose they would call it an exploit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tried HoH in hero shrines, easy to pull with harmony<br />
i snare on inc root to let shaman debuff/slow<br />
then goto town, with 6.5K buffed hp's forgot AC<br />
and PE perm on me im fine, cane be erractice damage due to mitgation sucking but avoidance ok + taps procs from ahb/vrs combo. Shaman with 2K ch pretyt much chains it though pet helps as well for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Killanyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I duo with a chanter regularly in valor and tactics, pull with snare, have chanter charm and then just watch your exp bar fill up. Rangers role is pretty much  crowd control (root) and support for the enchanter (heals, SoE) and shooting it of course. Make sure everything is snared and you can duo with any enchanter with half a brain (and Command of Druzzil).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ashenshugar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I usually either bow kite solo frogs in pos or dragon trial or pantheon one in hoh. I sometimes 2-box my buddies 65 shaman when he's not on in hoh, slowed they are easy to tank. Just harmo, snare pull, root, switch windows, malo/slow/cripple, and go to town. Takes 3 or 4 Kraggs Mending cast, but then again I only have ntov/ssra level gear<br />
<br />
Duoing with a Druzzil chanter is the absolute sickiest xp in cod (or even bot) imo. Ranger + CoD Chanter is probably one of the best duo's around imo. Pull and do pet control and just bow the mobs while the unwilling victim tanks for you 8). Even more fun to get 2 Druzzil chanters and a cleric to cheal them hehe. I feel like I'm feeding a meat grinder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fiercce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Went form LVL55 to LVL60 in a week duo'ing Yard trash with an Enchanter in PoN. Basically we both stayed up until we got a lvl per night. Currently at 60 I'm duo'ing with my RL chanter friend doing AA. I brought him to PoN when he ding'd 53 and got Boltrans. He got 54 and 1/2 way to 55 in 1 night. I got 2 AA's during that time. Great exp duo'ing. 3 blue AA ticks per yard trash mob in PoN. yard trash being Treants, Birds and Spiders.</div></div><hr />
