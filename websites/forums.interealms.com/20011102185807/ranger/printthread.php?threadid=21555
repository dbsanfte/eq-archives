<p><b>ATTENTION: This is a work in progress :-P  Bear with me until I can get all the logs and pics and stuff.</b><br />
<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step One of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Garadain Glacierbane'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hrmff, what's this? A spy sent from the giant heathens, or the selfrighteous wurms perhaps? Either way, you'd be no [friend] of the great Coldain. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a friend of the great coldain'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A friend, you say? That remains to be seen. Much more to being a friend of the Coldain than just sayin' so. Anyway, I'm too [tired] to argue about it. I haven't slept in days. <br />
<br />
You say, 'why are you tired'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Did I say tired? Exhausted is more like it. Ever since that blizzard last week I haven't slept a wink. I came back from huntin' snow orcs to find that my [blanket] had blown away and now I'm just too tired to rustle up a new one. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what blanket'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Not just any old blanket, mind ye, mine was made of the finest tundra kodiak hides and snow panther skins, two of each. When I was wrapped up in it ya couldn't see me a bit, no, I blended right into the snow, I did. Say, if you be a friend, here's yer chance to prove it. Sew me up a new blanket so I can get some rest. <br />
<br />
<b>Now you need to collect the pelts to make the blanket.  You kill Tundra Kodiaks in Eastern Wastes and get two High Quality Tundra Kodiak Pelts.  Then you can kill snow cougars in Eastern Wastes OR Iceclad Ocean.  The cougars in Iceclad are a lot easier to kill and seem to be much more plentiful.  Kill them til you have two High Quality Cougar Skins.  Once you have all four skins, combine them in a sewing kit.  My tailoring skill was 28 and I did not fail on this step the first time.  The second time I attempted it I failed.  It probably would be best to raise your tailoring skill to around 50 or 60 before attempting the blanket since the tundra kodiak pelts are so uncommon.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-ColdainHuntingBlanket.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Hand in Blanket to Garadain</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Ahh, that'll do fine. Take this, it is but a trinket for now, but continue to serve the Coldain and it will grow in power. I must get some rest now, for I have been told my [nephew] has disappeared again and I will need to track him down tomorrow. <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Two of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'Who is your nephew'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'My nephew, Boridain, keeps running away from home to kill a bothersome [beast], thinking this will prove to all of Thurgadin that he is a great hunter. Every time he does this my sister gets hysterical and I am sent out to find him. <br />
<br />
You say, 'What beast'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A rabid tundra kodiak has been feeding on our people for weeks now. If Boridain ever stumbled across the critter I doubt he'd stand a chance. I have a solution, but it would require the [assistance] of an outsider. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will provide assistance'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'I'm taking a liking to you stranger. Your eagerness to help us will not go unnoticed. Find my nephew and give him this axe. It should keep him from hurting himself. Return to me with the ring and proof that he is safe. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-DullBladedAxe.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Go to -2500, 1500.  Boridain is on a flat spot of a mountain and several giants, wolves and orcs path through this area.  Boridain is on Beta-Neutral faction at this point so he is not KoS to anything.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Boridain Glacierbane'<br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hello stranger, I am Boridain, master hunter of the Coldain. Glad to meet you. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand in the Dull Bladed Axe to Boridain.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Say! This looks just like the axe my uncle uses. With this I can kill the beast for sure! Now please, be very quiet, I must track my prey. I won't return to Thurgadin without the hide of the rabid tundra kodiak! <br />
<br />
<b>At this point Boridain despawns and then respawns with an axe in his hand and is now aligned with the Coldain faction.  People have charmed Boridain and buffed him up to give him more HPs to keep him alive.  I attempted to do this with an enchanter friend but we buffed the wrong one (the one we buffed despawned <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  After running through this step I found the best method was to use harmony on both Boridain AND anything in his path.  He is a madman - he'll attack anything and everything.  Just keep him harmonied and he'll be a bit more calm.</b><br />
<br />
<b>He walks from his plateau for a bit then emotes this:</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hmmm, fresh prints. They're HUGE! This must be it! This hunting stuff is easier than I thought. <br />
<br />
<b>Now he heads to the Frost Giant fort entrance.  Be sure to harmony the giants at the entrance before he gets there!</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Hmm, that wasn't him.Let see now, if I were a rabid tundra beast where would I go? This way! <br />
<br />
<b>Now he walks towards the prison camp area and stops to get a bite to eat.  His stopping point is -1150, 1000 and stays there for 2 minutes.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Boy, all this hunting sure does make ya hungry! Time for a snack. <br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Ahh, that's better. Back to the hunt... I think I hear something over yonder. Stay low. <br />
<br />
<b>Now he goes to a corral thingy in the Prison Camp area.  Sometimes there is a giant and an orc here.  I just harmonied them and kept harmony on Boridain and they all ignored each other.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Where did that vile beast go now? Wait, what's that over there? Could it be? Only one way to find out! <br />
<br />
<b>He starts off towards the Orc Fort and stops midway to take a little rest <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  His stopping point is -2000, 1400.  He stays here for two minutes.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane yawns, 'All this tracking is makin me mighty sleepy. Time for a little nap. You keep a lookout. <br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane stretches, 'Ahh, refreshing! Back to work... I think I smell the beast! This way. <br />
<br />
<b>Now Boridain goes to the Orc Fort entrance.  Make sure you keep him harmonied as well as any orcs at the gate.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'I just don't get it. I thought that was him for sure. I don't see any sign of him now. <br />
<br />
<b>Now Boridain goes back to the spot you originally found him and sits down at the corner.  (-2300, 1600)</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Who am I kidding, I'm no hunter. I'll never be a hunter. I may as well give up and become a miner like dad. <br />
<br />
<b>A Rabid Tundra Kodiak spawns and starts to creep up to him from behind.  Kill it before it gets to him and have someone guard the dorf so he doesn't get killed by passing baddies.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-RabidTundraKodiakSkin.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now you hand in the skin to Baradain and he gives you his axe to give back to Garadain.</b><br />
<br />
Boridain Glacierbane says 'Yes! I've done it! The vile beast is finally dead. I will at last be revered as the mighty hunter I am. Here is your axe back, I broke it on the killing blow. Take it as proof that you are a friend of the greatest hunter in the history of the Coldain! <br />
You gain party experience!!<br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-BrokenAxe.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now go back to Garadain and hand him the Broken Axe and the Copper Coldain Insignia Ring.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Excuse me, Chromite , aren't you forgetting something? <br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Well done friend! My nephew is safe at home and his thirst for adventure is quenched for now. The beast will claim no more of our people. I couldn't have handled it better myself. Now I can get back to the business of [hunting]. <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Three of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'What are you hunting'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'My camp here boasts the most proficient hunters in the recorded history of the mighty Coldain empire. We alone could feed an entire clan. Things have been frustratingly [slow] lately, though. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Why have they been slow'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'After years of skinning the hides of the giantmen, my hunting knife has lost its edge. The dull blade has slowed me down considerably. It has served me well, but a new [knife] would make me a much more proficient hunter. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I can help get you a new knife'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hunt a wooly rhino and take his tusk, then take a flawless hide from a walrus. Combine them in a forge with a skinning rock and bring me the new knife and the silver insignia ring. <br />
<br />
<b>Now you go and hunt wooly rhinos until you get a horn (it's not a tusk).  The horn is not too uncommon.  Then hunt walruses until you get a High Quality Walrus Skin.  After getting those items you need to search around the Sleeper's Tomb entrance (the sleeping dragon statue) and look for red dots on the ground.  Those red dots signify a skinning rock.  Pick one up and then you have all the ingredients to make the knife in a forge.  My smithing skill was 33 when I made my knife.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-ColdainHuntingKnife.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Now you hand in the Coldain Hunting Knife and the Silver Coldain Insignia Ring to Garadain.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Excuse me, Chromite , aren't you forgetting something? <br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Hrmm, not quite the work of a Coldain.  Barely functional, in fact. I'll be needing to touch this up a bit. Fetch me a Coldain [smithing hammer] and I'll be sure to tell my associates in Thurgadin of your deeds. <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Four of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'Where do I find a coldain smithing hammer?'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says '[Tain] Hammerfrost can get you one. Find him and give him this.<br />
<br />
<b>Garadain hands you a Note to Tain.  This note is useless, Tain just takes it and does nothing for it.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-NoteToTain.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Tain Hammerfrost'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Tain left a short time ago, he said he had a score to settle with a particular Kromriff. <br />
<br />
<b>Tain Hammerfrost spawns over the hill in front of the giant ice bridge.</b><br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost lies bleeding on the ground moaning, 'Ohhhh, someone...help, please...' <br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Tain Hammerfrost'<br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'The bloody Kromrif ambushed me! I escaped, but I am near death. They'll be tracking me down to finish me off at any moment. Without [help], I'm as good as dead. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help you'<br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'Thank Brell! I hear them approaching from just over that hill! Slay the leader, Ghrek, and give me his elixir. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point Tain Hammerfrost falls to the ground and 4 giants spawn.  One is Ghrek Squatnot and the rest are 'a frost giant'.  These range from like level 43-level 45.  Aggro all 4 of them and pull them away from Tain.  Kill Ghrek and loot the Frozen Elixir from his corpse.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-FrozenElixir.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Hand the Frozen Elixir to Tain Hammerfrost and he will give you a Coldain Smithing Hammer.</b><br />
<br />
Tain Hammerfrost says 'I will report your selfless actions when I return to Thurgadin. Take this for your troubles, friend. I hope you find it useful. Fare thee well. <br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'Excuse me, Chromite , aren't you forgetting something? <br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Five of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'What plans'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'The bloody Ry'Gorr, friends of  the frost giants, plan to raid our encampment. Their captain, Scarbrow Ga'hruk is leading the raid. I need someone to intercept his [orders] so we may prepare for the attack. Without them we could be in serious trouble. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will intercept his orders'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Find the Ry'Gorr messenger and cut him down. Bring the message he carries to my lookout. When the attack is thwarted, return to me with the head of Scarbrow and the platinum insignia ring. <br />
<br />
<b>The messenger spawns at the prison camp and then runs straight to the Ry`Gorr fort.  He is a random spawn and sometimes can spawn within 10 minutes or less of his last death.  Kill him and you get the plans.</b><br />
<br />
<img src="http://tfo.sok.org/zones/eastwastes/ColdainInsigniaRing-Quest/ID-RygorrInvasionPlans.jpg" width="320" height="130"><br />
<br />
<b>Take the plans to the camp with Garadain Glacierbane and hand them to the coldain lookout.  As soon as you hand them in 5 orcs spawn.  2 are oracles and 2 are centurions I believe.  The fifth orc is Scarbrow Ga`Hruk himself.  He is a 45+ Shadow Knight and can be solo'd by a level 60 ranger.  Scarbrow often has a nice caster/priest item on his corpse.  It is called a Frozen Orb and fits in the range slot. </b><br />

<br />
<hr><br />
<b>This is Step Six of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'What favor'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force. Bring me proof of their fate and proof that whoever was responsible for their loss is no more. <br />
<br />
<b>Find Korrigain the ghost.  He spawns at 10pm game time.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Korrigain'<br />
<br />
Korrigain says 'Who dares disturb my rest? If ye be a friend of the mighty Coldain, then show me proof and I shall tell you of my plight.  If not, then be on your way. <br />
<br />
<b>Hand him your Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring and he hands it back to you unchanged.  Icefang in the hut nearby will respawn and come out to be buffed by Korrigain.  Icefang takes off running around and eventually leads  you to the orc camp by the big Ice Bridge.</b><br />
<br />
Korrigain says 'Many seasons ago I stood here in life with my comrades, the best warriors Thurgadin had to offer. Along with our faithful wolven army we were poised to eliminate the Kromrif presence in the region. Somehow, the enemy was made aware of our plans and just before our attack, a group of Ry'Gorr oracles charmed our wolves, forcing them to tear down their own masters. We were caught by surprise and died a savage death. <br />
<br />
Icefang whimpers as he approaches. <br />
<br />
Korrigain says 'All that remains from that battle is my loyal Icefang. He will not rest until I am avenged. Follow and watch after him. He alone knows where our attackers lie and he cannot overcome them by himself. May Brell bless you with success, farewell. <br />
<br />
<b>Just before you get to the camp Icefang stops and sniffs at the ground and growls.  At this time Poxbreath Yellowfang spawns beside the campfire at the orc camp.  You don't need to wait for Icefang to get there to engage him.  I recommend that you clear the orc camp before handing in your ring to Korrigain so the camp is clear and Icefang doesn't get killed.</b><br />
<br />
<b>*** NOTE *** The above has changed slightly.  Now 3 oracles of Ry`Gorr spawn along with Poxbreath.  A level 55 monk and level 60 ranger were able to take them out with no problem.  Poxbreath and the oracles all conned blue to a level 60.</b><br />
<br />
Icefang sniffs at the ground and growls, baring his teeth. <br />
Icefang  wags his tail and howls in victory. <br />
<br />
<b>Poxbreath Yellowfang is a level 45+ shaman and was easy to kill for a level 60 ranger.  When he died he had 4 items on his corpse.  I am not sure if it's random as to the number of loot but he had 3 pieces of normal orc loot (Orc Fang Earring, Orc Fang Necklace, Ry`Gorr chain armor) and the Note from Kromrif.</b><br />

<br />
<b>Now you need to find Rodrick.  In the note it identifies him as Rodrick Kotrad, but that might just be to try and conceal his true identity <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  Anyhow, Rodrick spawns after a scripted sequence that happens near the orc fort.  His spawnplace is the zoneout from Crystal Caverns that is outside the Orc Fort.</b><br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Where is that sniveling little worm? <br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'He was supposed to be here hours ago! <br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'I don't know why the chief tolerates this insolent fool. If he is discovered he'll betray us for sure. <br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'If he makes me wait another minute I'll gut him myself... <br />
<br />
<b>After a bit of pacing back and forth for the Emissary, Rodrick finally spawns.</b><br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Ahh, good to see you my little friend, I was beginning to think something had happened to you. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'I had to take extra measures to be sure I wasn't followed. I sense that someone is on to me. You know I am risking my life for this. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'You are just a paranoid little man, Rodrick. That's not your fault, it's in your blood. It's what makes your kind weak and unworthy. As for the risk, that's what you're paid so well for. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'Yes, the rewards have been most generous... But what good is money if I am discovered by the Dain? After the massacre he is already suspicious and... <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary interrupts Rodrick, 'Chief Ry`gorr himself told me to assure you that the time draws near. When the Kromrif invade Thurgadin there will be no more Dain. The citizens will be enslaved and you will be placed upon the throne to govern over them. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'Okay, okay, please do not tell the chief of my anxiety <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'You have my word, now what news do you bring? <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'You have taken a prisoner, one that is very dear to the Dain. His name is Corbin Blackwell. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Yes, our interrogators are working with him now. He is sure to have some valuable information forthcoming any time now. <br />
<br />
Rodrick Tardok says 'You had better hurry with him, the Dain has made his recovery a top priority. A team of elite Coldain will be attempting to rescue him in a matter of hours. <br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'Very well, we will be prepared. Again you have come through for the chief. This will not be forgotten. We will contact you again soon. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point the Emissary walks away from Rodrick and then into the orc fort.  He stands in front of the Oracle of Ry`Gorr and the following is said:</b><br />
<br />
Ry`Gorr Emissary says 'My liege, I have spoken with the Coldain informant. I have some urgent news for the chief. It seems the Dain takes a special interest in our new prisoner. He has dispatched special forces to rescue this Corbin Blackwell from our interrogators. <br />
<br />
Oracle of Ry`Gorr laughs, 'We will prepare for this rescue party. They will not be heard from again. I will inform the Chief, dismissed. <br />

Garadain Glacierbane lowers his head and mutters, 'At least there will be some closure for their families, thanks to you. The Ry`gorr will pay for this with their lives!

<b>This is Step Seven of the quest.</b><br />
<br />
You say, 'What mission'<br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A Coldain... A very important Coldain, has been abducted by the Rygorr. He was gathering information that is imperative to our victory over the brainless heathens. You must find him before he is killed and escort him to safety. Return to me with proof that Corbin Blackwell is safe. <br />
<br />
<b>Go to the prison camp and you will find a dwarf being held captive.</b><br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Today you will  die stumpy one. It is simply a question of how much pain you will endure first. Tell me when the attack on Ry`gorr Keep is planned and I promise I will make your passing swift and painless. <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell glares at the orc,'I know not what you speak of, vermin. Your kind isn't worthy of our attention. Kill me now and reunite me with the heroes who have gone before me. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Guard! Get me my tools. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'This is your last chance pitiful scum, when is the attack on Ry`gorr Keep planned? <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'Listen carefully vile beast, if there were an attack planned there would be nothing you and your pitiful clan of inbred halfwits could do about it. If and when the Dain attacks, you and your kind will be no more. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Well see about that, the Dain will have a little surprise should he decide to invade our lands. <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Your stubbornness is only going to make things worse for you. Now, we know the Dain is planning an attack on Ry`gorr Keep. When is this to be? <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell spits in the face of his captor and says, 'Kill me now and get it over with, stupid beast! I'll tell you nothing! <br />
<br />
Interrogator of Ry`Gorr says 'Suit yourself tinyman, we can do this the hard way if you insist. <br />
<br />
You say, 'hail Corbin Blackwell'<br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'Hurry! Theres not much time, give me the key and show me proof that you are a friend sent to rescue me... <br />
<br />
You say, 'what key'<br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'You mean to tell me you don't have the key to unshackle me? Wonderful... I'm being rescued by a half-wit! I am stuck here until you find a way to unlock my restraints. <br />
<br />
<b>The key is carried by a named frost giant named Warden Bruke.  He spawns in one of the stone structures in the prison camp.  His placeholder is 'Kromrif Prison Guard'.  The spawntime on this placeholder is 6 minutes.  Just keep killing the PH til Warden Bruke spawns.  He is 100% immune to magic so snare/root/slow won't stick on him.  He is able to be hit with fire based spells.  When he is aggro'd anywhere from 2 to 13 'Kromrif Guard' mobs will spawn and run into the stone structure.  He has a lot of HPs and hits for 130 max.  When he dies there will be a key and a Frost Giant Femur on the corpse.</b><br />

<br />
<b>Now you walk over to the area where Corbin Blackwell is being held captive.  Kill the 2 giant guards out front and the 3 orcs inside.  Pre-buff and sow everyone in your group at this point.  When your healers are full mana hand in the key and your ring and Corbin will start his walk to Dobbin Crossaxe.  Your ring is returned by Corbin when you hand it in.</b><br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'I thought I was a dwarfskin rug there for a minute! Thank Brell for your help stranger! Now cover me while I make good my escape. I am weakened and cannot endure much more. <br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'Almost there now, just a bit further... <br />
Your Location is -547.24, -1354.12, 221.15<br />
<br />
Corbin Blackwell says 'Uh oh, looks like they were tipped off somehow... I hope you can handle them. <br />
<br />
<b>At this point Commander Bahreck, 2 Kromriff Soldiers and 5 Ry`Gorr Bashers spawn.  The bashers come in from all 4 sides and 2 soldiers come from one side and the Commander from another.  You need to aggro them all and get them away from Corbin.  Having a snarer for this stage is pretty handy.  At level 60 trying to get these mobs aggro'd on you is pretty tough.  It's probably a good idea to have a level 55 or so warrior to aggro all the mobs then have someone pick them off him with snare.</b><br />
<br />
Commander Bahreck shouts 'For the honor of Rallos Zek! Attack! <br />
<br />
<b>When slain, the Bashers can have regular Ry`Gorr Elite loot.  The Commander always has a Giant Woven Vest.</b><br />

Corbin Blackwell says 'I have escaped! With the help of our friends here I was saved from certain death. We are in their debt. <br />
<br />
Dobbin Crossaxe says 'We thought it was too late, the Dain will be very pleased! <br />
<br />
<b>After about 15 seconds Dobbin Crossaxe will respawn and tell you to hand in your Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring.  Do NOT hand it in until he says this!  And don't waste time handing it in after he says it, either <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></b><br />

Dobbin Crossaxe says 'Please friend, show me your Mithril ring and I will show you our gratitude. <br />

<b>You hand in your Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring and in return you get a Note From Corbin.  Dobbin does not return your Mithril Ring.</b><br />

You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry`gorr is given to me.

<br />
Chief Ry`Gorr, Oracle of Ry`Gorr and Firbrand the Black spawn in the courtyard along with 2 Kromrif Commanders.  Kill the chief first (a high level puller is needed for single pulls.. or harmony) and then kill the rest before Garadain arrives.  Firbrand the Black seems to always have a Dark Ember and Gauntlets of the Black when killed.  The Oracle of Ry`Gorr always has a Ry`Gorr Oracle Shield and the Chief always has the Spine Chill Spear.<br />
<br />
By the time you are done Garadain should walk through the gate and you can hand in the head of the Chief.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Follow me closely, friend, time is of the essence. I will describe our situation as we walk. <br />
<br />
Your pulse quickens in anticipation of battle! <br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'The Dain's own royal troops will be at our disposal for the battle. This is good news, they are hardened, experienced soldiers. The bad news is that our sources indicate that the Ry`gorr have been alerted to our presence and will be ready for an attack. This is most unfortunate... They will not go down without a fierce fight. <br />
<br />
You hear the pounding of Ry`gorr war drums. <br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'It is of utmost importance that you stay with me throughout the fight. Your focus must be on killing Chief Rygorr and keeping me alive, mind that you do not become distracted. If I fall the Dain's men will retreat and you'll definitely be cut down. <br />
<br />
<b>Garadain walks to the ridge overlooking the orc fort and sees the orcs and giants that are guarding the fort.</b><br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane groans, 'It is worse than I thought. Not only are they prepared for an attack, but they have the Kromrif here to help them. Our steel will be tested today. Be sure not to show the troops any fear. <br />
<br />
<b>Garadain walks to -2480, 670 and starts to give his troops a pep talk.</b><br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'TROOPS! FALL IN!! <br />
<br />
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Listen up men! <br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'You all know why were here. For decades these savages have menaced our people. Recent events have been too much to bear and the Dain has declared war! We will stop at nothing short of the Ry`gorr's annihilation! <br />

Garadain Glacierbane says 'No longer will we tolerate their heathen presence in our lands! Never again will we mourn the loss of a Coldain to these pawns of the Kromrif! Our deeds here today shall make this land safe for Coldain for all time! <br />

<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'My army stands prepared to launch an assault on Kael itself, but one task must be completed before this can happen. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'It seems Rodrick was not alone in his treachery. There is a faction of Coldain who believe that a treaty should be signed with the Kromrif, ending our hostilities with them. This, of course, is impossible. If there is one thing our history here has taught us it is that the Kromrif simply cannot be trusted. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'These traitors are poisoning the minds of our citizens, promising great rewards to those who will betray the Dain. It will take the unbiased eye of an outlander to flush out the masterminds behind this plan. Once again we turn to you. <br />
<br />
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Will you accept this task outlander? <br />

You say, 'I will accept this task'<br />

<b>Now you head to the Great Divide.  There is a tunnel at -5500, 3500.  Inside that tunnel are several dwarves that con dubiously to me.  When killed they give no faction hits at all.  Wait around for a while and Murdrick Tardok will spawn.  Alternately, you can just kill Davin Fatfist and Murdrick will spawn soon after Davin respawns.  You'll need to kill Murdrick to get his plan and his head so as soon as he spawns you need to pull him out and do damage to him.  I've found that harmony doesn't really work too well in this encounter but if you can manage to pull Murdrick out with none of the female dwarves aggroing, you can snare all the other dwarves and just kite Murdrick away to be killed by your group.  You must kill Murdrick fast otherwise he will despawn.</b><br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'Good day my friends, it is good to see you all are alive and well. <br />
<br />
Davin Fatfist says 'Well, we are alive, but I'd hardly say we're well... We have heard of the death of Rodrick, and the Dain is calling on all citizens of Thurgadin to flush out any opposition to the throne. If we're tied to your dealings with the Kromrif we'll be sent to the bottom of the well for sure. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'The Dain knows nothing, and I have a plan to keep it that way. I have given the matter much thought, and I have gathered you all here to ask for your help. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin says 'We all saw what happened when Rodrick agreed to help you. I, for one, am none too eager to take on these new friends of the Dain. <br />

Murdrick Tardok says 'Rodrick knew what he was getting into, and so did you. It's a bit too late for second thoughts. I don't recall seeing any hesitation when the loot was being passed around. <br />
<br />
Lapker Geynion says 'Go ahead Murdrick, what's this plan of yours? <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'As I said I've thought long and hard of our situation and I feel  we are indeed in danger. My cousin Berradin is a captain in the Dain's army. I've always been uneasy about him, but now more than ever. He could easily betray many of us and take credit for destroying the rebellion. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'My plan is to poison him and plant a suicide note on the body, a note in which he would take full responsibility for the actions of the rebels. This would both ensure that he could never betray us and would give the Dain closure. We will be free to continue working with our Kromrif friends without fear of discovery. <br />
<br />
Davin Fatfist says 'Sounds good boss, but how do you plan on poisoning him? <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'Berradin has a weakness for drink, one drink in particular... Avalanche Ale. I have had the recipe altered slightly to include a deadly poison. I have much to do, I need one of you to brew the drink and bring it to me. I'll handle the rest. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin  chuckles, 'Once again, Murdrick, you've put us at ease in the middle of a treacherous predicament. I will volunteer to brew the drink. <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok smiles, 'Very well, take this recipe and follow it exactly. It won't be easy, but you'll be richly rewarded for your efforts I assure you. Send word to meet me back here when you are finished. <br />
<br />
Gerton Dumkin says 'Consider it done. Be sure to watch yourself Murd, the Dain's gotta be suspicious of ya, being Rodrick's brother and all. And those outlander friends of his are dangerous, chopped down the Ry`Gorr chief like he was nothin! <br />
<br />
Murdrick Tardok says 'I must be off, be well friends. I will send word when we are to meet again. Until that day, be strong! Together we will overcome any obstacles! <br />

<p>Wow, an amazing walkthrough, Chromite!<br />
<br />
I have been following this over on the Safehouse as well, this is as up-to-date as the thread there was when last I read it. They were still working out the ingrediants for the tainted ale as there seemed to be some contention as to the seashell component.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there is some question as to who gets the brew once it's made. As well as the seemingly HIGH levels of skill needed to make the components, Mind Melt particularly.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Definately an awesome walkthrough.  I finished my 8th ring last night and one of my guildmates should get his in a few hours.  This is definately more detailed than what we had to go on and in several cases would have made some of the surprises we encountered a little easier to handle...  <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>i kinda have a question to chromite:<br />
<br />
you say:<br />
<br />
After about 15 seconds Dobbin Crossaxe will respawn and tell you to hand in your Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring. Do NOT hand it in until he says this! And don't waste time handing it in after he says it, either  <br />
<br />
.........<br />
<br />
do you get the note for the 7th ring still? so that would mean you have ring 6 and then get note for ring 7?<br />
<br />
<br />
so when you hand in note and get ring 7, you will also have ring 6?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
When you hand in your ring to Dobbin he does NOT give the ring back.  Instead he gives you the note.  Then you take the note to Garadain and he gives you the 7th ring.<br />
<br />
I'll see about updating that portion of the quest to be more clear.  Thanks for pointing it out.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
Note that someone with 195 brewing failed on the combine of the tainted ale.  He might have been unlucky, or this might indicate that the ale is extremely difficult to make.  Since nobody has come forward with a successful combine, the trivial level of the ale is unknown.<br />
<br />
Also, in one of the final fights for ring 8, Firbrand spawned with 2 Dark Embers, which he dual-wielded.  Made him a bit tougher than usual.  Also, I've seen Rodrick dual wielding as well, exercise caution.<br />

Just a note on Peffin Ambersnow.<br />
<br />
I saw her, and thinking she was one of the traitors, pulled her out of the giant camp to try and solo her.<br />
<br />
She hits for 137 max, has a ton of hps (parsed 8k melee damage, none of the non-melee from thorns or spells showed up), did around 5.5k damage to me, even with her being slowed most of the fight from the Earthcaller, and dropped nothing -- just a few plat.  I was hoping for a No Drop head...<br />
<br />
No faction hit either.<br />
<br />
Either her head is a random drop, or there's some actual conversation/questing that goes along with her.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just something I did today, and I remembered you mentioned her in your write-up.  Heck, gotta try to solo these Velious blues every now and then. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Did the 8th quest tonight, Firbrand also had 2 Dark Embers and no gauntlets this time :P<br />
<br />
One question, has anyone tried giving Murdrick's plan to Berradin? It doesn't make sense for us to be poisoning him; perhaps giving him the plan would make him rat out his buddies and give clues to obtaining more heads? (Can't try it myself; was a hair too late pulling the last giant; damn dorf got himself killed.  Now I have to wait for another person to do the war so I can turn in Rygorr's head...)</p>

<p><b> 9th step and such</b></p>

<p>Excellent walkthrough, Chromite - probably the best I've seen. Well done <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />
<br />
As for step 9: The note (Murdrick's Plan) has been given to Captain Berradin, Peffin Ambersnow, and the guy who volunteers to brew the drink; all with no results. Berradin is one of the traitors, I think - how else would he know enough about them to betray them?<br />
<br />
No dwarves other than Murdrick drop anything of interest (heads in particular) when killed. The assuption is that they have to be respawned. The bottleneck is the damned ale.<br />
<br />
The poison is not trivial for a rogue at 250 poison making skill. Annoying, but we can overcome that.<br />
The runed seashell (clouding) is a rare drop off of sirens in Sirens Grotto and only in Sirens Grotto. The ones in Cobalt Scars never seem to drop it. SG is populated by closely packed 51+ mobs, some that are fully MR (i.e. no snare, mez, slow), bad pathing, and very few players (on E'ci, at least). Very hard to get a shell.<br />
<br />
If you manage to get a shell, the brew is a royal bitch. No reported trivial yet (or success, for that matter, though it's not that unlikley that someone's done it and just isn't sharing). Failures have been reported at 195 and 198 brewing skill. Narsty.<br />
<br />
I have to assume that it's a brewing skill check, as it's put in a brew barrel. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Also, one of the components of the ale (ice wyvern stinger) is no drop. Not all that hard to get though. Still no idea on whether the combined ale is no drop or not.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a note and wants to give it to the Grand Historian in ThurgA, I'd be amused to see if he says anything, though I wouldn't expect too much.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the most amusing Rodrick I've seen had 2 daggers (Dirk and velium) and 2 heads (traitor's head and coldain head) <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />
<br />
GL to all... it's a VERY fun quest, outside of the competition and farming. Been trying to get ring 8 for weeks now.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Step 9 is a bugger. <br />
<br />
Mind Melt poison is not trivial at Poison 225.. and it can take several hours to collect enough components to attempt several combines at once, if you can find a rogue who has bothered to move their skill up that high. <br />
<br />
The Ale does not appear to be trivial at brewing 200 as nobody has yet posted a succsesful combine despite many brewers with skills in the 190s trying. Anyone who has been practicing brewing knows how hard it is to get skill up that high. Shame I wasted my one shell when i tried at skill in the 120's... sigh. <br />
<br />
The Shell(clouding) is damm rare. 10 hours hunting in SG pulling Sirens did not yield a single shell. <br />
<br />
The hope is that either the final brew is not NO DROP ( but i would be surprised ) or that the step where you hand it to Berradin can be split quested. Otherwise every single person doing this quest will need to become a Grandmaster Brewer.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Just a comment on step 5.  <br />
<br />
I did this yesterday and a lot more then 5 orcs spawned.  I brought an enchanter, druid, and another ranger (levels 59-60), figuring we could handle this easily, since the enchanter can mez 5 mobs no problem.<br />
<br />
It was more like 10 mobs, but I didn't get an exact count.<br />
<br />
We still did it alright, killed and looted Scarbrow, and then we ported away (leaving our dwarf friends to be slaughtered by the rest of them, sorry guys!).  We could easily have just run away instead of porting (Ranger Gate = run away!), but my friends aren't too familiar with EW so gating out was safer for them.  Heck we probably could have killed them all, but I think my friends got nervous about how fast my health went down (hadn't warned them about the HT).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the best way to handle this is probably Harmony,.  Try to stop them from attacking and then just pull out the one you want.<br />
<br />
Harmony is a useful tactic for many steps in this quest, but the exact way to use it isn't obvious until after you've already done it once or twice ;-P<br />
<br />
Right now I'm on step 7, planning to ask the advice of friends who have done this step, about the best tactic.<br />
<br />

P.S. Great Walkthrough!</p>

<i>Posted by Indira on 03-27-2001 04:33 PM:</i>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Actually, the best way to handle Scarbrow is to park someone on his spawn point (next to one of the trees down the hill and west of the dorfs, I forget which one exactly unless I'm there looking at it).  The other mobs don't pop right away, and if you aggro him immediately and keep him from running up the hill, none of them will spawn <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  Spent an easy evening collecting Frozen Orbs that way.<br />
<br />
I did step 7 with just the help of my cleric to heal me during the fight with Bruke.  I used my longest-range bow and arrow to pull him and got him without the other giants aggroing me, but it'd probably be safer to pull him from behind or to the side (assuming you can hit him through the wall, haven't tried)...the giants spawn outside the front of his building and run towards him; if you can aggro him from behind and back up immediately, you ought to be able to get out of their aggro range before they get to him.  Anyway, killed him, went to Corbin...didn't have to kill the orcs/giants there, someone else was doing it...buffed up and parked my cleric safely out of the way and triggered Corbin.  Followed along, and aggroed everything I could when the mobs attacked him.  I got all the giants and most of the orcs, Corbin managed to survive the other orcs.  Snared all the stuff chasing me, kited some of it past the dorfs to kill it, and ended up with a couple of mobs I let chase me around while Corbin beat them up from behind...Dorf Pet! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>The shells are pretty rare. I have gotten one in like 15 hours of raiding there. They only drop off the high level sirens so there are not many MOBs to choose from especially if you are doing it with a small group. Larger raids can pull more of them per cycle though. <br />

<p><b> Messenger</b></p>

<p>What is up with the Ry'Gorr Messenger?  I have been looking for him for days now.  He use to make a run to the fort every 20 minutes or so a while back, and now he is nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
Is he triggered from that step or what?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>i had the same problem, but then after a patch, i went in, and waited 10 minutes for him.<br />
<br />
The next couple of days i saw him regularly, but then again he was gone.<br />
<br />
So all i can say, safe yourself some time, place your char in the area, right before a server patch, then get on as soon as the patch is done.<br />
<br />
<br />
kinada sad you have to do it this way, but oh well it works.<br />
<br />
btw i spent 5 hours a day for a full week waiting for him, and about 20 hours in a weekend, no sign of him what so ever, even petitioned it. they didnt do anything, but the same day i gave up on it, i found out they patched the next day <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well I got lucky with the Messenger.  I camped out on the ridge in line with the gate to the fort and when I logged on last night I saw the Messenger making his run into the fort.  I got nervous, but I was able to target him and put an arrow straight into his back!  Luckily I didn't have my Idol on...hehe<br />
<br />
On another note, we triggered the giants with Tain Hammerfrrost, but instead of killing them all we snared each of the frost giants to get Ghrek alone.  After he was dead, we went back to where Tain was but he was gone.<br />
<br />
I searched for him for about an hour or so and no sign.  Do the giants really kill him?  Now that I have the Elixir, do I have to trigger the giants again and run them away from Tain so I can hand in the Elixir to the right one or is he the same spawn regardless?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Tain despawns shortly after the giants attack, atleast thats what i found after getting two rings.<br />
<br />
but you just wait about 2 hours i think, then he respawns, and you go hail him, and make the giants spawn again, and quickly hand him the potion and dash for the zone.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> 6th Step</b></p>

<p><blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>Just before you get to the camp Icefang stops and sniffs at the ground and growls. At this time Poxbreath Yellowfang spawns beside the campfire at the orc camp. You don't need to wait for Icefang to get there to engage him. I recommend that you clear the orc camp before handing in your ring to Korrigain so the camp is clear and Icefang doesn't get killed.<br />
<br />
*** NOTE *** The above has changed slightly. Now 3 oracles of Ry`Gorr spawn along with Poxbreath. A level 55 monk and level 60 ranger were able to take them out with no problem. Poxbreath and the oracles all conned blue to a level 60.  <hr></blockquote> <br />
<br />
I tried this last night and it didn't quite work as intended.  Main group was at orc camp and I had them clear it before I handing in the ring.  When I turned in the ring, Icefang got buffed and took off towards the bridge, but then started getting whacky.<br />
<br />
He ran around for a while, sort of lost.  He even went for a swim in the ocean.  He poofed and ported back near Kael.  I was tracking him the whole time.  He did this twice (10 minutes or more) before I decided to aggro him and "lead" him to the camp.  I rooted him and camped.  Still no Poxbreath. <br />
<br />
When I logged on again root broke and he took off away from the bridge AGAIN (mind you, no orcs at camp).  About half way to the Orc Fort, he turns and heads for the bridge camp because some orcs had just spawned.  I told the group to leave them up.  As we approached, THEN Poxbreath and Co. spawned.<br />
<br />
I assume Icefang was confused because there weren't any orcs up. We wiped them all out and finished that step, but only after a lot of needless running around.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> 8th ring question</b></p>

<p>I have a question about the 8th ring quest.  I understand the part about killing the chief, firbrand, oracles, and elites in the courtyard before Garadain shows up.  My question is who kills the line of giants and orcs outside the orc fortress?  Do the Coldain's take care of everything outside the fort?  I'd like to know so I can assemble a big enough army.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<br />
Here's how it goes..<br />
<br />
1) You kill all the courtyard spawns.  Chief First always.  Then you kill the 2 giants and the 2 other orcs.<br />
<br />
2) By the time you are done killing those five mobs Garadain will be sending in the dwarven army.  Once those dwarves are engaged on the orcs and giants outside the fort, Garadain will walk in to the orc fort unmolested.<br />
<br />
The only time this will fail at this point is if some jerkweed aggros orcs onto Garadain.  If this happens then Garadain most likely will die and the quest will be ended.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I did as Chromite suggested except for one thing.  My group killed the Chief and I looted the head and headed outside.  My group continued to kill the other 2 orcs and 2 giants inside.  I waited patiently while Garadain assembled the troops in front of the fort.  Once he yelled "CHARGE!" and all of the dwarves attacked the orcs and giants OUTSIDE of the fort, I handed in the Chief's head and Garadain despawned.  I didn't want to risk losing him as he wandered into the fort.<br />
<br />
The dwarves are a fearsome bunch.  They laid waste to the orcs and giants outside, but be warned, if you aggro even ONE orc or giant, they will ALL attack you (orcs and giants that is).  If you just leave them alone, they win without any trouble.  Just sit back and watch the show.  Good luck.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> thanks</b></p>

<p>Last night I completed the 8th ring quest.  I handed the cheif's head in after Garadain yelled Charge! and before he reached the fort.  It worked great.  Although if you don't want to kill the orcs and giants yourself, I suggest letting garadain reach the courtyard because after you hand in the orc head, all the coldains despawn and you're left with an army of orcs and giants.<br />
<br />
The spawn time on Gloradin is 24 hours.  Someone told me that in the game and then I saw it for myself.   She spawns in the Hut next to Garadain with the injured warrior.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help and information here.<br />

<p><b> Rodrick Spawn</b></p>

<p>This is ONLY A RUMOR, and I have yet to confirm this personally.  <br />
<br />
Rumor has it that the Messenger must reach the fort, then the Emissary will spawn, then Rodrick.  The Messenger part is at question.  The problem here is that the Messenger will attack anyone sitting down along the path to the fort, that means he dies.  Also, as soon as some people see the Emissary, he gets attacked.<br />
<br />
It takes a few minutes for the Emissary to spawn Rodrick, so if he is dead, no Rodrick.  It's tough, mainly dealing now with a lot of luck.<br />
<br />
Keep your eyes open and try to get it done at some off peak hour.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Roderick Spawn</b></p>

<p>Last night, I logged in and made my way toward the Orc Fort.  I saw the Orc Messenger on tracking and followed him.<br />
<br />
When I got to the fort, the only person outside was a Necro Fear-kiting elites.  The Orc Messenger made it inside.  Since I had read here that it was rumored that that needed to happen in order for the Orc Emmissary to spawn, I set up camp outside of the CC exit.<br />
<br />
I checked tracking again and I see the Orc Messenger.  I turn and watch him make a trip into the Fort.  I did notice that the Chief was not up at the time.  This happened 2 more times till I didn't see him on tracking anymore.  I did not notice if the cheif was up at this time.<br />
<br />
About 2 mins later, the Orc Emmissary spawned.  I /ooc begging no one to kill him till after Roderick spawned and no one did.  After what seemed like 4-6 mins, Roderick spawned.  I tried to land a snare to pull him, but he resisted it and 4 other attempts.  He also resisted 3 Earthcaller procs.<br />
<br />
A Ranger friend of mine started running from Kael to help when I said that he had spawned.  By the time she arrived, Roderick was dead and I had 26hps left. :lol<br />
<br />
I believe that not only does the Orc Messenger have to make it to the fort, but that the Chief has to be up too.<br />
<br />
I am now the owner of the 6th ring and plan to get the 7th and 8th later this week.  I also dinged 52 on my next solo kill so it was a good night!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info from everyone here.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon2.gif" alt="Arrow" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>Ok, here's a major hint for getting Rodrick posted by a guildmate:<br />
<br />
The emissary spawns at the zone out of Crystal Caverns outside of the orc fort. According to his script he paces In front of it then Roderick spawns, he has a dialogue with Rodrick and walks into the orc fort to talk to the Ry'gorr Oracle. However if the Ry'gorr oracle isn't up he automatically spawns back at the Crystal Caverns zone and spawns another Roderick.<br />
<br />
The key to looping the spawn is to make sure that he isn't killed (which is a challenge, selfish damn noobs) and to make sure the Ry'gorr Oracle is also dead (2 hour spawn time on both the emissary and the oracle)<br />
<br />
You can look him as many times as you want getting both a head and a dagger.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>TIPS AND TRICKS<br />
<br />
Ring 1 - HQ cougar Skins are rare. HQ Tundra Kodiak Pelts are very rare <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Ring 2 - Use Harmony on all mobs including Boridain. Train the giants at giant fort to Berrandin or Garadain camps before hand. Make sure you get the captain too. He walks in and out of the giant fort. Take Captain to Garadain since Berradin camp is too weak for him.<br />
<br />
Ring 3 - Not much to say here.<br />
<br />
Ring 4 - Easy way to do this is to agro all 4 giants right when they pop then start running. One by one pick a non-Ghrek giant and snare him. Keep running. Once you get out of range of the snared giant he will depop. He won't go back and kill Tain. Now you have 3 giants. Rinse and repeat until you are left with Ghrek. Get an SK or Necro to help you kill Ghrek using fear. Tain won't be there when you get back but you can wait 2 hours then trigger quest and hand in the elixer before giants reach Tain.<br />
<br />
Ring 5 - Have one person hand in the invasion plans, 1 person (ranger/druid) responsible for harmony, and 1 person pull Scarbrow away and to the side of the other 5-6 orcs. You have to do this *VERY* fast. Scar was an easy fight for level 46 Ranger and 57 SK.<br />
<br />
Ring 6 - Rodrick is completely MR resistant so don't bother trying to snare. Basically you need to melee it out with him so have a healer or more melee types to help you. Pox can be solo pulled using harmony. Again have healer or more melee types.<br />
<br />
Ring 7 Step 1 - Don't fight Warden at his spawn point because 3-4 other giants spawn when you agro him (its a trap.) Target Warden then go off to the side along hill and pull from there using long range bow to avoid agroing the other giants.<br />
<br />
Ring 7 Step 2 - Clear prison gaurds and orcs by training to Garadain camp. Hand in the shackle keys and ring six (you get ring back.) Corbin begins walking. 15 seconds prior to the ambush he says "We are almost there now." Then 1 sec prior to ambush he says "They are upon us!" or something to that effect. Easiest way to do this is to smack corbin and agro him, pull back towards the water before the giants/orcs agro Corbin. You might get a few giants/orcs (instead of all 8) and if this happens just snare/root them and get some distance between them so they stop chasing you. At this point Corbin will still be mad at whoever smacked him so have him snare/root Corbin and camp. Once root lifts Corbin won't move. He will stand there for about five minutes doing absolutely nothing while you wonder if you just screwed up your quest. Then he will thank you for saving him and continue on his way to Dobbin Crossaxe.<br />
<br />
When I did this last step with another ranger (just the two of us) the other ranger didn't smack Corbin fast enough and we ended up with 2 giants and 3 orcs chashing Corbin who was in turn chasing my fellow ranger. What I did was snared them one by one and left them in the dust. Then when we were far enough the other ranger snared/rooted Corbin, camped, then came back. At this point the 3 other orcs actually caught up to us and we killed them pretty easily with the help of Corbin. Corbin is pretty tough (not like Boridain.) I watched him solo one of the orcs and he came out with almost full hp. The orcs are pretty easy though. They were green to level 48. The giants on the other hand are not. Don't let Corbin agro on the giants.<br />
<br />
Right now I have rings 7 and 5. Tonight I hope to get rings 7 and 6 <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> For ring 8 I'm going to need a nice group to help me.<br />

<p>thanks a lot for the walkthrough <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
I was almost able to do the second part solo as a 60 rogue, although I did get some help.....some people were clearing the giant fort, and I got heal/fear help from a necro at the orc fort.<br />
<br />
I also got attacked suddenly by a rygorr oracle which was blue at 60 - it came at me right outside the giant fort.<br />
<br />
as for Scarbrow, simply root him, and let the orcs come to you standing at the dwarf camp - they will take care of them. go kill scarbrow <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Last night a group of us did rings and we covered a lot of ground. Ring 1, Multied a tailoring challenged paladin to ring 2, did the Tain encounter for his 4th ring (adds nearly killed us), did Ring 5 encounter twice, ran into Rodrick so we could do the 6th, then 7th ring for one guy, did the 8th ring for a very happy 49th level ranger in our guild. I even collected a few snowballs for the 9th ring. <br />
<br />
Question, we're getting a lot of casters in my guild doing the ring quests although they step aside for the melee types. Is anyone else seeing this? It's a great quest but if they think I'm going to trade my IGS for a prayer shawl, they are mistaken.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

It's a great ring for everyone - especially the 9th ring.  I have helped a cleric friend and an enchanter friend do their rings long ago.<br />
<br />
We're currently working on the 9th ring for all of us now.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Awesome run through Chromite.  I'm on ring 6 now and progressing nicely <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Question:  Whats the stats on ring 9?  I'm pretty confident I can get at least that far, 10... not sure <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p><b> 9th Ring</b></p>

<p>Hero's Coldain Insignia Ring<br />
AC9 +9STR +9STA +9 SV MAGIC +50hp<br />
Effect: Shield of the Eigth<br />
ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
I did part seven last night with myself (51 RNG) and a 40 monk. The Warden was up so I trained him to the Dwarf camp with the coldain cook. There were four dwarves there. They all fought until the dwarves were dead and the Warden was down to 30%. I agro kited him with flame lick and a level 40 monk whackced him from behind until dead.<br />
<br />
I did the freeing Corbin part solo. I trained the 2 Giant guards to Garadain's camp, then the 3 orcs to Garadain's camp, then handed in my ring and the shackle key, then Corbin respawns with Coldain faction, I harmo him, follow him on his way, then he says "We are almost there" then ~20 seconds later 4 giants and 4 orcs spawn, I immediately kick Corbin and run him back to where we came from, I turn around and see the 4 giants/orcs pathing to wear Corbin would have been, but they don't agro since we are now too far. I run Corbin back to the shore, snare + root, camp, log in, 5 minutes later Corbin starts walking to Dobbin and I get my 7th ring!<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
1. The giants DO NOT despawn. They will wander in a large circular path, most likely looking for people like me who are trying to evade the ambush. Make sure they aren't coming toward you/Corbin when you are camping. The path has them walking behind the prison camp towards the shore, then back out again, over and over.<br />
<br />
2. When you log back in Corbin will stand there doing nothing for abouve 5 minutes, while you wonder if you just screwed up the quest. He will also respond to Hails, asking for you to show him the ring and give him the shackle key. Don't be alarmed. Just wait until he starts walking.<br />
<br />
3. Keep yourself camoed while waiting. You don't want to have to deal with ulthors and walruses during this important part of the quest.<br />
<br />
4. Keep Corbin harmonied in case the giants find him. This way you can kick him again and have him follow you instead of agroing on the giants.</p>

<p>Ah, back from spring and summer hiatus....looks like I have some work ahead of me.  CHrome, is the first post here the full walkthrough so far?  it hasn't been updated since March, so figured I'd ask <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
BTW, excellent work, and grats to all who have been getting their rings <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon6.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>ring 9 - forgive the mispelling of names or total fubar of them...you will get the gist<br />
<br />
Murdrik - take one group with you into the cave where he spawns, allow him to go through his monolog , while he was talking what i did to kill the time is i harmonied all the dorfs in the cave, once he got done i have my monk freind pull him to the left of his room and follow the left wall of his cave and hang a right so that u end up pulling him deeper in the cave, all the dworfs will agro but most will hit the wall and reset instead of attacking you and yer party....oncce the monk has Murdrik to youre camp he FDs and stays down, at this time agro Murdrik and kill him fast to avoid a despawn....allways good to bring along a rogue or 2 in yer group so that he dies fast....loot the head and the note <br />
<br />
Baradin (sp) - hand him the ale or have someone hand the ale for you....Harmony the dworfs in his room while he does his lil epileptic breakdancing.....have a FD puller pull him out should get him solo or with an add....have a freind kite the add while u kill Baradin...loot the head and the note<br />
<br />
Peffin - this is probably the hardest part on this stage of the ring.... Clear out the giant fort in EW and then have an FD puller pull out peffin outside the fort and FD infront of you...hand in the note from Baradin and she will despawn. Peffin will respawn just infront of the Campfire in the middle of the fort surrounded by a bunch of elite giants...now all these mobs are rooted and cannot be pulled....so heres the easy way to do this...have a full group with you including a shaman with AoE slow....have the shaman cast his spell a few times to build lots of agro....have the shaman sit down just outside of melee range from the giants  and send youre troops in to kill peffin, loot the head the ring and the nice bow =).<br />
<br />
Dorgin (sp) - this guy is in kael, if u enter kael from EW head twords the frozen pond and folow the path above it to a building...in that building you will find a room with a throne( clear out all the spawns in the throne room). if you stand on the throne and say  "the dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain" or something like that...you can look at the note that peffin dropped it has the exact phrase written on it. once you say the the magic phrase the dorf will spawn, hand him the note you got from peffin, hi will give you a ring of the council or something like that....Attack him and he will despawn. at this time 2 lvl 51 giants spawn and agro on you take them to youre group and kill them, when they die another giant spawns i think lvl 53, then another i think 55, and then a lvl 60 one.....they come in waves so as you kill the 1st set the next one spawns. once you kill the lvl 60 one the lil dorf that despawned will respawn again and try to hightail outa the room....agro him fast or you will have to do all the giant spawns all over again....kill him loot his head and head on over to icewell keep.<br />
<br />
Julia Lockheart - (icewell keep) you can find julia either in the throne room or in the room on the 1st floor with the sleeping guard...you can fight her in either place the dorfs wont assist her, unless one of youre party memebers is KoS ;-p. Hand her the ring you got from the last guy (DO NOT HAND HER THE 8th RING OR U WILL LOOSE IT). once you hand her the ring she will agro , kill her and loot her head. She hits for around 350 so you might want to bring a strong group or 2. i did it with 1 group of all 60s, good idea to have a cleric and a warrior to tank her <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">. once she is dead loot the head. Take the 5 heads place them in the container that you get from senechal (sp) (hand Senechal youre 8th dain ring follow him downstairs and go with him through his monolog he hands you the box to combine the heads in....Chromite explained this step earlier on.) ok now that you have all 5 heads in the container...also place rodricks dagger that u got when u killed him in the box and hit combine...the end product is a box that u cant open.....and now you wait for dain to spawn and do the handins.....Dain has not spawned yet on Cazic thule so this is where i am at on the quest......have looked at some other spoilers out there and they say to hand in the completed box with the 8th ring to the Dain and you get ring 9.....wish me luck =p and i hope this helped anyone that was haveing issues =)<br />
