Because honestly, if GoD is only for those who are done with Time and such, then I wasted my money buying it since I wont be there for a long long time..Shoot me your thoughts..Im currious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a level 61 Shammy with OK gear, I've soloed in Natimbi without a problem. Think Dulak but with <br />
more damage and less loot. My recommendation would be to start on shore stonemites and tureptas first north of the magus so you can run back to the magus if things get hairy. Once you are comfortable with them, head over to the hynids and undead. I'd strongly recommend Torpor or Stoicism, Bane of Nife or Anathema and True Spirit if you don't have them. It is possible without them but much easier with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool, IM just looking to get that common drop necklace to upgrade mine..I may drag along a 56 chanter with me to help out with the adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, not flaming you - Just thought that was kinda funny...Actually, it's not that common.<br />
<br />
  But I did xp in Natimbi in the higher 50's, even dinging 61 there late one saturday night.  At 61 the mobs are much, much easier with the new pet and all.  <br />
<br />
There is also a more &quot;common&quot; range slot drop I retired my VERY old Howling Harpoon for - Irridescent Turepta Shell(?) off the turtles. <br />
<br />
Good Luck Heyokah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Will take it from your evil chuckel that it is not that common of a drop eh..sigh..I was reasearching the mobs that drop it and it seems there are quite a few..I would really like to get my grubby little mits on one..wish me luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Wish me luck&quot;<br />
<br />
I did, and I do. :)<br />
<br />
I guess it's almost a completely random drop...could come from a lot of mobs.  I would like it as well, but usually leave in disgust when bards, etc start dragging their messes all over the area.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of trying it on off times - Late, early, weeknight, something like that...Maybe we can get lucky, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Curio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solo’d my last 20 % to get 58 in Natimbi. Wasn’t to tough even with an add near the shore line. Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>phileepae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Natimbi is an excellent zone to hunt in.  I personally started there at around 56 or so and have always soloed there.  Here's what I did:<br />
<br />
Set up pet and buffs and everything you do to get ready to solo, and set up camp behind the boxes stacked up behind the camp.  Here, there are no wanderers and you can saftely pull singles to your spot.  Pull with your best malo and run straight back to your camp.  Start spam hitting your slow spell and you will get it off before the mob gets to you.  Root him, step back and cast cripple.  Then, because i had my epic, i'd hit him with one of those, then do an ebolt of BoN and either sit and med or melee the rest of the fight, rooting when they began to run.  Now, I'm a very physical shaman, I almost always tank my fights and my melee stats are all 200 atm, so it may have been easier for me and you may have more trouble if your stats aren't that high.<br />
<br />
There are also some nice named in the area.  Underwater, where the reef crustaceans spawn, there can spawn a named crustacean.  I have seen him twice, and the first time he dropped a calloused shell helm or something, and the second time he dropped a +20 mana aug.  Named turtle has Fierce in it's name, and I would not recommened fighting him until you are over 60.  He would be easier if he didn't hit for 300+, have a sh*t load of hp, and be very magic resistant.<br />
<br />
There are more named out there, like for the dog things and such, but I don't want to type anymore.  Good luck and I hope this helped someone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have been doing the restless spirits/souls? across the water right from the zone in at 63 for AA.  <br />
<br />
There is a Named that can pop there who can drop randomly a nice +20 hp slot 7 aug.<br />
<br />
the mobs are very easy with a buffed up true spirit pet then just slow stack pox/bane of nife.  I normally then root the mob and back up and canni on my dro while watching the pets hps(unless you get your pet a virt) and throw him a CH when he needs it and rerooting.<br />
<br />
One thing if you get the named it summons and cannot be rooted so your best bet is to slow/torpor yourself/dot with both dots/then keep torpor on yourself and tank for the pet.<br />
<br />
Also the souls drop a no drop spiritual essence that is for a nice no drop 1hb(not shaman usable).<br />
<br />
Oh one more point for the origional poster.  You should really get new shoes.  Oh and ya need to choose the other amulet of insight in magelo to get the one with the focus effect listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a twinked Shaman, and solo the natimbi mobs opposite the camp. I usually dont bother with malo-line and go directly for the slow. Fully buffed with a Corpsegrinder, I melee them till they run, then use the Inni necklace to snare and let dog-dog finish them off.<br />
<br />
The FT necklace is not common at all, but rare. But it does drop off any mob in the zone. I have seen it personally drop off a Turepta, a Shore Mite, and a Hynid, as well as off the souls. There is also a melee version necklace that has the same drop pattern.<br />
<br />
Mage summoned equipment is a great boon of course.<br />
<br />
For safety I suggest an evac hotbutton<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is also a +20 Mana aug that drops off the named crustacean (Vimidon).  Rare drop.  Common drop off Vimidon is Calloused Shell Helm.<br />
<br />
Shell Inlaid Collar is the melee version of the neck, Talisman of the Spiritseer is the caster version (I wear it).  +7 to saves, +5 to stats, +50 mana.<br />
<br />
These items can in fact drop off any mob in the zone, but calling them rare is giving them a huge benefit of the doubt.  They are still going for 45-50k on SolRo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TainwulfSilverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I soloed there at 51 just to see if I could.<br />
<br />
Granted 2 at a time meant I had to run, but I would just stack Plague and EB while my pet held aggro.  Only had to heal him once and unless I had to pull funny I only had to cast eb twice if I felt like spending the mana on it.  At your level using the same tactics with some summoned pet toys you should little to no problems at all.  Depending on how many other people are trying to farm necklaces, pull with a slow past the boxs just above the camp.  This is usually enough room to finish it off without getting adds.  Also the turtles don't tend to add, but Stonemites will add with a turtle if you pull one too close to the other.<br />
<br />
Just don't get crazy if you get a Shell-Inlaid Necklace to sell, I did twinked my alts and completely forgot to buy a horse and maybe a JBB ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Natimbi has a couple nice pieces of loot, but the XP pretty much dies out after 53ish.  My duo usually clears the Souls with time to spare for any named pops.  I have the melee necklace, but won't stop coming here til I get the caster necklace for my Shaman.  I am yet to kill the Kyv since the named mobs summon now, so that might be an interesting fight....well, not really, but they do look very cool :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First off, Can someone plz Explain where this zone is.  I have been to EQ atlas and I cant find the directions to this zone.   Also I heard one of the LVl 53's soloed this zone and said the xp is crap after or at lvl 53.  Are you saying the Lvl to fight in this zone is close too or like that of Dualk and if so, which is better in terms of exp, loot etc?   Dulak or this zone you speak of.  Inquiering minds want to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Natimbi is part of the GoD expansion, and is generally considered the easiest of the zones in that expansion.  It can be gotten to via magus from Nedarias Landing.<br />

In general, the &quot;loot&quot; in Natimbi is not as plentiful as that in Dulak.  There are however, at the top end, much better items available in Natimbi both dropped and quested.</div></div><hr />

So I go up to a magnus and say, &quot;Nedarias landing&quot;  to get there?<br />
<br />
And is the EXP worth it,  I know it sounds great for my monk by not having alot of loot drops, it hurts her wieght.</div></div><hr />

If Exp is your major motivation, stay in LoY.  The ZEM's are still higher there.<br />
<br />
If rare but nice loot is your major motivating factor, travel to Natimbi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'm not sure how &quot;nice!&quot; geared I am in comparison to many but I started soloing natimbi a bit at 49th and 50th level by shore.  Only problem I found is all the high 60's running around looking for diamonds and the like because they can slaughter the little turtles and mites real fast.<br />
<br />
Back when it was first released everything in the area aggro'd but it's not so bad now with being 'dubious'.  There ARE some assist issues but slow and root the adds, back pet out and then send in so you have 1 fight at a time and you should be fine if you want to do the shores.<br />
<br />
At 61 you should be able to solo one of the camp type spots though such as that theater area otw to qinimi -- the nocs and mastrung can be single pulled and are LB and DB up to 65th level (my 64 druid solos here at times and so did my 65 enchanter for &quot;charm&quot; warming up work to do tipt and vxed trials -- enchanter hadn't really soloed since like 16th level so...).<br />
<br />
AA work here is nice for higher level folks and xp is pretty good too.  MoB's hit hard but don't have a lot of HP themselves and their DOT's are mostly poison or disease based so your cures can clear that fast...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you should be fine going in and killing stuff these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viridovix Frosthammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gear wise, I am far from uber, but not badly equipped. Seeing as my entire outfit would sell for maybe 20k in bazaar, I am sure many of you are better off than me :p <br />
<br />
I started soloing there at 55, mostly just fighting the tureptas and stonemites. At that level the hynids were a bit tough, the souls were doable, but with tons of downtime and the fierce cragwalker was death.<br />
<br />
Now, at 58, I can clear the turtle pond (4 spawns, 1 can be fierce), then clear the hynids on the hill near Qinimi (6 spawns) and be back to the turtle pond as they start spawning again.<br />
<br />
As someone mentioned, the named spawns (which includes the fierce cragwalker and the swift scavenger) summon, but once they are slowed they aren't too bad. Each named spawn drops something and the two necklaces that have been mentioned are on their loot tables.<br />
<br />
Another really nice item that you can get there is Kiki's Recipe Book (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26397) (nice for those under 60 anyway). Talk to Kiki Mischiefmaker at the camp, she's the halfling near the fire. She wants 4 suculent turepta meats to make a soup. The meats are no drop, not stackable and somewhat rare (took me about 5 hours to get 4 of them). They drop from the turepta cragwalkers which are just about the easiest mobs in the zone to kill.<br />
<br />
Exp isn't too bad actually. It's a little more exp per mob than Chardok (the current &quot;hotspot&quot;) but the mobs take a bit longer to kill. The only things I have seen add are the stonemites and the nameds. Even pulling a turepta with another standing on top of him, the second turepta didn't add.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really like this zone. It takes a bit of learning, but once you know how it works, a shaman can do really well there.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Gustav.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sutphen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Shammy with mana-free clicky snare is really nice. I started these quests many levels ago and stopped after I finished part of the 3rd quest, but never got the necklace. I recently went back and finished the quest off and let me tell you, the snare effect is AWESOME. Troll Shaman and DE Clerics of Innoruuk got something to make up for being so KOS to most of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've been solo'n in Natimbi since I was 57. I've got roughly 4200hp buffed 3500mana. I've got a drog and I fully buff doggy. <br />
<br />
I pull hynids and and crags (avoiding the fierce ones like the f'n plauge) with slow. Hardley any resists. I run back to the wall (the upward sloping hill across from magus). Once the mob gets fairly close I sic doggy on him, dot him twice (E Bolt and Bane).. he'll come after you, but slowed his damage is minimal, just root and walk away. I have a JBB so I just mana free nuke em to death. Even if I cant keep em rooted with regen on I end up at about 75% health when I'm done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hmmm...<br />
<br />
I went into that zone at 47 and duoed with a 56 Druid friend of mine. Then went back at 49 and root rotted till about 51ish. Did not have the pet up because I thought he would get owned...about 51 or 52 changed my tactics and just tanked them while dogdog chewed their butt.<br />
<br />
Note I always get a Virtue and KEI before I go. I may be crazy but I am not suicidal.<br />
<br />
I have seen the melee version of the collar drop (Shell Inlaid Collar) but not the Talisman of the Spiritseer yet. Sold the melee version to a monk for 30k so I may try to buy the other one with that if I can.<br />
<br />
Great zone though and when I solo I mainly pull the cragwalkers, stonemites and reef crus...<br />
<br />
Takes me about 2 mins to kill them...which is me and dogdog meleeing both hasted and buffed (most of my melee stats are 255 when buffed) and me with a soulstripper (hey I am trying to max 1H blunt).<br />
<br />
No Malos except on named when I am in a group and never pull named solo. Pull with slow...if lands run to safe spot and and stop...me and dogdog start meleeing. If slow is resisted which is rare then send in dogdog as a distraction (never had him go lower than 60% and most times not below 80%) and then slow again and move into melee. During the fight I will usually cast EB twice and Plague once. Since changing to using dogdog and tanking I have not had Plague run out unless there is a add. Never died soloing (yet). Once pull 3 by mistake and had to zone.<br />
