<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't think of any use (by shammies) for lixt wing stalks. The only spell components I know of that we need are batwings, snake skins(for one of the early ac buffs) and fish scales. I am not sure, but maybe rogues need the lixt wing stalks for making poisons. My alchemy skill is only in the mid-70s, but I can't think of any potion needing them either, unless they're part of one of the new recipes. Sorry I can't be more helpful. :(</div></div><hr />
