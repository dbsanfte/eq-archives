<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>starrz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok my shaman is still pretty young.  :)  She's at 16.  Just wondering what stats besides wisdom I should be interested in. Do I need to worry about intelligence at all.  So far she doesn't seem to have a lot of mana to work with, but that may be her level I hope. :P  Just wondering in case I messed up on her point distributions. :) Would much rather find out now rather than at level 40. :) And yes I'm holding off on buying her a couple items until I find out which stats she needs to work on. :)  Just click Starrz for her profile. :) Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balance your HP, AC, and wis.  Your HP is effected in part by your stamina.  Your ac is effected a little by your agility, but its not worth wearing AGI gear for ac.  wear ac gear for ac.  wisdom is important because you do need to have a decent sized mana pool.  however, we arent druid or clerics.  we don't need a HUGE mana pool, and thus it shouldnt be your primary concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most important stat is the class flag, you picked the right one ;)<br />
<br />
Said that,  you will want to have enough AC and HP to be able to stand against a mob toe to toe, as many of our spells generate a lot of hate and the mobs like to pound on you. You also want to have good wisdom to be able to cast more spells. Stamina increases your hitpoints, more hitpoints -&gt; good.<br />
<br />
Stats you should look for (not sorted by importance, create a good balance):<br />
AC<br />
HP<br />
Stamina<br />
Wisdom<br />
Mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you actually can wear druid / cleric wis heavy gear at the lower levels.  Most of the people here forgot life before 49, when slow is always used, and gets agro =)<br />
<br />
Work on wiz / hp gear mainly, and work on tanking a good portion to keep your defense up.<br />
Once you have canabalize at 24, the HP gear is really worth it, and the Wis is to give you a good mana pool.<br />
You want to tank at least enough to get your Defense maxed for your level, this will make a huge difference later.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 39 to 44 though, you really need to switch gears, and sacrifice wisdom to AC and HPs, even if it means dropping something with good wis / mana for no wis/mana and good ac (JB armor).  At this point you gain mana much more from canabalizing than medding, and you will gain agro from dots and slows.  Your survivability is far more important than your mana pool, because your mana regen is far superior to other classes..</div></div><hr />
