<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's been mentioned on this board before, but DAMN katta guards make for GREAT exp.<br />
<br />
Duoed there the other night with a 46 chanter (works better than it sounds) and we both got a FULL LEVEL in one night (about 3 hours).<br />
<br />
The spot we camped is the open area near Tenebrous zone. Chanter pulled w/ tash, got hit once to send his pet in, and rooted the mob while i slowed it and sent puppy in to help. Togors lands easy and the guards are WEAK, hitting for 60 max and i don't think they even double hit. 2 hasted pets took out a guard fast enough that VoS didn't have time to do full damage, so i stopped using it. Pet healing is easy even with just greater healing, mana was never an issue, took maybe 1 med break an hour for the chanter's sake. Got up to two adds at some times because we were sitting right at a spawn for one guard and in the pathing for another, but wasn't a big deal with chanter there; if you don't have one it should be easy enough to find a spot without adds.<br />
<br />
Each guard was worth about 1/5 of a blue to me at 44, and as i mentioned kills took under 48 seconds with almost zero downtime.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah, loot is pretty crappy... we managed to score about 8 pieces of Validus Custodus armor including 2 of the bp's, few other people in the zone said that was incredibly lucky. The armor is decent, about ry'gorr quality, plate only though so not SHM wearable. Also they drop a weapon every time, worth about as much as FS, and a shield which is lore nonmagic ac 12 (ie sux, probably for some Seru faction quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does killing the Katta guards give any kind of faction hit? I know there's a few quests that come out of Katta that I may do someday, so I don't want to completely destroy my faction there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tacomodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What zone is this?<br />
And what level are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the zone is Katta Castellum. you can get to it through twilight sea or tenebrous.<br />
<br />
there are no less than NINE different faction hits, but only two that matter: bad katta, good seru. if you plan to do katta quests you may not want to do this... but hell if i want em later i'll just go kill lots of seru or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How much ac do you have??<br />
<br />
lol I know the ones that were duel wielding usually hit me for about 80 dmg each, and pretty quickly too, even when slowed. They were very easy however. Nice exp and loot. Can make about 70 plat per 3 blues ;) <br />
<br />
btw, where else did you pull from?<br />
<br />
I was soloing the katta entrance at lvl 45(46 now hehe) but only ones I'd kill was the two spawn right at the first gate place, then the one or two that wanders by. That's why I was wishing they had a quicker spawn time =P<br />
<br />
oh yeah, not sure if the ones I was fighting ever duel wielded, but the ones in tenebrous mountains were duel wielding. I had to stop fighting those ones because a druid I didn't see was buffing them with a dmg shield. accedently pulled the druid when pulling one guard so I had 2 guards and the druid on me. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Is my Sig too big? Completely forgot about size when I made it hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my self buffed ac is 802.<br />
<br />
was duoing with a chanter so his pet was tanking, needed one g. heal every fight, sometimes two, melee window sez they were hitting for about 60 max.<br />
<br />
i never saw a guard in KC dual wield, and never stayed in tenebrous long enough to fight one, only went in there when i had to zone b/c of some stupid quad kiter pulling centurions to us. (i got to KC through the fungus grove teleport to twilight)<br />
<br />
we stayed in the little courtyard in front of TM zone tunnel, chanter was pulling from down the street in both directions, names were like Legionnaire Jaypario and Heraticus and stuff. all blue to me at 44, a few were occasionally LB to the chanter by the time he hit 48. some of em had 2 handers but again no dual wielders. no casters either. we did try going down the ramp thing that leads to the top of the walls but lego's there were hitting for MUCH more and conned yellow to me at 45 so we stopped after one pull.<br />
<br />
your sig is pretty big but wait and see if sunmoon removes it, also imho the umlauts over the I's and O's look pretty dumb no offense :)</div></div><hr />
