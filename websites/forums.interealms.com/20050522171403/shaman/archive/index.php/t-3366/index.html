<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylvanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WHat do you guys think of a Kitty Shaman. I was debating between either Vah Shir or Ogre. How much of a hassle is it for a ogre? As in being KOS in most cities.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Sylvanos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">shrug....the only time i have had issues with being KOS is in old world.  i'm not kos in velius or the moon.<br />
<br />
so in other words....dont worry about KOS its not a big deal that some make it up to be.:)<br />
<br />
kitty shaman?  ugh...they are pretty much a barb that is a little prettier....have safe fall....and eat more.:)<br />
<br />
so kitty shaman=barbie upgrade...but thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, I will have to agree with smaserr somewhat.  I have been playing a kitty shaman for a while now, safe fall, we eat more, and infravision.<br />
<br />
The difference between the barb and kitty is just looks, some stats, and night vision.  It really just depends on what you want to look like, you can look like a mountain of muscle or a feline.  That choice is yours.<br />
<br />
One thing though, I really hate the vah shir plate look, might want to look into preferences that you are in looking for in the class...<br />
<br />
KOS will be a big deal if you like spening time in towns, but never will it effect you greatly, you will just have to travel a little farther...  but as you know, shamans already have to travel to get spells, and if it wasn't for the firepots room, halas and shar vahl would be a long haul.</div></div><hr />

Sneak! Nothing 'sees' through sneak if you're behind it, be it live or dead or a god. Not instantly reliable like a rogue's, but if you have a moment to get it going, sneak is huge.<br />
<br />
The part I take issue with is the preposterous claim that a kitten is more attractive than a handsome Northman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">VahShiir advantages:   Nice faction in general, SNEAK, and NO EXP PENALTY (I'm pretty darn sure). <br />
<br />
Ogre advantages: better stats in general, and no stun from the front. <br />
<br />
At high level an ogre would be a bit more powerful, but the lower vahshiir exp penalty is nice too, especially if it's not someone you're going to play a ton. <br />
<br />
All shaman races are fine, IMHO. Once you've picked the best class, what does the race really matter? ;)<br />
<br />
Kriel / Untar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Kriel there.. pick the race that you like, it all evens out in the end.  I enjoy being a Vah Shir shaman, but it's more liking the race in general and not any specific advantage/disadvantage we may have over other races.  The sneak is quite handy, though, there's no denying that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually like the plate look on them.  But, racial abilities are what makes the race appealing.  Sneak is pretty useful anywhere.  Safefall is at a pretty low level, and doesn't help as much as people might think, but it's good to avoid or reduce bumps and scrapes.   Plus, you start with a new environment to level in. <br />
<br />
I have a kitty beastlord in the 50's, and I'm glad I chose that race.  I must say though, a troll beastlord is inticing, because having a &quot;Lockjaw&quot; running loose, would be fun.</div></div><hr />
