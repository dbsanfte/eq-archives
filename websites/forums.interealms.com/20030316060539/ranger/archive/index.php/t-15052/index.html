<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what i've heard, after the guys start chanting you need to kill the four dark masters and than doomshade will pop.<br />
<br />
That doesn't seem that bad, but what i heard was that you only have about 30 minutes to kill the four dark masters after they start to chant or you lose the ability to spawn doomshade.<br />
<br />
Will they start to chant again like maybe an hour later or so? or is it like another day or two. <br />
<br />
If you only have a 30 minute window to spawn him it seems like you would need to keep your entire raid force for him camped there indefinitely until they finally started to chant.<br />
<br />
Maybe i'm missing something, i'd really like to take this guy down, but i don't think my friends and guildies would be down with campthing this guy for three days strait every week like stormfeather or something... hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeera Edhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We've done him a few times. Not sure on the 30min after start of chant, but I'm pretty sure you have to kill all the DM's within a certain amount of time (10min?) and then Doom will spawn.<br />
<br />
He's on a 3day spawn timer I think. Most peeps kill Rumblecrush too, so if RC is up, Doom is close to being able to spawn as well. We usually wait till we know someone's killed him or after a server reset. Then we get the timer. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kohpry Mossarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have to kill all four Dark Masters within 15 minutes (that's when they start respawning) in order to trigger Doomshade.   If you don't, you got to kill them all over again.   He isn't an insta-spawn either-- you got a few minutes to wait before the zone-wide emote lets you know he's up. The wait is longer than you'd think, so don't be impatient!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuvan Truearrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought it was a 20 min time period, but irregardles...<br />
<br />
You gotta do the DM's quickly, then get everyone to where you want to fight Doomshade.<br />
<br />
Fairly intense fight...but well worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every two minutes the server checks to that these two conditions are met:<br />
<br />
a) Zone-wide &quot;chanting&quot; emote<br />
b) Dark Masters are dead<br />
<br />
If those two condition are met then Doomshade will spawn. Respawn on the DMs are ~15 minutes. The zone-wide emote starts occuring 0 - 12 hours after a patch, stops when Doomshade spawns, then starts three days later (regardless if Doom was killed or not). Doomshade poofs two hours after being spawned.</div></div><hr />
