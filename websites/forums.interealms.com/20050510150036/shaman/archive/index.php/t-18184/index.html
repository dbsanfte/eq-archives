<br />
Neither one is true anymore.<br />
<br />
Shamans were the kings of solo'ing in the velious era, and we still hold our own, but with the release of PoP, charm classes became much better at solo'ing the big mobs.  For sheer kills per hour, and thus cash per hour, necros outrank us, and probably druids and chanters do as well, if there is a charmable mob nearby.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea, 2 druids in my guild took down a mini in PoStorms recently with a couple of charmed frogs.  These hit for about 1000, can't be slowed, rampage, flurry, and enrage.  I don't speak from the perspective of a time-geared player, but I doubt any 2 shammies in similar gear (mostly ornate, maybe FT8) anywhere could do the same.  Similarly, CoD chanters can take down most any named in a Teir 2 PoP zone (and probably any Teir 3 zone as well by adding a cleric).  Meanwhile, most shammies would still consider low-end mobs like Lodizal or WW dragons to be a substantive kill.<br />
<br />
To give you another idea, consider that a necro in my guild can kite-kill the diakus in PoTactics at about twice the rate per hour that I can.  He has more AAs, but we're both 65, both have all spells, and I have better gear.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can solo well, but we're long past the days of being the best at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For just farming? Necro hands down. They have the ability to burn through low blue trash quickly, yet have all the spells and options to take on some really big mobs or named mobs in dungeons for loot and bragging rights as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Enchanters can make more money probably than any other class...  <br />
<br />
/auc Casting KEI/clarity1&amp;2 for donations.. ;)  <br />
<br />
May get a bit boring, but it definitely brings in the plat. With their charm spells, they can solo very well as well so there's other opportunities to make cash as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman are quite capable of making good money and xp solo, more than some classes but less than others.<br />
<br />
We can do well though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can make an solo aa in about 50mins in PoF while chatting with friends. Could probably do it faster with Ba4 item and not being a slacker ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;/auc Casting KEI/clarity1&amp;2 for donations..  &quot; lol so sad that its true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If al I wanted to do was farm for cash/loots, then I would level a necro to 65, get undead dire charm and some AA healing skills and tear Veksar a new arse (after stopping in bazaar for some pet toys).<br />
I have seen several necros soloing in the Highborn area with dire charmed mobs and doing VERY well, netting Kylong gauntlets, cash loots and even heading to the golems/shop area and farming the heck out of it. <br />
It really is sick what a good necro can do with the right gear and AA.<br />
And yes, I am envious :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say a mage with son of rathe would own a necro at soloing in OS..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meogurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Druid =)  I've been averaging at least 50k a week for the past 5 weeks, since I've put my mind to it.  I have a 65 cleric, 65 druid, and now a 55 shammy to twink out, boy does the money go quick =/  On the bright side I do have Malo/Torpor/Pox in the bank waiting on me. ;)  I might be able to make more sitting in BoT 24/7 with the cleric hoping to win an ornate drop, but that's extremely boring.  With my dru I have a circuit I run in the morning before work, and at night before bed.  Augment this with the occasional spec parch spell sale and I usually have enough cash around to buy what I need...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xxithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sure, druids might do well farming solo, but there are a few small drawbacks...<br />
<br />
1) Can never get a group.  Druids are usually just after warriors in inability to find a group.  Tied with necros as far as I can tell.  Shammies get groups fast and easily.<br />
<br />
2) Chanters cant heal, so things get just a slight bit outta hand, and you have 30 mins to wait regening your health a few hp at a time.<br />
<br />
Shaman are still top dog when it comes to taking out big mobs solo, with beastlords coming in a close second.  Best part about shaman is, get a tank friend, and maybe a cleric, or dps class, and you are farming at 10x the rate of any soloer.  10x / 3 = more than 1.  I have a buddy that two-boxes a shaman and a sk, and farms AC, making upwards of 200k a week in a good week, or did at least, havent seen him on in a while =/<br />
<br />
Basically, if you cant do it solo, pick up an SK and split the profits.  <br />
<br />
PS it helps to either be related to your farmin partner, or to have BOTH people that farm together have a decent bankroll, so if you go out, get 1 50k drop, on person can simply hand the other 25k and keep the item to sell, thusly everything gets split fairly and most importantly, promptly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dont count the shaman out of the big money making scence.<br />
<br />
necros might beable to farm greenies, but greenies arent where the real cash is. The real cash is farming areas that drop high $$ loot, not farming a zillion mobs for the plat they drop. <br />
<br />
I know a place that i can solo that i can walk away with 30-80k in a 3-5 hour time span.<br />
<br />
Thats pretty damn good if you ask me. And no, the place im thinking of i dont think a necro could solo cause you cant split and you will end up tanking mobs alot. But then again i dont have a high level necro or the skill to play one, so maybe then can.<br />
<br />
Point being, dont leave shaman out of the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">about xp..........<br />
well a bard in our guild tried to get 100aa in one week.<br />
<br />
he didn t get it but was pretty close.<br />
<br />
i got 370 aa,he was at 200aa  3 weeks ago, now he maxed is aa (like 470 i think).<br />
<br />
in one pull,  when all mobs were dead,he had to loot like  80 corpses :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kei? Please dont make me laugh... they arent raking it in anymore, which is why not that many are doing it.<br />

Casinos are where you big money is at.</div></div><hr />
