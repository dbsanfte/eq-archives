<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently, when I went to McDonald's I saw on the <br />
menu that you could have an <br />
order of 6, 9 or 12 Chicken McNuggets. I asked for a <br />
half dozen nuggets. &quot;We <br />
don't have half dozen nuggets&quot;, said the teenager at <br />
the counter. &quot;You <br />
don't?&quot; I replied. &quot;We only have six, nine, or <br />
twelve,&quot; was the reply. &quot;So I <br />
can't order a half-dozen nuggets, but I can order <br />
six?&quot;  &quot;That's right.&quot; So I <br />
shook my head and ordered six McNuggets. <br />
<br />
The paragraph above doesn't amaze me because of what <br />
happened a couple of <br />
months ago.  I was checking out at the local Food <br />
Lion with just a few items <br />
and the lady behind me put her things on the belt <br />
close to mine. I picked up <br />
one of those &quot;Dividers&quot; that they keep by the cash <br />
register and placed it <br />
between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. <br />
After the girl had scanned <br />
all of my items, she picked up the &quot;Divider&quot; looking <br />
it all over for the bar <br />
code so she could scan it.  Not finding the bar code <br />
she said to me &quot;Do you <br />
know how much this is?&quot; and I said to her &quot;I've <br />
changed my mind, I don't <br />
think I'll buy that today&quot;. She said &quot;OK&quot; and I paid <br />
her for the things and <br />
left.  She had no clue to what had just <br />
happened.......... <br />
<br />
A lady at work was seen putting a credit card into <br />
her floppy drive and <br />
pulling it out very quickly. When inquired as to <br />
what she was doing, she said <br />
she was shopping on the Internet and they kept <br />
asking for a credit card <br />
number, so she was using the ATM &quot;thingy&quot;. <br />
<br />
I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping <br />
beside her car (no, she wasn't <br />
blonde).  Do you need some help?&quot; I asked. She <br />
replied, &quot;I knew I should have <br />
replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. <br />
Now I can't get into my <br />
car.  Do you think they (pointing to a distant <br />
convenient store) would have a <br />
battery to fit this?&quot; &quot;Hmmm, I dunno. Do you have an <br />
alarm too?&quot; I asked. <br />
&quot;No, just this remote thingy,&quot; she answered, handing <br />
it and the car keys to <br />
me.  As I took the key and manually unlocked the <br />
door, I replied, &quot;Why don't <br />
you drive over there and check about the batteries <br />
it's a long walk. <br />
 <br />
I was in a car dealership a while ago, when a large <br />
motor home was towed into <br />
the garage.  The front of the vehicle was in dire <br />
need of repair and the <br />
whole thing generally looked like an extra in <br />
Twister&quot;.  I asked the manager <br />
what had happened.  He told me that the driver had <br />
set the &quot;cruise control&quot; <br />
and then went in the back to make a sandwich.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin Rainbow</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that always got to me, was when questioning stuff like this, someone has the nerve to say &quot;You can't blame them, they are only making 5 bucks an hour&quot; or &quot;Their just kids&quot;<br />
<br />
Excuse me, but when I was a kid, I could add and subtract and etc, and when I was a kid and held a job, I was expected to do a good job, no matter what I made an hour. I remember holding a summer job at an Army Nat'l Guard camp making 3.35 an hour. I was expected to be on time, to do my job correctly, and to act as an adult. What changed?<br />
<br />
It almost seems as if mankind is on it's downward spiral to extinction from stupidity and greed.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I will just ride this ride and see where it takes me I guess. I feel confident I can 99% of the time stay alive due to my intelligence, barring natural causes, it's just that 1% that worries me sometimes, when you see some idiot driving 75mph and about a foot from your rear bumper.:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder who that was directed at :)<br />
<br />
Being underpaid. That's not their fault. Being products of a decaying school system. That's not their fault. Being horrible little f***in' punks who'll spit in your food just because. That's them. The difference may be subtle to some but it's still there :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While these stories sound like urban myths I've no doubt remarkably similar situations have happened.<br />
<br />
Tosh, I think most of spitting in people's food is also an urban legend. I'm sure it happens, but after working in restaurants for 3 years in high school and my friends all working in restaurants nobody has ever, EVER spit in food.  It's generally regarded as something you don't do to someone no matter how mad you are.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Samin we had to be able to do lower math.  You had to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.<br />
<br />
As far as these people making 5 bucks an hour?  Hell McDonald's is paying 7.50 and hour, like most other fast food places around here.  Kids won't work for min wage in alot of places, of course mommy and daddy have alot of money may influence this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do that sometimes late at night when I want to get a fresh burger from the fast food joint.  Only way for you to get something that isn't stuck under the heat lamp is to ask for a special order sandwich and verify it right there at the drive thru.  Then I'd order the ketsup later.<br />
<br />
This btw, is the best way to get fresh fries.  I want to order fries no salt.  Get home, put the salt on and bring out the miracle whip.</div></div><hr />

If somebody pissed me off, I'd either A) drop their burger on the floor and wipe the floor with it before putting it on a bun, or B) spit in it.<br />
<br />
There was one great one though. Some jerk came through and ordered a burger with extra extra extra sauce. So I tore out the middle of the bun and just filled it completely with mayo. I could barely get the thing together there was so much may in it. Had to gingerly put it in the bag so it didn't spew out the sides. I don't ever rememeber seeing that guy come back again. hehehe<br />
<br />
Also, its not necessarily that people are too stupid to understand your order. Its one of 2 things: Too rushed to pay that much attention to detail (yeah, I know, lame...) or they just don't give a rat's ass.<br />

I still hate customers, no matter what I'm doing. And for the record, that was like 8 years ago. I work in the IT industry now :)</div></div><hr />

No way dude. Wendy's ain't bad, but they will never match up to Jack. Especially since Dave Thomas ain't around anymore. Didn't you see that triple unltimate cheeseburger they were selling? How can you top that? I cower in fear when I think of trying to eat a whole one. All Wendy's has is Chili. And I think we all know how that's made....</div></div><hr />

What you claim to have done while working there is one of the more disturbing things I have seen admitted to here and I have to be honest when I say I hope there are not many others out there who find that acceptable to do. Has it occured to you that if you hate dealing with customers so much you should pursue a field where you will not have to deal with them?<br />

I can honestly say I think you would be VERY surprised by the amount of Fun I have had and do have in my life. Even before I had such Strong Faith, and ethics, I do not think I would have found this funny, even the mayo thing. <br />
<br />
Now let me explain please. In my Fraternity for example, I have been a part of some GREAT practical jokes that I am sure even you would be impressed with. The difference was that I knew the people and there was an exchange of jokes and an understanding that they would happen.  In Screeling's story, there is a man who is paying for his food and a service, and expecting to receive what he wants in a form that has not been messed with. That man was not expecting to be the target of a joke, and really was not fair to have done so to him. I know how I would have felt if I paid for food and was given something that was made with so little care for how it turned out and disrespect for me as a customer.<br />
<br />
Second, Screeling is being paid to do a job. He had agreed with his employer that he would do a certain set of tasks (including preparing food for the customers that would make the restaurant look good, and make the customer happy), and the company would pay him. He got paid (the employer's end of the bargain) without doing either of his tasks (his end of the bargain).<br />
<br />
Just my opinion of course, but like I said, I can and do have lots of fun, some I am sure you would be surprised about, I just do not see ANY aspect of that as funny. /shrug<br />

Which is why I'm ALWAYS nice to people preparing/serving my food, even if I don't particularly care for them at the moment. Probably 99 of 100 people in fast food don't like their job and I think its healthy to keep that in perspective, lest your food be tainted by a disgruntled worker.</div></div><hr />

There's something to be said for behaving like this with anyone, not just folks in the food service.<br />

Try just ordering from the menu without having something added and/or something taken off.  If you want something different get off your lazy butt and make it in your own kitchen.  Sheesh.<br />

Except for the fact that Burger King SPECIFICALLY advertises that customers SHOULD make special orders, yet they STILL get it wrong. Can't tell people to do something and then complain when they do what you told them to. If you want to have a job and make money get off your lazy butt and do what you're paid to do. Sheesh. Maybe it really IS the young people who are getting lazy and expect the world to be handed to them on a silver platter rather than actually earning their keep.<br />

Cops drinks did get spit in, i never saw anyone else's food messed with.<br />
<br />
As for the coming up and ordering a number 2 super sized with a coke thats easy to answer.  After standing in front of a machine for 8 hours you get in a sort of grove and dont really listen to what the person says anymore. Half the people are morons and have to be asked numerous questions about their order.  I just gave everyone what number? do you want anything special on the sandwhich? what size? what drink? what else?  <br />
<br />
If i didnt do this id get all sorts of wierd stuff..<br />
&quot;uhhhh let me get a numberrrrrr uhhhhhh 4, yeah a 4 with  a drink&quot;  <br />
<br />
 &quot;what type of drink&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah a 4 with a drink  how much?&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;no what type of drink do you want?&quot;    <br />
<br />
&quot;ohh what type...yeah let me get...aaaaa.....ummm....coke..........................wait! you got dr pepper?<br />
<br />
&quot;yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah make it a dr pepper&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;that all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;$4.62 second window&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey could you make it no onions on that sandwhich&quot; or &quot;oh hey can i get that super sized? &quot; or &quot;oh hey make that onion rings in stead of fries&quot; or &quot;how much are you desserts, can i add one of them?&quot; etc etc etc<br />
<br />
It never failed.  Also people come up and order a cheese burger plain but double chease add mayo and heavy mustard on two bottom buns.  But this is how they order it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aight i want a cheese burger, with no kethup, heavy mustard, no pickles,  and (speaks to someone else in the car) heavy onions (other voice in the car yells nooo) wait never mind (to other voice in the car what then)  (other voice i want a cheese burger plain with no lettuce heavy mustard add mayo and double cheese)   ok ok scrath that what i really need is a cheese burger with no lettuce heavy mustard  (to voice what else?) aight mayo on that double the cheese  ( and make it two bottom buns)  oh and can you make it two bottome buns. <br />
<br />
so thats a....read it back<br />
<br />
yeah<br />
<br />
ok its $5.42<br />
<br />
$5.42?!?! how much is it for extra cheese?<br />
<br />
Its 50 cents for extra cheese<br />
<br />
No no thats too much you better take the extra cheese off <br />
<br />
<br />
And then when the order is not whatever the hell it was supposed to be they will complain.<br />
<br />
<br />
After having worked at a fast food place i have much more sympathy for all fast food employees, i was just doing it for summer money and could quit whenever i wanted to.  Some people are doing it to feed there families and have to put up with stuff like that every day, dont be ruff on em.  Make it simple.<br />

Chees burger plain= i want a cheese burger with only cheese on it.   That should not get screwed up.</div></div><hr />

A year later, I started working at the A&amp;W in town because my car died. I worked there until I graduated from high school, and on every school break until I was about 21.<br />
<br />
The great thing about the A&amp;W was the regular customers. It is a very small town, and you don't see a lot of strangers. We had one old couple who came about three nights a week, and we'd start cooking their order when we saw their car. The town cops had their coffee there every afternoon. Some of the women who worked the day shift had been there for 20 years or more. For a fast food job is wasn't half bad.<br />
<br />
I happen to know that it IS possible to give people good service at a fast food place. True, they do sometimes make their order so confusing you have no idea whether you're going to get it right or not, but that's no excuse for vandalizing their food, or failing to smile at them. It's a lot easier to keep a customer happy if you appear happy to serve them, even if you screwed up their order.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and every one of em ate at my store. I did it. It's my fault. Gotta love sarcasm, don'y ya.<br />

Seriously though, my working there was 2-3 years after that whole SNAFU. That was also caused by Jack not cooking his burgers longer or hot enough from what I understand. Not from irritated high school students.</div></div><hr />

I wanted a breakfast burrito, so I looked at the combo board, and they had a combo that was 1 Breakfast Burrito, 1 Hash Brown and 1 Medium Coffee for $2.49.  I thought it was a good deal, til I noticed something.  On the other parts of the menu board, A Breakfast Burrito was $.99, a Hash Brown was $.69, and a medium coffee was $.69.<br />
<br />
I thought ok.... and ordered the items individually.  For the next 5 minutes or so, the young lady on the speaker tried to argue with me that I would save money if I ordered the combo (I didn't care about the extra 12 cents, but wanted to bring this stupid cirumstance to someone's attention). No matter how I tried to explain to her, she said, no , but you save money with the combo.  I finally get my order, paying $2.37 plus tax.  I grab my receipt, and immediately leave the window, get back in line for the drive-through, and order the combo (yes i really, really wanted to prove my point hehe).  I pay, and when i get my receipt, I hand her the first one and ask her to tell me which one was cheaper, the combo or the individual items.  She hands the receipts back to me and says: &quot;Well, the total is less, but you still save money on the combo.&quot;  I gave up.</div></div><hr />

I'll just smile and slap the &quot;Extra Cheese&quot; button once with the hamburger, which actually costs equal to/slightly more than a cheeseburger.<br />

<br />
I work in a Burger King.  I've worked there for 2 years so far, and know how to do pretty much everything there (except the managerial stuff; this is a franchise and they treat their managers poorly; they've almost got a higher manager turnover rate than employee turnover rate).  In my time I've served on the Drive Thru headset.<br />
<br />
Me : Thank you for choosing Burger King.  Would you like to try a Value Meal today?<br />
Customer : No thanks, I'll take a Number Four.<br />
<br />
Umm . . . ok . . . so people don't listen to me when I'm on the headset, other than to make note of the fact that someone is there to take the order.<br />
<br />
I usually work boards, making the sandwiches.  I've seen people order hamburgers, only ketsup, mustard, and pickle.  I've seen people order cheeseburgers the same way.  Funny thing is, thats how they're made normally.  I've seen people order hamburgers, no mustard or pickle; and when I circle the ketsup symbol on the wrapper, I've seen the person handing the food out get confused, asking me where the hamburger no mustard or pickle is.<br />
<br />
My point is that its not one side of the equation thats the problem.  Its both sides.  I know I'm not the smartest person on Earth; but I'm one of the smarter people working at the Burger King I work at.  I work with some people who are downright dumb.  Speaking about one person in particular, I've said that the only thing impressive about him is the magnitude of his stupidity.  I wish I was joking; but I've said this in front of him and he didn't even understand the degree to which I was insulting him.  I've also seen some truly idiotic customers.  Why do drive through customers go up to the speaker, start making a lot of noise (&quot;Hello?  Anyone there?  Hello?&quot; etc until they get a response) and then when asked what they want, say they need a minute to decide what they want?  Why do people think that we'd be intimidated by someone's calling and complaining that their order was wrong, and asking for the district manager's number, and the customer not even having the reciept that we give out taped to the bag?  First thing the district manager's going to ask is if the customer has the reciept.  My manager is quite happy to give out the number for the office in such cases; to let the office tell the customer to go away.  Another question.  Why do people drive up to the speaker and ask whats for sale?  Are customers too lazy to read the menu board?  If so, why even put a menu board out there?<br />
<br />
BTW, I've heard of nastier things to do to someone's food than just wipe it on the floor, or spit in it.  My cousin worked in the Chateau on Mount Camelback (Pennsylvania) and she's told me some of the things they did to nasty customers.  However, the worst I've seen, done, or heard of being done at the Burger King I work at is exaggeration.  Order light anything, barely get any.  Order extra, get a lot more than you probably wanted.  I've gotten complaints about that once or twice (heavy mayo on a chicken sandwich, extra extra pickle on a whopper) and I've gotten complimented on it (one guy said, about his double cheeseburger add onion, extra onion, that it was the &quot;best damn sandwich&quot; he's ever had).  However, from what I've heard from my cousin, and what she's done and seen done, I have to agree : don't annoy your food preparation workers when you go to a restraunt.  You literally don't know what they can put into your food or drink that you won't taste, smell, or otherwise tell is in there, but can still mess you up (such as making you sit on the toilet for a couple hours).</div></div><hr />

Special implies its not a normal item or price.  Everything a store sells is on sale, even if its not on special.<br />

Here's another question.  Why do people have a hard time believing me when I say that &quot;double bacon cheeseburger&quot; and &quot;bacon double cheeseburger&quot; are two different things?  Double bacon cheeseburger is a bacon cheeseburger with double the bacon of a normal bacon cheeseburger.  Bacon double cheeseburger is a double cheeseburger with bacon on it.  Is it so hard to understand that the position of the words in the name of the sandwich determine what gets &quot;double&quot; and what does not?</div></div><hr />

Fact of life.  Only the dumb things get remembered by most people.  Only makes sense then that only the dumb people get remembered.  <br />
<br />
Obviously thats not a 100 percent true statement; plenty of people who were downright genius are remembered by history.  But it sure seems like its a true statement!  When's the last time you got complimented by your boss?  When's the last time he (or she) chewed you out because of something dumb you did?</div></div><hr />

Here's another question.  Why do people have a hard time believing me when I say that &quot;double bacon cheeseburger&quot; and &quot;bacon double cheeseburger&quot; are two different things?  Double bacon cheeseburger is a bacon cheeseburger with double the bacon of a normal bacon cheeseburger.  Bacon double cheeseburger is a double cheeseburger with bacon on it.  Is it so hard to understand that the position of the words in the name of the sandwich determine what gets &quot;double&quot; and what does not?[/QUOTE]<br />
Bugs me too, but I've learned that since they really don't care, the onus is on me to communicate effectively, especially since they serve plenty of idiots who will use 'double bacon cheeseburger' and 'bacon double cheeseburger' to mean the same thing. If you say 'Bacon cheeseburger, double the bacon please' you generally circumvent their idiocy.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but sometimes even that fails. The last time I was at Wendy's, I asked for a &quot;Jr. Cheeseburger Deluxe, no catsup or mustard&quot; Simple enough, right? Straight off the 'value' menu, just minus catsup and mustard.<br />
<br />
I get home, it has no catsup or mustard on it, alright, but it also has no mayo, tomato, or lettuce. Needless to say, a return trip to the Wendy's resulted in a new burger.</div></div><hr />

I disbelieve.  Unless laws in Arizona are radically different than in the rest of the nation, DNA testing everyone at a fast food restarurant would, besides being expensive, be an unlawful invasion of privacy.  That officer would have to show probable cause against a specific individual to be allowed to DNA test them.<br />
<br />
Of course, you do have legal open carry laws on firearms in arizona, so the laws may indeed be different there :-)<br />

Good story and worth a chuckle regardless if it's true or not :-)<br />

<br />
Just so.  In Illinois or Ohio at least, he would have to have probable cause against a specific individual, not just &quot;someone in this restaurant&quot;  In short, he would need a material witness to testify (via deposition at least) before a judge would allow a DNA test.<br />

I certainly cant walk down the street in Ohio or Illinois with a pistol belt, even in plain sight..  Even rifles have to be dissasembled for transport, and even then not be in the passenger compartment of the vehicle.  Assembled weapons can only be legally accessed in your home, on a gun range or in an approved hunting area.  Enforcement of hunting weapons is lax, but I cant even chase a burglar out of my house and still have my gun on me as i exit my front door legally.  My open gun rights end at my doorstep.<br />
<br />
I am not a gun owner, but I am just anal enough to read laws when i move into a new state :-)<br />

EATERY WORKER ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY BLOWING NOSE IN OFFICER'S BURGER<br />
By Abraham Kwok<br />
<br />
A 20-year-old fast-food worker has been arrested after he allegedly blew his nose into a hamburger that he served to a Phoenix police officer and then laughed about it. <br />
<br />
George J. Kuehme, who had been on the job for less than a week, reportedly told a co-worker, ''That's what the cop gets'' as he tainted the food, police said. <br />
<br />
Kuehme, of the 2400 block of East Willetta Street, was accused by police of aggravated assault, adding a harmful substance to food and disorderly conduct. He was being held at a Maricopa County jail in lieu of $3,425 bail. <br />
<br />
''This is like pulling a gun on an officer,'' said Sgt. Kevin Robinson, a Phoenix police spokesman. ''He intentionally tried to injure or provoke the officer.'' <br />
<br />
Kuehme, who declined to be interviewed Tuesday, would face up to 45 months in prison if he were charged formally and convicted of the two felonies and one misdemeanor police are recommending to prosecutors. <br />
<br />
The incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. Monday when Officers Gary Underhill and David Duron placed an order at the drive-through window at Jack in the Box, 1001 N. 24th St., police said. <br />
<br />
The officers left with their food, responded to a forgery call then sat down to their meals, police said. <br />
<br />
Underhill reportedly took three bites into his hamburger when he noticed ''nasal mucus'' on his hands and face, according to Officer Leo Speliopoulos, a police spokesman. <br />
<br />
''It was a repugnant act,'' Speliopoulos said. <br />
<br />
Underhill and Duron returned to the restaurant and spoke to the shift manager, Aaron Gulsarry, who confronted Kuehme, police said. <br />
<br />
Kuehme reportedly admitted the prank but offered no reason for his action, authorities said. He was immediately fired by Gulsarry. <br />
<br />
''We are shocked and horrified at the information reported by the officer,'' said Jan McLane Rieger, a spokeswoman at Jack in the Box corporate headquarters in San Diego. <br />
<br />
The restaurant closed early Monday night as a result of ''the commotion'' caused by the arrest, she said. <br />
<br />
Underhill complained of stomach pains after the meal and expressed concern about catching communicable diseases, Duron wrote in his report. <br />
<br />
Underhill, however, required no medical treatment.</div></div><hr />

This is a true story from the Word Perfect Helpline which was transcribed from a recording monitoring the customer care department. Needless to say the HelpDesk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing the Word Perfect organization for &quot;Termination without Cause.&quot; <br />
<br />
Below is the actual dialogue<br />
(Now I know why they record these conversations)! <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ridge Hall computer assistance; may I help you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of trouble?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Went away?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They disappeared.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I tell?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a sea-prompt?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind, can you move your cursor around the screen?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a monitor?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't reach.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle -- it's because it's dark.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, -the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Why not?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Because there's a power failure.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A power... A power failure? Aha, Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm afraid it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer.&quot; <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alexzander</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stand corrected... here are the stellas I pulled that from... it mentions a jury (the rest is a good read too):<br />
<br />
Candidates for the Stella Award <br />
<br />
It's time once again to consider the candidates for the annual Stella Awards. <br />
<br />
The Stella's are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella awards for the most frivolous successful lawsuits in the United States. The following are this year's candidates: <br />
<br />
1.Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son. <br />
<br />
2.A 19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub caps. <br />
<br />
3.Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr.Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of $500,000. <br />
<br />
4.Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun. <br />
<br />
5.A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument. <br />
<br />
6.Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses. <br />
<br />
7.This year's favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.</div></div><hr />

The McDonald's Coffee Case<br />
Sorting through fact and fiction....<br />
<br />
Myth: An opportunistic old woman launched a frivolous lawsuit when she spilled her McDonald's coffee on her lap.<br />
<br />
Truth: Lieback was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's car holding a coffee after purchasing it from a drive-through window of a McDonald's. When she opened the lid to add cream and sugar, she spilled the coffee. <br />
<br />
The simple accident caused third-degree burns on more than 6 percent of her body. She was treated in a hospital for a week. McDonald's served coffee 20 or so degrees hotter than the industry standard. The woman, Stella Liebeck, underwent numerous skin-graft surgeries as a result of her third-degree coffee burns to her thighs and groin area. She had permanent scarring on more than 16 percent of her body.<br />
<br />
McDonald's had already ignored more than 700 similar claims of coffee burns, many involving children. The company even ignored a request from the Shriner's Burn Institute in Cincinnati to turn down its coffee.<br />
<br />
McDonald's refused to pay the then 79-year-old woman's initial medical expenses totaling $11,000. McDonald's actually countered with an offer of $800. And they also refused to turn down the heat on their coffee. Left with $20,000 unpaid bills, she finally hired a lawyer.<br />
<br />
A mediator later recommended the parties settle for $225,000. Again, McDonald's refused and the case went to trial.<br />
<br />
McDonald's representatives lied to the court and jury about the existence of other claims. A jury reduced the original verdict of $200,000 to $160,000 for contributory negligence - Liebeck spilled it on herself.<br />
<br />
Based on McDonald's annual profits of more than $1 billion annually, and more than $1.3 million gross daily coffee sales, the jury levied two days of coffee sales receipts as punitive damages for a punitive damage award of $2.7 million.<br />
<br />
A judge later reduced the $2.7 million jury award to $480,000. McDonald's later settled the case for an undisclosed amount, requesting the deal be kept sealed. Most major newspapers ignored the judge's reduction and the final outcome of the case.<br />
<br />
Punitive damage awards are not currently allowed under Washington law. Juries undoubtedly return verdicts when faced with a large corporate defendant who has ignored reasonable pleas to resolve such situations or grievances. <br />
<br />
In this case, McDonald's simply refused to turn down the heat, so the jury turned it up on McDonald's.</div></div><hr />

This is a story regarding DNA testing on a cop who had his food spit on.  It takes place in Pittsburg, so i don't think it is the same one I heard about locally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finduillas Pala</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote from excerpted article:<br />
-----------------<br />
Aaron said Arbuckle let investigators swab his mouth to obtain a sample of his genetic makeup. Arbuckle's DNA then was matched to the spittle found on Trooper Robert Manno's burger.<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
OK- first- the bonehead allowed himself to be DNA tested.  He didnt raise the issue of privacy at all, the silly person.  Second, the rest of the article doesnt include anything about DNA testing the whole restaurant.<br />
<br />
So- Thanks for another chuckle- another funny story about a silly person!  <br />
But I still disbelieve that at any fast food restaurant anywhere in america in recent memory had a police officer force the entire, unwilling work staff to undergo DNA testing in order to locate an unnamed, unwitnessed spitter as stated in the original post.<br />
It's really not a big deal though :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RatGuy</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I can relate to the operators frustration in the Word Perfect thing, even if it isn't real.  I work in IT as a consultant for a software company and have to answer customer enquiries all the time.  <br />
<br />
I've had system administrators ask me how to download a file from the internet.  It didn't occur to them to click on the Download button on the screen.<br />
<br />
We had one user call us and say that our product wasn't working on their machine.  The IT department of the customer couldn't help her either.  They didn't know what was wrong.  After lengthy questioning we found out that there had been a power cut during the night and her computer was turned off because of it.  She had never turn the computer on or off before.  What's more worrying is that you could see her machine from the IT department.  Surely, if they glanced over they would have seen the black monitor.  To complecate matters, when we were asking her to turn the computer on she was pushing the power button on the monitor.  She thought the CPU was provided so that women wouldn't have to bend over to pick their handbags up off the floor.<br />
<br />
I've had one person tell me that the steps in our manual didn't make sence.  They went from step 3 to step 7.  They were only reading the right hand page of the manual and ignoring the left.<br />
<br />
I have seen messages come up on screens that say &quot;Do you wish to delete this job?&quot;  The only option you have is &quot;OK&quot;.  That programmer didn't last very long for some reason.<br />
<br />
During the Y2K bug fixes I had someone ask me during the upgrade, &quot;Why are you copying files onto the computer?  Don't you need some bug spray?&quot;  I looked at the person thinking this was a bad joke.  To my amazement, they were serious.<br />
<br />
I've seen a consultant delete all administration access to servers and they wonder why they can't do anything when they reboot them.<br />
<br />
This is just the top of the iceburg.  I fully expect someone to call me up oneday and ask me why they can't see the screen only to find that they have been using white out to correct the mistakes.  Why this one?  Because I have had the urban myth question about the coffee despenser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finduillas Pala</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite IT call from when I was taking calls:<br />
<br />
Customer in Florida calls me on monday morning to say that all of the machines in her office are &quot;going haywire&quot;.  They are turning themselves off and on.  After doing some OS and Hardware toubleshooting, I ask her to restart one of the machines so I can see what happens when it boots.<br />
<br />
So we have a couple of minutes of dead air, and in good customer service fashion, I filled up the space by asking her what the weather was like.  She said it was raining.  Raining a lot.  It rained so much that this office flooded and all of these computers were underwater all weekend.  We've dried them out with hairdryers and now it's time to get them working again.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds pause, I stood up and repeated what she said, ostensibly to verify that I heard her correctly, but really to let the department in on the joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to do support on a software designed to run Windows on a Macintosh. We got one call from a guy who was complaining that it wouldn't install. We went through the system requirements and his computer met them. After a lot of quizzing we found out nothing was happening on his computer.<br />
<br />
Finally he admited he lived in a cabin where there is NO POWER. Since his Mac wouldn't run, he bought our product to make Windows run on it instead. He actually threatened to sue us because nowhere on the system requirements did it state electricity was required.</div></div><hr />

I will now relate my favorite support story, since it's just wrong on multiple levels.<br />
<br />
Responding to a call about a dead monitor, I called the director and learned that she had called about once a month for the same thing, for the past 3 months.  Sure enough, when I looked over her records, she had been through 2 other monitors very recently.  Since they were all under warranty, I thought this was worthy of investigation.<br />
<br />
When I arrived at her desk, I checked the usual culprits - power and signal cables, video card output, etc. - all checked as normal.  When I moved to the monitor itself, I noticed a brownish circle on top, right over the vents.  When I moved the monitor, preparatory to shipping it back to the factory for repair, I found drops of water underneath it.  &quot;Aha!&quot; I exclaimed to the director.  &quot;Here's the trouble - your monitor's got water in it.&quot;  When I checked the ceiling to see if perhaps a leak was coming through, I didn't find anything.  Not seeing anything else in the office that could be a source for the water, I installed the spare monitor I brought with me, and took the dead one back to my office to pack it for shipping.<br />
<br />
I decided to go back the next day, to see how the director's spare was doing, and inadvertently solved the problem.  The director was away at a meeting, but her fairly new secretary was getting ready to water the plant sitting on top of the newly-installed spare monitor.<br />
<br />
After explaining to the secretary that watering a plant on top of any electronic equipment is a bad idea, both for the equipment and potentially the waterer, I made an additional observation: perhaps watering an artificial plant wasn't the best use of her time, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn Veryien</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the Snopes reference: They mention some other famous &quot;myths&quot; there except the one about customers putting floppy disks on the side of a filing cabinet with a magnet is true.<br />
<br />
I used to go out after class in 1982 with the instructor I had who was teaching a computer course at San Antonio College. Several of us went to a bar one evening and he shook his head and explained that on that very morning he had finally figured out why one of his customers kept losing data. Now this instructor was, at that time, selling customized TRS-80 installations with business software he had written to small businesses. This one business consistently kept losing data. He even wrote a program to walk the 8 inch floppies sector by sector to retrieve the data. This particular shop was actually owned by a personal friend of his too so it bugged him that something was wrong. He had even replaced the floppy drives twice so far but found no defects with the drives.<br />
<br />
On this day he went in to see what was wrong yet again and his friend did not meet him as usual since he was busy with a customer. He asked the secretary where the bad disk was and she walked to the filing cabinet, pulled it down from the side, and handed it to him.<br />
<br />
He didn't get upset and this was at a time when people really were new to computers so he explained that she should not do that, should not store disks under the phone (ringer magnet) and some other tips. He recovered as much data as he could again and never saw the problem happen after that.<br />
<br />
Given that it was 1982, none of us there really felt the shop owner or the secretary (either one) were particularly &quot;dumb&quot; for what they had done. They were just ignorant of what floppy disks were and how they stored data.</div></div><hr />
