<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember hearing that FV has trival loot code on it, but to compensate for that, very little is no drop. My question is this; What kind of things are no drop? I know a regular servers after a certain level pratically every thing is nodrop.<br />

(question make since? Its late, I am tired and it was ONE of those days)  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">epics, newbie notes and keys to : veeshans peak, Sleepers and vex tall.  the no drop keys where implemented a few patches ago.  And yes TLC i active, this means if anyonein your group does not get XP and the item is lore or magic it will disappear (unless its no drop ie iksar tear for our epic)<br />
<br />
but as a resident of FV dont take this as a perfect place to go and buy anythign you want and such, the envirornment is very ... unique though i have come to truely enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thraall hit the majority of stuff that is no drop.<br />
<br />
Unique thats to say the least &lt;smiles&gt; come enjoy learn to love it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So let get this straight? High end stuff like dragon drops, planes gear, ST, and end game Lucin mobs are not no drop? That sounds cool. Although this one line sounds ominous.  the envirornment is very ... unique though i have come to truely enjoy it.  Sounds like weird server politics?  Anyways, I was just wondering. I had played on FV briefly when it first came online and had fun, but I have long since quit EQ.  I was just feeling nostalgic and day dreaming about maybe start playing again.<br />
