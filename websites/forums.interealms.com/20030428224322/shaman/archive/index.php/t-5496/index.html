<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You cant recharge them.  When you use all 10 charges the potion will poof and you will need to buy a new 10 charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ooops i mean recharge thru vendor. maybe it's one of those lil tricks that some people dont know. first you sell a fully charged item to a vendor and then sell him an item with 1 or no charge left. then when u buy both back from the vendor they are both fully charged. for some items it may be cost effective to do that that to make brand new ones. also its good to recharge rare items like res staff, bind locket</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I know this can't be done with alchemy potions.  Whether it was cost effective or not depends on how much the vendor charges for you to buy the potion back.   Gate potions cost 168pp per charge, and if the vendor charges more than this for you to buy back the potion, you may as well buy new potions.  By the way, if this did work, you could only do it with potions that have 1 or more doses left, since the item is expendable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zionak Maliseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this little programming bug does exist.  I talked with a GM about 4 days ago and he said that this is a known bug that the programmers have not figured out how to fix.</div></div><hr />
