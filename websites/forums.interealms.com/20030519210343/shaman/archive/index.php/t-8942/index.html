<br />
almost done with epic (stupid tear!) and awaiting an MQ of tov arms, so anyone have advice for the rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is my advice. <br />
<br />
Why? Because it is all stuff you can do yourself. The only guild participation would be on 8th shawl battle which doesn't require a lot of people, Giant Captain in WW and possibly Juggs although a duo/solo *can* do these for undead dragon sinew. Painful faction work and yes farming but very doable...<br />
<br />
This is all gear that you can either buy or get yourself. I care mostly about HP and am not a fashion freak so take this with an ounce of salt as you might not like the look. Although the arms match Vindi BP colour!<br />
<br />
Left Finger<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
<br />
Liquid metal (rare drop off of Golems in PoV..not that hard to get if you have Castle camps)<br />
<br />
Right Finger <br />
<br />
Regal Band of Bathezid<br />
<br />
Can do this alone solo...very easily..bottleneck is Angry Goblin but the warlord spawn is a chump solo.<br />
<br />
Left Wrist <br />
<br />
Spirit Wrapped Cord<br />
<br />
Bottleneck is HS mob :( but again doable if you check at the right times...<br />
<br />
Right Wrist <br />
<br />
Bracelet of Fortitude<br />
<br />
Can camp or buy it for 5-10k depending on server<br />
<br />
Shoulders <br />
<br />
8th Shawl<br />
<br />
Can do all of this except the final battle...But some nice drops for those who help...<br />
<br />
Range <br />
<br />
Talsiman of Benevolence<br />
<br />
Can do this with 4 people and ally to CoV. Shaman/Cleric and Warrior/Rogue<br />
<br />
Hands <br />
<br />
Shissar Scaled Gauntles<br />
<br />
Easy camp solo or can buy for 1-3k depending on server...<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
<br />
Hardened Gray Flesh Sleeves<br />
<br />
Can camp or buy for about 5-8k depending on server...<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on this you would net the following stats:<br />
<br />
45 Stamina (135hp)<br />
273 HP Directly<br />
<br />
So a net of about 411HP with no real AC loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, I am working on the dizok signet of service myself, currently farming for chardok faction while raising my twink through levels 27 and up. She's now 35, I am still threateningly. Sigh. Looking forward to 40 when she can group with me and I can just mow mobs down rather than handing them to her one by one.<br />
<br />
So the warlord is easy solo? I was thinking of doing him solo, wasn't sure if I could since he's level 57 with a 1k harmtouch. But I guess sending in spirit dogs and then loading up all my dots on him would work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes he is very easy...1k HT is not much. He is also rootable and does not summon.</div></div><hr />
