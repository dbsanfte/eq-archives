<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at 60 now and was really wondering where the best places are to solo or duo. I run a Ranger and Druid and want to level my Ranger in AA xp for EQ and AM naturally =) Big Surprise eh?<br />
<br />
Now with PoP out I'm thinking just doing my best to get to class skills and then maybe go 50/50 working towards them while also leveling to 65.<br />
<br />
When duoing where can I go if I decide to stay at 60 for a while. I hear people talk about gaining 2 and 3% AA at certain spots etc... I'm getting 1% every kill now with sol b spiders but there must be better spots.<br />
<br />
Some people closely guard this information I guess =/ but any guidance would greatly be appreciated. Spots I've heard of are FG but to me it seems much slower as compared to sol b spiders. I havn't tried Velks yet. Whats the percent at velks?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance folks =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UsuRpeR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply Glail, I'll try that out. Guess this info really is kept secrets =) Only one reply ugg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, stuff on AA hunting is all over the boards, so people are probably not bothering to respond again. I have no idea where the best places are, but the obvious choices are Seb, VL, Chardok, HS, FG, and maybe the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FG shrooms has been 2/5 to 1/2 an AA point per cast of C3 for me, depending on whether I get eyepatch or enchanter haste, using epics.  I'd recommend getting disease resistance to 150 or higher to eliminate slows and stuns and cut down on the illusions.  Tarmok Tribal Headband has 20 DR and Gloves of Fungal Flesh has 25 DR for starters, and shaman Talisman of Epuration will add another 55 DR (lasts as long as C3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eldarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FG is great for solo/duo AAXP.<br />
If you can pump your DIS resist to 140 at level 60 you will not get slowed - no need to go any higher than that.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I would recommend the search function :) not trying to be an ass but there are at least 40 threads with the exact same title as this one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ayochak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have friends that can port &amp; good CoV faction, go solo Velium hounds in WW, just 1% a kill but furs (2 drops for 5 wolves) can be sold for about 1k each...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always favored velks for soloing mostly due to the fact that that spiders dont cast any crap on you like slows, nukes etc, and all spiders except nameds are quite easy to chop down.<br />
<br />
And another reason, make thurg gate potions, and then you can get kei at bazaar and gate down fast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're duoing, might I offer another suggestion?<br />
<br />
Duo with a nec, and ping/pong the mobs in PoN.  Make sure the nec maintains aggro, you snare but otherwise do nothing but melee.  Nec fears, and the mob runs away, with you and the nec's pet in tow.  Fear wears off, the mob runs back to the nec, who will fear it again when it gets close.<br />
<br />
I forget which mobs we did this on, but it did not work on the treants for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Siren's Grotto has some great spots....I've done it with a cleric but I'm sure druid would work well also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was gonna say 'It takes 2 1/2 hours to get 1/2 a blue worth of AA there?' but then I read it again and thought, 'Ohhhhh, I'm an ass'.<br />
<br />
But I do have a question. Pumping resists up, how ya think normal XP solo would be there at 56?<br />
<br />
I've got ye old pocket 56 cleric that I leave ungrouped so I get all the XP (yep yep, I'm a greedy little xp h00r, but I also started Dranex in Sep 1999 and I'm only 56 yet). <br />
<br />
Or, if I left the cleric grouped (can't go wrong getting better buffs / heals really) would it still be good, fast XP? Can slow with swarmy, and MoK off the clerics BP, regen health off the clerics pants. Really dying to get 60 :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Edit - make that really dying to get 65, I'm figuring levels then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Severance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only problem with FG at 56 is not being able to pull singles, so be careful in there =)<br />
I probably say Chardok is good for you, if ever your cleric gets low on the mana front just make sure you pull a wolf to fear kite while he meds up.<br />
Other than there, pulling the centi's in Akheva should be ok, just need to watch the patrollers.<br />
Hope that vaguely helps hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep, no way you can do FG shrooms at 56 with a single healer, you'll be paste. Can't root-park them.<br />
<br />
Best places for you to exp are probably:<br />
<br />
VL Spiders, if you can find enough to keep busy.<br />
<br />
Chardok entrance tunnel, you can fear kite the Chokidai to save healing.<br />
<br />
Hole entrance might still be decent exp for you, due to the high zone exp modifier.</div></div><hr />
