<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SchonFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to start my Spear of Fate quest although I'd like to fina a nice little walk thru. I know of the one found at Casters Realm but was curious if there were other views on the processes.<br />
<br />
Also, being the beautiful troll that I am.. how do I pull off running around freeport without having to kill a million orcs?.. unless of course there is a different way....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">guess ill be the one who says it but u could also bribe a druid like 1pp for example to help u w/ wolf form till u get to the drunk than drop doggie form and recast till u get to the inn to talk to the spirit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a very quick run to the drunk, even with the 3 zones. You've got a very high chance of making it unscathed.<br />
<br />
And it's an even quicker run to the inn if you know where you're going. The trick is to scout it out in advance or have a good map and not wait for the drunk to walk there so slowly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've heard of short cuts to the shammy epic, I don't really plan on doing them as I like the storyline and don't think the quest is all that hard to begin with.  But I am in a less than uber guild and if there are any big fights that I have trouble with.  Wouldnt be bad to know a way around them.<br />
<br />
So what are these rumored shortcuts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SchonFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds like good fun... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you only are concerned about getting to North Freeport and could care less about teh boat and other shops than help a pally or two kill Lucan.  You will be hated by the guards but folks in N Freeport (the paladins) will love you.<br />
