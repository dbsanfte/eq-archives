<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all - thanks for all the help in the past.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if we shaman get any lower level disease slows or are all of out slows magic based until 61 (or always?) I am going to plane of hate tonight, and have been trying to prepare, as it will be my first time.  <br />
<br />
So - i can't tell from alla's list which slow's are magic based, and which are disease based.  So if I can get an answer to this it would be much appreciatede.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Janribet</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We get 2 disease slows. Plague of insects at 54 (25 %) and Cloud of Grummus (40 %) at either 61 or 62 just cant remember atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yah, and the usefulness of each of them isn't high.  There's a few select boss mob fights that require that slow.  There's a few mob types that do better with that type of slow for resistance reasons.  That's bout it. <br />
However, the price is right.  Both spells are very low dollar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We get Cloud of Grummus at 61. And I find their usefulness pretty good, personally. When I bounce Turgur's, I can hit the mob with Grummus and slow it so the MT doesn't get beat to a pulp. That gives me some time to play with and try and land Turgur's. Also saves the complaints about &quot;shamun suk, slow the mob plz.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Oh god if I ever saw that in a group or raid someone would get told to goto hell, piss off, and KMA so fast it would make thire head spin. Slow gets resisted and sometimes takes a few casts to land. Any MT or raid leader that is going to bitch at the shm for that. Has no basic concept of the game and no buisness being a MT or raid leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, Snug. There are days it's REAL damn difficult to keep my mouth shut. Tordail is a redhead, and arguably one of the hottest-tempered shaman on Karana. I keep a couple stacks of ale in Ye Olde Bookbags for that very purpose (ROFL, alcohol tolerance is maxxed ... *grin). It's easier to grin, take a swig, shrug off the idiocy, and slow the mob than it is to get into Ye Olde Bar Fight in the middle of a raid or group expedition. And I just don't like getting rude with people (though I've found myself in an arena many a time). I've got a good reputation, as does my guild, and I like to keep it that way. I have been known to be a bit hard-edged, and that's made me someone not a lot of people mess with.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've not had a raid leader complain about Turgur's bouncing. Most of those who'd lead open raids in zones like HOH or BOT know me, and they know my play style. It's generally the tanks that complain, not the raid leaders. When they do, the raid leader sends the complainer a quick tell. Problem solved. I've not had that many problems with complaints in a group situation as I'm usually with a guild group ... most times when the tank complains it's part of a pickup group, and other group members are on him or her quicker than I can type something up.<br />
<br />
A lot of people just don't understand the shaman class. Irritating to not at least have a basic understanding of various classes you group with, but hell, they're probably wrapped up in their own class. Most times, in a non-guild group, I warn people about debuffing and slowing, and once they understand it takes a bit of time to weave the spells properly (not to mention the rather long refresh on Turgur's) I don't have many problems with &quot;slow the mob plz&quot; complaints.</div></div><hr />
