<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This legend, the truth of which is not necessarily related to <br />
its value, concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the <br />
University of Copenhagen: &quot;Describe how to determine the height <br />
of a skyscraper with a barometer.&quot;<br />
<br />
One student replied: &quot;Tie a long piece of string to the neck <br />
of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the <br />
skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the <br />
length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.&quot;<br />
<br />
This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the <br />
student was failed immediately.<br />
<br />
He appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably <br />
correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter <br />
to decide the case.  The arbiter judged that the answer was <br />
indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge <br />
of physics.<br />
<br />
To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in <br />
and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer <br />
which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic <br />
principles of physics.<br />
<br />
For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased <br />
in thought.  The arbiter reminded him that time was running <br />
out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely <br />
relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use.<br />
<br />
On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the<br />
skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it <br />
takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then <br />
be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad <br />
luck on the barometer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the<br />
barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its <br />
shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, <br />
and thereafter it is simple matter of proportional arithmetic <br />
to work out the height of the skyscraper.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could <br />
tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like <br />
a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the <br />
skyscraper.  The height is worked out by the difference in the <br />
gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sq root(l / g).<br />
<br />
&quot;Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it <br />
would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the <br />
skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of <br />
course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pres-<br />
sure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and <br />
convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the <br />
height of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise inde-<br />
pendence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly <br />
the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say <br />
to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give <br />
you this one if you tell me the height of this building'.&quot; <br />
<br />
The student was Niels Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel <br />
prize for Physics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just like reading about people outsmarting the damn professors :P<br />
<br />
(A musical arrangement I did was once graded 03, the equivalent of an F, because the person graded it was too set in his ways to realize that just because the original song said &quot;Swing&quot;, the arranged version didn't necessarily have to be in swing too. Took me 2 months of writing angry letters, but I got my grade changed to an 11 or A-)</div></div><hr />
