<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a cliff golem the other day, very resistant mob; in the end though Q kept up with his DPS and I only had to use a few blast heals to spot fill; main DPS was Dogdog, Delightful Orb procs and a few JBB blasts, in essence nothing else landed.<br />
The trouble is also single pulls, pull at the wrong time and you have the entire goon hord and some gargoyles (had the General actually land a fear on me heheh); just snag the one furthest from the PoK book, he paths in a big triangle, just catch him at the furthest point from the Outpost and he comes all by his lonesome.<br />
Also he summons, but didnt summon me till he was at 70ish %</div></div><hr />

Rann is near impossible to solo, cant slow him yet, spirit call with what few dots + nukes I got to land took him to oh say 99% if that, and then he bounced back up to 100% :(</div></div><hr />

A few friends and myself killed him. It took about 2 hours of two shaman pets, two shamans dotting/tanking (DoTs landed about 1/3 of the time after we landed Sinia), monk-bot, paladin. He only hits about 350, but his HP and regen are just disgusting.<br />
