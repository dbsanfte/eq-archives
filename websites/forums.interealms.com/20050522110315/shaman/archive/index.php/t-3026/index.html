<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if I am bringing an old topic up...but on Rodcet Nife server, I've been seeing many people auctioning off to trade ODS's for IGS's. The sad sad thing is IGS's are now selling for as low as 6k. ODS, not sure the value on them arm...but I assume its anywhere from 4-10k atm. I asked a few ub3r buds and they both agreed that ODS &gt; IGS for Shaman w/o Topor. <br />
<br />
Now IGS's have always been one of the uber items I've always wanted for gear, so it was a highly valued item in my eyes. I ended up trading my IGS's for ODS b/c I really didn't take a hit as far as AC goes. around 955(plus bought/aquired items that added AC). As far as resist gear, I had a 10+ resist to magic/cold/fire shoulder piece from the Rathe Mountains GM event last year, so didn't lose that much there.<br />
<br />
The shaman who ended up getting the IGS braought his AC up to 910. It hurt loses my IGS's. but I felt a little better about giving up/trading something valueble to help a fellow shaman out.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know everyone thoughts about trading ODS for IGS, vice versa.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been debating this myself. I am hardly ever short on mana however and 10 to all resists is nice not to mention the AC. If only the IGS had hps there would be no question. I kinda lean towards the IGS because I have cann5 and torpor but if you didn't I think the ODS would possible be better.</div></div><hr />

If you want mana preservation get a crystalline torque ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was very disappointed to find that Iksars can't wear the IGS. Sigh. I guess fo us the question is fairly straightforward... ODS is better than IGS. <br />
<br />
The next question is:<br />
<br />
For Iksars, what shoulders are better than the ODS?<br />

Get an 8th shawl! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah Diss da uba...thats what Alyna suggested, but I don't see that obtainable in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO: Matchless Dragonscale Mantle &gt; IGS/ODS<br />
<br />
15AC 65 hps/mana.  But then again, I'm a hp fanatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">personally saving 10% mana off all my spells is more important to me than 10ac and 10 to all resists.   I can't say I never have mana problems, cause I do.  Me work hard.<br />
<br />
If I was going to take off the ODS (again) I would wear a high end dragon mantle from WW or Death Watcher Shroud from Umbral Plains... or spirit wracked cord or strength of the elements  heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been debating taking off my IGS for a while now.  Actually, if I could find a Matchless Dragonscale Mantle for sale, I'd buy it.  Basically, I'm too lazy to scour the auction channel, and have no real interest in hunting WW anymore.  So, for now it's still IGS.  ODS doesn't really impress me much.</div></div><hr />
