<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All of my equipment is things that I have gotten myself with help from my guild/alliance or with my tradeskills or that I have quested. I am stuck on what to shoot for next. Any ideas would be great.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Edit: I should add that my guild isn't very large and that my alliance isn't either. We are capable of doing Fear, but not CT himself. That kinda thing :p</div></div><hr />

Your gear looks very good overall considering your guild's limitations.<br />
<br />
An easy to obtain upgrade for your face slot would be a Death Mask of the Elysians.  That's a simple one group encounter, but bring a good pulling team to save yourself some trouble.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it looks like you should start farming Cazic Thule (the zone, not the boss) entrance and maze for the Tae Ew blood to upgrade your chest slot with a Tae Ew BP.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh I miss that alliance. We'd probably be in ToV by now if our guild hadn't quit and hopefully you and I would be snagging some chain drops but oh well that's the breaks :)<br />
<br />
I'd suggest the earring of solstice also, took me 4.3k to buy all the parts for it. Have you started the shawl quests yet? I'm drooling over the FT3 on the final shawl and hope to get back to that soon.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you are doing great and I got some catching up to do on you :)<br />
<br />
Oh and check out this thread for quested stuff: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11502</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purrjian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps a Shadel Bandit Ring ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Earring of the Solstice!! I had thought of starting that once, but didn't have the heart to clean out my bank. Now with 8 more slots I guess I don't have an excuse :p<br />
<br />
I have been camping the bandits in FG off and on but have a hard time getting a bard/enchanter to come since I can't seem to single pull them for the life of me! <br />
<br />
Solariis, I recently made Thursday EU night and once a week we try to get together for just fun or for a certain item for a guildie. This week we're heading to the castle in Velks to try to get our 3 mages Burnout IV and you're more than welcome to come along!<br />
<br />
As for the shawl quest. Stopped after I got the 4th shawl because tailoring scared me :p  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas, will definately get started on the earring of the solstice tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">finger - shadel bandit ring off FG bandits, i did it at 51 with a group of 3 so i'm sure you can solo.<br />
<br />
wrist - coldain military wristguard if you're into focus effects, EAIII's nice if you solo.<br />
<br />
ear - earring of the solstice.</div></div><hr />
