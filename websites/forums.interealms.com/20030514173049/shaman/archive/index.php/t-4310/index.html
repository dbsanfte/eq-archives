3-5 Kills = 4% aa exp (this includes light blues)<br />
<br />
@ 20 spawns in the area.  Awww, to small to pbae, sniff.<br />
Usually deserted.  Never bothered to check on repop time, I havent cleared whole thing by myself.  I'd say half an hour maybe.<br />
<br />
Bonus of having unsuspecting dragon raiders dropping into your camp due to pit traps.<br />
<br />
Bonus of having  CRAZY BL epic mob (spawned?) in your area.  BTW if someone comes down to do aforementioned epic mob, GET OUT.  After they wipe he will chew on you for about 10 seconds, before you do the happy naked dance at bindpoint.<br />
<br />
Bonus of having crazy ice witch in your spawn area.  She is easy to avoid, but also fun to kill.  Ice Witch ice comets, surprisingly enough.<br />
<br />
If the moon and planets are aligned, and you are alone down there for any considerable length of time, I'd say 4 aa blue an hour, but then again, I am lazy.<br />
<br />
********NO LOOT***********<br />
Loot consists of hides that do not stack and sell for @ 5 plat, so my friend tells me.  For his kind deed of helping me farm low medium and high quality skins, I pl'd him from barely 48 to 49 in a little under 3 hours while grouped with him in this spot.  PLEASE dont 2 box down here, I hate 2 boxers :)<br />
<br />
Long time Lurker, hope this helps in some way give back to the shaman community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That mean 4% of a total AA level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sssythe Malosepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, 1 blue roughly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to say this is one of my fav areas for exping in a group with a porter... the major problem is trying to convince a group that the place is better than velks with 20 people in it (ie nothing to pull).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So is this a spot for a kitted lvl 60 sham to AA?  Or do you suppose that it could be done before hand?  I would give it a shot, but I don't think I really want to drop down and expect a nasty CR ;&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't been here in a while, but this place was soloable for a 56 shaman and I hear it starts to go lt blue at 57.  I have no idea about the BL epic guy.  Everything in perma seems to be on a 23 +/- 3 min timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well here's something embarrassing: I continually have problems trying to reach this location. The first time I went down there I got lucky (though I didn't realize it at the time) and spent a couple of hours happily soloing spiders and bears. But since then I've tried every week or so to get down there and there are always Ice Giants that see through invisibility in the area. They're not particularly tough (all light blue I think) but once one sees me I'm swarmed and I have to Gate.<br />
<br />
When you're going down there, do you just take the time to single pull any giants in the way? Hmm, maybe I just solved my problem :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heheh - i used to 2box down there, but the place gets so boring.  I used this spot to level through part of 58, all of 59, 2 golds into 60, and then my first 10 aa points.  During that time, my necro went from 54 to 57 and picked up 3 aa's.  This place is insanely boring, but awesome experience.  A couple of notes:<br />
<br />
if you die, you're screwed.  it's very difficult to get a rez in this zone unless you happen to catch a vox raid or BST epic raid as they're moving through.  I see lots of people in that spot with pocket clerics.  I've only been able to get a rez one time down there after a LD mishap, and that was from a guildy of my wife's that lives down there with his mage and cleric.  I also burned through about 6 essense emeralds on my necro providing rezes after various mishaps (first time i encountered the ice witch after she was added for example).<br />
<br />
things are on a roughly 20 minute timer (i've never kept an exact count).  with a good partner or when 2 boxing my necro, I could hold between 15 and all of them down before repops started, depending on the partner.  solo, depending on level and the spells I had available, I could do 6 to 10 before repops began.<br />
<br />
when travelling to this spot, be careful.  occasionally some of the giants that you have to pass will see invis.  I usually nose around the corner to target them, con them to see if they see me.  if they do, i'll pull them and then move through.  80% of the time, however, you can safely move through the area without being seen.<br />
<br />
you can pull singles MOST of the time at 57, but you will get an occasional add until 58.  the level range for the bears / spiders / wolves is 43 to 47 i believe.<br />
<br />
these mobs have fairly hefty cold resistance.  debuffing them with malosini helps, but you'll still get lots of partial resists (i never really tracked it, but i'd say somewhere around 60% of max jbb damage over all).  on occasions where i was by myself down there, and not 2boxing I made a pet, buffed him with haste and pulled a mob with slow.  epic dot followed by a disease dot (eventually pox once i got it). then jbb blasted away while the pet chewed on him.  I'd canni a few times along the way to recover from the mana expenditure, and cblast / torpor myself as needed.<br />
<br />
most of the spawn locations in the area will pop EITHER one or two mobs.  making the number of mobs per cycle variable between 13 and 22, not including the ice witch or the roamer that pops at the top of the ladders leading back up to vox's lair.<br />
<br />
this is a very popular spot for rangers since they can fearkite VERY well in this spot.  AA farming druids like it to since they can DC a bear and go to town.<br />
<br />
pulling the mobs near the ladders can be tricky with the addition of the ice witch.  one of them tends to stay in one spot, the other roams.  pull the one that stays close to it's spawn point first.  then try to catch the roamer when he's as far away from the witch as possible.  most of the time, he's within aggro range of the witch, so you'll get her too unless you time your pull with when he wanders away from her a bit.<br />
<br />
at 58 you occasionally get a light blue. at 59 i'd say about 25% of them are light blue. at 60 the number seems to fluctuate around 50%, depending on how lucky you are with the pops.  just as with the mobs in high keep, the light blues make for some tasty exp.  the zone has a decent ZEM, and the mobs die fairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so how do you get there?  I have been on Vox raids, but I never had the pleasure of falling into a pit trap.  Is it better to drop down one of the traps, or go in via Vox's lair?  If Lady Vox is up, and you aggro her she just ports you to the zone right?<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">drop down through one of the pit traps.  mobs in vox's lair see invis, so you'd have a very hard time surviving the trip going that route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get the right drop. From the rock, turn first left and go up the ramp... at the top of the ramp is the drop.<br />
<br />
If you don't you'll end up with 7/8 bears mauling you to death.</div></div><hr />
