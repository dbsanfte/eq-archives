Swamp Port  Detail | History  <br />
   <br />
Date Change <br />
07-31 07:25 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Teleport to -438,985 in innothule&quot; to &quot;Teleport to 1188,544 in innothule&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey, that was very cool of them!<br />
<br />
From what I understand, the old gate position was pretty much a shadowman camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it was...ported u on da hand in swamp :)<br />
<br />
will have to try mine this morn see where i go now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">...seems to suggest this potion now lands on or very near the northern hand... the one with the dot vendor.  If my memory serves correct, that vendor should be dubious to everyone at worst (vendor change, post kunark release).  So, this makes the potion safe for all factions, of almost any level.  You just have to be strong enough to run 30 seconds north to the SRo zone.<br />
<br />
This slightly increases the value, since with a click, a 30 second cast, a zone, a 30 second jog, a zone, and another 30 second job, you can be connected to either the druid transport system, or the wizard transport system.<br />
<br />
A small change, but hey, it's the little things that matter, no?<br />
<br />
-A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah - that location is by the Hand with the vendor.  It is the first loc I ever memorized in Norrath <br />
<br />
1234, 567<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was this really an issue?<br />
<br />
I can't remember the last time a shadowman aggroed on any of my gating toons.  I've even hit the potion and went AFK for 10 minutes. That camp is coded differently or something, they never aggroed on you if they were green to you...unlike the other shadowmen camps.<br />
<br />
And as far as i'm concerned, ya probably don't need/can't afford gate potions if the shadowmen aren't green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, now I'm one step farther from CT  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Vaxx, at level 60 I've been agroed by them.  Not that they could kill me, but they are annoying.   I've had lower level people buy potions in the past (not many), and they complained afterwards, even though I warned them.    I'm glad they changed the location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Those shadowmen in swamp have never aggrod me. I could even sit down right next to them, no aggro. They did /con &quot;scowls&quot; though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually like popping at shadowmen camp, because when I needed to go to OT, I would gate to hand, melee shadowmen, get a drink, and come back in OT. It was easier than looking for something to beat on (usually have to SLOW first) or look for someone to duel.<br />
<br />
But no biggie...I guess I'll have to look for a wondering kobold or froggie to beat on. Or can I just melee the merchent at the hand? What level are they anyhow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shadowmen won't aggro on you at 55.. don't know at 51 (this is where the stone drops you, right in their laps.. I'd say if  you are 51 for the first time, have root up and be ready to run.  They are PESKY little things)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've gated a level 45 into the hand...they don't aggro.  Ya, i've stood there for 10 minutes with my 60 toons, they don't aggro.  I'm telling you, that camp is coded differently, those shadowmen aren't anywhere near as aggressive as the ones anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They never agroed me, although they agroed my ranger. go figure.<br />
Maybe they will make these potions a bit faster casting someday. like 15 seconds instead of 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">*shrug* I've had the agro.  Don't know what else to tell ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've received unprovoked aggro as well if memory serves.<br />
Of course, I did level on shadowed men in my youth for a time.<br />
<br />
A shame the Everfrost port location is in such a harmless place., and unlikely to merit a change.  While it isn't a long run to Halas, I'd prefer to show up by the dock then at the spot where I farm spiderling silks and pelts after clicking my stone. :p<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ive been aggroed every single time Ive 'swamp gate'-ed....Ive been level 60 everytime Ive arrived at the hand....while Im almost possitive there is no difference in the coding of this one single camp of shadowmen, I am curious to understand why they aggro some and not others.<br />
<br />
It was my understanding.......that faction has something to do with aggro radius? I know Evel has taken countless shadowman hits over the past couple years.<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Interesting though......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used the gate potion to that loc just once.  I was aggroed by shadowmen.  I think faction issues and race issues apply here, not trying to say anyone is lying.  I'm a Barbarian shaman tho, and that is a different starting faction with shadowmen from an ogre or troll.<br />
<br />
I like the change.  Makes that potion the best one by far.  Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/shrug...I gated in with barb warrior, barb shaman, human monk, halfer rogue, ogre warrior, probably a couple other twinks I missed.  Next time I think about it i'll go get a screenie of me standing up there :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was non-aggro to the shadowmen there for a very long time, even at scowl.  Guild members would complain about it as they would get aggro every time they gated there.  I couldn't understand *** they were talking about until one day just after I helped someone get Jboots.  I went from scowl to Max scowl.  Once I did that, they would aggro me every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aggroed about 50% of the time, and certainly if I have a bad connection and stay there for too long.<br />
<br />
Im an ogre btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, that's strange.  I've killed lots of shadow men helping two or three friends get jboots(including my own monk), and still don't get aggroed on by shadowmen.  Am ogre.</div></div><hr />
