<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How many of you guys think content in &quot;The lost dungeons of Norrath&quot;, will be doable with just 1 group 61+?<br />
<br />
If so, how many of you think the reward will be nice with 1 group?<br />
<br />
EQ has been content chasing since day 1 ... back in the day, everything was more-or-less balanced risk vs. reward.<br />
<br />
Then as more stuff was added, pushing the envelope higher, in an effort to match their risk vs. reward model, they made harder encounters to get better gear.<br />
<br />
Simple enough.<br />
<br />
But it's getting to a point with harder and harder content, to get better and better rewards, (to keep that carrot out in front of player's faces), that to fit in, the content is to a point that no single group, or &quot;practical&quot; guild can achieve it.  So where does the cycle end?<br />
<br />
Will gear and drops in the new expansion be doable with 1 group and equivalent to stuff in PoP that takes raid lvl forces to obtain?  I doubt it, so where's that leave us?<br />
<br />
I liked EQ a lot better as well when things were realistically achievable for most any character and not just higher end raid guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agreed, but I think they're too far gone by this point to go back to making much for a good group.  We equipped ourselves quite well through droppables and 1 group encounters through velious or so, but since then, it's just been &quot;farm cash, buy uber droppable stuff you can't get yourself&quot;.  Still doing quite well at it, but it's not nearly as much fun as trying to dig deep into chardok to get a halfling mask or a couple iksar hide capes to equip people with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My hope is that this expansion will bridge the gap between PoP gear and LoY gear. Possibly around HoTish level gear? I dont think thats too much to ask since HoT is doable with a single group as it is anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could go for a couple of zones where there is massive content like the PoJ trials, forcing it to be just one group... Maybe a Hedge maze type of deal for single groups even...  And with how I am reading the script for Plane of Time, all I can think is why don't we get to do anything nifty like that at lower guild capabilities?</div></div><hr />
