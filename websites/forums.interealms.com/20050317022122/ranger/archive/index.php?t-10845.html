<br />
Basically, at level 46 my Human Ranger can cast herself about 13 buffs. About 10 of those are actually  quite useful, let's see :<br />
<br />
Fight Spells :<br />
- Skin Like XXX<br />
- Strength of XXX<br />
- Bramblecoat<br />
- Shield of Thistles (pre fight)<br />
- Call of Earth (pre/during fight )<br />
- Feet Like Cat (small AC bonus)<br />
- Nature's Precision<br />
- Riftwind's Protection<br />
<br />
Fight, other :<br />
- Endure Cold<br />
- Endure Fire<br />
<br />
Fight Utility :<br />
- XXX Healing<br />
- Flamelick (early levels)<br />
- Tangling Weeds<br />
- Grasping Roots<br />
<br />
Utility:<br />
- Spirit of Wolf<br />
- Camouflage<br />
- See Invisible<br />
- Eyes of the Cat<br />
- Hawkeye (any good ?)<br />
<br />
I'm sure I have forgotten some of them but already you can see that;s a bunch of spells to put in a Spell Bar.<br />
<br />
I will discuss the Spell Book organisation mostly as Spell Bar organisation is very much down to preferences.<br />
<br />
SPELL BOOK ORGANISATIONS<br />
<br />
Idea #1 :<br />
In the left page (new UI) you could put the 8 most useful Spells just as you have them most often in your Spell  Bar, in the SAME ORDER. This will help you re-mem your 'regular' spell easily and quickly without checking the order of spells or searching for the spells.<br />
<br />
In the right page, you could place the other most useful spells, as well as other Combat Buffs, in DESCENDING ORDER of Refresh Time. Memmed first will be the spells that need  refreshoing more often. Such as ThistleCoat. Memmed Last will be the longest duration ones such as Spirit of Wolf or Riftwind's Protection.<br />
<br />
When you need to do a re-buff session, remove  from 3 to 8 spells off your Spell Bar and mem all the buff spells from the left and right page, skipping the utility spells. Buff yourself. Then re-mem your regular Spell Bar spells from that you have on the left page in the exact order as you have them in your Spellbook, quick and easy, no need to struggle with what spell goes where.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense :p<br />
<br />
PS: All other remaining spells go to the next Spell Book pages, grouped by utility / spell types, as you wish.<br />
<br />
SPELL BAR ORGANISATION<br />
<br />
Generally I place spells where they feel 'natural' or intuitive.. but I suppose that's down to your type of memory, mine is 'associative'.  For example my typical Spell Bar looks like this:<br />
<br />
1. Spirit of Wolf (if not me I often drop one on passers by for fun)<br />
2. Healing<br />
3. Tangling Weeds<br />
4. Careless Lighting / Flamelick<br />
5. Camouflage<br />
6. Call of Earth<br />
7. Stinging Swarm / misc. buff for passers-by or a single buff refresh<br />
8. Grasping Roots<br />
<br />
1, 2, 3, and 8 are ALWAYS in my Spell Bar. Grapsing Roots saved my life oh so many times :p Tangling Weeds is great just because I hate running after fleeing creatures :P<br />
<br />
For a quick single -buff refresh or cast of a spell on other person, I use slot 7 or slot 5.<br />
<br />
Pre fight slot 7 will be a Cancel magic or DoT depending on situation.<br />
<br />
I liked to use Flamelick at least till level 30, even if it is weak the 'Placebo' factor works for me :) And it's fun. Technically. I suspect sometimes a 4 ac decrease MAY bring the mob's AC down one 'step' in the ac 'slices'.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Hope this is useful,<br />
I would like to hear about other people's way of dealing with the Spell Book and the many Buffs us Rangers have to refresh :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiyn</div><div class="date">10-02-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My bar has in this order (I'm 36)<br />
1. sow<br />
2. strength/swap out with SLR/Cat feet/Riftwinds/Barbcoat<br />
3. shield of Thistles<br />
4.healing<br />
5.flamelick-not for the debuff but for the taunt<br />
6.Stinging Swarm (I haven't even used this one yet, fizzles too much)<br />
7.Grasping roots<br />
8.Snare (I snare my mobs rather then root them as they are running.<br />
<br />
  My spell book is done by spell type:<br />
Buffs<br />
Defensive spells (root, sow, camo...)<br />
Nukes<br />
<br />
My most important bar is the hotkeys<br />
1.Range weapon<br />
2.taunt<br />
3.kick<br />
4.flame lick<br />
5.snare<br />
6.healing<br />
7.assist/ or stinging swarm or track.<br />
8.root<br />
9.Incoming message<br />
<br />
  I really think with the amount of spells that Verant is adding that they need to double the amount of spells we can load into our bars.  The only character I know that has it worse then my ranger is my poor enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduyn</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've set up the keys so that I can cast spells just by hitting the number, with or without the ALT key.<br />
<br />
That way, I don't have to use a hotkey slot for a spell.<br />
<br />
I also have my run keys as Z X C V - where Z is back, C forward, X left and V right.  So I can move and reach up with my left hand and hit the most commonly used spells.   To that end:<br />
<br />
1 - Healing<br />
2 - Snare<br />
3 - Grasping Roots<br />
4 - Panic Animal<br />
5 - Nature's Precision<br />
6 - Buff <br />
7 - Buff<br />
8 - Wolf Form / SOW<br />
<br />
The only buff I ever cast during a fight while soloing is Nature's Precision.  I leave slots 6 and 7 open for downtime buffs. There's no reason to use more than a single slot for buffs, really, the only reason I have two is because I don't really need that many spells constantly at hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SwordMage</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I would add to this is a reminder during buffing sessions NOT to unmem any spell that you might need if jumped on (such as your root spell in slot 8).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faB</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Anduyn, I should have mentioned that. I also remove the alt.. I cant be bothered and it's uncomfortable to hit alt + number regularly with the left hand.. so I also use just the number keys, works great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeric</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the alt method, usually thumbing the alt and index fingering the number. Being level 30 only, my spells aren't quite the level of everyone else, but having recently hit 30, it got a whole lot more interesting. Here's what I run (pay no attention which number slot, it's set up for my hotkeys)<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
1) SLR<br />
2) SoW<br />
3) Snare<br />
4) Bramblecoat<br />
5) Stinging Swarm<br />
6) Feet Like Cat / Strength of Earth<br />
7) Panic Animal / Camo<br />
8) Grasping Roots<br />
<br />
My hotkey pages are broken up so page 1 is attack and page 2 is buff... keeps me from accidentally snaring myself when I'm trying to cast feet like cat :)</div></div><hr />
