<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I am currently gathering components for the Shield of Banewarding quest. What this requires is a lot of Maiden's Eye hunting and some in Mona Letalis (Also a long boring solo camp in Scarlet Desert witha poopy sun rev on a 30 mins spawn with place holders...grrr...)<br />
<br />
I need a rare drop, Black Flame Charcoal, from umbral toilers in ME and a Thought Leech Brain from Thought Leeches in Mons Letalis.<br />
<br />
The reason I am posting is since I have to do these things anyway and experience is mostly negligable for me, any 50+ folsk who wanna get some exp and help me out would be appreciated and welcome. I /can/ solo all of this, but I detest soloing and like having some company, so anyone who can get some exp while I grab the occasional light blue AA is more than welcome to join me. I plan to be in ME most all this week unless on raids. Just let me know in /gu or by tell that you are coming. Any class is welcome, as I said..most of this is slowly soloable by me, so any help is appreciated be it DPS, healing or just good conversation!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and look forward to seeing you!</div></div><hr />

I've been told that at my lvl I should be quadding the toilers in ME anyways.  If your there and see me on just shoot me a tell and well see if I can't speed up the charcoal drop.<br />

I always like to blow things up.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, completed the ME and Mons LEtalis portions..all that is left is a boring camp in Scarlet Desert. Lots of Sun Revenants and Reavers around to kill, though..still light blue at 61:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Kilorn, if you see a Chancellor's Medal drop, could you pretty please save it for me. Would be a nice neck piece upgrade. I'll even come and hang with you in SD. It'll be good xp for me and good conversationalist to keep you company.</div></div><hr />
