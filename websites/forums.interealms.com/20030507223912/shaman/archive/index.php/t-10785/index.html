<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I have about 15-20k pp to upgrade equipment and I'm looking for suggestion on what to do. Mainly trying to raise hp in hopes of being able to cann 5 without worry of low hp aggro. Anyway any suggestions would be appreciated my profile is below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get rid of the JB<br />
<br />
Hardened grey flesh sleeves<br />
Slime covered rubicite coif<br />
Barbed Dragonscale boots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh coif goes for 18k alone on my server. Thanks for suggestion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i bought the coif for 1.5k, i love my server. i see more upgrades then i can shake a stick at. dusty soriz boots, coldain skin gloves, shimmering terror hide cloak, barbed rubicite bracer, crystal spider eyes, metal linked crown. that wouldnt even dent your bank much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was going to recommend Artificer's Ringmail armor, but that’s Barbarian Tribunal only :(<br />
<br />
Possibly Night Terror Chain Armor<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=NIght+Terror+Chain<br />
<br />
or Hurricane Chain Armor<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=Hurricane+Chain<br />
<br />
Both have decent AC and HP. Player made though. <br />
<br />
For 15 to 20kpp you should be able to buy a few decent pieces. Depending on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i wouldnt recomend Artificer's on my server i find it to be over-priced for what you get. a little mix and matching and you can do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah just bought night terror legs for 10k. Fairly cheap and nice  item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could replace the JB helm with a Metal Linked Crown.  You'd give up some ac but gain 6Wis 30hp and 5svmagic.  These things have flooded the market on my server so are only like 100pp.  A Large Smoothmetal Torque would give you some HP in the neck slot tho the AC isn't great on it.  Crystal Spider Eyes for the face, Spider Fur Belt for the waist.  Pauldrend of Witness are about 4-5k on Vaz and have very nice stats for shoulder.  7wis and 55hp iirc.  <br />
<br />
Angrif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Silver Hammer Earring (I think that's the name.  comes from PoJ Execution trial) has 25hp 55mana.<br />
Skull Charm from CoD has 35hp 65mana on it.<br />
I'd personally get the 25hp 35mana earring that right clicks that crappy sow &quot;upgrade&quot; over the ihoop.<br />
<br />
For neck slot, when you hit level 58, you can try taking a tank friend and maybe another healer, and go farm yeldema every few hours until you all get his talisman.  5ac 4stats 4resists 10hp/mana.<br />
Also, go on 8th shawl quests.  The coldain tracking collar is like 40hp/mana/10ac with other minor stats.<br />
<br />
Lose the mask for Crystal Eyes, Enshrouded Veil, Death Mask of the Elysians, or some other mask like that with 35hp/mana and about 8ac on it.<br />
<br />
Drop the helmet for the Circlet of Falinken from the Dragons in Velious.  It's a relatively easy quest that a single group of people can do from start to end.  The hardest part is catching certain mobs up, like the snake in DN.  50hp 75mana and stats and affliction haste 3 is pretty nice for a single group doable quest.<br />
<br />
For your rings, they are quite fine.  Next upgrade you want is the Ring of the Shissar (it's the key to get into the emperor's throneroom.  doubles as a kick ass ring).<br />
<br />
Drop the worked bracer, and go get a Supple Scale Armband.  You lose like 3wis and 9ac (no hp on either I don't think), but you get the extended range 3 focus in exchange.  Well worth the payoff<br />
<br />
Drop the arms for Grey Flesh Sleeves from the Grey zone.  They have about 25hp on them.<br />
<br />
Check the stats on Grey Flesh Gloves, and Coldain Military Gloves to see if they are better for you.<br />
<br />
Stick with Fungal Tunic until level 60 when you can hopefully scribe Torpor and cast it off to one of your twinks.  Vindy BP or one of the Velious quested BPs is what you want to upgrade to.<br />
<br />
Get a Heiro Cloak on the back slot.  75hp 75mana is hard to argue with.  Other option, though it lacks hps, is Lodi shield.<br />
<br />
For the belt, look into a Girdle of Mithanial? (spelling?).  Not sure the cost of them though.  Maybe too expensive.  There's a belt that drops often off the bugs in FG.  It's got some hp on it I think  Very common drop if you are camping the Lucid Shard for VT key quest.<br />
<br />
Those legs are actually rather good.  Only upgrades I know of to get would be Velious quest legs, or the legs that drop in the Hedge Trial (they have like 40hp 40mana)<br />
<br />
Get a Talisman of Benevolence for range slot.<br />
<br />
Orb of Infinite Void is the shield you want.<br />
<br />
Get epic for primary hand.<br />
<br />
You may also want to look into the Strength of the Elements should quest for 100hp if you happen to ever catch Master Yael up in the Hole.<br />
<br />
Also, check out the Regal Ring of the Bathzid (spelling?) and the Spirit Wracked Cords quests in Chardok.  It takes a lot of work to get the faction for them, but the stats are worth it.  There's 100hp on the arm/shoulder/bracer slot item, and like 85hp on the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks for the replies. I actually have the 50k for torpor just trying to find the spell. Found out from a shaman friend that while I was at work one sold in bazaar for 30k :(. Sigh oh well next time.</div></div><hr />
