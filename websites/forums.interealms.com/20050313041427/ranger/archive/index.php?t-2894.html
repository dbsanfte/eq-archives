<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I got a tell from a ranger in need and I happen to have the item in my bank that he needed(Swirling Sphere of Color from PoA).   Well we ran off to Erudin and proceeded to sneak.   After we discussed the procedure and double checked on our faction/sneak, I tried to hand in my Sphere and I get this.<br />
<br />
NPC: &quot;I do not need this Arbok, you can have it back'<br />
<br />
I get my sphere back, and puzzled, I try it again.   Same result.   I petitioned and told a guide the situation.   The guide later responded that 'SoE does not support any forms of MQ'ing&quot;.    Hmm well i thought it was the contrary, in which SoE supported MQ'ing.<br />
<br />
Whats the story here?</div></div><hr />

Verant did post awhile back that each patch will see several zones being upgraded to have the quest NPCs return items they do not need.</div></div><hr />

She will then give it back and tell you to get the sphere from the plane of sky. The item you get back with be named Hammer of the Ancients I think. Then you give the hammer of the ancients and the swirling sphere to Mairee to receive the dwarven smith's hammer which you need to spawn Usbak the Old.<br />
<br />
Of course, how can Mairee know what hammer the other ranger has...  weird.</div></div><hr />

We had a wizard do the final hand in a week ago.  she had two of the staffes and a guildee had the third.  The hand in NPC kept the three staffs and did not give back the wizzy epic.  Obviously she petitioned the GM and Lebunde had a look at the records and said yes you handed in all the parts, but the MQ does not work and we do not support MQ. So basicly she lost everything on the last hand in.  We have since decided to avoid MQ unless we are certain that particular one still works.  <br />
<br />
I guess it is better to have the parts handed back rather then lose everything.  I wonder if this is all part of SOE finally closing the loopholes on MQ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that is only slightly correct.<br />
<br />
1. Mairee asks to see the Soulbound Hammer. You give it to her, she gives you the Hammer of the Ancients THEN sends you off to the Plane of Sky.<br />
<br />
2. If you follow the plot of the quest, technically you do not know you need to go to the Plane of Sky until after she gives you the Hammer of the Anicents.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the problem here is that Mairee has two possible outcomes:<br />
<br />
Soulbound Hammer = Hammer of the Ancients<br />
Swirling Sphere of Color + Hammer of the Ancients = Dwarven Smiths Hammer<br />
<br />
<br />
I sounds like Mairee is broken where she only looks for the Soulbound Hammer and not the other two. You should be able to give her a Swirling Sphere of Color without her giving it back to you.</div></div><hr />

Ack. That's what I meant. My english grammar sucks, obviously :).</div></div><hr />
