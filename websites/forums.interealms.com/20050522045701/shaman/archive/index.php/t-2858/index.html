<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The end game legs poll was very informative and prompted me to start this one for the waist slot.<br />
<br />
So I'd like some suggestions as to what to belt to save my dkp for.  :)<br />
<br />
It would be replacing this crappy old one that I had since level 40:<br />

My guild is just starting to explore NToV.  We can kill Grieg, IV, Sont, Yelniak and comparable mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Belt of Dwarfslaying, accept no substitute!  As used by Nixx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are lots of belts, some are better than others but most are about the same.  Off the top of my head I can think of these, destroyer belt from ntov, dain belt, dracolich belt, i think there is a belt on cursed too.<br />
<br />
I dont memorize loot to well, but thats a start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At your level of the game get a Belt of Dwarfslaying, you'll never replace it most likely.  I don't really see anything in game that I'd replace it with.  There are some nice alternatives, but nothing that really stands above it by enough for me to bag mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say that you should first look at THIS (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2219&amp;highlight=belt) topic that was posted like a week or so ago. It has lots of discussion over high end belt slots for shaman. And, not flaming ya or anything, just making sure you know how good of a resource it can be, try hitting the search function when lookin for stuff. The amount of information that has been posted before on your topic could sometimes be great. Never know if someone that had some great insight in the last topic might not notice yours and post there, which would leave ya out of the loop. <br />
<br />
As for myself, I am aiming for the belt from Blood of Ssramynameistoolong. I want those resists so that I don't have to switch out too much stuff into resist gear hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, well if you can't spell 'Ssraeshza' then you haven't been there long enough.  Of course, if you can spell it, you've been there way too long.  The belt your're referring to is called Ssraeshzaen Blood Cord, and yes it's pretty unreal especially for those of us who aren't sta capped yet.  (ac 35, sta/wis/int 20, cha 10, resist 12, hp/mana 100, all/all).  The Aura of Battle from Belt of Dwarf Slaying is pretty tough to beat though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are quite right, I need to get in the habit of searching before I post.<br />
<br />
Some good ideas on that other thread...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wear a White Dragon Scale Sash off Tormax. It's not as good as Dain belt, but it's pretty nice. Good luck winning a Belt of the Destroyer over melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another option is:<br />
<br />
Circle of Smoke<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP<br />
Slot: HANDS WAIST<br />
AC: 20<br />
STR: +10  STA: +8  WIS: +12  INT: +12  <br />
HP: +100  MANA: +100  SV FIRE: +15  SV DISEASE: +15  <br />
SV COLD: +15  SV MAGIC: +25  SV POISON: +15  <br />
Recommended level of 55.<br />
Effect: Gate (Must Equip. Casting Time: 10.0)<br />
<br />
It is dropped from Vyzh`dra the Cursed.  You have to have a great strategy to beat him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i would love a dain belt, but i had to settle for a silver girdle of stability from keeper ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another very nice belt is the Girdle of Magnificence.<br />
<br />
Was lucky enough to get one the other night:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am hoping to get myself a Belt of the Dwarf slaying, just have to wait my turn for Dains head, boy is he a ugly dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe. Circlet of Smoke is what I am aiming for for my hands slot. Very nice that it can be worn in more than one spot. I am in no big rush though. There are others in guild that have lesser equipment than I do, so I would rather get everyone to a decent fighting strength first before uberizing myself only hehe.</div></div><hr />
