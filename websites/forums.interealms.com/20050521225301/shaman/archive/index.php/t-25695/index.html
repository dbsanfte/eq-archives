<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was sitting around in Barindu at the vxed/tipt zone-in buffing guild groups for the trials when a group set up there to get the drop for the cleric 1.5 epic.  Being bored I decided to help them out a bit.  Put one poison dot (Yoppa) on a trash mob and immediately got summoned.  Then got summoned 4 more times before the mob got to 10%.  I'd wait for MT to get agro then take 1 step back to see if agro had changed (no HoTT when not grouped =/).  This is just plain stupid!  I did not slow, or malos, or anything else.  Didn't even have dogdog up.<br />
<br />
The MT for the group was an SK.  All, or at least most, of the group was much better equipped than me.  The shaman and wizard in the group are friends who I know have about 2k more HPs than me.  I have SCS3 and my epic 1.5.  I started casting dot when mob was at 95%.  It was probably well below 90% when the dot landed.  I have DoT crit AAs but I could have hit the mob with a poison rain or nuke and done more damage faster and would not have gotten agro.<br />
<br />
Does SoE have any reason for coding poison dot agro differently than all other dots except to reduce already lousy shaman damage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its actually a clever play to force shaman to only group with elite tanks.  Its an effort to brand us &quot;elitist&quot;, so when they finally remove our class from the game, no one but us will care:)<br />
<br />
Actually, its somewhat true. Since my guild has progressed beyond Time and into GoD, I rarely have aggro issues unless tanks are being lazy.  However, if I'm in a random pickup group, and the tank isn't an aggro machine, yes, still a problem.<br />
<br />
Last night, I had Yoppa dot, Bane of nife, Bane, Ultor, Pox, and was alternating Yoppa rain and our ice nuke without being summoned during a time raid.  But in some groups, I too can summoned with one poison dot after slow.  <br />
<br />
What Rytan (soe spell guy) said, if I remember correctly, was that he wasn't able to pinpoint why they had high aggro.  I remember a thread where most though he said he didn't think poison had high aggro, but someone quoted him exactly further down in the thread as saying, he just didn't know how to fix it.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have the link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funniest thing is they fixed disease dot aggro way back when in SoV when they added disease counters to slow. They just need to go ask who ever did that how and do it with poison counters too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vivitron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I seem to get ballpark &quot;fair&quot; aggro for the spell when it lands, then &quot;fair&quot; aggro for each tick.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Posion nukes/rains also generate a disproportional amount of aggro for the damage.  Our posion aggro is a side effect of Tash having a high amount of aggro associated with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The MT for the group was an SK.<br />
To be honest though, if this is really the timeline of the fight, it looks to me like the SK was just being lazy. I have had SKs much worse geared than me hold aggro just fine in places like the EPs, KT, WoS-PG, etc. SKs can generate HUGE amounts of aggro with a couple very low-cost spells. Summoned once, fine, but continously summoned for the duration of the fight? I think he was having you on, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're all right.  SKs can hold agro extremely well and I can often put all kinds of stuff on a mob with an SK tanking.  That's a lot of why I was surprised.  Even if the SK was chatting or lagging or whatever he was well enough equipped either he should have been getting agro or the shammy in the group should have.  The HPs on the mob were going down so I assume someone was hitting it. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The HPs on the mob were going down so I assume someone was hitting it. lol.<br />
Thats just it though. SKs dont really generate most of their aggro from damage, its hate-via-spells. If he didnt bother to use em, then the DOT would get you summoned 5 times. But any SK-PAL worth their salt can steal aggro from me EASILY even if I have Yoppa and Saryrn running at the same time, after Slowing and Crippling. Its a no-brainer for them, and only BARELY gear-oriented, like much of a Warriors aggro-generation is.<br />
<br />
NOTE: not saying our poison DOTs dont generate a hugely dissproportionate amount of aggro, everyone knows they do, and we also know they CAN create lower aggro DOTs (I can stack Bane and Sisslak easily on almost any mob without getting its attention from an average tank, but 1 Blood of Yoppa will get me smacked every time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of my guilds tanks can handle me malosing, slowing, then immediately stacking Yoppa's, Saryrn, and Bane on a mob (only in rifts, stuff dont live long enough in mpg), without me being summoned (generally).  Are times when I gank it from some of our best pallies and SK's and warriors go nuts trying to get it back =)<br />
<br />
Heck, my level 64 *twink* paladin (buffs to 7700hp tops full buff) can handle me doing the above mentioned and never get Tidy summoned.. but like Blazz said, PR dots still are way way too high for aggro... but also anyone worth their salt should be able to keep it off of us. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lolanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its a problem with Poison counters in general. Tash for chanters generates mad agro, poison dots/nukes for shaman generate mad agro, same for SKs and necros. We are just the only class that doesnt have a way to ditch that agro. (watches for a shaman boggle line to be added since like hell they are going to give us FD.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">be careful what you say, you know how SOE like to make obscure gear effects count for class abilities. (note: FD ring from sky)<br />
<br />
anyway, it really doesn't matter &quot;how&quot; it generates spikes in aggro, the fix is rather simple in concept, though I don't know their coding, so implementation is a different story, introduce a secondary type of poison counter for shaman poison DoTs, adjust aggro around it to be more suitable to our curse DoTs, maybe even slightly less.<br />
<br />
I've actually come to rely on my Curse DoTs and Rain Nukes for group DPS anyway, seeing as how they cause a significant amount of damage in a short order of time, I can keep Curse DoT going constantly through most fights (accounting for the occasional resist), and Poison Rains for a good number of fights in a row, before I back off to recoup a bit of mana (still keep DoT going though).<br />

<br />
Yeah I know i should watch what I say, was more pointedly laughing that instead of fixing it they will probably end up giving us something to just counter it the mad agro. hehe maybe they can make the ring have unlimited charges and a 1 minute reuse /sigh i only wish.</div></div><hr />

Sony has hinted at times when talking about &quot;the great monk nerf&quot; that mitigation is based largely on the raw AC of the item worn.  It has been theorized that this is why a druid with a 1500 AC will mitigate better then a monk with a 1500 AC.  The druid will have to have more RAW ac on his items to get that 1500 AC.</div></div><hr />

 I was the person who said I'd follow up on the DoT agro/hate (and coded /melody, fwiw). We had to change the way PBAE DoT's worked a while ago to prevent exploits, and one unfortunate side effect of the change was that hate generation from DoT's was affected. Basically, damage is a key source of how much NPCs will hate a player, and without the damage being applied, less hate is created. We tried a few things, but were met with various problems and then more pressing issues came up and this was left behind. I'll try to get some progress on this one soon. <br />

Yup, SK's imo are agro generating machines.<br />
<br />
They have always complained about their Hate line of spells over at the SK boards, but fact of the matter is between their snare line, spear line and hate spells, it's damn hard to pull agro off of em.<br />
<br />
Not so long ago I read a thread here complaining about how our lvl 51 spell Turgur's was our class defining spell.<br />
<br />
Hard to complain though when the SK's class defining spell is the lvl 15 Clinging Darkness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Clinging Darkness isn't what it was.  Spell:Fear is where it's at for sideways hate generation.  The new Terror of Discord spell, though, is effective enough to be used.  What SK's complained about before was that direct hate spells were useless, since they generated less hate than Fear or Darkness.  That's not so anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">An amusing little story from late December when I was playing EQ1 over the Christmas holidays.<br />
<br />
I had gotten my 2-boxed monk a Stave of the Eternal, a nice droppable 2HB weapon with a stun proc. Figured it would be good for holding agro when tanking, hopefully even good enough to let me DOT. So I head out to Grieg's to check it out.<br />
<br />
Before I can start killing mobs, I get a tell from a level 54 Warrior, who wants to get to 55 badly. I invite him and we start killing. The Warrior has OK twink gear since his main is a 65 Druid, but nothing special, so he can't tank nearly as well as my 65 Monk with some defensive AAs. Still, he tries to steal agro since he is, after all, a big burly Ogre and likes having his brain smashed in. Try as he might, my Monk is holding agro like a champ. A successful Taunt or Provoke will make the mob turn around, but then it turns right back to the Monk. The warrior is puffing and huffing (pride, durn it!) while I am quietly smiling. None of it really matters since most mobs in Griegs are complete wimps. I don't need to heal on single pulls and an occasional Q on double pulls gets the job done. At that point, I chalk most of the agro up to my Monk's superior DPS.<br />
<br />
Then it gets more interesting. A 66 warrior friend of mine joins the fun. He has good Bazaar equipment, worth well over 1 mil pp. BoC, some Anger augments from LDON, the works. We start killing again. To my surprise, my Monk is still tanking. I make a sarcastic comment about my friend switching to a DPS weapon, so he starts paying attention and working at agro. He manages to wrestle the agro away from the Monk most of the time, but it's not easy, he has to use all the tricks.<br />
<br />
At that point I am excited. Finally, my Monk is a veritable agro machine. I should now be able to DOT at will!<br />
<br />
Next day, when I go back to Griegs, I load the DOTs and hit the first mob at 90%. Low and behold, it leaves my poor Monk staring at an empty spot in the courtyard and gives my Shaman its  undivided attention! At that point I just laughed, said &quot;Good job, Sony!&quot; and went back to DOTing at 65-70%, preferrably after the stun procced :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">heh great story. I used to challange a Pally friend of mine to keep aggro. He would get SO mad, having to bust out the &quot;old school&quot; stuff lik Flash of Light, LOL. He got a lot of respect for shaman over the course of our duoing together (we used to duo at the ZI in earth, heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You should know how to control your argo so that the tanks can do their job by now, don't ya think?  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to assume that after 4 years and 70 something days of playing my Monk, most of them without two boxing, I have heard about agro control :)<br />
<br />
In this case, however, I was looking for a way to increase my Monk's agro for the dual boxing setup, not to lose it. That was the whole point of buying a SoE and going to Grieg's End to test it, as I indicated above.</div></div><hr />

Just a thought...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, since poison DoT agro is obviously broken, it is our fault when we get agro.  Since the second most deadly line of spells we have is broken and causes undue agro.. the solution should be just to not use it.  Great logic champ.  I'm sure Sony will address our DPS problem by giving us a 1000hp/tic poison dot that you can never use unless you want to get summoned instantly. <br />
<br />
The whole 'suck it up, control your agro' logic is retarded when we all know it is something that is broken.  The REAL answer from paying customers should be 'FIX THE FREAKIN POISON DOT AGRO SONY'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'll pass on needing ANOTHER focus effect, tyvm.<br />
<br />
Dunno if you've counted, but shaman are up to at least ten already: bene pres/haste/ext, detri pres/haste/ext, magic, poison, cold, and disease damage.  If you want it, the epic agro focus is an eleventh.  If you want full haste or mana pres on your dots(affliction haste V, 33%, instead of generic detri haste 23%, and affliction efficiency V, 25%, instead of detri pres 20%), you need to make augments with a twelfth and thirteenth foci.  If you're on the GoD system, you need separate poison foci for nukes &amp; dots.  All told, that's at least half your gear needing to have a focus effect on it.  Now you want another one, who's only role is to fix the insane agro problems of a narrow line of spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lol.  Just like tanks don't &quot;need&quot; agro, or &quot;need&quot; hp &amp; ac.  They just suck if they don't have it.  Every one of those foci that I lack is a way that I suck.  It's not a matter of choices, unless you're accustomed to chosing four dollars instead of five. That's the difference in whether or not you have foci.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like fries with that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope, because I chose $4&quot;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, what you're suggesting isn't a solution.  It's a bandaid to cover up a supurated bleeding ulcer.  Oh, and I have to put on the bandaid myself!  Wearing it instead of 100hp! (holy mixed metaphors, batman!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You suck when you don't make the best of what you have. Adiquate level and gear will go a long way, if you can play you class at all.  Everything else helps, but what is totally essential? a TA?  some random focus effect?  what do you really NEED to play your class effectivly?<br />

Back to my original point, if you NEED all of those focus to play your class effectively, is it your NEEDS that holds you back, or it it you?<br />
<br />

Honestly, if you are trying say that we should need some focus to deal with the BROKEN poison dot agro..you must work for Sony.  That is the most retarded thing I have ever heard actually.  You MUST work for SOE.</div></div><hr />

You want to keep high agro?  Don't equip your item/aug/voodoo doll.  Want to reduce the gorked agro from dots? Equip the item.  It may not be the best answer to the question but it does imply some consideration towards people with different goals for different situations.  <br />

Yup, the same thing that we are asking for.... well sort of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm and whats the betting that the Chanters who dont have this focus effect arent happy with SOE's so called fix.<br />
<br />
They obviously cant fix poison aggro as its been broken god knows how long now.<br />
So why not try something radical and do away with BoS,Yoppas etc and replace them with exact same dmg/manna ratio spells using a different base ie magic/fire etc.<br />

<br />
Possibly, there could be quests to aquire augments in increments so that as the palyers level they can recieve the augments relative to their requirements to play more efectively.<br />
<br />
It's not a fantastic solution and its not the simple fix.  But it is something that may help out and something that we are much more likely to see than the deep seeded coding solution that we would like to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
So for this to be a 'solution' it would have to be readily available to ALL shaman.  Put it on a vendor or have it show up in your inventory on login or something.  This is a fix to a BUG, not something you should have to be flagged for or do some retarded quest to get.  If they do want to make augs, fine, but it had better be available to ALL shaman because ALL shaman are broken by this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hmmm the only time I even load up a Posion DoT of any kind anymore is when soloing, where of course the aggro you are generating doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Most tanks I group with can hold aggro through what another guild shaman refers to as the tri-posion special : Ancient Scourge of Nife + Blood of Saryn + Blood of Yoppa, with associated Foci and ACA3.<br />
<br />
However the reason I do not use either BoS or BoY most times has nothing to to with the obviously broken posion DoT aggro.<br />
<br />
For me Bane &amp; Sisslak are what I use while raiding and xping for a variety of reasons. They generate less aggo, tend to land more often on all kinds of mobs and with the Discordant Energy focus Bane does more damage than Blood of Yoppa and does it faster.<br />
<br />
But most importantly they are fast acting DoT's that run to conclusion most times before your typical mob in MPG / RS dies in an xp group. Even in high DPS groups they run their full duration more often that not. Where as with Blood of Yoppa I rarely, if ever see it run to conclusion, thus it's a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
If I had a 10th spell slot I might load BoY up, however I believe that even Ice Age our much maligned Cold Nuke is a better choice, with 3K+ crits and the ability to cast it more than once per mob it's a no brainer for me.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a personal choice, or a choice made depending on yer Foci / AA's or even play style. Yes Posion DoT aggro is horribly out of wack, but I really don't care because there are better spells to load up than Blood of Yoppa in most situations.</div></div><hr />

Um so necros are druids too then sorry didnt realise.<br />

*** has what base your spells use got to do with what class you are.<br />

So all these Shaman who just use Bane line are not Shaman ?.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What it is is precedent.<br />
<br />
Necros have legendery precedent for their fire based line(boil blood type of thing) and for chilling the soul of their victim.<br />
<br />
Shaman have legendery precedent, not as using elemental, but spiritual(curse) and poison, and disease.<br />
And because EQ has shamans matriculating out of a cold areas background, they chose to give us cold nukes.<br />
<br />
We get poison nukes as matter of course along with our legendary background.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changing all our poison based DoTs to fire, or cold, would give some of us a druidic tang as we are casting. We don't *all* like that ;)<br />
<br />
I'm sure if Sony worded these new spells you are thinking of correctly, it wouldn't have a druidic tang.<br />
but who here trusts sony to get things right the first time? How many months did Pure Spirit remain filed Dispell? Or Putrid Decay  slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Brothur.  Please explain to me what I'm not understanding about gear improving a character.  in what way is your higher skill (since you must have that, being 7 levels and 5 expansions behind me) allowing you to do better damage, debuffing, and healing than I do?<br />
<br />
What part of player skill would let a bazaar, or hell even a Plane of Time tank take on a mob that hits for 4500?  Or compete with a monk wielding 26/19 weapons for agro?<br />
<br />
See, I just don't get where you're coming from.  Sure, for soloing in Lower Guk, you don't need any 200hp items or any foci at all.  For doing pick up groups in LDoN, you can get by just fine with 35hp things and summoned magician foci.  But if you're claiming to attack cutting-edge content at level 70 with that kinda crap, you're nuts.  What's really happening is that people who're better geared are carrying you.<br />
<br />
You have Turgur's Insects, and Malo, and Tnarg's Mending, and Anathema.  You can join a group in Wall of Slaughter, slow mobs for them, and deal damage.  But you're not doing half the job that a well geared, aa'd up Soothsayer could do.  Your skill is I'm sure appreciated.  You can &quot;make the most&quot; of whatever you have.  But when, by the limits of numbers, it would take four of you to do as much as I do, you can't claim that aa's, gear, spells, and foci are an optional thing for someone who wants to be all they can be.<br />
<br />
LACK OF SKILL doesn't keep me from dealing 300dps instead of 250.  LACK OF SKILL doesn't hold me back from healing off the damage of a mob that hits for just a lil' too much.  But the effect is the same.  I only deal 250dps in exp groups, not 300.  I can't keep up with some mobs, healing-wise.  It's a miracle if everyone in a group I'm healing in RSS survives a three-pull; I usually lose 1 or 2 folks.  Those people wouldn't die if I had the Ancient heal and the haste focus to go with it.  My groups would get better exp if I dealt 25% more damage.  I'd do that, if I had Sisslak, and the Anguish foci.  This all leads me to the conclusion (cr8zy, I know) that to be the best he can be, a shaman needs focus effects for all his spells.<br />
<br />
Adding yet another focus on top of those is a really steep demand.  And putting it on augments?  Augs are, base, 65hp at the high end.  Like, if you make any effort at aug'ing yourself out, that's what you'd lose to wear a focus there instead.  As it is, to get the affliction haste focus, I'm planning on wearing a 45hp instead of a 90+some% augment.<br />
<br />
This arguement about &quot;when I want agro&quot; thing doesn't work either.  When I want agro, I don't do it with poison dots, I use Incapacitate.  Faster casting, more immediate effect.<br />
<br />
I think it's noble how you're willing to take on the burden for this bugged-to-hell situation.  Really, I'm sure the folks at Sony appreciate it, too.  But I'm not so willing, and don't think I should be expected to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Dunno m9, SOE's way to fix suff generally cover questing and collecting loots to compensate for 'Bugs&quot; and obvious problems.  Take Warriors for example, they need to collect armor higher AC and HP's, weapons and augmants for higher agro generation.  They don't all log in with 11k HP, 2k AC and a BoC with an anger 3 augment...  and I don't see SOE doing this anytime soon.<br />
<br />
All fixes, no matter how lame the may be, are meant to be challanging.  At some point, the reward for the challange becomes worth it to get The Fix™<br />
<br />
The question then becomes.... how much are you willing to give/do as a player to get a 'solution' to the poison problem? <br />
<br />
Keep in mind Wulf that Necro's depand on that agro to efficiently snare kite.  My 'solution' will allow them to remain able to do what they do while allowing those who want the flexability to take advantage of our poison DoT's they way we want to.  I know of a few Shaman who actually make use of the agro generated from some of our spells.<br />

I don't want to screw one class to 'fix' ours.<br />

What are you talking about?  What does 11k hp's have to do with agro?  As well, this is a known bug, not being able to keep agro better.  For someone with your gear, you sure are keen on adding even MORE gear to fix the bug.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry to have mislead you.  You being soooooooooooooo uber and what not.  I often use poison DoT's when boxing my Shaman as they are efficient and fast. I can be found in MPG and occationally RSS, but don't like to risk the group on my boxing skills or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
- m9, Glad to see that you are... o hold on, wth are you?  Figures just a nobody, pain in the ass blowing carp out there for us all to read. <br />
<br />
Dude, before talking about how great you are, just don't.  Stop talking because you just look like a fool even more.<br />
<br />
- Oh Brohg, if you are steadily fighting 4500/quadding mobs, you would think that you would be getting some better gear dropping from that.  None of the trash out there that I have ran into does... unless you want to call King/Queen in RS trash.    Maybe you are reaching to far beyond your grasp and should de level and delete 5 expansions an pwnz0r my ass.<br />
<br />
Also, I was wondering why you bother slowing if you are doing 250 DPS simply holding back from your easily capible 300; for that and your almost on par with 1.5 epic rogue DPS(about 300+/-)[non-disc of course] and close to a wizard...  (250 DPS = 21,000 per minute)<br />

<br />
<br />
So let me see here.  You box a shaman and so now you think you are up for insulting me?  You must be sensative about your penis or something, cause you are talking about it quite a bit.  So you box a bazaar geared shaman, nothing to be ashamed of in that.  However, before you go spouting off and insulting those of us that DO play a shaman as our main, try doing it yourself.  As for how great I am.  Please quote me where I said that...please, do so.  You are just digging yourself a deeper freakin hole my friend.  My gear is medium at best.  However, I do play a shaman main and not just a 'boxed' shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Dude, rogues in my guild do 220-something dps with just the backstab button, last I checked.  Not even attacking.  300 is a ranger number, and an average one at that, not even extreme.  In comparable gear dealing 250dps with full attention to casting every second is... well, is what it is.  I have to work at my 250, to be sure.  And I can't do it while main healing (which I'd far rather do. getting another damage guy in place of cleric way outdoes the damage I deal. But sometimes my groups have clerics, I can't help that.  People don't like kicking them out :( ) Shamans are not primarily a damage-dealing class, so I think spending all my attention on maximizing myself to deal less than any melee or caster is kinda how it should be.  The fact that I can outdamage a rogue from a PoTime guild... who's afk, I guess, and still reaching here... doesn't seem relevant.<br />
<br />
We're talking about what a shaman can and can't do, and how that's limited by what gear(foci) you have.  You can &quot;get by&quot; without foci &amp; mana regen &amp; aa &amp; all that, but only if other people are picking up the slack for you.  Cleric healing, Bard doing CC or HoS for you, tank being beastly and absorbing 20k more damage because the party isn't dealing more damage to the mob?  All else being equal, when one guy says &quot;I can do [something]&quot; and another guy says &quot;I can't do [that same something]&quot;, then they're effectively playing different classes.  I'm not content to define &quot;shaman&quot; as &quot;a guy that can cast Turgur's Insects.&quot;  The best foci available help make a shaman what he is, just like the best gear makes melee what they are.  They're needed.</div></div><hr />

Oh by the way... Also, I was wondering why you bother slowing if you are doing 250 DPS simply holding back from your easily capible 300; for that and your almost on par with 1.5 epic rogue DPS(about 300+/-)[non-disc of course] and close to a wizard... (250 DPS = 21,000 per minute)250dps is 15k damage per minute, Abacus boy.<br />
<br />
Why do we slow if we can do dps? I dunno, people whine if we don't... Considering I can malos on inc then click my TA, slowing takes almost no time. Usually the mob's slowed soon as it hits the camp and I can get to healing or adding some dps. The whole &quot;Slow on Inc&quot; thing isn't too bad with the addition of bazu bellow. By sticking to curses and nukes, I can do respectable damage. <br />
<br />
We can't use poison DoTs, and that's what this whole thread's about. I could do more dps if I could use poison DoTs, but they're unusable except when soloing, just like the disease ones are unusable albiet for a different reason.<br />
<br />
They need to put a dagger on some mob in Wall of Slaughter that's 23 damage 18 delay and procs enraging blow with a 400% proc rate mod or something. That would be some good times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Dude, you make less &amp; less sense.  Of course shaman soloed dragons. *I* soloed dragons.  You don't seem to follow, here: my skill is what I would characterize as &quot;very high.&quot;  There are still things that I cannot do.  If I had better focus effects, I could do those things.<br />
<br />
Maybe if I step it through in different words...: two identical situations, two identically skilled players (that would not indicate you &amp; me, btw).  One, because he has foci, can get the job done.  The other one can't.  By an inch or a mile, he missed the mark.  These situations aren't rare or hard to find, and are very easily extrapolated to less clearly delineated results.  The easiest example is one you hand to me.  The first guy can be &quot;buffer, debuffer, and occasional patch heals&quot; and the guy next to him, because he has the right set of gear, can be &quot;buffer, debuffer, and main healer&quot;.  That's a pretty big difference!  Almost as if... ready for this?... the two people were playing different classes.  As a matter of fact, it may just be the difference between a turgurbot (the class you play) and a shaman (the class I play).<br />
<br />
The role for shaman that you hold so dear to your heart, and perform so admirably, is of such limited scope that real shamans accomplish it with just click effects.  Debuffing, slowing, occasional patch healing.  Doesn't that indicate to you that a high end shaman should be doing more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think you're getting more stupid as you go.  By your current reasoning, since you can do the bare minimum required of a slower bot in exp groups without advanced foci, high end shaman clearly don't need them and should take on the burden of another one just so that their spells can perform as they're intended to.  Christmas Carpenter in a handbasket, it's all so clear now!  We should all go back to Banded Mail and Combine Spear, since we don't actually need anything else to log into the game, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">It is a real shame that you are so stupid.  Agro from poison is too high so use it at your own risk.  A simple focus could be added to help aleviate some of this exsessive agro, but no.  You won't accept this. Twelve other focus effects are all right, but heaven forbit we add another that wouls allow you to do more than usual, something that you claim to need focus effects to do.  You claim to NEED those twelve other focus effects and an array of clickies to do your job.<br />
<br />
I never once said don't bother advance, I just posed the question of NEED vs. want.<br />
<br />
Fact is, asshat, I can do your basic job as a bot, so what do you really NEED to do your job?  If you are so talanted that you can do your job and operate as main healer in RSS then you still have time to NEED to toss on a poison DoT/nuke/rain to add to the other lower DPS alternatives?  Then ask yourself, if such a focus effect became availible, why would you bether to NEED it??<br />
<br />
So get back to the point of this thread, not that fact that you are a poor crippled Shaman, but a high end player that has been cheated out of being an uber DPS class too.<br />
<br />
Poison agro sucks and I would love to see it reduced, but until there is a solution of any kind out there I will have to do what I can with what I have... and so will you.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is great to watch. Guy talks all big about what shaman need.  Then he gets found out to be just a bot that really does nothing a shaman is capable of except hit his 'slow' macro once a fight.  Then he lashes out and starts making no sense, throwing insults and like.  It is like a ball of string unwinding as it rolls down a hill.  Little pieces lashing out in all different directions.  <br />
<br />
I don't think he understands trying to do the best DPS, as well as the other things we do because..he doesn't do these things.  For me to do the best DPS available with the tools I have (spells), I should use poison dots as well.  This BUG (yes, it is a known bug) doesn't allow me to do that.  He seems to think that using the spells we are giving is something we shouldn't do...strange logic. <br />
<br />
With your bot shaman..please tell me you don't take up a group spot for him?  If you do, you are really cheating your group out of a spot...</div></div><hr />

 I don't always bot the Shaman, but I usually do.  I use poison DoT's all the time, but I use them with a bit of skill... something that you could take advantage of, skill that is.<br />
<br />
You say that you can't use poison spells, I say Bulls**t.  I use them, I do well.  I make the best out of what I have and need very little to do the basic job a Shaman does.  You seem to NEED a lot, and skill does in fact go a long way, even for a bot.<br />
<br />
I was talking about pre-luclin.  Not all Shaman could solo dragons, but some could, it was to disprove a point that skill made little/no difference; only gear did.  I kinda thought that is what you meant with the dagger, I had ghetto backstabbed back when my 1HS's blew away my dagger.  So I would have used the dagger, but only with great caution.<br />
<br />
Go forth and be fruitful and mery Shaman of Norath &amp; Luclin.  Be all that you can be and more... but never, never, never ever use your poison spells, the world may come to an end, gnomes will randomly die and a plethura of strange events will come to be as they are broken. /sigh.<br />

I am part of a high end raid guild, which means I also experiance in high end places (Rifts, PoFire tables, etc.).  I have tried really hard to find a place in a group where I can use our poison dots, but have been unsuccessfull.  These are the problems I always run into;<br />
<br />
- After completing my basic job (debuffing) there is about an average of 40 seconds (6 ticks) for me to dot the mob.<br />
<br />
- With all my focus effects, my Magic dots last 7 ticks, and my poison dots last 9 ticks.  Obviously, the Magic based dots are a more logical choice.<br />
<br />
- The only way I would be able to make my poison dot as/more effecient then even our cold DD, is if I could malos/slow the mob before it even reaches camp, then hit it right away with the poison dot.  This would almost garantee myself getting agro, since the MT would have only 2 or 3 seconds to out agro our infamous high agro poison dot.<br />
<br />
The only advantage, that I see of useing our poison dots, is it does not resist 30% of the time like our Magic based dots do (even after malos).</div></div><hr />

actually most wizards will be busy casting some of their aggro reducers and keep nuking, but I'm sure you have a bot wizard to prove us wrong.<br />
I have rarely seen someone so opinionated and so wrong in this forum.<br />

The fact is, you CAN cast these spells... nothing prevents you from doing so, but you all know that the agro is high on them, so you have to use them wisely.  Have none of you thought of a way to use these spells more wisely?<br />

This is getting more and more easy with you.  You obviously don't do more than the basic things or you wouldn't have the opinion you have.  However, what more do you expect from a bot. I mean it takes concentration to play your rogue, you can't be bothered by actually doing something on your shaman during the fight.  <br />
<br />
It has been said before, if you just malos*, slow and sit there, you won't have a problem with DoT agro.  I guess if you also wait until the mob is at 20% you won't have a problem either. I could follow your Wizard advice and wait..and wait...then wait some more..then really pour on the DoTs when the mob is at 20%.  That will sure be good.  Do you have any idea how DoTs work?  Of course not, you are a rogue.  With wizards, they also have this nifty tool to help shed agro as well.<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=752<br />
<br />
As well, a wizard can wait until the mob is at 50% and burn it down.  With DoTs we don't have that luxury since they are damage OVER TIME.</div></div><hr />

i like to know that in the end i have contributed in the demise of the mob in the biggest way possibe (and the survival of my team as well) I get a lot of kill shots, which in the end means nothing really, cept to me , it says i contributed.<br />
<br />
(small family guild, not time geared, not ELE flagged, just being the best i can be)<br />
<br />
i dont get the huge flap over this...at all quite frankly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hrmm, a little confused.  I'm going to assume you don't have Bane.  Anyway, what the heck with malicious decay?  Why in the world would you disease debuff for slow and poison dots?<br />

Disease debuff?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">rofl, Brothur, he's not on your side. I'm pretty sure your turgurbot doesn't have a side in the shaman community.  He's bulling ahead, using a broken tool, and just ignoring the fallout because the mobs he's fighting atm don't kill him for it.  I use Yoppa and Saryrn both, too, when I don't give a **** about agro, or when I have a guild tank who can make up for bad EQ code.<br />
<br />
The fact is, if any fix is possible, then it can be fixed innately in the spells.  But when you selflessly (that's a bad thing) offer them the 'out' of augment or aa fixes, then they don't have to admit that their spells are borked.  They get to **** out some line about &quot;features not bugs!&quot;  No class uses poison dots as a source of agro that they want to have. This isn't a game balance issue.  This is a bug issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">So now you can use poison spells?  I thought that you could not due to gear/focus issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">well....let him not care about aggro.<br />
<br />
personally I can use my poison DoTs in a group. if the tank is good, and the mob is at 70% or below already. this includes raid mobs.<br />
<br />
I typically stick to my curse DoTs because, despite their long recast time, they hit harder than poison DoTs, but don't have the aggro issues.<br />
<br />
so typically I can cast Bane/Anathema as soon as slow lands and not pull aggro...poison however....I would need to be prepared to cast a heal on myself.<br />
<br />
in OoW, or GoD, when a mob runs over and &quot;smacks me a little&quot;, it is usually just enough to put me near low-HP aggro range. in an appropriate group of buffers, my HP is around ~7.2k average. I've seen MPG mobs run through 6k HPs without a pause. so if you like putting your character and bot in that kind of situation, feel free, its your money. but this thread is more about issues with poison DoT aggro, and experiences with it.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to step into a mudslinging fest. there are plenty here who will step in for that. you all can continue now.</div></div><hr />

Notice the bit in there about it being &quot;unresistable&quot; and not being a DoT.<br />

Thanks, I was waiting for someone to catch that he doesn't know what he is talking about. Also, using any disease dot in a xp group setting is...not very efficient unless you are killing REALLY REALLY slow.<br />
<br />
Also, is he  the one talking about having the 'HP's to handle it'.  Maybe that is the real answer?  In places were getting agro isn't a big deal..then poison dot agro isn't as big a deal.  In BoT who cares about agro.  However, in MPG, RCOD and RSS, I can very easily lose my entire 7.5khp's in a flash.  I'm not that well geared, but it seems on par with this guy and more than Brothur.  I'm not sure how they don't care about agro most of the time unless they are fighting in zones where the mobs don't hit hard enough to matter.  <br />
<br />
I use Bana/Anathma after slow and then the new rain.  The Poison rain doesn't seem to be quite as bad on the agro as the poison dot, but I still get summoned with the rain quite often.  In zones where agro can get you killed fast, I pull out the ol' ice nuke.  Slow as sin, but better than being dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">So his solution is to pull out a 150hp/tic disease dot that runs close to 3 mins with focus in groups?  I guess that would keep you from getting agro...</div></div><hr />

But, on another note, Bane really, really is worth the time and boredom to grind out.  I am SO glad I got it.  Even if you have sisslak already, Bane is such an excellent complement, esp considering the widely available magic-damage focii available from OOW.<br />

<br />
Still, breath of uthor is 130/tic and the 56 poison dot is 214.  However, using blood and bane of nife together would be sure agro.  We are left using lesser dots because of agro.  I use Anathma instead of Blood because of agro. <br />
<br />
My best DoT combo with the spells I currently have would be Bane/Blood for a whopping 328+420 not counting focus and crits.  That is 748/tic.  124 DPS and I get summoned like no tomorrow.  I know that there are some tanks that can handle the agro, but I can state for a fact that most can not.  <br />
<br />
The issue isn't how we 'work around' stuff or make due with less.  The issue is that the spell line is broken and we are getting screwed every day it is broken.  The whole 'Make Due' line is getting old.  I make due every day with my heals and my spells that are crap dps.  We are shaman, that is what we do.  However, when we can't even use the spells we have because of a bug, then it needs fixing.  <br />
<br />
I guess maybe they are balancing the classes by our poison dot agro.  Maybe that is how they balance out us being able to use it solo but not in groups because of the agro.  Whatever the reason, it is broken.<br />
<br />
As for focus to fix it.  BAD BAD idea.  Any time you have to add items or AA's to fix poor code or bad spells, you are asking for trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necromancers that use agro for kiting have Boil Blood line and Darkness line that each have far more agro than poison.  The bugged to heck (,,|,, badword filter) poison agro just doesn't bother them like shaman because of Death Peace.<br />
<br />
Lemme excuse myself up front, though, in case you have a level 61 Mindwrackbot, too, and thusly know more than all of us about Necromancers.  Not that anyone here plays 70+400 characters besides shaman, ever :whistle_innocently:</div></div><hr />

I hope you all do what works for YOU as well, im done being insulted for my personal playing style, cant see yours so, i wont be a critic.<br />

simply, I don't get into whine sesions over things i can't fix. I work with what i have (said that didnt i?)<br />
<br />
and it works for me.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
throw in the fact that not every mob is the same, and i cant ALWAYS cast all of those, and may be healing as well....<br />
<br />
time given tho, that is how i cast....<br />
<br />
=D<br />
I do not have any GoD spells as i hate that expansion with a passion, and frankly, i am not up to those mobs, i have tried and proved it to myself.<br />
<br />
I do fine in RCoD, RSS, and MPG tho ...<br />

I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 bane :)<br />

<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
Bane is certainly worth the time, and when LDON was new, i spent eons there grinding for augs and gear...<br />
<br />
Its very hard to get people interested in LDON anymore, there are still a few things worth going for there, although now that i almost have a full set of tier one armor, im not *burning* for the BA aug like i was...and have less motivation to bother people to do LDONs when they all seem to be doing 1.5 and 2.0 hits when i am online (good fun, i love the big epic mobs)<br />
<br />
that said, bane would be worth going back for, I have not looked hard at my 69/70 spells to see if there are ones there that make bane moot, or if it stands alone.<br />
<br />
I play not to compete for best play style, best toys, best shammy, but rather for fun first and foremost.<br />
<br />
I suppose it was pointless for me to post my opinion here as these people seem to have decided everyone is an idiot who does not agree with them.<br />
<br />
Unlike other threads where people have been civil and kept their replys to replys and not attacks.<br />

As far as I can tell, all you've said about Poison dot agro is that you ignore it.<br />
<br />
i said it isnt a factor for me...<br />
<br />
my 1.5 counters a lot of hate, and i play with people who can hold aggro most of the time. (people who know how to play tanks)<br />
<br />
i also said it rarley gets me dead, largley again because of the people i play with, mobs dont escape to attack the casters very often, not even the over nuking wizzies, nor heal aggro clerics.<br />
<br />
do i LFG? almost never, i dont like to play with strangers and rarley do. <br />
<br />
it simply has not been a major concern for me, i get worseaggro from the cripple line, and yes i use those too when needed.<br />
<br />
i also never called you crazy or jerks, <br />
<br />
but my mana pool and canni abilities enable me to cast a LOT without mana deficits (and heal) I also have the AAs to crit dots , so double the damage....A LOT!<br />
<br />
as i said my mana and Hp are nearly equal, at 7k (give or take a few raid buffed)<br />
<br />
i dont try to factor mana useage into what works for the mob, or rather, i dont use mana useage as a factor in choosing the most effective spell for the mob. if it casts fast and will land more then a SLOWWW cast (considering the lifeline of the mob) i will go for a dot over a DD every time. half the time with a SLOOWWW DD the mob is dead when it lands LOL! (yes beacuse i choose to cast DD last if at all)<br />
<br />
mebbe i am talking to people with small hit points and small mana pools so apples and oranges? i dont know, but i wont judge you the way you judge others.</div></div><hr />
