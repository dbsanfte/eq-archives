<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had previously understood that most of the epic quests wouldn't work for players under level 50.  My wife, level 47 rogue, has told me that some of her quest NPCs won't even talk to her until she is 50.  I have completed the test of patience, and the test of wisdom.  I am planning to get the test of might out of the way this weekend, I lucked out this weekend being the only un-epiced Shaman in Fear, so I have the tear.<br />
<br />
 That leaves the pages/letters, the book, and neh Ashir, Kirn, and Rak.  I have all the misc pages, and the book should be fairly trivial.   I am wondering if I will be able to clear up all of the trivial stuff before 50?  That way all I will need to do is get friends together for the Hole and CoM raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess my question is...Is there a point in the quest where my level would need to be 50 to complete it?</div></div><hr />

I've done everything short of the Iksar Child, and had no problems (until one small good deed ruined everything).  I was 30s-40s at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what is the lvl you need to be to click the boots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magelo lists the effect level on the boots as 0, compared with 50 on the epic , 45 on the JBB, so I'd say there's no level requirement for the boots clicky.</div></div><hr />
