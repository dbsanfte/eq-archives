<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't see this in the Med Cabinet thread on AAEXP, sorry if it's a repeated question.<br />
<br />
LR costs 3 points per level. Does this stage up like other AA? Would level 3 cost me a total of 18 points?<br />
<br />
Level 1 = 3 points<br />
Level 2 = 6 points<br />
Level 3 = 9 points<br />
=18 points<br />
<br />
Or is it just 3 points per:<br />
Level 1 = 3 points<br />
Level 2 = 3 points<br />
Level 3 = 3 points<br />
=9 points</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it's 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that what he said?  3+3+3+3+3 = 15 pts total for LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And worth every point spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm still trying to decide what to do post QB2...  I tend to duo/group/raid mostly these days, and I don't seem to get hit all that often.  I kind of want to do LR5 on principle, but I'm wondering if I might get more bang for the buck doing some levels in SCM, RC, VP, etc first.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and I'm lucky if I get 2aa per week, so any of my upcoming AA expenditures are a pretty long-term plan. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I highly recommend a level of Radiant cure and VP. Maxed VP is nice because it knocks stuff back alot and can last long enough that the aa refreshes before the root wears off. The first level of radiant cure is nice because it's a quick and pretty effective way to cure the entire group. Especially handy in LDoN with traps. The later levels cost alot more and don't add much curing power for poison, disease or curses (only goes from 9 counters to 16 counters) the remove detirmental on the other hand does go up fairly well (1 chance 3 chances 6 chances).<br />
<br />
SCM is a nice aa too. Saving ~10% mana on everything you cast is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />
