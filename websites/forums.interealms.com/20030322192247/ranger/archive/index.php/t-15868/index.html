<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tilador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I reactivated my 2 accounts this weekend and moved them both to Legends, just to try it out. I currently have a 60 Shaman pretty well equiped, and a level 58.5 Ranger semi decently equiped.<br />
<br />
I am looking for advice on a good place to PL the Ranger, ( I want to go back to my old roots, I played a ranger for 2 yrs before I quit and gave my old acct away) I'm not really too concerned about the Shaman as it is right now, I may get him some AAXP at some point later.<br />
<br />
One of my other main questions, since I can devote full XP to the Ranger w/ the Shaman ungrouped... Should I work on getting EQ then just soloing or grouping regurly?</div></div><hr />
