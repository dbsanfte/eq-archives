<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there something wrong with our 61 Pet's HP?  Its supposed to be 58th level, but Kragg's takes it from nothing to Full.  Buff it with Regrowth and it maxes out HP in seconds.  If there are any 58 lvl mobs with this few HP, I would like to know where they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would be my guess, although I have no facts or proof to support this, that our lvl 61 pet is level 58 in order to help it land some damage on higher level mobs.....yet not having enough hps to tank for us as we've never been a true pet class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">58 pet has several k hp... duel a melee and just send pet at them, let 'em parse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">New pet is good stuff, he has a few K hps, as he can last a few rounds against unslowed PoI mobs.  He also does have insane regen.  Its not going up that fast cuz his hps are low, but because he just natually regens better than I do with a fungi on,  add replenishment to that and he can tank a good bit too.  I agree though, that the main point of his lvl is so he can hit the mobs with greater efficiency than all our previous pets.  Is also good so he can alpha weapons that have proc lvl requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think its about 2k hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah around 2k hps, which isnt bad considering plenty of 60 - 65 shamans only have around 2k unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He can tank fairly well with some cleric hp buffs. I've had him tank an add in PoS long enough to get it slowed but it was close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think he's around 2.5-3k unbuffed but that is just an estimate, I don't have any hard data to prove that.  I'm pretty sure he's at least 3k with focus of soul since it seems when I heal him at around 30% it takes him to 95-96%.  Pets have always had very good natural regen rates, the 61 pet regens around 120-150 a tick when not engaged but that number drops considerably maybe even to 0 when engaged.  He actually tanked for me pretty well in nightmare on yard trash like ravens, trees, and spiders when pop first came out and did even a little better in PoI though I didn't solo much there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure how many hp Goner has, but he can be down to around 20 percent and one torpor will get him back to full health. You probably have to factor in his innate regen, so 2k is probably about right. <br />
<br />
*note: I'm speaking of a non-extended torpor (1200 hp healed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The nicest thing about true spirit imho is the fact that it takes hits so much better than all our previous dogdogs, howler used to get thumped hard regardless of if it was tanking a seb jugg or some pesky trashmob in dl, its pityfully low level stopped it from ever getting to the point where it could mitigate annoying greens to near enough nothing.<br />
<br />
True spirit on the otherhand can pretty much tank slowed SF stuff (Lower end of the scale, regulars to matures) indefinately with almost no heals required providing you help out with the dps a bit, the little knocks it takes easily regen whilst your running to the next mob.<br />
<br />
It was pretty suprising how well it worked and it made farming my clerics SF fragments a lot easier than I was expecting it to be =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well, I for one cant wait for my new pet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1800 to 2000 hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a 2k ae sent dogdog to enrage (under 10%) <br />
<br />
was using spirit call and all 5 went enrage at the same time<br />
<br />
<br />
so a little more than 2k hps, proply 2100-2200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agree with posters 2k or so.  Much better regen, with replenishment, super dogzilla regen.  The 61 pet is my first pet that, after buffed a bit, can tank a slowed mob while i kick back on lizzard.  A serious upgrade from 55 pet.  <br />
