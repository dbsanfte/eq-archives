<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greymarch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I hunted the Ulthork Hunters and Warriors in the Eastern Wastes.  I found 8 tusks in about 3 hours of work.  I also collected fine steel and platinum from the Ulthorks, and sold those at Thurgadin, where I am considered kindly.  I then turned in the tusks to the Othmir Chieftain in Cobalt Scar, and he gave me a ruby crown (sold for 180 plat), and an earring (sold for 90plat.)<br />
<br />
I figure for the three hours I spent doing this, I made about 400 platinum.  But, I am 57th level, and it just feels like there must be a quicker, easier way to make cash.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I know that the big pay-off for doing the Ulthork tusk quest is that the Chieftain occassionally hands you a blue diamond, but how likely are you to get a blue diamond from the Chieftain?  Is the ratio high enough that it makes this type of cash scheme worthwhile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarothias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 57 solo you'd prolly make more either<br />
a) Doing Rathe mt <br />
b) pharming in sol a. Kill all the gobs in castles and dungeons and gather up thier gems/Fine steel and just sneak and sell to the goblin merchant in zone<br />
<br />
Doing Sol A i can (depending on amount of drops) get anywhere from 200-400pp an hour /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sol a is good for $ sarothias said. make shure you bank before going tho, to have most inventory space possible. it helps :)<br />
<br />
could also try the bazaar game, buy low, sell high. spider silks, velium bricks, etc. all sell rlly well if you want to farm tradeskill stuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xequecal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jaggedpine is really great cash. Do the wisps, 10-15pp per kill and a few are still light blue at 57. Griffon/Anaconda meat sells for 5-10pp each in the Bazaar. You may want to keep it as well, Baking is obscenely easy to grandmaster, 500 meats will take you from 191-250. For ~6k plat (1k to GM baking and 5k for the artisan's seal) you get two 100% WR bags, a great deal.<br />
<br />
Stay the hell away from Rathe Mtns unless you are prepared to KS other people's giants and get into KS fights over the ones you aggro yourself.</div></div><hr />
