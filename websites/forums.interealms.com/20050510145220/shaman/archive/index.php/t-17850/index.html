<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's the mob's name and why are you pushing it back? Might be able to help you, but need this info first.<br />
<br />
PS: Potions or any effects that up the caster's level for spells do NOT affect any sort of resist rate whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cast your pr/dr debuff first (insidious/malicious decay). Resist is disease based so debuffing this will help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Robby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hi,<br />
<br />
yes, i casted desease Debuffed first<br />
<br />
The Mop is from Rathe Conzil.....ohne off the 6 we have to Mezz.....sometimes it came not so fine in and we guess to correct the Positon a little.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Rathe Council is pretty much immune to disease based spells, so don't bother.<br />
<br />
Use paladins for push instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What Wulf said. Use Divine Stun AA from Paladins to move them.<br />
<br />
That said, The Rathe Councilmen aren't really immune to disease, but you will not be able to land any Shaman disease based spell on them. <br />
<br />
The SK debuff Aura of Darkness lands fine after Malicious, which will bring all resists down by another 10 points. This still won't be enough for Malady or VP.<br />
There's another trick to move them if you don't have paladins though. Make melees equip non-magic weapons and melee push them. The Rathe Councilmen are immune to non-magic attacks and mezzes won't break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Robby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hi,<br />
<br />
thanks a lot my friends :-)<br />
<br />
this informations are very nice and will help me a lot.<br />
