<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm still having some trouble with my ac and hp, could anyone suggest some gear I could attain that would help out in this department.  <br />
<br />
I'm very low on cash since most of it's been spent buying 58+ spells so I'd like some suggestions on some items I can maybe call in a small raid to get.  <br />

Thank you kindly for your time and consideration, sorry about the gear advice post, I know we see a lot of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You got some nice stuff, the whole HP package is only going to come with Velious quest armour I fear, oh and level 60. I'm jealous of your gloves, belt and mask, lusting after them myself.<br />
<br />
There are some things you can pick up that'll give you a boost if you're seriously gunning for HP.<br />
<br />
Back - Heiro Cloak, single group job (if youre lucky and he pops).<br />
<br />
Range - Sarnak Prayer Beads from Chardok bank area, one strong group or Talisman of Benevolence quest if you have good CoV faction, 1-2 groups.<br />
<br />
Neck - One of the dragon talismans would be nice, difficult if it's bad faction for you but if you see Kael arena raids regularly or get on ring wars then the faction is fixable. 1-3 groups.<br />
<br />
Edit, bah I misread your post and thought you were concerned with HP primarily, thats a very HP heavy list of mine so take it with a pinch if you are more interested in AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd sell the shield and go with an SBS.  You'll end up ahead in both cash and hps.  Ancient Seahorse Cloak and Imbued Granite Spaulders are both easily attainable with one group.  And yeah, I want your belt too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes I think people post equipement threades just to Gloat and rub it in our faces LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really don't mean to gloat.  Honestly it's not meant to rub anything in anyone's face I just seem to be stuck in a rut equipment-wise and I'm not sure where I should branch out from here.  <br />
<br />
I appreciate your suggestions on the gear changes, I think I'll look into some of those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your on dragon faction I would recommend the circlet of the falkin(sp) and the talisman of benevolance. Both should be pretty good upgrades. The bone braided buckler from the grey has a nice combo of hps and wisdom on it.<br />
<br />
If you aren't on dragon faction or can talk a group of friends into hunting some there. A dragon bracer, a talisman and the barbed dragon boots (quest from turning in a dragon head) would all be nice upgrades to what you have IMO.</div></div><hr />

Posting Magelo really helps a lot, not only do you get to see what most wear, you can get the stats in an easy to see package.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed it, made it real simple.</div></div><hr />
