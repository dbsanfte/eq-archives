<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Swear to god this isnt the same old crap... Have been talking to folks lately and I've come up with one new AA for each class.  Don't you think it would be great if there was one class defining AA that you could only get after you spent 100AA or something that would let you keep sinking pts into it forever?  Let me give you some examples and see if others have ideas.<br />
<br />
Each level would require 5AA for each class but you could sink AA into them forever and you could get rank of 9999999 in that AA as long as you kept dropping points in.<br />
<br />
Sham:  -5MR check/level to land slows.  You throw 50AA into it and you now have a -50MR check on your Slows.  This isnt going to turn the tide of much but isnt it nice if you dont have to worry about some GIMP ARSE PoD mob bouncing your slow all the time?<br />
<br />
Wiz:  2% higher base damage on DD/ level.  Wiz are there to deal damage.  I just find it kinda stupid that my wife's wiz  (who is not uber at all) is completely capped out on her max damage AA.  She crits for 5480 (granted that's a lot of damage) and no matter how much more xp she gets she'll never do more damage than that.  *correction, till she gets the new LDoN nuke, but THEN she'll never do more damage*<br />
<br />
SK: 5% higher base damage on HT/level.  Though my brother requested that as a SK himself, he'd like something that would decrease their FD cast time by 0.1 seconds per level so that they could at some point FD like a monk.  I'm still liking the HT idea though.<br />
<br />
Ranger: same as wiz but with a bow.<br />
<br />
Mage: pet will hit for 2 extra max damage / level.  Once again, sure you could have a MONSTER of a pet after a while but it would cost you a ton of AA and time.<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm..no.  My RL friend is a SK.  He has maxxed his HT damage AA and his recast time AA.  He can pump out 9K+ on a HT, and he can do it about every 42 minutes or so (Maybe more, I didnt ever keep track).  <br />
<br />
In a regular exp LdoN group I run with 2 SKs, both of whom have maxed AA's for HT.  WE love to take Assasinate missions because we can pull the named and drop it in less than 20 seconds. (2x9K + critting wizard +double backstab rogue+ Lifeburn necromancer = named dead really fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as to his gear that you so aptly sneer over, i am sure the magelo is incomplete as to his skills and the AC is incomplete.<br />

Well thought out, intelligent response Warador.  Way to contribute to the thread.<br />

In defense of his gear Gorgos, look at the server.  Loid's strongly in the minority, and I think that is Warador's 2nd or 3rd shaman (my memory fails me).  I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
That said, I agree the response wasn't very friendly.  BUT...<br />
What are your thoughts? He gave them.  A bit blunt to be sure. :p  Responding with a snipe at his gear just lowers yourself to (maybe even below) Warador's level though.  Your reply did nothing but promote this brief hijack, which I don't think is what you wanted when you created the thread. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I personally also think your idea has little merit, though it is by no means the 'worst idea ever'.  I have one of these  'I have an idea...what do you think' threads somewhere around here (hopefully buried VERY deep) where I came up with my own crazy idea of trying to do something innovative.  I'm glad it died once I had a few nights worth of sleep and realized how unrealistic my thinking was.  Keep on thinking, but be prepared to take the bad lumps with the good. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was just asking what people thought and for input, not looking for a slam.  If you dont like the idea then improve on it or move on to the next post.  *shrug* was just an idea that I was discussing with people.  Wasn't a rant about class x being able to do something or how screwed we are that we should get rez.  Was just something that has come up and a lot of people started talking about so I thought it was interresting and something folks here would discuss.<br />
<br />
I appologize for any inconvenience me starting this thread has cause... no offense ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Skills like that would compleatly over power any and all classes. Bad idea all in all imo.<br />
<br />
If your just looking to waste aa points. A sink has you said then why not.<br />
<br />
Advanced regen -- 1 more point of regen for 3,6,9<br />
Advanced MC    -- 1 more point of mana for 3,6,9<br />
Group shrink -- 5 point (way not after all it is a sink)<br />
Suspend Min3 -- for 15 points you can now zone with your pet when its suspended. <br />
<br />
Personly I think that haveing a slow that I could pretty much stick on anything. Would take a lot of the challenge out of things. Seems to me your not looking for an AA sink so much has an all powerfull skill. And once that exsists whats the point in playing.<br />
<br />
And BTW bad form commenting on someones gear like that. I am sure for his play time and guild his gear is right where it should be. Look at it this way others could point a fingur at you and say the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like your idea, but its much too powerful in your examples, maybe more reasonable would be -1mr per 5aa, would still make you stronger but not rediculously so, maybe cap it at 100aa (-20mr).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, let's look at what you just did.<br />
<br />
1) You attacked, in a much more person way than you were attacked, one of the longest standing and most respected members of this board.<br />
<br />
2) You slammed someone's gear while you still wear earring of the solstice.<br />
<br />
3) You got upset after he gave absolutely correct input on your idea.<br />
<br />
4) You made an ass of yourself. And before you say that he did too, look at his contributions/post count/time served versus yours. He's earned making an ass out of himself without anyone jumping him like that.<br />
<br />
So, in summary, shut the f*** up. Your idea what quite possibly the most idiotic thing ever proposed for eq. It makes me physically ill to know that someone can be playing a level 65 shaman with absolutely no idea of how such sweeping and impactful changes would completely imbalance the game. Pull your head out and be nice to our elders, or get the hell off of the board.<br />
<br />
Whew. I feel better now.<br />
<br />
Oh and before you comment on my level and gear, as I know you will, think about it. I have more knowledge of game mechanics when I'm drunk and haven't slept for three days than you can claim on your best day. I've been here as long or longer than 97% or so of the Crucible population, and you know what...I hate exping. Thanks, move along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The problem with Class sink aa's like this is that they have to be balanced even at the extreme and most of your Ideas fail that check.<br />
<br />
Sham: -5MR check/level to land slows. You throw 50AA into it and you now have a -50MR check on your Slows.<br />
<br />
Would resulting nearly unresistable slows after only a couple levels. Taking it up to max level and you'd be able to slow any mob in game that wasn't flagged immune. Totally game breaking in that respect.<br />
<br />
Wiz: 2% higher base damage on DD/ level. Wiz are there to deal damage.<br />
Would rapidly become game breaking once you started doubling or trippling the amount they can nuke for. 15k crts on a nuke you can chain cast continously? Remind me why mana burn got nurfed.<br />
<br />
SK: 5% higher base damage on HT/level.<br />
Once again heading straight for the MB nurf. Actually rather surprised it hasn't been nurfed already. Probably just not enough sk's out there compaired to wizzys.<br />
<br />
Mage: pet will hit for 2 extra max damage / level. Once again, sure you could have a MONSTER of a pet after a while but it would cost you a ton of AA and time.<br />
<br />
Monster isn't even close 2 dmp per level would push towards and pass what dc pets can and do hit for and we all know what verant thought about those. Game breaking dps especially considering the pet can not get aggro over a player. Hmm 1k dps mage pet that can never over aggro. yeah that would be compleately broke.<br />
<br />
Given how quickly some people got to compleately max and the basically infinite time allowed to do it anything of this nature has to be considered to the exreme because it can and will happen and will just get more common as time goes on. Yeah some obligitory aa's to just spend points on wouldn't be a bad idea but it has to be closer to 1 innate hp or mana for 1 aa max at 100 or something. Would still add 200 more aa's for most people to get but and extra 100 hps or mana wouldn't be game breaking either. It obviously wouldn't be a high priority aa either but it's not ment to be. It's ment to be something somewhat useful to spend alot more aa's on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think once your char has 'beaten' Time (not even sure what mob(s) are up there) and you're maxxed on aa's, you should simply see a &quot;Game Over - You Win&quot; screen when you log in.<br />

Only semi-joking, btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">2) You slammed someone's gear while you still wear earring of the solstice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">*laugh*  I just got lumped in with Gloriana.  Yahoo!<br />
<br />
While the proposed ideas ARE ludicrous, I like the thought.  How about a hp per AA indefinitely?  Outrageous cost for ONE hp, but you know, after LR5 and VP3, I'd probably do it.  And if you capped it at a couple hundred, it really wouldn't change much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">*blink*<br />
What's wrong with a solstice earing?<br />
<br />
To the original question: An ability that has no cap will rather quickly result in characters that can solo practically anything. Somehow. There are some amazingly obsessive people that play this game and they will find a way to do the unthinkable. I just wish I could, too! j/k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So, to recap:<br />
the problem with this idea is the absence of a cap.<br />
<br />
If we tweak the idea by putting a cap on it, have we eliminated its potential as a time sink with a reward?  Depends on the tweaks, obviously.<br />
<br />
A minus 50 to MR is very powerful, especially in pvp.  so maybe the shaman version would be -2MR for 5 AA ... capped at, what?  minus 20?  minus 40?  (pvp ... could create some serious imbalance, I suspect)<br />
<br />
or stay away fromthe minus to MR, and go to hp and/or mana pools.  These do not get limited by the caps on stats.  So ... 10 hp per AA spent, maybe.  capped at ??? any cap will get hit, but a plus 200 tohp is not really imbalancing.  a plus 2000 to hp ... or , in the extreame, a plus 8 or 10 thousand - for a shaman - vry wierd.<br />
<br />
<br />
It all comesback to how you cap it, and the caps will inevitably be hit by some players.  You will have a ceailing, and someone will hit it, and it seems unnecessary to put in a tweak like this to accomodate those &quot;very high end&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">LOL.  This thread became funny.   Yes, this is my 2nd shaman after I quit for a good while.   Thanks ;)<br />
<br />
As you can tell from my link, yes my gear isn't too good...  but it's plenty good enough for what I enjoy doing.   PKing.  That's the only reason I came back to EQ.   Not to spend 40 hours a week exp'ing for AA's.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to why your idea is the worst idea I've ever read.   :D  The gear differences between the high end and low end are way too big atm because of PoP.  This makes a Elemental/Time equipped person 10x more useful than someone geared as myself.  (I was able to goof around with some elemental/time geared characters on the ldon beta)   So obviously these people can experience for AAs at an incredible rate.  Your ideas would widen this gap even more.   I agree people who spend the most time doing something should be awarded more, but not to the to the extent where it makes them more overpowered than they already are.   <br />
<br />
In the past a high end player and a low end player could exp. in the same zones, for the same exp.   This won't be the case anymore because of the gear/ability differences.   I can only imagine what kind of mobs/zones SoE is gonna have to make in order to make experiencing a challenge for Time geared folks.  The mobs will be like raid caliber mobs for a lot of people..  meaning they won't be able to exp. there.  So they're gonna use LDoN style zones.  The problem is that even the best equipped players in EQ will continue to do the normal modes because it is so easy for them and still good experience.   So in the same time that a normal person spends AAing for these powers you suggest a Time geared person will gain 2 or 3 times as much experience.<br />
<br />
SoE has broken EQ.  Some people see it and understand it, some don't.  Some may think I'm full of ****, some won't.  It doesn't matter, I still enjoy PKing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Like I said it was a general conversation I was having with folks and wanted input... I guess the majority of folks think it's a bad idea :)<br />
<br />
I do appreciate the thought out response Warador.  If I'm ever wrong tell me why.  When someone comes up to you asking for help and your response is &quot;you are doing it wrong&quot;...well... yeah that's why I came to you guys in the first place :) it was a rough sketch that was quasi original I thought.<br />
<br />
Two general questions I have.<br />
<br />
1) How is landing slow on the first cast so insanely overpowering and game destroying as people are acting?  Mobs that were Immune are still Immune and by letting someone who works hard and grinds AA land slow on the first try on Trash mobs every time wouldnt blow the whole balancing system.  I still cant solo named guys that hit for 900 because I can land slow w/o Malos first.  I'd just be a bigger benefit to my group if when we got an add I wouldnt have to burn 6 slow attempts while pulling huge agro and getting smacked around.<br />
<br />
2) Maybe the damage increase is a bad idea, okay it is a bad idea.  I will admit that.  Fine, but the whole concept isnt hosed because of the damage issue.<br />
<br />
As for the wiz example... 600AA= 120 x5 ---&gt; 2% x 120= 240% increase.  5480 (max wiz crit my wife has done)x 3.4= 18632<br />
<br />
For a 38000 you'd need 2970AA :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1) How is landing slow on the first cast so insanely overpowering and game destroying as people are acting?

<br />
<br />
Because it would go beyond just slowing mobs first cast. Things like emp or other disease slowable mobs would become slowable with turgurs with a large enough modifier. Additionally this doesn't just effect trash mobs it effects everything. Marr for example is magic slowable but is highly resistant to magic and I have gone entire fights chain casting turgurs on him with out landing it. Turgurs instead of grummus does make him a fair bit easier and having that land sure thing first time every time would definitely change the difficulty of the encounter. In pretty much any encounter the most dangerous parts of the fight are the very start while your getting things debuffed, in position etc. If all of a sudden the debuff is faster and alway lands this part just got alot less dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hrm... I think I see where you are going with this.<br />
<br />
So, by having a Shaman with TONS of AA and spent a lot of time playing it would in effect help you to beat a Boss Mob? Where as typically he spends the whole fight bouncing slow?<br />
<br />
Interresting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It's SoE's reaction that people are worried about.<br />
<br />
After getting enough AAs to have a -200 MR slow is fine and dandy. However, given SoE's normal response to such things, they'd simply add +200 MR to all mobs, or simply make certain mobs higly mitigate or even immune to turgurs. At that point, we'd have a bigger problem than we do now.<br />
<br />
Perhaps 3 levels of -5 MR to turgur may have a chance of ever being implimented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I dont think AA sink is a bad idea for an AA extension idea. Just that there are tons of other ideas out there as well. I would think the sink would be best tailored toward something like 1-2hp/1-2mana per aa. An improved AA for slowing would be cool, but the beastlords would whine if they didn't get it. *shrugs*<br />
<br />
I don't think I'll be finishing all my AAs any time soon at any rate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The concept about AA's I like the most is that with the exception of a few defining skills, most are nice but not 100% required.<br />
<br />
Any kind of modification to slow resist would pretty much slip into the required category. Suddenly you would feel obligated to spend 100+ hours to give you that slight edge in mobs resistance. No thanks on that from me...would rather have a slight Hp or AC or Mana mod like someone else mentioned - but again nothing overpowering in that area either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Personally, I think a better idea would have been to put certain class defining spells as AA's so that you could free-up spell gems for them.  Ie Canni 4, Turgurs, identical to the normal versions, at a high cost, like canni 4 for 6aa (make it identical or slightly worse than the real spell)<br />
<br />
Its not terribly unbalancing because the spells already exist, but buying class spells so that you don't need to mem them I think would be huge.<br />
<br />
Even better would be a 8 16 24 point buy spells that would be like:<br />
<br />
Turgurs 1, higher mana cost, slightly longer cast time, 65% slow<br />
Turgurs 2, same mana cost, same cast time, 70% slow<br />
Turgurs 3, slightly lower cost, faster cast, 75% slow<br />
<br />
Canni 4 would have, worse, same, better ratio of cannibalize, eating more hp each time.<br />
<br />
Malos, and Q could be two others.  maxing out those 4 spells alone would be 96aa's. At 48 aa's per spell its pretty pricey.<br />
<br />
I like the aa's to enchance specific spells, however, I agree that they would be unbalancing and separate people for groups even more.<br />

To the original question: An ability that has no cap will rather quickly result in characters that can solo practically anything. Somehow. There are some amazingly obsessive people that play this game and they will find a way to do the unthinkable. I just wish I could, too! j/k<br />
<br />
My point was that Solstice earring isn't the best in the game, and since he's not on top, he shouldn't be looking down his nose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Timesink AA would be like this:<br />
<br />
Improved Life Force<br />
First 50 levels cost 1 AA and give you 1 HP<br />
Next 100 levels cost 2 AA's and give you 1 HP<br />
Next 100 levels cost 4 AA's and give you 1 HP<br />
<br />
Pull the same trick on all base stats and resists, adjusting the AA cost appropriately (2-3 AA = 1 WIS to start with, for example).  That would give plenty of headroom in the AA front.<br />
<br />
But they will probably put a LITTLE more thought into it than that and give us some new AA sinks in the next expansion that are a little more meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Personally, I think a better idea would have been to put certain class defining spells as AA's so that you could free-up spell gems for them.  Ie Canni 4, Turgurs, identical to the normal versions, at a high cost, like canni 4 for 6aa (make it identical or slightly worse than the real spell)<br />
<br />
Its not terribly unbalancing because the spells already exist, but buying class spells so that you don't need to mem them I think would be huge.<br />
<br />
Even better would be a 8 16 24 point buy spells that would be like:<br />
<br />
Turgurs 1, higher mana cost, slightly longer cast time, 65% slow<br />
Turgurs 2, same mana cost, same cast time, 70% slow<br />
Turgurs 3, slightly lower cost, faster cast, 75% slow<br />
<br />
Canni 4 would have, worse, same, better ratio of cannibalize, eating more hp each time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Porgy<br />
<br />
I've long thought that this would be a good idea and one that I would think about investing AA into.  If, however, the line up came out as you describe, Halas would melt before I every even considered using them.<br />
<br />
First, if they are AA abilities they wouldnt use mana. So cast time and recast time would be the only concerns.<br />
<br />
Second, the ratios that you have listed are way off.  More than three seconds for a 65% slow?  So a slow worse than beastlords, who get a fast casting 65% that only runs them 150 mana.  The 3 sec 70% slow could have situational uses, like if Im trying to slow multiples fast and I could use that while waiting for Turgurs to refresh.  The third is ok, about 2 to 2.5 secs for a 75% slow.  But I probably wouldnt get it if I had to buy the other 2 versions first.<br />
<br />
Good idea, I just think it needs tweeking.  Spend 24AA to get the ability to cast turgurs as it is now as an AA, and then spend MORE AA scaling down the cast and recast times and it would be more (IMO) usefull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AA Abilities can consume mana, so that can still be a balancing factor.<br />

<br />
I'd have to say that I'd buy, and use in many situations, the first level of the spell. It's a free spell gem! Everything on top of that is just gravy. Naturally, I'd max it out ASAP, since the third level would be one of the best AAs in the game, as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Free Spell Gem, good idea.<br />
<br />
An AA that helps you slow, good idea as long as they don't balance game content around it, or make it so good that they have to.<br />
<br />
An AA that you can just dump and dump and dump into and see a noticable inprovement the whole time, good idea.  An extra 10k hps on someone might be un-balanceing, but thats a long way out and if they get it, by that time there might be a reason for the person to have it, although that would probably break the rest of the game ala PoP.<br />
<br />
But frankly, the more they put in the game at this point, the more they break, and it will be pretty hard to argue otherwise.  From here on out, they should truly address bugs and content issues and other matters along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">These ideas may be viable though, if nerfeda bit and capped. Lets say a -1 MR check on Turgurs per 10 aa spent, to a max of -10. Thats 100 aa to burn. 1% damage increase for WIZ per 10 aa spent, with a max of 10%.<br />
<br />
Thats a TON of aa to burn guy. Also, it could be limited to &quot;Minimum 250 aa spent in an category&quot; or something, to make SURE its only the truly hardcore that are able to bother with it. <br />
<br />
Not sure if I support this, just offering up some possible adjustments.</div></div><hr />

        I don't care how many posts a person has, how great an EQ player they are, or how much better they understand the game mechanics than annother person does.  NOONE &quot;earns&quot; the right to be an ass, and not get some flack for it.  Your post is a prime example of what I am talking about.  I realize that Warador is a great contributor to this forum, and I have learned much form that he has posted (and I thank him for that), but his INITIAL response was &quot;cruel&quot; and uninformative.  I believe that if someone is going to take the time to be a leader on the boards, that &quot;increases thier responsibility&quot; to reply in a polite and &quot;dare I say&quot; professional manner.  To do anything esle cheapens their expertise. You ,Callir Spiritwalker, just looked like an ass who plays a game!</div></div><hr />

Ouch. I'm hurt. However will I continue to breathe because someone that I don't know has said I look like an ass?  :confused::confused::confused: Give me a break. Move along, please.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gutrippar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Umm..no.  My RL friend is a SK.  He has maxxed his HT damage AA and his recast time AA.  He can pump out 9K+ on a HT, and he can do it about every 42 minutes or so (Maybe more, I didnt ever keep track).  <br />
<br />
In a regular exp LdoN group I run with 2 SKs, both of whom have maxed AA's for HT.  WE love to take Assasinate missions because we can pull the named and drop it in less than 20 seconds. (2x9K + critting wizard +double backstab rogue+ Lifeburn necromancer = named dead really fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Impossible. having ut3, scf3 *which combined with improved harm touch* is the big bang you see. this can ONLY be done with a disc on for max damage. disc recycle time is 72 mins, NOT decreasable. <br />
<br />
You can decrease your UT timer, but that does nothing to lower your disc time. max ut3 scf3 id and rizlona is around 8600.</div></div><hr />

Now you're catching on! We have a genius here, folks.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I have 7 AA so far.<br />

I figured you guys would be interested to know that.</div></div><hr />

Posting a snide response because someone else 'started it' is juvenile.<br />
<br />
As far as the Solstice earring goes, many level 65s in raiding guilds still wear it.  It's a nice balance of HP/Mana and FT to boot.  No it's not uber.  Yes there is better... however, it's normally not the first thing on the upgrade list.<br />
<br />
I still wear mine - although I do look for upgrades to it.<br />
<br />
People need to stop thinking that they are justified in flaming someone just because that person ranted/flamed.  It's a self-defeating cycle and it causes more trash in threads (like MY post now).<br />
<br />
Do everyone a favor, and if you don't like someone's comment - post a feedback on them - but leave the threads unadulterated.  Please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>deadman1204</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">this really wouldnt be that great, because it would be giving an advantage to certain classes over others. ex a wiz could quad thier hearts out in fire on yellows and get unreal exp, while a rogue would have to earn them 5x slower in a group. This would be a boost to solo classes only (minus the insane ones that exp 80+hrs a week)</div></div><hr />
