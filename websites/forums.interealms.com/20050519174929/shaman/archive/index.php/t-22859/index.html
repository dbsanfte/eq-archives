<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">not that i want to shout this, incase soe decide it`s not in our best interest, but<br />
<br />
since the patches where we can zone pets i have had my pet out more, and i was supprised to see him actually hitting things, and in fact hitting for 60 fairly often, now i know that about a month back he wasn`t hitting anything. or sc3 pets, but now they do to.<br />
<br />
first has anyone esle noticed this, and second my theory is that when they did the patch that affected mage/beast/nec pets our pet was affect too.<br />
<br />
i am pleasently supprised and will loading up puppy more often now. still not amazing but certain welcome.</div></div><hr />

i pretty sure it wasnt that , i am aware of the only getting misses if not close enough, but before even up close it was still miss miss miss.<br />
<br />
now it hits?<br />
<br />
was your puppy hitting alot in time/elemental and god before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree; my average DPS is up because I have the pet out more.  The first thing I go now when I log in if I know Im gonna be on for at least an hour is get the pet up and bribe a mage for weapons.  I usually carry only one pair of rusties with me now instead of a whole backpack full, in the off chance I or my pet dies and I need to recast it.  <br />
<br />
I do think they need to look into the pet reporting thing though.  It is annoying not to have thehits being reported correctly.  Ive got a small window dedicated to pet messages and sometimes it doesnt scroll for minutes at a time.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I log and parse everything by default, mostly for my Monk's benefit. Naturally, I also look at my pet's performance. With Focus, 60% haste and weapons from SH, he has been pretty consistent 29-33 DPS on mobs ranging from barely dark blue (Mavuin's tunnel in PoJ) to 60-61 (LDON). I have seen no change in the last few months, but I'll re-check tonight just to be on the safe side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had a strange experience the other day with dogdog. I was waiting for my guild to arrive in Nadox (we were after the Spiritseeker) so I casted and buffed my pet and solo'd a bit. Everyone finally arrived and I was invited to a group for Coth to the kill spot. My pet poofed on Coth as expected. I decided I didn't need the pet so I didn't re-cast (I don't have suspend minion AA's). We killed the Spiritseeker and I recieved a translocate to bind point from the wizzy. I clicked yes and zoned into Plane of Tranquility. Low and behold, there was my pet. Still fully buffed and with rusties equipped (I zoned into PoI to make sure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, Beafly, I had the same thing happen to me after having ben COH'ed in Chardok from the entrance. Zoned back out to Burning Woods after we were finished slaughtering the royal family, and there was puppy, happily wagging his tail and demanding a treat. I thought they fixed pet poof on COH ?<br />
<br />
I do wish they'd allow us to toggle viewing other people's pets. The lag is horrendous sometimes. Also, being able to see the time left on puppy's buffs would be incredibly convenient. Nothing worse than having to sit mid-fight and mem haste for puppy.<br />

<br />
it should be said that my pet hit fine in normal ldon and in bot/hoh and below, it was only in elemental and time i noticed it missed almost every time. and i now notice that it hits.<br />
<br />
cant be sure about god as i only just got that due to guild starting to raid it.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so True Spirit with Focus, SLTW and any two non-proccing weapons gives dogdog, say, 31 DPS. Does anyone have aparse with pet weapons? I'd like to add DPS columns so people can tell what they're getting for their effort, both with True Spirit and eventually with the new pet, Farrel's Companion.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I won my first Omens rune today - turned it in and got a shiny scroll of Farrel's Companion. Once I ding 67 (perhaps as early as tomorrow) I'll scribe it and post some reports of how it performs, hopefully it'll be a bit better than just a True Spirit clone!  :)</div></div><hr />

Congrats!<br />
<br />
No fair saying you won one without telling us where you got it and which mob it dropped off of. :p<br />
