<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Caster disciplines.<br />
<br />
Like melee disciplines, these activated skills will, for a period of time, improve an aspect of the user's character.  Refresh times similar to melee discs would, of course, be part of this system.<br />
<br />
Also, to make it a little more balancing (and believable), give pure casters more discs than priests (like how warriors get more than rangers, paladins, SKs, etc).  Further, perhaps exclude hybrids from this, or give them only one or two caster discs, since they already have a melee set.<br />
<br />
Some examples of caster discs may be:  Critical Cast (sort of like warrior's crit disc; maybe exclude WIZ from this since they already have this innate ability) -- Mana Shield (where, for a short time, casters' mana diminishes each tick to put up a self-rune) -- Conservation (when activated, this disc decreases the amount of mana your spells use by a certain amount) -- Mind Wipe (this disc, for a brief time, removes the caster from the target's hate list; maybe include the feature where the caster can re-add himself even during the disc if he casts an extremely high-aggro spell).<br />
<br />
Anyway, probably would never happen in a zillion years, but just an idea :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  And as far as this maybe conflicting with AA (i.e. making casters too overpowered), I don't see that as an issue.  For AA skills, not only must you be the appropriate level, but you also must sink the time and EXP into them.  Also, to get to the good skills (which, for casters, are few as it is) you have to earn a fairly large amount of points.  Not to mention the fact that many AA skills operate on the &quot;add a modifier to a random die roll&quot; principle, meaning you basically have to get a lucky roll to see your AA skills activate.  These discs, while short-lived, will be completely reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">good concept .. I will need to think about the disciplines, though.<br />
<br />
defensive and stonestance, etc. directly benefit the melees MAIN purpose in a fight.  similar for the offensive discs ....  how does that carry over to casters?<br />
<br />
wiz have a start on that - crits and manaburn.  all nukers would benefit - but shaman and enchanters are not nukers, as a MAIN purpose in the fight.<br />
<br />
other casters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like Mana SHield concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find the Conservation attractive and also the Mind Wipe, although I think the only class that would get conservation might be the chanty because they are more about the mana recovering and mana playing stuff. But then maybe my mind is dulled from too few hours of sleep and not fuctioning. I wish all of those where AAs that I could look forward too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some others I just thought of:<br />
<br />
Mana Conversion:  For 4 ticks, the damage done to you is added to your mana pool.  EG:  A mob hits you for 100 damage, your mana is increased by 100, but you still take the damage.<br />
<br />
Deep thought:  For 10 ticks, your mana regeneration is increased by a huge amount, but still balancing.<br />
<br />
Critical Heal:  Same thing as DD but for heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know some melee discipline have both positive and negative effect, like evasive make mobs miss you more,  but same time you will miss on mob more also, how about caster discipline suggested? any negative effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mana shield would so rock :) a la diablo 1-2 that is, each point of dmg=1 mana gone.  wouldnt interfere with c4/5 as the ratio would kill it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's called Alternate Abilities. We have to earn our cool new things instead of just getting them when we become level 55, 56 or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Durnitol, refer to my edited comments about AA.<br />
<br />
Also, it's not like we wouldn't earn these disciplines.  We have to fight to get to the level they are available at first (which operates exactly the same as earning AA skills).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My opinion is I dont think we should have disciplines. I think the whole purpose of melee's getting disciplines was because they dont have cool spells or anything. Look at the hybrids, they only get 4 disciplines because they are part caster. Full melee get 10 disciplines. I think it's right that we don't get disciplines since we have spells. Just my opinion, flame me at will.</div></div><hr />

I know some melee discipline have both positive and negative effect, like evasive make mobs miss you more,  but same time you will miss on mob more also, how about caster discipline suggested? any negative effect? <br />
<br />
Personally, I think the long re-use time and short duration are negative enough effects, but you're right, some of the more useful ones will probably have to be balanced further to be even remotely plausible.<br />
<br />
So how about this (revisiting my examples):<br />
<br />
Critical Cast possible downsides -- high aggro, uses same resists as spell you are casting (so if you cast a spell that has a high resist rate, Crit Cast will not affect its chance to land either positively or negatively)<br />
<br />
Mana Shield possible downsides -- Perhaps make it a &quot;chaotic rune&quot; that only absors a random amount of hits for its duration (In other words, each time you are hit a die is rolled; if the number comes up as a failure, you are hit, if a success, an absorption).  Maybe also design it to where, as you level, your chance to absorb goes up.<br />
<br />
Conservation I feel should be one that has no downside other than short duration/long re-use time.  Perhaps make its duration shorter and re-use time longer than normal discs.  Amount of mana you save may also increase slightly as you level. <br />
<br />
Mind Wipe possible downsides -- As I stated in original post, perhaps make it where, if you choose to cast a high-aggro spell while this disc is in use, this will cancel the mem blur effect and return you to your normal spot on the hate list.  This is meant more as a means of keeping yourself alive; your groupmates or pet not being able to retake aggro before the disc wears off is part of the risk you take.<br />
<br />
&quot;think the whole purpose of melee's getting disciplines was because they dont have cool spells or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Possibly, Cerum, but keep in mind that casters/priests lack in the offensive and defensive area, so in a way, caster disciplines that focus on these two areas, for us, would possibly help balance that out a little.  And before someone may bring it up, no, AA does not count as us being balanced versus melees since they get AA also (and arguably better skills than we do :/ )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Strange, I always thought casters HAVE disciplines already... except they look like yellow spell gems instead of using up hotbuttons. And every caster has a different set: shaman have this really nice discipline that trades HP for mana maybe you've heard of it :p<br />
<br />
but seriously: while these abilities WOULD be nice, i don't personally think they make a whole lot of sense, and I don't think we casty types need the added complexity.<br />
<br />
(but for god's sake give us spell casting subtlety instead of fury!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Critical Slow :<br />
<br />
Causes the next slow spell cast to slow by an extra 24%. If the spell is resisted the disc is wasted.<br />
Reuse time ... about 1 hour.<br />
Can only affect mobs of caster's level or lower.<br />
<br />
In effect, this would be a 1 shot &quot;almost mez&quot; for melee mobs. At one use per hour it wouldn't trivialise xp hunting, and the level restriction means it wouldn't trivialise high end raiding. It would be an emergency ability to cope with adds or to allow an escape.<br />
<br />
Perhaps! This was off the top of my head, feel free to critique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Although what I just posted might be a good idea for an AA skill rather than a disc. I can't decide whether I think casters should get discs  - melees get effectively &quot;free&quot; abilities whereas we have to hunt/pay for our spells. On the other hand, do caster classes need discs to be balanced?</div></div><hr />
