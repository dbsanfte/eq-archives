<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the solution to most of our rants about class balance, about solo-ability, about effectiveness in groups. Its so simple it hurts me. <br />
<br />
We need pets.<br />
<br />
No, not stupid bear pets that are worthless, not wolf pets 'cause they are taken. I think it would be sweet if we got an eagle or falcon pet. <br />
<br />
not only would our damage output rival/exceed some of the other melee classes, but we could solo so much easier.<br />
1)send in pet<br />
2) plink away with arrows (dbl dam after 50)<br />
3) snare/dot/nuke<br />
4)heal pet and/or melee<br />
<br />
in groups the pet can be used for additional melee damage and parking.  SK have pets, BST have pets, why not rangers?<br />
<br />
more of an idea than a rant. is there a better place to post this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kullaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait, are those horse fragments I see?  They look beaten!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darlatan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL Kullaas<br />
<br />
I &quot;believe&quot; that we should have pets, more along the lines of the wizard's familiar.  Not a melee pet though.<br />
<br />
I'm not pressing for it though.  I'm still figuring what it should do.  Some mana regeneration is the only thing I feel so far.  Making it look like a fae drake would be appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it'd be neat to have Falcon Companion instead of falcon eye, does the exact same thing just looks neat. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heilos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a great idea Acturian, just make the bird's eye line of spells have a familiar graphic attached to them... very cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xeratul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Closest thing I can think of to a Falcon would be an aviak.. and I don't want one of those things following me around.<br />
<br />
A Fae-Drake (kinda like the one in the Kelethin Ranger Guild) would be nice though..  or the owl in Firiona Vie.  Surely you've heard the owl!!<br />
<br />
-Xera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>myusedone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yah if we get a melee pet it will prolly be like a 20 hp pet or like we would become a cheap ripoff beast lord rangers :P we would lose our doubble attack riposite blah blah balh yawn :P<br />
<br />
but yah that would look kewl i w0nt one of them Drake things following me around and to beable to say &quot;my leader is Neospring&quot; muehahe feels good =) raises self confidence now u got a pet following yah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How bout an Eye of Zomm style pet, neh?  Would be rather fun for exploring and pulling... :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, we won't get pets.  Pets, and Ports are not realistic goals for Rangers.  Nor do I think they really should be.<br />
<br />
You want the solution to all our class-based rants, I got it right here...<br />
<br />
FIX ARCHERY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>VaderJM4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, the solution to ranger's problems is overcompensating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sylnathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OMFG Kullaas that is funniest **** ever... I love that...I think I may use that sometime in the future<br />
<br />
BTW my co-workers think I am looney</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We have pets...<br />
The Gnoll slayer gives ya a wolfie<br />
The Elemental Brazier in UGuk gives you a fire elemental. Nuff said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pets suck. A great deal of places are very pet unfriendly. I don't want pets, and we are balanced enough to not need pets. Almost all of our 'balance' complaints are bug fixes.<br />
<br />
Again, pets suck. Please think about it. We will never be a pet class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A ranger who thinks he/she needs a pet to survive should consider recreating their character as a necro or a magician. This is not an ability our class was meant to have.<br />
<br />
As far as requests, I'd be happy if VI found a way for my arrows to stop disappearing without hitting a mob when fired...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fyrfytr Blazeseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I keep thinking of the Bud Light commercial in which the eagle returns with women's undergarments.<br />
If that's the type of pet ye invision, fine. Otherwise, leave the class alone. I love it the way it is.</div></div><hr />
