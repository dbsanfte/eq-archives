Because if you use a character as a trader it would be handy if you could pass the money to another character without having to get someone to help you..</div></div><hr />

I haven't logged onto a live server in a few weeks, but as of patch day the shared bank on Test was not supporting plat transfers......I agree that it would be great though.<br />
<br />
Edit: has the shared bank gone live yet?...guess Im not sure what date that Live patch is scheduled...at any rate it didnt have plat transfers as a feature on Test as of a few days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not live till the 11th... at the earliest.  Unless it went live and my UI sucks.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Bank isn't a part of your UI.  It's a part of your expansion (LoY gave you an extra 8 slots).  So don't worry, when shared slot goes live, you'll see it pop up.<br />
<br />
This slot MUST be a new one, because what would the bank do with two chars that are both full and now whatever was in at least one (and probably both) char's slot would disappear.  Shared PP would also have to be completely seperate.  Otherwise, it's not going to be trivial for them to combine the coin on ALL of your chars, while you're offline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shared PP would also have to be completely seperate.  Otherwise, it's not going to be trivial for them to combine the coin on ALL of your chars, while you're offline.<br />
<br />
Actually, it would be pretty trivial.  Each character on an account is set up under your primary account username.  In most SQL supporting databases, all it would take is a simple:<br />
<br />
select sum(plat) into usr_lvl_coinfield from acct where username=&quot;nnnnnnn&quot; into that field, and you're all set.  Then any char that uses the plat, all gets taken out of an &quot;account&quot; level field instead of a character level field.  At that point, it wouldn't matter what was in the character-dependant fields anymore.  The only problem *might* be the size of the fields and if a sum on any given account's coin would take them over the size limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesn't seem that easy to me.  Currently, they'd have to have it coded PP_char1, PP_char2, etc...  (so I imagine).  They'd have to add all 8 of these togather for every single user and recode the bank interface to show the result, PP_user.  Add to that, ones for Gold, Silver and Copper.  They've shown that every time they try to make universal character updates, these are much slower than expected and rattlesnake coding is rampant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Perhaps I'm missing the point, but shared PP would be just a matter of adding a pp field to the shared bank space. You could then transfer money from any char into the shared space with any pre-set limit intact. I'm basing this on what I've read concerning the shared spot (ie two more slots that can be viewed from any character). We already have 8 pp slots (one per char) so the addition of one more 'seems' easy at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, you'd think a seperate money box would be relatively simple to implement since they're putting in the shared slots anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm just excited that this means instead of my wife and I... err... cross-polinating, we can run traders on our own accounts, meaning we each get our 8th characters back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Who thinks VI will be stupid and let people transfer no drop items?  Can't wait to see the first lvl 1 decked out in SS Armor ;-p  (and no not singing steel)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They addressed this in one of the releases saying that you couldn't put NO DROP items in the slots at all (and something about LORE items also).<br />
<br />
Of course, that doesn't mean anything and I think there is a high chance that you are right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can't wait to see the first lvl 1 decked out in SS Armor <br />
<br />
Already been done ages ago.  Velious armor is MQ'able.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless a bug pops up(and believe it or not, no matter how competent the programmer, bugs -do- pop up) this will not be the case. We haven't had any instances of this as far as I know(based on server boards, chatting with other players) on test.<br />
<br />
Also the shared space -is- two extra slots underneath your current 8-16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think you will need a UI change in order for you to see the extra boxes.  As Elev pointed out they are two extra boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And as I pointed out, the Bank, like Merchants, isn't a part of the UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FJ...if you aren't using the default UI, you will not automatically get any changes to the UI.  The new bank window when LoY went live is a different UI window.  Therefore, if your UI isn't updated, even if you have LoY, you won't see the 8 additional slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And as I pointed out, the Bank, like Merchants, isn't a part of the UI<br />
<br />
You pointing it out doesn't make it so...<br />
<br />
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br />
EQUI_MerchantWnd.xml<br />
<br />
I wonder what those files might be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Kk, I stand corrected.  However, if you haven't changed a particular window from its default, you don't have to worry.  In the begining of skins, you had to incorporate all windows into your skin.  Now, if you don't have a window defined, it picks it up from the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would be surprised if you can put NO DROP items in those slots. Likewaise, i would be surprised if you can take out a LORE item out of those slot if the character that you try to do it with already has a copy of it.<br />
<br />
As for SS armor (or Kael or Thurg), yeah it's multiquestable but each and all part must be handed by someone with the adequate faction. At that point, if someone gets to the trouble of getting a level 1 to Ally with SS or Kael, they can pretty much twink him anyway they want in my book :)</div></div><hr />

Level 1 druids get snare, right?<br />
Heck, just about ANY level 1 detrimental spell would work.  You'll get the faction hit even though they resist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I haven't LoY I won't get the 2 extra bank slots?<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">you will get 8 slots and the 2 shared.<br />
<br />
i have just edited the .xml files to check if it'll work with my UI :)<br />
<br />
Bankwnd.xml   &lt;- will be used if you don't have LOY (8 +2 shared)<br />
BigBankwnd.xml &lt;- will be used if you have LOY (16 + 2 shared)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Imagine that the 2 shared bank slots as an area of the ground that only you can access, and items there dont disappear over time.<br />
<br />
You drop items onto 'your ground', log in your other toon and pick em up. You can not drop cash. You cant drop no-drop items. You can not pick up a lore item off the ground if you already have one.<br />
<br />
Pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">SOE has an OPPORTUNITY here to fix two problems at one stroke.<br />
<br />
What they NEED is an item that is<br />
<br />
   *) Stackable<br />
   *) Vendor-purchaseable<br />
   *) Useless<br />
   *) SELLS BACK FOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT (assuming the same faction/CHA)<br />
<br />
Let's say it's a Glittering Gem.  In fact, a series of them - Glittering Rubies for 100p, Glittering Sapphires for 1kp, Glittering Diamonds for 10kp.<br />
<br />
Glittering Rubies cost 100p from any vendor if you have max faction with that vendor.  You want to transfer 2000 plat to your twink, go buy a stack of 'em and put the stack in your shared bank slot.<br />
<br />
Now, let's say you want to buy something from someone for 200,000 plat.  Go buy a stack of Glittering Diamonds for 10000 plat each.  Sure beats being plat-bound.  OK, ok, this is much less of a problem now with the bazaar, but still.</div></div><hr />

My experience has been that if a high lvl person is fighting a mob and a low lvl noob attacks the the mob the high lvl one is fighting the mob with kill the low lvl noob in one hit  :D <br />
<br />
I know this from farming paineel guards and Ice giants<br />
<br />
One time i had this lvl 1 erudin necro that kept bugging me while farming guards, he kept trying to get me to grp with him, then he attacked the guard i was fighting and even though i had the guard more then half dead he turned and got the noob in one smack HaHa!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh Ye Gods, I would love to have that happen to me! I think I would soon fall down dead next to the n00b just because I wouldn't be able to stop laughing long enough to defend myself.</div></div><hr />
