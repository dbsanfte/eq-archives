<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok where are the threads on puppy dual wielding and procing weapons?  I did a search on: alpha, puppy, dogdog, dual wield(ing), pet (did not work) and all sorts of combo's.<br />
<br />
As a side note the Luggold Daggers that drop just outside of the Crypt of Nadox are kinda nice - 6/18.  They do not proc but puppy was doing some serious poking to the point where I had a rough time keeping aggro unless I really loaded the dots or nukes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm confused.  You seem to know about everthing already, so what were you looking to the threads to provide?  empirical evidence &gt;&gt;&gt;  thread claims.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused as well... of course, a 1/100 dagger would perform just as well when given to your puppy, so maybe you do need to look up some threads.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, turn his taunting off if you want aggro.  If my puppy isn't taunting, I can draw aggro with no more than two spells (slow and dot) normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I want to reread them for ideas on summoned items and other cheap weapons (vellium wpns, etc).  Especially since I have the 55 puppy and want to get as much from im as possible.<br />
<br />
Taunting was off : ).  He just was hitting very quickly and outdamaging me for the most part.  Are you saying that the weapon delay does not effect puppies swing times?  I have not had any chance to really parse it but I gave him some vellium weapons before the daggers and he seemed to be swinging ALOT faster with the daggers.  When puppy had the velliums he was procing them but I had to work to not keep aggro  ( I share tanking with puppy, he tanks for a fight then I tank for a fight makes that /pet taunt hotkey very well used).<br />

Anyone confirming ?<br />

bored to carry weapons/doing bazaar stuff for my dog i'm looking for something summoning one hand weapons, any idea ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't had a pup yet, but I would like to know, if a pet makes the kill will it disappear like when a NPC makes a kill?<br />
<br />
Also, why would you not want your pup to have aggro?  Is he too hard to keep healed or is it something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was curious about weapon delay on project Alpha as well.  Does our puppy even care about weapon delay?  Some of those weapons that drop regularly from pirates in Dulak are good pet fodder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">give him some level 62 mage weapons  , fist or blades , thats all you will ever need.<br />
<br />
Oh and if your going against alot of casters , gnoll hide lariats can be of us sometimes. But in general Fists or blades from a mage is where im at , 150dd nuke is nice and you got 3 to choose from according to the mobs. Fire/Ice/Magic.  Gotta love it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pet delay was fixed years ago. Two weapons activate dual-wield but will not affect the delay of your puppy paws. <br />

<br />
Hehe, no the mob will not disappear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the weapons have to either have ALL or NONE for the race for them to work. For instance, a broken blam stick (30/40 1hb NONE/NONE) is a great pet weapon, but your pet can't use a weighted axe (which is only large races).<br />
<br />
Also make sure that the weapons aren't both primary only... if one weapon has a restriction as to where it can go (i.e. secondary only, or primary only) be sure to give it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in the Bazaar today and thought I'd try out that Muzzle of Mardu (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1348).

<br />
The Belt was 20pp, and worth every copper.  Dogdog was a machine!  The belt added a tons of Hp.  Dogdog was able to tank 10 times better then previously (which he did VERY well while I was rooting adds and such).<br />
<br />
If you know you're going to be heading for a long solo sessions (or a long session where you know you'll be using dogdog alot), I suggest as you head to the Nexus for a KEI to take 5 minutes and stop in the Bazaar and pick up some of these No Rent items for dogdog.  You'll be amazed at the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, Mages have some *incredible* things to give your dog.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things I've learned as a Beastlord (Afaik, all these apply to Shaman pets):<br />
<br />
In general, there are two reasons to give weapons to a pet:<br />
<br />
1) to activate dual wielding<br />
<br />
2) to get whatever proc is on the weapon<br />
<br />
Other than that, weapons have very little effect - as stated previously, pets ignore weapon delay these days.  Weapons can increase the maximum damage of a pet, but only if the listed damage on the weapon is greater than half the pet's normal maximum damage. (You need some pretty expensive weapons to have that happen, unless you want to use two handed weapons and give up dual wield on your pet.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you do get proccing Mage weapons - give the dog a dex buff!  He'll be spamming that 150DD proc like mad.</div></div><hr />

Damn. I clicked the link for that girdle. DAYUM! OMG! I HAVE GOT TO GET THAT FOR MY LEVEL 39 PET! Sorry for the caps....but one single question. Would the girdle work for a level 39 pet? Or do I need something special?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">in my exp those 61 mage weapons dont work for the lvl 55 pet  (<br />
<br />
thus they wont proc for the lower pets; however i just tried the blades, but cant see that the fists will differ.  <br />
<br />
Can some one confirm this?  Even if it not what we want to hear !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fists proc at lvl10, I think all the others proc at lvl40.<br />
<br />
So if your pet is 10 lvls lower then you, the lvl39 dogdog CAN proc the Fists (I know my lvl44 dogdog can), but wouldn't be able to proc the other weapons until I got the lvl55 dogdog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would be suprised i think on how many mages are more then happy to simply trade for buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just a note......  When my dog was dual weilding mage weapons + mask, his DPS went up from 21 to 31 in PoV.  This was with SoV and FoS.   A pretty nice improvement.  I don't believe that counts proc dmg either (if there is any).  The 21dps pet didn't have any weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Also get the mage summoned armor, helps your pet tank twice as well.<br />
<br />
Ya know, that red no rent bronze crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I read somewhere that the reason to give your  pets weapons besides the dual wielding was to get them off of the hand to hand combat table which is capped lower for &quot;warriors&quot;, than their other skills.  I'd think if this was the case, I'd want to avoid the fists (aren't they h2h??)  I only have the 34 pet so it probably doesn't matter for me yet :-)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that I read it on this board but it was only in one thread if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've never seen any evidence that weapons perform better than hand-to-hand.  I've heard it mentioned offhand, but I doubt it makes a difference.  Pets are all NPCs, and I'm pretty sure that NPCs perform the same no matter what sort of weapon they use (unless they are using a proccing weapon).  This is what makes the Disarm skill mostly useless, unless you are fighting a mob that is dual wielding (to get him down to one weapon).<br />
<br />
Didn't see the answer to this one, but all of our pets can dual-wield, since we get them starting at level 34.<br />
<br />
Velium weapons are really not any better than regular weapons, and I would never go out of my way to get them.  The proc damage is less than 10, and it is resisted a LOT when fighting most mobs, due to the fact that your pet will be light blue a lot of the time.  When fighting Gorangas in ME that were a little lower level than me, my pet's proc stuck about 10% of the time, and I bet that one was partially resisted.<br />
<br />
Unless I am soloing and my pet tanks, the only thing I do is give him two of whatever weapon is lying around, and Celerity.  If he is tanking, I'd probably just toss HoS on him as well and call it a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">okay thanks!  Next question.  How does dogdog pull anything off you if you are standing right there swinging with him?   Other threads I've read (on mage boards as well as here) have stated that if any PC is in melee range, then the pet will be ignored.  Has this changed as indicated higher in this thread?  I've never bothered turning off taunt on my shaman or my mage because it didn't seem to matter based on my reading or experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I tanked with my pet a lot as I was leveling, but recently I’ve been teaming up with a friend playing a level 57 ranger and he also has a 57 cleric on a second account.  The three of us make a great team.  Anyway, when I was tanking with my pet I left his taunt on as well.  And it didn’t make any difference for me either.  As long as I was fighting along side my pet the mob ALWAYS attacked me.  Since the lower level pets tend to be somewhat fragile, this worked out just fine.  I always positioned myself so my pet was biting the mobs butt, so I think I’d notice if the mob were to turn around and redirect its attack.  Lately I’ve just been slowing and buffing, so I don’t know if anything has changed, but I expect if you want your spirit companion to tank you’ll have to stand back and cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's not very significant, but NPCs (other than monk NPCs) do have a lower hand to hand cap than other weapons skills. Hence, for instance, AoW has higher damage output when he's wielding a BoC (Warriors have parsed it). Beastlord pets on the other hand, actually LOSE Damage when they have slashers etc equipped, because they have a high H2h cap by comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The True Spirit pet (level 61 spell) can handle the Warders and Warrior in CT. He does such a good job of getting agro that no matter what i do they Summon him not me, hehe. However I ran out of Shiv's and tried the same game with an un armed pet and he could bot get them off me.<br />
<br />
I have not paresed the data but he normaly hits the Lizard 16 times between the lizards hits. A fare few of those are 50 to 60 damage (One of those 16 was a kick for 24)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Matdowns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the weapons have to either have ALL or NONE for the race for them to work.

<br />
I don't think the race has to be all or none for a pet to use a weap.  The example you used was a weighted axe (2 hand slashing).  In my experience my pet has never used a 2 hand weap.<br />
<br />
I don't know wether pets do more damage with 1 hand slashing over say h2h weaps, but I have heard he is based on a warrior.  For that reason I even shy away from piercing weaps since warriors have that capped lower.  Gnoll hide lariats are still my favorites because of the stun proc.  This is especially useful when fighting caster mobs that heal or gate.<br />
