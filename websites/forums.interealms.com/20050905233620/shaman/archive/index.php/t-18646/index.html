<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larbonal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a heads up, I have my own domain, so for every site I visit that asks for an email address, I give my email address as &quot;site&quot;@&quot;mydomain.com<br />
<br />
I recently recieved a Scam for paypal users requesting that I reverify my information.  It basically wanted me to fill out all my information again including my credit card info, without even asking me to log into my paypal account.  It was sent to interealms@mydomain.com   <br />
<br />
So everyone else out there beware, and to the admins here, either someone sold or stole our addresses, either way, shame on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got the same email.  However, I'm not very gullible when it comes to unsolicited requests for money, and didn't fill in the information it wanted.  It does look remarkably similar to other legitimate Paypal emails that I have received.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These emails actually use a bug in IE that incorrectly displays web addresses in the address bar. They put in &quot;http:/www.paypal.com[undisplayable ascii character]@scamsite.com&quot; and only the paypal part shows up but it goes to the scam site. You can see the whole thing by coping the link and paste to notepad and see where your really going.<br />
<br />
It also goes to http:// ALL paypall stuff is https://<br />
<br />
Make sure you forward all of these to spoof@paypal.com</div></div><hr />
