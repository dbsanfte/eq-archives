Personally, I think this sucks. you just KNOW you're gonna have to recast focus on people because they forgot to click shielding off, which means memming single target and wasting more time. I mean, shield of maelin is only 300 mana, if they really want to keep it they can just recast.<br />
<br />
Anyone else's thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally if they dont drop it before focus goes off, oh well. I see clerics get pissy about it when they cast HoV and completely agree if you were that worried about a particular buff you would of made sure you could get it.</div></div><hr />

I think you are referring to the cleric self only line of shielding spells.  The reason that most clerics didnt complain is because that although  the best in the line (Armor of the Zealot) is about 100 HP less than Focus it has mana regen and an AC component that stacks with their own hp buff spells.  If they want the stats from focus they can always get an Infusion.</div></div><hr />

Amazing...Shamans complain for months and can barely get looked at.<br />
<br />
Chanters (apparantly the favored class among the SOE developers) complain on one VERY minor item and it gets fixed in a week.<br />

That's because to fix the shielding stacking issue all they had to do was add one line of data to the spell file, and there are no balancing issues to consider.</div></div><hr />

Huh? Where'd this come from? I've heard nothing about it on the chanter boards. I read about this change on test on the wizard boards and came here to find out what the shamans thought about it.<br />
<br />
Personally, as an enchanter, I always want FoS over Maelins. This change would be very annoying to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm sure that some INT casters have wanted this change for as long as clerics have. Clerics just wanted it badlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How many casters really want nearly 200 less hp and 40 magic resistance most of the time?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Belanar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No, as a cleric (I play both) I wanted to use Zealot for mana regen when nine wasn't available, although I didn't mind recasting it.<br />
<br />
There is no similar reason for me to want to use Maelin's, since I consider 194 hp more valuable than 39 ac and 40 MR pretty much universally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why demand an infusion upgrade or group IoS. I may have a bad memory, but I can't recall ever being asked for IoS. Most here agree stat buffing sucks and is nearly pointless, even my small guild of very little raiding is nearly capped in stamina, str and other dubiously important stats. I don't want a useless spell given to me, just to play the tit for tat game with beastlords.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I wouldnt get the spell and put it in my spellbook, but I don't want SOE to ever point at those IoS upgrades one day when they are refuting that shamans have been ignored by SOE:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">so does this mean we should be getting an upgrade to infusion of spirit and a group version too?<br />
<br />
They gave it to beastlords (the group version anyway). Tureptan Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Live). I *think* it's their turn-in spell.<br />
<br />
I think this new change will be annoying, but I already have and afk message macro set up for people who didn't pay attention to /gu 'MGB FOCUS INC!!! Last call for misc buffs before we start!'.  It's very simple!<br />
<br />
/afk Nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I had a cleric ask me for IoS once.  I had to look at the pull down menu's before I even realized I had the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hey, IoS is useful... for twinks.  Couple that with altuna and the single target buffs, and you can get more hps, and closer to the cap on every meaningful stat (dex being most important, so you can cap those damn melee skills while flying through the levels at a stupidly fast pace).<br />
<br />
But ya, after level 49 the spell is worthless.  I had way too much mana in a pov group (was level 55 at the time) and I thought I'd do the IoS/altuna/single stat buff cycle over hos, thinking I would bring everyone a wee bit closer to cap.  After landing IoS and altuna I'd ask the person what stats weren't yet capped (so I could single target buff that, and cap it).  5 other people in the group...  not one was above level 58...  the ONLY stat that wouldn't have been capped just by friggen HoS on ALL 5 of them was agil.  and I can already single target buff that POS, should I be drinking enough to actually think it was worthwhile.<br />
<br />
As far as the stacking goes, one can only hope that all the /test server shaman will /feedback the issue, and somehow, someone, somewhere will actually listen to it.  Not much of a chance of that happening though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I dont see the stacking as much of an issue besides that occasion clicky melee that forgets he has sheilding on from earlier.  Also i know some melee with clicky actualy prefer sheilding for the ac boost.<br />
<br />
As for ios it is a good spell for clerics and others whos self buffs block focus.  since alot of these do not have max sta and often dont have max dex.  A good cleric or wizzard will often ask for ios and dex to increase crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">since alot of these do not have max sta and often dont have max dex<br />
<br />
You're not at the level where a shaman isn't as useful as a beastlord or enchanter.  For those who are, stats are already FAR over the cap.  IOS is a wasted buff slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hes talking about melee crits.<br />
<br />
<br />
my chanter almost never wants focus over shielding...but I play on a zek, so if I snagged an ornate bp for my rogue I still woulndt want focus...come to think of it, if I could get shielding for my Shaman I would never want focus.<br />
<br />
but what the hell would any blue server caster care about ac/mr for in normal exp/raid settings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">65 wiz, 65 enc, 61 shm here.  I use Focus about as often as I use my Shield of Maelin; it just depends on the scenario.  The fact that people don't pay attention at buff times is the problem, not stacking.  Focus should NOT overwrite Shielding, and people SHOULD pay friggin' attention at buff time.  Also, the fact that melee BPs have Shield of Maelin is wrong altogether, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For most experience groups or LDoN adventures - I'd much prefer shielding. In this sense the change will be great - I won't have to go running when focus starts being cast.<br />
<br />
For most raids - I want HP. In this case I would view it as my responsibility to drop shielding first. There are a few exceptions where I want all the MR I can get, and in that case shielding blocking focus will be a very good thing.<br />
<br />
All in all - it has been an INT caster headache for years and a very easy fix. Bout time.</div></div><hr />
