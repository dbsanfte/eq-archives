Ebay is buying paypal and will no longer support transactions for virtual property.<br />

<br />
PayPal is a nice concept, but they have **** for customer support when you have a problem.<br />
<br />
I've bought a few things off E-bay and used PayPal like most people do (no, not EQ things.)<br />
<br />
Had a couple of small problems, and PayPal doesn't really have a tech support phone number, they want you to do everything through e-mail.<br />
<br />
So perhaps E-Bay will change the company around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vebran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never used this service before, but what does it really change?  When you buy plat or items on playerauctions do you actually have to tell Paypal why you are transferring money to another persons account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think that it would be hard for Paypal to regulate what items (in terms of online merchandice) are sold through their services. What kind of program would they put into play to stop people from selling online items? Sure they can declare it illegal. SoE declared it illegal, yet people still do it with services like playerauctions.com. <br />
If Sara X wants to sell her character through playerauctions - I'm sure once she found a bidder, she could sell it to the bidder as &quot;X furniture item&quot; (or whatever she chooses). There's nothing to stop her from changing the name of the final winning item just so that she can sell it on Paypal. <br />
<br />
I really don't see this having any impact on the online selling community. And furthermore, I'd like to see what Paypal is going to do to stop people who sell their items and accounts.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.<br />

<br />
I've used paypal for buying a lot of goods over the internet (not EQ stuff though!) When you send money to someone you can attach it to a specific auction in ebay or you can just say it's for non auction goods or services. You can then be as explicit as you want in the description. <br />
<br />
I usually put a message to the seller along the lines of...<br />
Hi soandso,<br />
<br />
here's the money for Tony Hawks 3 for the gamecube<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
just to remind them what goods I want. You also get the option of giving the seller your address, so if it's a service that you can receive via e-mail then you wouldn't have to give out your address.<br />

<br />
&lt;b&gt;Spotted Dick renamed to spare shoppers’ blushes? &lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
                      A supermarket chain may rename one of the nation’s<br />
                      favourite puddings to save shoppers from blushing when<br />
                      they buy it. <br />
<br />
                      Tesco is asking customers if they want spotted Dick<br />
                      rebranded as spotted Richard after it noticed sales of the<br />
                      pudding lagged behind those of other traditional desserts.<br />
<br />
<br />
                      Bosses were puzzled at the sales figures after taste tests<br />
                      of the pudding met with positive feedback, so further<br />
                      research was conducted on 1,200 customers. <br />
<br />
                      The results showed that men felt bashful about buying<br />
                      the suggestively named sponge and raisin dessert,<br />
                      especially from women checkout assistants. . <br />
<br />
                      Jacqueline O’Neill, from Tesco, said: &quot;We want to know<br />
                      what our customers think. <br />
<br />
                      &quot;On the one hand, spotted Dick has been a favourite dish<br />
                      for decades, and so many will want to keep the name. <br />
<br />
                      &quot;However, we also know that many men have been<br />
                      embarrassed by the name because they seem to believe<br />
                      it may be interpreted as a comment upon their own<br />
                      personal condition.&quot; <br />
<br />
                      While 98 per cent of male respondents listed spotted Dick<br />
                      as among their favourite desserts, 78 per cent admitted<br />
                      its name made them feel uncomfortable. For 7 per cent of<br />
                      men, buying the dish under its current name was a real<br />
                      trial when facing a female checkout assistant. <br />
<br />
                      A further 3 per cent of mainly young men said they would<br />
                      avoid the ordeal entirely and head for a checkout with a<br />
                      man behind it. <br />
<br />
                      However, women were more low-key, registering only<br />
                      slight amusement at its name which has caused much<br />
                      mirth in classrooms over the years. Meanwhile, Tesco will<br />
                      quiz customers to see if they want the pudding rebranded<br />
                      when it launches a new range of desserts next month. <br />
