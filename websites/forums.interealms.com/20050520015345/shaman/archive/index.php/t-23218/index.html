<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see the other thread linking all the bitching about Druids getting a Rez-Like AA and Shaman not.   <br />
<br />
And while I can agree with it about 50%.   The other 50% noticed a more critical question.<br />
<br />
If you look at all the AAs.  It appears each class is getting only 1 completely new AA.  The rest are AA upgrades to Class, PoP, Gates AAs.<br />
<br />
Druid's 1 New One looks like the Rez.<br />
Shaman's 1 New One Looks like a Group (MGBable) Hot 400 HP tic + 100 Endurance.<br />
<br />
So the real question is, if my suspicions are correct and each class is only getting 1 &quot;New&quot; AA.  Would the Rez be worth giving up the group HOT?<br />
<br />
((Course since classes arent on, they might be getting more than 1 new but it just looks that way atm))</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had to choose only 1 &quot;new&quot; AA between rez and group HoT, I'd take the HoT over a rez anytime and everytime.  <br />
<br />
Looking at the amount of the heal, it almost looks like that the devs may have listened to the shaman community request for a group Q?   I'm scared to believe SoE may actually have listened.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isn't your primary a druid, Corlathist?<br />
<br />
I think phrasing this as &quot;please pick one&quot; is disingenuous on your part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if i knew the stacking issues of the HoT, i could answer.<br />
<br />
Good point.  Just looked at Lucy.  Looks like its slotted same as Wood.<br />
So will stack with our own HOTs, and the Cleric HOTs (aa one included)<br />
and paragon.  But not with wood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm.. the AAs for Omen haven't been released yet to anyone.  That is just info from a third party program.  Rashere on the summit forums has pointed out that this is not the AA list for Omen.  Just be patient and I'm sure that someone will have them posted without minutes of when they are inserted onto beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Isn't your primary a druid, Corlathist?<br />

<br />
Heh, I don't use phrase primary (though my guild would).  619 AAs on my druid 617 AA on my shaman.  Druids got 290 Days Played and is 2.5 Years old, Shaman has 260 Days Played and is 3.5 years old.  Ranked in top 15 in hps on my server on both classes.   To me personally, their totally interchangable.<br />
<br />
Anyway this is just a guess.  but unless you can find me a 2 new (not upgraded) AAs for another class, it is just what it looks like to me personally.  <br />
<br />
Truth is for my Druid, I'd prefer the elemental looking AAs that Im guessing Mages are getting to the Rez.  Same question would apply to them.<br />
<br />
Edit: PS: I'd love for my shaman to have both incidently :&gt;  that would be obviously to anyone the best answer of all.   Who would foolishly pick between, if ya can pick both.   But, that might not be an option.</div></div><hr />

but that would break teh nda !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whether they're planning to give each class &quot;one new AA ability&quot; or not shouldn't matter.  Shamans are one of the classes that's behind the power curve for a lot of environments ATM - such classes should be given what it takes to fix them regardless of some stupid arbitrary restriction like &quot;one new AA/class.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its also distinctly possible shaman are getting both the rez and the MGBable HoT, lord knows we can use all the little twigs we can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Figuring the HoT is something we should have gotten 2-3 expansions ago (our hybrid and the other 2 priest classes got it), choosing one or the other is not an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont see where one should or is mutually exculsive of each other. They are both necessary, needed componants to todays game. People will often wait for a cleric/paladin to show for a group just cause they can rez, especially in the lower levels or in places that there are no graveyards.<br />
Its not going to be game breaking, people arent going to turn down clerics for druids/shaman unless they would have already.<br />
SOE, at the players requests and movements, has made EQ a fast paced game. They need to give us the tools to keep that pace, or our class will fall at the way side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shrug, guess I phrased this wrong.  I don't think the two should be mutually exclusive AAs.  I'd agree with all the posters on that.<br />
<br />
But my question is, if the big wigs had decided they were mutually exclusive.  Is either so much better than the other, that shaman should argue for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Given a choice, I'd take the rez option.  Hands down.<br />
<br />
In addition to saving time in group/raid CR, the fun part is the risk free sensation of doing all kinds of crazy things and not worrying whatsoever about bugging someone for a rez or having to chose to eat the loss.  <br />
<br />
That would be good.  <br />
<br />
From a balance prespective, it would seem a lot of possibly significant items are looming, and this clearly isn't the last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I really do not want a rez ability.  Imagine all the peeps begging you for a rez, on top of all the peeps begging you for buffs.<br />

I'll have to swap out my primary and secondary to look like a rogue or warrior if it ever happens.<br />

I think whoever gets this new rez, it will be &quot;summon to corpse&quot; only, and wont return XP. That would definitely cut down the requests for rezzes, but also not help if we die soloing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There is a list of AAs out there.<br />
<br />
Seems the rez druids get is no XP rez.<br />
<br />
What seems to be shaman only is the following:<br />
<br />
6897: 31352 Spiritual Channeling<br />
6898: 31353 While this ability is active, all of your spells will be fueled directly by the energy of your body, consuming hit points rather than mana.<br />
6899: 31354 Spiritual<br />
6900: 31355 Channeling<br />
6901: 31356 Boon of the Ancients<br />
6902: 31357 Use of this ability creates an enhanced version of your Call of the Ancients ward. Increased ranks improve the healing capabilities of this ward.<br />
6903: 31358 Boon of<br />
6904: 31359 the Ancients<br />
6905: 31368 Ancestral Aid<br />
6906: 31369 Through use of this ability, the shaman can call upon their ancestors for aid, providing healing and rest to their group.<br />
6907: 31370 Ancestral<br />
6908: 31371 Aid<br />
<br />
Couple of other cool AAs are new spell gem, new possible FT/regen max, really there is alot of stuff in there, enjoy.<br />

Cast by you: You call the spirit of your fallen colleague back to its body. <br />
Cast by other: Someone calls the spirit of the fallen back to its body. <br />
Game Description: Revives a slain ally, restoring a great amount of their lost experience.<br />
<br />
I dunno if this is right, but that is what I thought was on the table.  The only variable was the percentage of the exp.  I know people are talking about a no exp revive/res option, but this seems to indicate actual ressing is involved.  <br />
<br />
Is there newer information about it?</div></div><hr />

The spell msg still shows exp returned because it's a copy paste of an old spell but aa description is no exp.</div></div><hr />
