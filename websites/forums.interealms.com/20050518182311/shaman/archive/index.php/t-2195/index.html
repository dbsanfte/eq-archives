<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard different things when it comes to torpor and getting the first skill in SCR. Some say it increases torpor time with one tick, some say it increases it sometimes, others says you need SCR3 to get one more tick.<br />
<br />
Can I get an confirmation from someone that have or had SCR1? Does it increase it EVERY time with one tick, if not how often does it increase it?<br />
<br />
Also, do you need Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery to get 2 extra ticks?<br />

SCR2: 15%<br />
SCR3: 30%<br />
SCRM: 50%<br />
<br />
Base time for Torpor is 4 ticks.  Notice that to get an extra tick, you will need at least 25% extra time on the buff.  (4 * .25 = 1.0)  So, you'll see the first extra tick at SCR3.  SCRM will give a second tick (4 * .50 = 2.0).<br />
<br />
SCR1 and SCR2 do nothing to help Torpor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 1 ding in SCR.<br />
<br />
I get 1500 point torpors (God I love being able to say that) about 1 in 3 casts. <br />
<br />
I belive it has to do with lag. If your torpor will end right after a server tick, you will get the benifit of the doubt and get an extra tick. This can happen with 300+ ping times on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Take that information as you will but remember casting right at a server tick will make it happen more often. if you dont have spell casting haste.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, I have heard that theory before  Megumi, unfortunately its just a theory before you say you HAD that skill  and TESTED it at SCR1,2 and 3. Have you? :)<br />
<br />
The thing is, several others have said that it gave them an extra tick just to get the first skill, so still a little confused. Dont want to invest in the skill yet if I have to get 12 points to get any effects from torpor. Id rather put it in Spell Casting Mastery.<br />
<br />
Edit: Read your post after I posted this SnowwSilverhammer, interresting theory. Im playing from europe so have some lag =p <br />

SCRM: 50%<br />
[/B]<br />
<br />
This has been nerfed to 20% now :(<br />
<br />
And yes, torpor is extended with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression that SCRM was always 20%... on top of the 30% increase from SCR3.  Hence 50% cumulative effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a cable connection ... most times my ping times are in the 120 +- 25 range.<br />
<br />
At SCR 1 If I ever got an extra tick out of torpor I didn't notice it.<br />
At SCR 2 I get an extra tick out of torpor maybe 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
I'd guess that at SCR3 I'll get an extra tick everytime, rarely 2 extra.<br />
<br />
I'd guess that at SCR4 I'll almost always get 2 extra ticks.<br />
<br />
Just a data point (and speculation) for those who are wondering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With a 120 Ping you have 1.2 milliseconds transfer. So time to go and come back (I think is 2.4 milliseconds. <br />
<br />
That isnt much of a window to get the extra tick.<br />
<br />
I normally have 350 to 450 ping. (Thanks Dial up and Duel boxing)<br />
<br />
So between 7 milliseconds and 9 milliseconds.<br />
<br />
If I try I can squeeze a 5 tick torpor out every time I cast I just time it a tick and cast right on the tick. With a 6 second cast time and my delay I will get it to land on me right after the tick every time. <br />
<br />
And then I will get the extra tick. <br />
<br />
With SCR 1 I make it easier. So not even trying I get a 1 in three chance (Roughly)<br />
<br />
With SCR 2 I should get a tick every time without thinking and a second tick every now and again if I try.  <br />
<br />
With SCR 3 It will be most of the time without thinking. Then with SCM it will be all the time. And maybe just maybe a 7th tick. (Ill know better once I finally get it in about 5 months. (Grin))<br />
<br />
Try it for yourselves. But with a Fast ping it is much harder to get the spare tick. The server and client are in too close contact.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course all of the stuff after SCR 1 are speculation I havent done it yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have nothing useful to add, but I would just like to say that 120 ping is not 1.2 milliseconds.  It is 120 milliseconds.  I am also fairly certain that your ping is the time for a packet to go from your end to the recieving end and back, not just one way.  Thus, 120 ping is NOT 1.2 milliseconds multiplied by 2, it is 120 milliseconds.  :)<br />
<br />
All that time tweaking my counter-strike netcode finally had a use (sort of)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I intentionally did not discuss the extra tick that results from lag, because it's different for everyone.  You can get that with zero AA points if your connection is bad enough.  I play with almost zero lag, so I rarely ever see it.  Leoice: I know that SCRM is 20%.  30+20=50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The paladin spell Celestial Cleansing gets an extra tick sometimes at SCR1, will usually get an extra tick at SCR2 and rarely 2 extra ticks. At SCR3 it always gets an extra tick and has a decent chance to get 2 extra ticks.<br />
<br />
CC has a 4 tick duration just like Torpor. I don't have any level of SCR myself, but that is what has been reported by many paladins on the PoN board.</div></div><hr />
