<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yoshy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey All just started a shammy alt and so far Im loving it, Basically started him with some gear I had in the bank, but I think I may go ahead and equip him pretty decently.  Basically wanna spend about 2-3k for equipment.  His magelo is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=607825&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;<br />
Thanks for any advise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First step would be to sell the forest loop to a merchant for 285pp (good cha) and then use that money to replace the breastplate and all the empty slots with banded armor or ry`gorr if the prices are low enough on your server.  Better to have something in all slots.<br />
<br />
You also may want to replace the Leaf Scale Gloves with banded until about level 25 or so, right now they lose too much to be worth while.  Hang on to them for later but for the time being banded would serve you better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on difference in server prices in bazaar, 3k can get ya alot on BB for example. My advice is get a black sapphire earring, velium fire wedding ring, acrylia tunic, the 10sta 10str 6wis one, Rygorr legs maybe rygorr helm, that cloak is good for some time. also try withered leather boots for the raw hps on em, they are 200p or so on BB. Aim for raw mana/hps imo, serve you better in long run. Wis is ok, but dont shoot for the 200 mark like most caster twinks do. Spread it out with hps/sta gear. Personnally i went raw hps over sta for the most part, sta gives a fairly low hp ratio.<br />
<br />
Edit: and like the poster above said, fill ALL slots, even if with cheap banded. AC will help alot at lowlvl tanking.</div></div><hr />
