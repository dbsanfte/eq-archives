<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buphie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please try not to laught too hard at me.  I saw the phrase &quot;alpha dog&quot; used in another thread and I don't know what it means other than that it refers to our pet.  It seems from the context that there is something special to be done?  Or maybe it is just a term to refer to our pet.   I feel that I am missing something.  Can someone please let me know between guffaws?   Thank you for your assistance! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe, it means to give yuo pet 2 weapons so he can dual wiled, preferably ones that proc eg gnoll hide lariats whichu can get from splitpaw or bazaar for 10pp which proc a stun. Remember though, it's got to be a warrior weapon as our pets are warriors, btw whats your level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a point of reference, I was soloing Kodiaks in GD.  Without dogdog having a weapon, the kodiaks would be above 40% health when my envenomed breath wore off (42 seconds + Coldain Bracer).  So I'd have to spend the mana to recast, or take 150-250 hp of damage waiting for the thing to run.<br />
<br />
With dogdog having a weapon, after my envenomed breath wore off they would be around 25% health.  So they'd be running in no time.  Saving me mana and hp.<br />
<br />
I went to SolB the other day, pulling a kobold with tagar's and casting listless power, dogdog can tank very well with a FS dagger.  Of course I drop scrouge and envenomed breath on the kobold too, to help dogdog out. (Note I only did this when I was low on mana AND hp, as I normally tanked for my pet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Buphie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OMG I can't believe what a huge dumbass I am.  It never even OCURRED to me to give my pet weapons!! :rolleyes:  ROFLMAO... Puppies don't have hands.    What a silly goose I am!!!   Ok, thank you both so much for the answers.   I am just over a yellow til 51st.  See, a silly shaman indeed, to match my silly name.   Will be buying some inexpensive weapons for my pet I guess, lmao.   :o   /em Buries her head back in the sand...<br />

This little know snippet of information is known as &quot;Project Alpha&quot; and while a lot of people know about it, many do not!<br />
<br />
Basically, we, the Paranoid Shaman of the Crucible, are scared that if the broader community find out, they will whine piteously until Verant waves the nerf stick.<br />
<br />
Ok, so we told you. Now we have to kill you!</div></div><hr />
