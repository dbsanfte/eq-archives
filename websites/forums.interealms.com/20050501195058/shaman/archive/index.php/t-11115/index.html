Has worked for them and warriors and wizards etc.  It didnt work for us because we were either not unified enough between the ubers and casuals, or we have such a small population etc...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yay druids, less healing for shamans</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its the same level as mini torpor, all classes get new spells. i think we need to stop jumping to conclusions around here =P</div></div><hr />

I have an idea. It's a &quot;Jump to Conclusions Mat&quot;! You see, you have this mat, with different conclusions written on it that you could jump to. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, it’s about time.  Naturally, my druid is just now in his 51st season, but I’m still happy to hear about the new spell.  At 49 I was trying to keep the warrior in our group healed up a bit and her health bar would hardly move when I cast my spell.  I was so happy to get a new healing spell at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tok....that is the worst idea I've ever heard.<br />
<br />
Yes, this idea....it's horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And I told thevolcanogod no because they have moved my desk four times already and and I used to be over by the window and I could see the squirrels and they were merry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and its not okay because if they take my stapler then ill set the building on fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Im not that lazy, its just that i dont care&quot;<br />
<br />
lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree Drinnar.<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heh, no, what they need to do is upgrade Chloroplast.  That spell suxors!  <br />
Looking at Chloroplast and this new spell:<br />
<br />
          Healing Water           Chloroplast<br />
Level           44                            55<br />
Healed        425                         425<br />
Mana           200                        185  <br />
Cast time     4                             3<br />
Recast         2.25                        2.25<br />
<br />
Does it seem to anyone else like druids are getting Chloroblast at 44?  And if so, why is Chloroblast itself lvl 55 and only such a very minor improvement after 11 levels?  <br />
This isn't class envy, this is me wondering why Chloroblast wasn't scaled up to make this spell fit.   Seems like a waste of 11 levels and all I got was this lousy 15 mana decrease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, according to Lucy Chloroblast is 175 mana to heal 428, but in any case, healing water looks like a nice spell for the level: just 33% slower casting and 25 more mana.  However, considering I am about to get chloroblast at 55, I would prefer the mini-torpor we are probably going to get at the same time.<br />
<br />
So, consider that our spell is better in the long-term, and I would prefer Stoicism... 640 health for 180 mana, even though the casting time is longer and it has drawbacks.  Heck, I think it's better at 44, too.</div></div><hr />
