<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anuenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who have completed this portion of the epic quest can you just clear Kirn's room and complete the quest?  Or do you need to clear the stairs and the other rooms around Kirn before you fight Kirn?<br />
<br />
Current plans call for a couple of people to make their way to a safe spot outside the castle using the Earth Elemental Illusion from a ball of golem clay and then CoH the rest of the party to the safe spot.  Using IVU run up the stairs to Kirn, clear the room, turn in the idol, kill kirn, loot the ring and gate out.<br />
<br />
Sounds simple enough, will it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We usually IVU outside and then assemble in the room with the ghost of kindle. There are 2 revs in the room, the ghost is not agro. We take those 2 down, then clear kirns room. After that, we kill Kindle to make sure she doesnt interfere. The shaman then does the hand in and pulls Kirn into Kindles room, where he is killed. Basically pretty easy to do with 2 decent groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IN addition, if a ghost doesn't aggro on you, don't kill it.  You won't need to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anuenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info.  I'll post my results when we go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colodagh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What is the smallest amout of people who has been able to fight their way to Kirn and kill him?<br />
<br />
I have a 60 cleric, 60 monk, 59 Paladin, 59 Druid, 55 shaman, and a 50+ enchanter.  Would this group make it all the way up or do we need more help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it would help if your enchanter could cast glamour of kintaz, but you have a pretty solid group there, shouldnt be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question...<br />
I made a Halfling Rogue of Brell for a Kirn raid.  I was surprised that he was KOS there.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im pretty sure he's supposed to be kos there, but he is the only type of rogue that can sneak past ALL mobs in the zone, as far as i knew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FYI...<br />
The Halfling Brell Rogue is KOS there but can walk freely and they don't attack except...<br />
<br />
The Ratmen Warriors and Undead agro.  If they agro, all others nearby do too.  Make sure you bind outside in Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Monday night, 13 of us fought our way up into The Hole, mainly for SK's epic pieces.  Due to the downtime on Sunday the needed mobs were not up, so we fought our way with 2 groups up to Kindle's room.  After a couple nasty agro's, we managed to clear the room where Kindle is, then went into Kirn's room.  2 Cleric's, 2 Enchanters, 2 Shaman's, a Necro, couple warriors etc.  I handed in the Idol, backed off, and Boom, Kirn was down..and I lived thru it, with just 2 well oiled groups.  No panic, no muss no fuss.<br />
<br />
I found that if the people you take in know what to do, don't panic when trained, or pull too many, 2 - 3 groups can do it.  I was fortunate to have some Great people with me who knew the area.  It was just a side trip up to Kirn, since the SK mobs were not up.  <br />

Next is Fear for the Tear :)  *gets excited*<br />
