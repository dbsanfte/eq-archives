<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend and I have been talking it over the last few days.... We have no clue what is &quot;good&quot; xp anymore. I've heard that 1 blue an hour is good mid to high 50s. This sounds pain stakingly slow to me.<br />
<br />
Solo I can get about 2+ blues an hour ( if everything goes well IE no trains, over crowding etc... ) <br />
<br />
Grouped varies depending who is in the group what we are doing. It ranges from 1 blue to 3 on hour.<br />
<br />
Small grouped 1 yellow an hour is what I get ( did this with an SK and Rogue )<br />
<br />
I was just curious to what you guys think is &quot;good&quot; nowadays with PoP. Post your comments please, I want to know if what I'm getting is good  :p</div></div><hr />

I was going to post something to the same effect.  I blew through 45 to 51 in DL getting 1 yellow every 50 minutes.  With 51 I had a little trouble and went here and there. 52 and 53 I did in HHK getting about a yellow every 70 minutes.  At 54 I was dying in Katta, getting at most 2.5 blues an hour.  This was all solo work.<br />
<br />
I was in a group in PoJ and got terrible exp, but I was the lowest level in the group.  The Hole entrance was terrible and Jaggedpine gnolls were worthless.  I grouped in The Grey a little and that was bad xp too.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll try PoI or PoN/PoD and see what comes of that.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any preferences from the planes above?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of custom interfaces have experience bars with percentages on them. So whenever you go up 1% exp you can see it on the interface. :)<br />
<br />
BTW, just so you know - 1 blue bubble = 4% exp.</div></div><hr />

I've had trouble soloing in PoN.  I try root-rot, but even with C3 I usually end up running out of mana before they're down to 40% health.  Could it be because I'm level 55?  Should I wait for 56 and use new root and BoN?  They resist or break Immobilize too often for me to get any decent amount of mana back.<br />
<br />
I don't bother creating pet because I figure he'll be beat down too fast.</div></div><hr />
