<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally decided to come back to Everquest after about a year of not playing.  When I quit I gave away all my items except my no drop stuff (which sucks), and 7k in the bank.   I'm curious as to where I could make some good money or where to go for some decent drops.  I only have kunark and velious at the moment, and I'm gonna be dragon/dwarf faction.  <br />
<br />
On a different topic.  How hard are the 'mastadons' in western wastes, how hard do they hit, hit points, summon, etc?  I would like to go kill these for their furs if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the insight.</div></div><hr />
