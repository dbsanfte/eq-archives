<br />
&quot;Griz what's your wis?&quot;<br />
&quot;136&quot;<br />
&quot;Ack! is that WITH your epic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
...to which they think it's thier right to school me on how I'm not a tank, what the hell am I doing?<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what I'm doing... I'm slowing everything, peeling off adds, and root parking, far more than your ass is doing sitting there FM waiting for someone to heal... I need the Hit points, and the armor class, and in general the less health I lose, the more I can turn into mana anyways.<br />
<br />
I assume others have similar problems with this... feel free to post your opinions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hear it alot also Grizlor.  It usually stops though as I'm doing the same things you're doing, tanking adds til i can root park them, then slowing the parked mobs, canni'ing down and doing spot healing where i can while keeping the mobs waiting in line for death.  Took my regular tank all of about 3 pulls before he realized he didn't have to pull a mob off me as I would run it off a bit, root it and come back to help with the carnage.  We'll win them over eventually I suppose ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe even so 136 wis is pretty impressively low :) I think with me concentracting on AC/hp gear but considering wis item that im sitting at around 190 wis, no uber gear (just got glad chain legs as an upgrade if that gives an idea of my gear level hehe) The only items that i wear that i need to change are wis rings for hp/ac rings but im a touch lazy hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my AC gear I hit 225 wisdom unbuffed.   I generally hunted for the best AC piece with wisdom or mana on it I could find.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions;<br />
Artic Wyvern hide Cloak, 9 ac with stamina and wisdom and some other stuff.<br />
<br />
Earring of Essence Quest ;)<br />
<br />
Move up to Velium fire wedding rings.<br />
<br />
And work on getting into ToV HoT for Skyshrine armor; barring that, Kael Arena raids for Thurgadin Quest armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">136 wisdom is more then enough.  <br />
<br />
up until lvl 55 or so i only had 112 and never had any issues.  currently sitting at around 150 wisdom i find i have too much mana and am converting some gear that has wisdom over to somthing with more AC.:)<br />
<br />
unless your in uber guild its hard to get high AC AND wisdom.  So go ghetto gear with good AC value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1 of my favorite ac/wis items and &quot;easy to get&quot; is divine inspiration, 15ac 15wis/int 35mana range, drops from chief (5 spawns), easy for any 55+ group, i did it with a 56 melee and me (60 shaman), the chief is a uncommon pop, and the item his semi-rare, but u get xp while camping him (his commin is a 7ac 4wis necklace i think), so imo the item is worth the time cause u get xp (and some gorange idols, clubs, mage earrings to)<br />
<br />
Also shadel bandits in fungus are a 1 group thing and u get like 1 ring per hour, also xp and a nice way to boost mana and keep ac/hp.<br />
<br />
Hunting in velks (i so hate that zone after 6 grinding lvls) will give u a shot at CC arms/gloves/boots/shield all have decent ac/stats</div></div><hr />

Gear(not including epic) adding 15 wisdom. There *is* such a thing as compromise you know. Now my shammy has alot of upgrading to do between now and his mid 50's, and a good deal of it will be in ac/hp. I think he's pretty well balanced for his level though:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=273766<br />
<br />
Now my resists are lower than yours, and I'm missing some clickies. My ac's at 829(/bonk fix your ac). My hp is almost to 1000(just 600 behind yours, and on track to be in the same range by your level), and my wis is at a decent 185.  You can have both decent wisdom and good ac/hp..going way overboard either direction is silly, as manapool(My manapool is already larger than yours) does matter too..<br />
<br />
But as for them complaining about you not being a tank, tell em to stick it. I regularly tank for a rogue-rogue-shammy group, and have better ac than a warrior my level does in crusty armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll hotkey that one day, when the new UI is live and we can have longer hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Tell you something. I've got about the same wis at 31 (ok 30, that lava bath was not healthy), but went from shadr00d at 500something HP/400something AC to Shawarrior with 800+ HP / 600+ AC. It helped me a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had around 130 wisdom till I hit about 52 and started raiding with the guild - since them my wisdom has gone through the roof - am at 918 AC (wearing fungi instead of JB BP) and 205 wisdom and 2187hp buffed with Talisman, Sta, Bramblecoat (JB BP ;)) - only other ones I bother with are regen and sow and horsey.  Have been trying to ditch wisdom for more AC/HP but it is getting difficult to find items I can get - next on the list is a Matchless Dragonhide Mantle, also want a Lodi Shield.<br />
<br />
As long as you are doing yer job tell em to **** off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that is impressive :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mine runs at 170 w/o buffs but IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!!! ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually most of mine comes from my Ivandrys (6ac) and the Solstice earring and Epic and Thurg legs.. the rest is really accidental.  I'm mostly balanced I'd say (heavily weighted to AC) but I also Duo a lot and I tend to solo a bit too.<br />
<br />
But ya I'd trade 40 wisdom to break that stupid self buffed 1000 ac all day long and twice on sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I must have missed the part of the initial post where Grizlor said &quot;please suggest WIS upgrades for me&quot; or &quot;please masturbate over how much better your gear is than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
What, do you think he has been regularly destroying the dozens of Kael quest helms people have been throwing his way?  Not everyone has access to the same things and not everyone has the same willingness to devote their lives to seeking better equipment.<br />
<br />
In almost every situation, max WIS means jack ****.  As has been stated over and over, more AC = more mana.  You are a shaman.  EVERY MOB THAT MELEES IS A MANADRAIN MOB TO YOU.  My WIS is up in the 230's somewhere now and it almost never makes a damn bit of difference.<br />
<br />
His gear is respectable, and he is doing his job well.<br />
<br />
Graz, I hear ya buddy.  Lots of people don't understand our class (or their own!).  Don't let them get you down.  Just keep doing your job and they'll become converts ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I dispise people telling me how to do their freaking job.  I won't comment too much on this but to say the following.<br />
<br />
I believe that everything in moderation is all good.  I balance AC/HP/WIS so that my unbuffed AC (completely unbuffed) is around 925 and I can self butt that to 980 ish.  When I need AC because I know I'm going to take hits I can get it over 1k, when I don't, I use more wis and resist gear.  This works for me.  When getting spanked I take hits well and I survive better than the droood shaman, but when I'm the extra shaman on a raid or when I'm soloing non summoning mobs and I only take 2-10 hits the whole night, then the extra WIS works for me better than if I was a pure AC shaman.  I carry 2 weight reducing BPs with me and swap out gear accordingly.<br />
<br />
Play how you want though and have fun, personally, I believe the shaman makes the gear, not the gear makes the shaman.  I'm ok with my current gear (looking to upgrade my pants, maybe my BP and shoulders but I'm happy with everything aside from that).  I like the moderate AC/HP and WIS approach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">136?  Sweet!  Someday I hope to get mine that high!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Through my 40's and lower 50's, I think my wisdom hovered around 170.  I really wouldnt have wanted to drop below 160, but that was personal preference.<br />
<br />
As I got a little higher in level, and went on a few raids, it has actually climbed without me really trying.  If I pulled some of my tradeskill stuff out of the bank, I think I can hit around 228 wisdom.  With my regular gear, it's sitting at 207.<br />
<br />
Really, it's kind of embarrassing :D <br />
<br />
Since I stay broke all the time, I'm trying to figure out what cheapie upgrades I could do for ac and health.  So out with the chokidai hide spaulders, hello tattered mantle.  Next will probably be a spider fur belt for my cobalt drake belt.  Still havent gotten around to getting some crystalline spider eyes for my arctic wyvern mask yet either :o <br />
<br />
My goal has always been 1kac and 2k health, unbuffed.  Still about 250 health and 42ac left in my goal.  Getting hard to upgrade on the cheap side though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Okay, I feel sort of . . . wrong.  I think my current wisdom is something like 267.  I'm trying to find decent AC/HP items.  It seems that all the nice hp/ac items I can find that are decent upgrades are also huge +wisdom items.<br />
<br />
I'm really trying to break the 1200AC cap unbuffed too.  :(<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Looking at the typical gear he's wearing I'd say 130 wis is just fine. He obviously doesn't feel like his wisdom is too low.<br />
<br />
For those people telling you you need more wisdom I'd just ask them when the last time they saw you oow was and after they pause to think for a few minutes and can't come up with an answer tell them i obviously have enough mana then.<br />
<br />
Since people seem to feel like throwing some equipement upgrade suggestions out for ya I'll add a couple on.<br />
Coldain skin gloves. A little bit of an ac loss but a nice chunk of wisdom and hps on them. Great peices all around, i still wear em at 60, and pretty cheap to get. They currently seem to be going for 2 - 3k on my server.<br />
<br />
Do the quest for the earing of the solstice. If money is an issue rather than flat out buying componenets try to gather up the components your self and find a tradeskiller to do the combine for you. Should be alot cheaper that way especially on the peices that require dropped or foraged components. Cost 3-4k depending on luck and cost of tradesmen.<br />
<br />
For a ring try to get a shadel bandit ring. same hps/ac as what you have but adds mana and resists. Very nice peice and frequently rott on my server to the ae groups aeing the bandits.<br />
<br />
For arms get in some arena groups. Either chain arms for the dorf quests or gladiator chain arms would be a nice upgrade for ya.<br />
<br />
Long term for shoulders either higher end dragon mantles or the 8th shawl would be nice upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Also long term for you back a hierophant cloak would be a great upgrade.<br />
<br />
Over all I'd say with the gear you have access to your doing great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I try to stay at about 150 wis at all times.  The only time I am ever LoM is when I have 4 melees in a group and they all want buffs and me to slow or on raids when we are moving fast and I dont have time to do anything but slow and cant med up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I remember when groups I was in would scream at me to get a higher wis.  Heck, RL friends have told me I'm a moron for being content with a 160 wis.  I figure that if the shaman wasn't meant to take a beating, we wouldn't have such a nice line of self-only buffs.  At 49 I can get my STR up to 232, and my guild has warriors that don't have that high a STR yet.  I'm in a small guild that doesn't raid yet, so a lot of the better gear is out of my reach.<br />
When I get in a group that gives me flak about my wis, I just keep going about my business and doing my job.  Tanks have thanked me for saving their tails when the cleric was sleeping or when I had to lock up a mob that wouldn't stay rooted.<br />
Don't listen to those dr00ds and clerics who try to tell you what your gear should be.  They're just jealous that they're not shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">54 shaman here . My wis is 135 .<br />
<br />
Too be honest , I don't even look too hard at the wis on my pieces. I look for HP , AC and resists . If it has wis...bonus.<br />
<br />
My AC is 922 and my HP are 1900 ish. Lets me do my job much better.<br />
<br />
I'm almost never OOM,and if fighting,grouping,raiding , I'm never FM anyway . Besides getting back from OOM to a decent mana level is not hard for a shaman. <br />
<br />
Play to your strengths,If you wanna be a root rotter go nuts.Or you can use your cannibilize , regen ,HP, and AC to their maximum effectiveness .</div></div><hr />

You know you aren't the best equipped shaman yourself.  You are in between a druid and a REAL shaman.  Ditch the Shoulders, Range, Shield, Cloak, Belt, and Neck.  Put some real ac/hp items in these slots.  I would also recommend dropping the Gloves/Helm/Arms but since I believe you to be an Iksar I'm not sure what is available to you.  As a level 30 troll I have 770 ac and over 1000hp unbuffed.  You should work on those stats because you are lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You're at the point now where a majority of your upgrades will start coming with WIS whether you want it or not. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm sure you have no problems at all with that WIS.  With a good group I'm never over 60% mana which is less mana than 136 WIS provides.  It's all about the hp/mana regen.  Less damage taken is like hp regen.<br />

But still, if that's your attitude toward shamanhood, and you can do it with X amount of WIS, then X amount of WIS is enough. You're lightyears ahead of all the f***ing barbarian druids out there. If only they knew how much more they can be with the right philosophy.</div></div><hr />

I would also recommend dropping the Gloves/Helm/Arms but since I believe you to be an Iksar I'm not sure what is available to you. As a level 30 troll I have 770 ac and over 1000hp unbuffed. You should work on those stats because you are lacking.<br />

Yes, I am an iksar. And I do have upgrades to do, if ya read it insteada just quoting it you might've noticed I said that. I still say it's silly to skip out on wisdom completely though. Manapool does matter. <br />

Ps. I'll out-tank you any day of the week Potens :p  My ac is higher than yours,  and from you're post I'm guessing my wisdom is double what you have :) What that boils down to is i've got more mana in reserve, so when i get an add or two i finish it all instead of runnin to zone.

When 90% of your exp comes from being indoors, where you don't have the space to run around like an idiot, you'll be awful thankful for having AC... and so will everyone else. From a non-taunting melee persepective, having the shaman (or any other class for that matter) taunt a mob off you is a Good Thing(tm). It's his problem now. I FD mobs on to my Shaman partner so he can work up his defence. With Chloro + IkkyBP + Troll Regen he regens almost twice as fast as I do with just chloro... so even if he takes twice the damage we're only losing medding time.<br />
<br />
Then again... I don't try and taunt mobs off Enchanters so maybe nobody should be listening to me. If they pull the aggro then it's their problem. Don't got time to be chasing after people that haven't got stuns memmed. :p</div></div><hr />

Enchies pull aggro when attempting to mez mobs to help the group, if the mez gets resisted and they get pummeled it's hard for them to get a spell off since they can be interrupted and resisted.<br />

He only dies when we all die from someone training through us on their way out from an over pull or if something really weird happens which just causes there to be a lot more mobs than there should be. Usually if he dies everyone dies and I have to CR. Always give him a nice long head start when we book it for the zone too.<br />
<br />
I've never seen him get instant killed by a regular slowed exp giving mob either. The closest it's come to that was the one time we dropped down in Dalnir and for some reason he got aggro (Fattn has a very funny story about that) and caught a bunch of nukes. And the time while I was still learning how to FD split so he used a lull that bounced. He was the only one that died too.<br />
<br />
I work damn hard to break spawns and pull singles or at the max doubles too. He gets to throw nukes out a fair bit.<br />
<br />
I'm not out to kill him or anything. I just have a little faith that in the last however many levels he's learnt how to take care of himself a little. Hell! If he dies I got no one to give me Celerity! /cry :(</div></div><hr />

If you had read my post you would have realized I'm level 30 and you are level 40.  Yet, I'm only what 25 ac below you.. one level of defense? So when I'm 31 or 32 I'll have more ac than you when you are a level 40 iksar.  Not to mention I have more hp than you at 30 than you do at 40.

If only they knew how much more they can be with the right philosophy. <br />
<br />
Agree and disagree.  <br />
<br />
I agree that left or right-leaning shamans can become much more by breaking their molds and expanding their game philosophy.<br />
That being said, there really isn't a &quot;right&quot; philosophy to playing your class, other than just playing however works for you.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have found that the Path of Balance(tm) works for me -- max all stats to their fullest potential.<br />
Now there are some stats I put priority over others.  My top three are:  HPs, AC, and WIS (in no particular order).  But, to me, all stats are important.<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, just play however makes you happy.  If, down the road, something needs changed, change it.  Don't be a mindless follower who jumps on the latest bandwagon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Playing the straight up tank 'em down style exclusivly is as short sighted and narrow minded as those that play the root rot game exclusivly.  If you don't have to be hit why stand in the way and take damage, conversly there is no reason to run around in a circle like most druids you see play (I say most because i've run with at least 1 that tanks as well as a ranger /shrug).   The only advantage to tanking more than 2 at a time as opposed to ghetto mez is when you have a ds up. Otherwise my personal style is to root any over 2 and run the epic dot on all of 'em.  That's not to say I can't stand there and take the beating from more than 2, I just see no reason for it.  Letting a relative new shaman know we can tank is one thing, telling them they must is quite another.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the ac cap argument has been had on this board a few times.  Personally, I've been over 1250 but not 1300 and I've not seen a difference between that and 1100 on regular xp grinding mobs.  Hence, on most xp grinds the vindi get's swapped out for a fungi.  Now with the changes to casting mobs that isn't always true anymore, as the resists come in more handy than the regen from time to time.<br />
<br />
What either we or the people you talk to think about your wis status doesn't really matter.  Play the game with the gear choices to go with the style you play, but make sure you have all the information before chosing an avalible upgrade (/em wishes he'd have known about the ancient greeves before the onyx chain in his youth).  It was my opinion that dropping below 150 wis was going to be low while I was lvlin up, hence the choices I made.  After your abilities and mastery of the class has been demonstrated, the gear you wear and your stats will never be a concern of the people with which you play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The very quintessence of being a shaman is optimizing.  People who strive for optimal performance with the least cost usually make good shaman.  This is why you feel uncomfortable on your twinks. Every time they get near full hps you get involuntary twitches in your canna finger and look around uneasily, thinking &quot;bugger me, this blows, if i could only...&quot;<br />
<br />
How you choose to optimize depends on your style of play. The very fact that there is room for choice is what makes us strong. Dont let others classes tell you how you play at maximum efficiency, because they couldnt possibly understand.</div></div><hr />

It affects your game when they're a level higher and &quot;the Shaman&quot; on a raid. With their 50 more Wis and 200 less AC they're getting squished on resists and dying. Constantly having to be rezzed, slowing down the progression of the raid you're on and starting to become bitchy yelling that it's everyone else's fault that they're Shaman paste. Not to mention the aggrevation they cause when they see you step up and try to slow as well. Not that this is the case for every Shaman out there but that's just my experience with 3 different Shaman on two different servers. <br />
<br />
I don't spam inspect other Shaman and tell them what to wear. I don't even make comments to guildmates regarding their choice in gear, it's none of my business for the most part. That doesn't mean I can't shake my head at the level 55+ Shaman with 700AC and wonder how the hell they're going to survive raiding with their raid oriented guild *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Well, he has 145 mana in mana items, which is worth well over 15 wisdom, so he's not THAT lacking in the ability to kick out the spells, guys.<br />
<br />
I had 120 wisdom until about level 52, when I started getting upgrades here and there that, like someone noted occurs, eventually raised my wisdom whether I wanted it or not.  The higher you go, the more wisdom seems to just kind of accumulate. The one thing I would think of doing where possible is getting some wisdom gear so that when grouped you can switch in some more wisdom items.  You will be tanking a lot less in groups so need AC less, and needing wis/mana more, so should switch some in.  A great compromise item is the jaded velium rings, AC 5 mana 30 HP 30.  Mana 30 is worth more than wis 3 at your level, so you are actually getting the equivalent of almost wis 4 by equipping just one of those rings, and still getting almost the same AC and still keeping some nice hitpoints.  Try to keep lots of situational gear around -- which gets pretty expensive, by the way.  It's all very worth it though, you'll make constant use of good switchable equipment.<br />
<br />
I notice a lot of gear suggestions for him, too, which as someone also noted he may not agree he needs as much as some would think he does.  But also, it assumes he has money to blow at this point or anytime soon, which may or may not be the case.<br />
<br />
THAT being said....besides the epic, the three shaman items that completely kick ass to the extent that you really MUST try to get them are the JBB, the fungi tunic, and the iksar regen BP.  You are iksar so can't get a JBB, and if you could afford a fungi you would probably be wearing it, so there's no point dwelling on that.<br />
<br />
Which leaves the ceremonial iksar chestplate.  Regens 5 standing/6 sitting, AC 19 weight 6.0.  Until you get this item, buy NOTHING but any spells you are missing.  Level and live like you're broke!  This item is far better than any chest piece you could be wearing(and probably anything you could put in any slot besides a fungi tunic).  Goes for 5-7k on my server. <br />
<br />
At your level, fighting in The Overthere, for instance(which is exactly what I did at your level), you can sometimes GAIN hitpoints WHILE FIGHTING.  It's not possible to exaggerate the importance of that.  <br />
<br />
Get that BP and then save up for fungi and/or rune etched icewurm fang, which is the best weapon you'll hold until you get your epic, at 12/19, wis 5 mana 35 and spiritstrike DD that procs a fair amount.  <br />
<br />
I guess for an iksar, I'd say ikky BP, fungi, and rune etched icewurm fang are the three items that will change the game the most for you until you get an epic and torpor.<br />
<br />
By the way, I banked many fine items while wearing ikky BP and fungi BP--including even my HoT CoV BP.  Don't even think about underestimating regen -- which I'm sure you're already loving as an iksar.<br />
<br />
By the way grats on having some guts and not playing your iksar like a root and rot druid.  Most do.</div></div><hr />
