<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>akuros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, sorry to take up your time, I did a search on like, tons of class boards to get ideas, but everywhere I go just seems like I'm doing something wrong heh.<br />
<br />
My son just recently was diagnosed with leukemia, so my paytime is like way down, so I decided to start a SK twink, and PL him so when I didnt have a ton of time I could just duo (I'm not really into a lot of soloing with a shaman, I dunno why heh) But anyways, I've got him to 26 so far...I did FoB &gt; PC &gt; HHK &gt; GD so far, and was just doing the giant camp atm for faction...I tried CoM but got insanely worked cuz like everything aggros, and was red...and my shaman isn't uber by any means heh, he only has 29 aa at level 65 and is bazaar geared.<br />
<br />
I'm just kinda looking for a guide to best way to PL (in case im doing it wrong...I mean i haven't used ds potions yet, and im still stuck until 46 using pre 50 spells to buff, and I heal him while he meelees, other than that I slow em when needed etc.)  Also, Im using my laptop to PL till next week when I get my second comp rebuilt.  Just looking for some zones that net good xp, pretty much everything pre OoW or PoP are dead on my server anyways,<br />
<br />
Here are the chars magelos so you get an idea how they stand gear wise.<br />
Shaman: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1116607<br />
<br />
SK: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1119722<br />
<br />
Any help would be like insanely appreciated heh.  Just figure with the static times that I get to play now, and the fact that I would like to be able to duo later on, I would ask for some help.  THanks again guys</div></div><hr />
