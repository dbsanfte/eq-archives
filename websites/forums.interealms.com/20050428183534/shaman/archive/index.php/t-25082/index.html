Bah!  :(  My RL friends joined up with DAOC/EQ/COH guildies and went alliance.  Look for Snapdragon the Night Elf Druid (kill me now please, I'm embarrased.  It's like hanging out in front of school smoking with your friends and Mom shows up in a station wagon).<br />

If you gotta go alliance, dorf is definitely the way to go.  <br />
<br />
Now if you're just picking race for the dancing, Nothing beats the human male except for perhaps the orc male.  Dorfs, as is to be expected, can't dance for beans!</div></div><hr />

a) I was embarassed to admit I am playing a druid (and liking it).  Given the pure amount of hate I have harbored towards them over the past 4 years in EQ, it was like waking up one morning with breasts.  Betrayed by my own body!  Shocking, yet fascinating.  <br />
<br />
b) Night Elves have ass ears.  'nuff said. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering this is a shaman board, and shaman are horde only, its only natural for us to lean to the Horde.<br />
<br />

Have you seen the female human dance?  She's so white it's embarrassing.</div></div><hr />

Bah!  Nothing says &quot;rhythmless doofus&quot; like the Tauren male dance.  Looks like the mosh pit at a polka festival!  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm still shuffling around servers trying to find somewhere I like.  Have a range of mid teens-low 20's characters on about 5 servers, but can't find anywhere that I really want to settle.  Being an Australian, makes it hard to find decent guilds in my time zone, so if anyone has come across a server with a decent range of 'very late night' guilds, let me know. Levels are easy to get, so starting afresh doesn't really bother me at the moment.<br />
<br />
My favourite alliance race is definately dwarf, with trolls for horde. <br />
<br />
I also find most Australians horribly obnoxious when online, and steer clear of them, so I won't be heading to the 'unofficial' Aussie servers if I can help it.  I'm really going to miss the asian guilds I've spent the last 5 years a member of  :(   (darn that country of origin enforcement)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well if you want to avoid the &quot;unoffical&quot; Aussie server, then avoid Blackrock.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to try somethin' different, so in OB I started a dorf pally.  That was fun, but I was just playing - no tradeskills, no worries about gear.  The last day I decided to try a Tauren, and the druid was just more fun (ok - in one day I only got to lvl 6 - so shoot me.  That part was still maor einterssting than the dorfs.  After 4.5 years as a Troll Shaman, I could not get interested in killing those lil ole trolls in Coldridge Valley).<br />
<br />
So now I look on the druid boards and get an earful of how underpowered they are.  Apparently they all want to be equal to a warrior when in bear form, and equal to a Rogue when in cat form, and to be able to fight in aquatic form, and just pop back in to caster form to heal and insta-nuke and go back to bear form while mana regens.  Oh, and upgrade our armor so the bear is equal to a warrior, plz thx)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I like healing at the moment.  If it keeps up with mob damage, i am willing to put up with the healing aggro.  If it doesn't keep up, there will be new totems sprouting in Mulgore.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't have the magic EQ did, but it's pretty good so far. <br />
<br />
Still log into EQ some, but the magic is definitely gone.<br />
<br />
I really like the priest.  It's been a fun class.  I can't believe it.  I was committed to &quot;I AM NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER SUPPORT CLASS&quot; theory, but it just didn't wash.  It's been strange, and my reflexes kinda suck sometimes.   :o <br />
<br />
I didn't want to be an undead priest though.  I don't like the idea of playing undead.  I don't get into horror stuff at all.  <br />
<br />
I love! the music and sound of the Taurens though. &quot;walk with the earthmother...&quot;  owns.</div></div><hr />

Just interesting to read this again.  Post was made on 11/29.<br />
<br />
So, it took me about one week to gain 18 levels.<br />
<br />
Then it took me about 2 weeks to gain 13 levels to where I am today at level 31.<br />
<br />
So, twice the time to gain 72% of the levels.  Has anyone noticed the increased exp requirements post 30 that they patched in Open Beta?  Will I slow down any more?  Just curious ...  Obviously I'm not interested in any speed records or firsts for the server here lol.  I spend a lot of time crafting and just hunting down ore as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High level (50+) folks say that leveling slows down some at 30, then again at 40, and after 50 you start wondering if you will ever make it to 60. But heck, after doing 51-65 in EQ a couple of times, &quot;it is to laugh&quot; :)</div></div><hr />
