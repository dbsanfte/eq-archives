<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're all in agreement that the Panther/Leopard recast is unnecessary and that we require effective and open communication from SOE. We no longer want to be in the dark about changes, we don't want nerfs snuck in at the last second, and at this point fixing Panther will do to the real issues what Panther did to the issues before it came along - gloss them over. I'm going to propose a two-fold way of handling this that will benefit everyone, both SOE and the playerbase, by quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Our current short-term problem is the Panther recast. With this recast in effect the spell is effectively the same for any Shaman who has it, regardless of level of play. You can only keep it on a maximum of three people, assuming you watch the recast timer like a hawk. It doesn't matter of you're raiding Saryrn in the Plane of Nightmare or slaughtering some unpronouncable invader in Taelosia or if you're staring down Mata Muram himself. This recast cripples the spell's effectiveness, disallowing for any progression in the spell's abilities as the player grows. Spells and gear are how Shaman grow in this game, and all we're getting with this spell is the Webster of 80s family television, where once it was great, the spell is now stunted and will never grow. (Stop groaning, it was funny.)<br />
<br />
The long-term problem is that even if this is fixed, what is to prevent it from happening again? The current lines of communication are ineffective. I appreciate all the hard work the class representatives put in, and especially their time, but little is said to them and much less is done. Just as Sony is revamping classes they must, once again, revamp how they communicate with us. We want to know why things are happening, and how *we* can affect them positively. For example, other slowing classes are having their slows brought up in power, closing the already miniscule gap between our mitigated slows and their mitigated slows. Was this done so that Shaman can finally get the healing boost we deserve, because giving a healing class a powerful slow was holding us back all this time? Please tell us. We want to know. Your thoughts are much more important to us than your actions, and if all we see is the hand that smacks us on the nose with a rolled up newspaper we won't know why it's done and will growl and snap at you.<br />
<br />
So what can we do to change this? Let's hit Panther first, since it's our biggest concern. A lot of thought has been put into it, and almost everyone can agree that the change in pet proccing percentages was necessary. It was broken, and we accept this. A recast timer does nothing but hurt the spell and disallow growth, as I mentioned earlier. The mana cost was already a limiting factor, and I, personally, think that it was enough to make it situational. But since we're asking you to give us something, we'll give a little too. Some people think a smaller recast timer, like 3 seconds, would be a compromise. Considering the extremely short duration of the buff, anything over 5 is almost heinous and, once again, caps a spell that should be able to grow with a player since this is the focus of our class re-envisionment. Another idea was to leave the mana cost alone, but extend the duration and tweak the damage per proc accordingly or to make it group only. The fact is, short duration buffs with recast timers are no fun for us, and if we're not having fun we won't play. This is, despite any emotional connection we have to our characters, a game. <br />
<br />
As for the communication issue? There are many ways of handling it. Have a weekly thread at each representative class board, run by the moderators. Have them come up with three or four questions, and let the developers answer them for us (in a few paragraphs, please ... we want you to feel free to tell us everything about the process and how we can make it easier for you and better for us) directly to the community moderators, so that they can be posted and the thread locked, and the community can discuss them as time goes on. Ignore the trolls and flamebait. Become an active part of our gameplay and communities. The bottom line is that this is both a business and a game, and we're both gamers and customers. We want the job to be fun for you, so that you can make it fun for us to play. If you enjoy it, we will, and if we can reach some harmonious plateau of communication everyone will be better for it. We can all learn a lot from one another, and make this game grow together. In the end, you'll have a better game and we'll have more fun.<br />
<br />
Right now, our only option is to take action. We're unhappy. We don't want a riot, but we want answers and we want change. I am urging you all to post kindly in this thread and the EQ forums, to please be considerate of the subject matter and the attention it deserves by not flaming, demanding heads on silver platters, belittling, or arguing. We have a point to make. We need some changes, and we're not the only ones. We can help them make Panther an effective spell, but they have to listen to us. Yeah, we're all angry. Even I was angry enough to cancel my account, but I'm taking that perturbedness and turning it into something positive and effective. You should, too. We need more parses, more numbers, showing the effectiveness of Panther. We need theoritcal parses of what it will be like with the recast change, with small recasts, with limited mana pools and so on. <br />
<br />
Hopefully we can use this as a platform for further changes, but we need to work together with one another and with SOE to do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sony almost NEVER changes it mind for the better ..but they have a weird way of nerfing things at the drop of a hat<br />
<br />
/shrug i hope we can talk them out of it but i highly doubt anything we say will even GET to rytan let alone having him consider our suggestions and concerns.<br />
<br />
im sure he could care less about us and our educated objections...<br />
<br />
Sorry if im being pesimistic... but asking sony to listen to reason is like a politician to tell the truth...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beth I agree about the communication.<br />
<br />
I disagree about offering concessions in advance.<br />
<br />
I want to know what the appropriate level of burst cooperative damage provided by shaman buffs is judged to be.  <br />
<br />
I want this to be set in the context that wizards can provide max burst direct damage of perhaps 1100 or so -- maybe a bit less.  <br />
<br />
And in the context that the real comparison has to do with how much damage casting a buff causes -- and so the real comparison is with enchanters, who can routinely provide perhaps 2400 dps in increased cooperative damage, for an hour at a time, with one single cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The comparison to haste is horrible, I am sorry you don't see the argument, but that won't change it.<br />
<br />
The issue is that 1100 DPS figure is highly theoretical and not sustainable for any length of time, as well as reliant on several super high end items + an ancient spell.  In a real parse on a boss mob, I very rarely ever see wizards break 700+ DPS, and when they do, it is using frenzied devastation on very short fights, thus using the 1100 DPS figure will not help you much.<br />
<br />
The argument that better communication is needed is extremly true, but communication requires that both parties are willing to listen to the others arguments.  My experiences with the developers is that they are extremly smart and knowledgable of game mechanics, but they make up their mind and it is almost impossible to change it.  Quoting inflated DPS figures will result in you getting mocked or flat out ignored, I remember Jazer a few times correcting people who were claming retarded numbers for rogue damage.  Unfortunately, people with very fewexceptions tend to not be very rational when looking at their own class and their perception of power.  Enchanters thought charm in early PoP was balanced, and we all have memories of enchanters solo'ing in BoT.  Necromancers insisted that their old level 49 pet was 'balanced'.  Wizards insisted that manaburn farming dragons was 'perfectly balanced'.  Magicians, insisted that pet canni was perfectly legitimate and scaled well.  Bards insisted that AE kiting was very balanced and acceptable.  Paladins thought Thunder of Karana was fine pre nerf... etc...  i can bring hundreds of examples of classes being totally out of balance in the eyes of everyone, but people just will not see it, or will rationalize it by saying, we got the shaft so many times, we deserve a good thing.<br />
<br />
Developers should do better in the way of explaining things, but people should also lose their emotional attachment to their character and be willing to look at things logically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we can. If you walk into a battle with that mindset, you're already defeated. Don't you want things to change? You're unhappy with the way things are, and it's not just Shaman. It's almost everyone. If we got a representative in every class to spread this idea and gathered enough support we can make the change.<br />
<br />
I also offer this: &quot;The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.&quot; -Chinese proverb<br />
<br />
If you don't want to be a part of this and you don't want to at least try to help thsi change along, that's your decision. I'm going to make an earnest effort until my subscription runs out in June. I can't sit on the sidelines when I'm pissed. If I don't make a difference, at least I tried.</div></div><hr />
