<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I got by black fur boots Monday night.  I must say, it is quitte fun to be able to insta-click and refresh SOW!  :D <br />
<br />
Next item of business is the pages from City of Mist.  CAn this be done solo at level 46?  An no i don't have a JBB.  Grrr!  They go for 25-30K on Drinal<br />
<br />
If I remember from the previous posts on this, as I enter the stables, turn to the right.  that is where the Spectral Courier spawns.  Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think at 46, you would have to be a very very good soloer to do this, and then only do the bridge area. 5 of my pages dropped from the fog golem right at the gates, so you've got a good chance of getting those.<br />
<br />
The spectral courier can spawn in either the north or south part of the stables. It spawned once in each for me. (Second time it dropped my item). Be aware that the stables are rough, as there is very little wiggle room, fast repops, and lots of large aggro ranges.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to team up with a ranger/druid/bard who has track, get your other pages while watching for a pop in the stables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did this recently, and I think you will need to be at least 50 or so for the spectral courier piece.  You can pull most things in the stable area single at that level.  Before that, would be very very challenging without a JBB.  I have one, and did it solo at 49.  For the other 5 pages, they can drop anywhere, and you would be able to get them from even just the two spawns at the zone line, though it would take forever.  pretty common drops, but you do need to get 5 differnet ones.  Best bet would be to worry more about getting a few levels, then head back there, or find a melee partner if you want to do now.  Slowed, the mobs there are quite easy.</div></div><hr />
