<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friend picked up a pair of ornate gloves for 70k last night in the bazaar, but I can't find a pair on magelo or lucy.  There is a link on eqmaps, but I don't trust it, it has the leather graphic instead of chain.  I know there was a mixup back when people were item-link farming and the gloves got moved around, so I don't know what to believe.  I don't think the Scaled Avatar ones are going to be better than my current gloves (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=40177&quot;&gt;Supple Black Gloves&lt;/a&gt;), judging from the stats on the bracer and arms and boots as a reference.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a set turned in and wearing they can post the real stats for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nada there &gt;&lt;  Couldn't come up with much on google either, there is something on the silent redemption page, but it's blocked to non-members, and I can't tell if it's a link or just something about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked magelo's item database, it's not listed there either. Nor on Lucy's. err, at least I can't find it listed, hehe</div></div><hr />

Ornate gloves have a mixed up name.  They share the elemental armor name. Rosrak's Gloves of the Primal are orante, Rosrak's Guantlets of the Primal are elemental ... kinda confusing.. since youd think it would be named scaled avatars guantlets</div></div><hr />
