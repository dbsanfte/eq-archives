------------------------------<br />
Background:<br />
KoE was wandreing about its Kunark home - Howling Stones - doing some spring cleaning.  The groups were in the process of clearing out the South wing when they came upon a new set of Mobs.  Rizz noted that there was one of the dreaded carpet traps, and stops to warn the group . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Rizz: Ok everyone. Listen up. You see this rug here. This is a trap. <br />
<br />
Hammer, daydreaming: I am so wonderous. I know everyone is looking at me in awe. It is so nice to hear Rizz stop the raid and tell everyone of my grandness. <br />
<br />
Grinric, also daydreaming: Hammer, how I love the so. Where you go, I shall follow. <br />
<br />
Rizz: Everyone got that. This is a trap. If you step on the carpet you will fall and die. So don't go near it. <br />
<br />
Hammer, still daydreaming: Yes, Rizz, go on about my godly grapeness. Tell them all so they can hope to have a glimpse of understnading my magisty. <br />
<br />
Grinric, still daydreaming: Hammer's purple sheen really exites me. I can't wait until we are alone. <br />
<br />
Rizz: OK, now that that is very clear, Valfaroth, pull us some nastys. <br />
<br />
Valfaroth: 4 Inc! <br />
<br />
Hammer, finally awake, thinking to himself: A fight! A chance for all to see my splendor. Hmm, I wonder what's under that rug. <br />
<br />
Hammer goes to the rug and falls to his death. <br />
<br />
Grinric: /shout NO!!!!!! Hammer my love, I shall rescue you. <br />
<br />
Grinric dives onto the rug and falls to his death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmmmm... what is this fascination that shorties have with pit traps in HS? last night we were in the West Wing (Hammer, Moe, Lianna, Teeyana, Animal and I).  I was very explicit in warning the Purple One of the presence of the trap (as was Moe and everyone else).  We go to move past it and lo! MOE falls through the damned thing!  is it something that shorties can't see the rugs?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>burien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ROFL, funny u say that wulf, i have fallen thru the rug only one time, and (im not kidding) i was in gnome form.... ive never had a problem in erudite form, its the shorty thing i guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bagfra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what is a rug??:D <br />
<br />
what is a trap?:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can only say that my daughter being in the room tearing stuff up had an impact on my concentration.  But at least I caught myself on the way down and did not take any damage on the fall.   What makes this really bad is that I was giving Hammer a hell of a time pointing out every rug that was a trap or not and pointed out the trap rug just moments before falling in myself.<br />
Well I know I made Hammer's night with that little show of gravity.<br />
<br />
I still think I could have Grav Fluxed myself back up, but it was getting late anyway. <br />
<br />
Oh well.....   :D</div></div><hr />
