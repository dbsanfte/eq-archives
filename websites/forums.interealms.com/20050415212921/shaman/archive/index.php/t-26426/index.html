Either way I cannot be bothered to go and find the 5 best, so I selected just to add 1 to my post count.</div></div><hr />

i agree. i am over 1400hp with my top 5, but some of my other gear really sucks.  overall i am at 6253 unbuffed, but i have 75hp, 80hp and 85hp items in the mix lol.  luclin to qvic gear!<br />

Don't see how you got 1400 with your top 5. Altho I did get 1410 with your top 6 =) 1400/5 = 280 so you' need average of 280 hps per peice to get 1400 and you just don't have that =)</div></div><hr />

double added my bracer. shows the dumb things i can do right after i wake up.<br />
i could drop the bracer AC aug for HP and changed my augs around i could end up at the 1300 mark though. still wouldn't have been a very good indicator as to my overall gear situation imo.</div></div><hr />

Bah, nothing dreaded about being &quot;pre-elemental&quot;  :p <br />
<br />
OOW really brought some amazing items for non-raiders and as luck would have it you don't need Time+ gear to be a slower in RS (tanking's a different matter though ;) )<br />
<br />
As a non-raider, my top 5 would be:<br />
<br />
Chain of the Tormentor 180 (incl 40 HP LDoN aug)<br />
Tainted Heartstone 171 (incl 99 HPs from the LDoN charm aug)<br />
Linked Scale Boots 155 (incl 40 HP LDoN aug)<br />
Scalelink Armguards 150 (incl 40 HP LDoN aug) <br />
Shrieking Band of Despair 140 (aug'd with one of the DoN all-stat augs)<br />
<br />
796 HPs, although 219 of those are from LDoN. I know it was a much loathed expansion by some, but it's the bedrock on which my gear was built!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have to agree - it was all that LDoN gear I had that enabled me to wade right in to WoS and even MPG, and the gear from there (Spiritkin, MPG drops) that got me to RS.<br />

I hate it for the people coming up now that can't get LDoN groups, but hopefully the servermergers will help with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, LDON did wonders for my gear. I happily wore my Incorporeal tunic (augged to 160 HP/130 Mana) until I got my Bloodlink from Ikkinz. Wouldn't you know, the first RSS group I had a Chain of the Tormentor drop in was the first group after I had my new tunic? Heh. Anyway, I had a TON of LDON gear, all of it fully augged, and it was some pretty great gear for the level of the game I was at back then. I think the best part about having a lot of LDON armor is selling back that old armor and grabbing up some +40 HP augs. <br />
<br />
It's so odd to go back and look at my gear progression ... since December 2004, I've added more than 1,000 HP and roughly the same amount of mana. Even more odd is wearing something as good as the Bloodlink tunic and still having earrings that don't break 100 HP, lol. Improvements come in leaps and bounds, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">A lot of complaints on these forums, but just play and have fun with what you got. <br />
<br />
This is where I think Eq failed, <br />
<br />
The whole game is based on two things ITEMS and SPELLS. Which is ok up to a point. <br />
<br />
Think about it, what seperates two level 70 shamans of equal levels and AA exp ??       (besides how the person individually plays)<br />
<br />
Items and their obtained spells !<br />
<br />
Now, (for Example) I had played a game called Shadowbane (RPG). It was not as good as EQ (no where near enough content/quests) but the one thing that made it better than EQ was each character you made would be 100% unique than any other character on the server. Depending on how you want to build him and what areas you want to concentrate on. <br />
<br />
IE : Lets say you made a &quot;TANK&quot;<br />
<br />
You could make this tank into a 50% DPS 50% damage absorbtion character or make him 100% one way or another, or any combination you choose (% wise), Depending on how you spend your exp points when you level. Of course there was other abilities and features but not to get into a whole page about it.......<br />
<br />
But do you understant my point ??<br />
<br />
I think EQ 2 tried to do a bit of this by having more types of classes:<br />
EX: Dark Shaman, Light Shaman, the Dark would have stronger Dots but the Light would have the better heals. (A step in the right direction but not enough)<br />
<br />
              So when you get your 10K HP and 10 Mana unbuffed and raided your ass'es off like there was no tomorrow, WHO GIVES A  FLYING FOOK ? You are still a level 70 SHAMAN and your role still stays the same as any other level 70 shaman who has Half the mana pool or HP and who doesn't have all the spells. <br />
<br />
So don't worry about all this class balancing bull****, its all 1 game and its all the same for everyone who plays<br />
<br />
The next RPG that can have the same content as EQ but with this &quot;uniqueness&quot; feature will dominate no doubt</div></div><hr />
