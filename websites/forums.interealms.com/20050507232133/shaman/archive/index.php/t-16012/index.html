<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jafah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is this doable now with one group assuming the resists are really high?  I left the game about 1 year and a half ago when it took a large raid force to think about ToV.  Seems like now some of it should be doable with one group of 65s.  We tried last night and had to corpse pull 2 of the team to HoT because they were KoS to CoV faction.  We pacified one worm pulled it and its AE aggroed the mobs outside the door.  Was this because there were members in group KoS to Cov or is there a method to keep is AE pointed a different direction or something?<br />
<br />
Are the helm and toe turn in guys still In Skyshrine by WL zoneline and is there any way to turn them in while still being KoS?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes doable with one group for a long time now. I know of two people who duo Doze in HoT all the time. yes you aggroed because of the KOS folk. I think there are spots to not aggro, prolly have to be out of LOS of door. I just raised my faction again and the guy I turned stuff into was near where you used to get your shrine key. Dunno if there is another. I don't think you can do it while KOS but am unsure if there is a trick to do it. I just smoked everything in the Kael arena over a couple of days and got ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HoT has been 1 groupable for a long time now (2 years+ probably - we've been doing it since later 2001).  If you can get lucky around mob resists, it's shaman soloable (I've tried, only once been successful, a few too many deaths :) )<br />
<br />
If you're kos, it's a bit tougher, but still easily doable.  Best to test the waters while nonkos, makes it easier.  If you're kos, the mobs are really weak, you can easily just train everything to the HoT door and die inside, then have the nonkos rez you.<br />
<br />
Avoid the door if you're kos, Zemm is very picky about who he lets live.  Sometimes you can walk around freely and he'll not bother you, but sometimes he'll come dashing right in when you think you are safe.  Pick a side of the ledge and stay there, don't try crossing back and forth.</div></div><hr />
