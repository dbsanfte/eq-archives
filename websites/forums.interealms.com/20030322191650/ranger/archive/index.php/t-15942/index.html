Helm of the Tracker - As of right now, I only have the FG overseer's head, I'm needing the heads from Kael.  My guild almost never goes to Kael, and when we do, we get stuck at the bank, so I'm about to ding 56, and I still don't have my HotT :(<br />
<br />
Swirling sphere of color : Again, my guild doesn't go to PoA, you almost never find a pickup raid (air = expensive :P), and it's my second-to-last piece (Grubbin hasn't dropped _MY_ JR yet)<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated - check your banks and let me know, eiher here, or in game :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance -</div></div><hr />
