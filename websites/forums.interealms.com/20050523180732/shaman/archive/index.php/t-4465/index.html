<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kudamorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question my guild is considering changing factions from SS/dorf to kael... Not soon but not so far away. I have bought the gems for all the parts that I want and was woundering if I should keep trying for SS or get Kael.. I know Kael has more ac and SS has resists but I want adivise from a person that most liekly has expierence from both. Thx..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ss armor is better, by the time you have a set you're gonna be over any reasonable ac cap anyways. this goes for most all classes i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's broken down like this. SS has more HP, Kael has more AC. Id have to disagree with the comment of being over a reasonable cap with Kael. With Kael or better i sit at 1083ac. <br />
<br />
It's a close call, most seem to prefer SS. As far as im concerned it's close enough that looks come into play. the Dark Kael compliments my Vindi BP nicely :)<br />
