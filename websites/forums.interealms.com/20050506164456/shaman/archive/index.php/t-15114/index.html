<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought in the early days when dungeon groups were the norm and presented a serious challenge to people using extremely inferior gear, that there was alot of skill involved.  People in general played better and smarter.  Not everybody knew every dungeon maze like the back of their hand but they played with alot more care.  Group etiquette was much more important too and people seemed to have alot more concern about their reputation as a skilled player.<br />
<br />
Nowadays it seems like most people have Warrior Syndrome when the **** hits the fan or even when doing something extremely menial like finding the right PoK book to click.

The headaches involved in responding to a raid full of people with their own complaints, issues and personalities is more than most can tolerate - or have any conception of what it is like.  <br />

Those guys have what could be considered &quot;skill&quot; in my opinion.  Doing what Furor, Thott etc, have done over the years clearly takes a form of skill because not many have done it.  <br />

Your statement hints to the fact that this is a bad thing.  Drunk, ok i will agree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">STRATEGY.<br />
<br />
many people do not realize this but once you begin raiding Everquest really shift from a roleplaying game to a real time strategy game, where each player is a unit in warfare against a target. Coordination, assisting properly, picking who to heal and when to heal, what to mez and when to mez, what to slow and when to slow, its all strategy and it all takes an amazing amount of intelligence and even further, quickness and skill with your hands.<br />
<br />
I duo with an elemental necromancer in Crypt of decay. I am equipped in mediocre Velious loot... 2700 hitpoints unbuffed, 4k mana unbuffed... yet she says I am the best shaman she has ever played with. Not to shamelessly gloat (okay I am) but the reason she loves duoing with me so much is because of how much attention I devote when we are duoing (and this is charm duoing, so it takes a LOT of attention) and how quickly I can react with smart decisions. When to slow versus when to patch heal versus when to root park versus when to run for the zone line. All choices she trusts me with.<br />
<br />
A lot of people think Everquest is boring, because its nothing more than turning autoattack on and going AFK. That couldn't be further from the truth.</div></div><hr />

Wizards can and have tanked AOW sir!

I agree to a certain extent, there is no skill really involved in &quot;playing&quot; everquest.  But to be truly great, you do need to knowledge, hand eye coordination etc.  I play on Sullon Zek, and any of the shaman's on the pvp servers can tell you, it takes alot more than a click of a button to kill someone.  Playing against mobs, it might be more of an autoattack thing, but against real life opponents its alot more strategy and real time thinking.  I used to play CS competitively, and i can honestly say that there is just as much hand eye coordination if not more involved EQ than CS and just as much strategy.  And i also think this is what makes the pvp servers so much fun, its no longer a game of click click click... its more of a &quot;oh sh**!!!!! click, run, hide, heal, click click click.. pick up pp and sig from dead player (if you're lucky).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I always find it amusing to see this argument when EQ gets slammed. And the answer is, I think, that it depends.<br />
<br />
If you're part of an XP grind group in OT or DL is takes barely any skill to play this game. Someone has to be totally incapable before it intrudes into the gameplay. This is where all the &quot;EQ means hit autoattack&quot; ideas come from.<br />
<br />
If you're part of a group going somewhere challenging it changes quickly. You can really see the difference between someone who's on the ball and knows their stuff and the average gamer. Indeed it can be so demanding it's hard to find a group you trust enough to enter such places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">it is all about Patience   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">10% of the players on EQ have no skill.  They are the bards swarm kiting and killing everyone around them (they read it on EQDiva and thought they could do it too).  They are the warriors that think that their new Knockback procing weapon looks cool - so it's a good thing to use on a raid while they MT.  They are the clerics who think that Divine Light is the only heal worth casting....<br />
<br />
There are 80% of the players that play and do just fine.  These are your typical players who group, raid, camp, quest, tradeskill, etc.  What they do they do because they learned what it takes to survive, get exp, and accomplish the normal goals of the common player.<br />
<br />
Then there is the last 10% of the players who through innate ability or great skill push the envelope.  The first wizard to solo PoFear.  The first shaman to solo WW dragons.  The first bard to swarm kite half of HoH.<br />
<br />
There is definitely a skill to playing EQ - but it's not a requirement.</div></div><hr />

- Tanking to me is to be able to maintain the attention of the mob not just having 10000000 giga quads of HP. A wizard who is being pummled into the ground by a mob can't maintain aggro, thus he can't &quot;tank&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well, I do not play on a pvp server, but I have done a lot of dueling.  About 95% of winning a duel is knowing what you need to do to kill the other guy, and to counter his attempts at killing you.  The other 5% is carrying out your actions.  It really isn't difficult, you just have to know what to do.  Heal here, run there, dot him now, dispell yourself soon, etc...  All you really have to do is make sure you're targetting the right person and casting the right spell.  It is a bit more difficult when you throw in some extra players or even a 3rd team (I have played a bit of daoc, so I am not completely unfamiliar with pvp), but still all it really takes is practice.<br />
<br />
I also used to play counterstrike competatively (Former CAL-I, competed at 4 CPLs, if that means anything to you.), and I have to say that the hand-eye coordination required in EQ is laughable compared to what you need for CS.  There are really only 2 things I can think of that I have done that have required any real ability to navigate in a 3d environment.  One of them is jousting, or just circlestrafing your opponent so that he is always in front of you and you're moving in circles around him.  I've actually beat true melees before in straight melee duels because they cannot move around as well as I can.  The second thing is fighting rangers, where you run alongside him in that sweetspot where he can't quite reach you with his swords, but you're just slightly too close for him to use his bow.  It took me about 20 seconds to learn the sweetspot against rangers, and I have known how to circle-strafe for almost a decade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Counting is the only skill in EQ. <br />
<br />
Counting how long the mezz lasts, how long you can wait before nuking, how long it takes a mob to path from A to B, how long it takes a mob to warp, how long until slow wears off, how long until the next DT, how long til you cast CHeal, etc. If you can count, you can play EQ.<br />
<br />
And I somehow doubt any Wizard has ever had a problem getting agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Oh I dunno.  The difference between a smart player and an average on becomes crystal ****ing clear to me as soon as the group encounters a challenging situation.  The smart players will immediately act to make the best of the situation and pull tricks out of their asses to survive and/or evac in a timely manner.  EQ at its hardest is all about timing, paying attention to your surroundings, groupmates, raidmates, and any mobs.  But mostly about timing.  Making the right choice is crucial too at times.  <br />
<br />

hehe.. i knew there would be some cal-i players here =P... farthest i made it was cal-m, then i quit CS for EQ because its its more fun... i really don't think that you get the feeling unless you play on a pvp server... in CS, all people are basically created equal, albeit someone with a colt is more likely to beat someone with a mp5/deagle etc, all things being equal otherwise.  On the pvp servers its a bit different, especially Sullon, where a lvl 65 can pick on a 50, and its never 1v1</div></div><hr />

Good equipment does not equal a good player. Many good players have good equipment, but having good gear does not automatically make you a good player.<br />
<br />
Most of the good players grew up in the earliest periods of EQ, when you had to make due with less. When you level up to level 30 in patchwork or banded armor, you learn things the EQ crack babies of today never learned. When you level up to 50+ with KEI and equipment that most of us didnt earn until well after level 50, you never learn basic concepts like managing your mana, avoiding adds, or even knowing your way around the world. You recklessly crash and plunder through the low level exp zones on your way up the ZEM chain. You think the game is 'easy' and when you reach that point in the game where KEI and your storebought-twink-gear's impact is nominal - bad things happen because you dont have the basic skills to function, nor have you even really learned your own class.</div></div><hr />

But yeah I guess games like these are not based around skills but are more around character development, social interaction and Decision Making. It tests your ability to manage and find our your social qualities to an extent, for example leadership. Or how you react to some people. <br />
<br />
I guess most important requisite would be knowledge, knowing where to level, knowing what equipment to use, and say for example trading in the bazaar knowing what is a good price. <br />
Anyway interesting to read what others wrote. Also its very hard to define skill I guess in the true sense, I guess most games most people relate skill with hand-to-eye coordination.</div></div><hr />

  Just what do you think skill is?<br />
<br />
   A crack shot with a rifle?  He knows how to hold it, how to breathe, and what time to squeeze the trigger (and how).<br />
<br />
   Ok, how about a gymnast?  All they know is how to hold the bars, which way to shift their weight, what foods to eat, how to tone their body.<br />
<br />
   Hrm, so far only knowledge and timing seem to be defining skill... maybe if I stretch I can find something better....<br />
<br />
  A chef?  They make tantalizing foods!   Of course, that is a knowledge of what spices go well together, and how long to cook foods, what pleases the pallate....  hrm..<br />

  A musician?  nope, knowledge of what strings to hit, what shape to put the lips in, pressures to apply and timing and chords....<br />
<br />
  A doctor?  Just a bunch of anatomy, timing, equipment and herbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
  A hunter?   Nope, same as the marksman but add in a ton of patience and a little more knowledge, like where to wait and how not to scare them away.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I guess that means people have been posting that EQ doesn't take any skill to play because it only requires you to have elements of skill...   Just like how I don't live near a forest, I live near a large grouping of trees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I generally think you could train a monkey to malos a mob on inc and slow it when a tank has enough aggro.  Then during that time cannibalize / nuke or dot the mob.  I generally think the only way I usually can tell if someone is skilled in Everquest is as soon as the **** hits the fan and you have to start using your mind to live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The argument is eq takes limited skill, not that it takes no skill. With things such as chef, doctor there are more distinctions of these people by skill/style and knowledge. With eq the distinction between say 2 shamans is hard to distinct by skill. <br />
<br />
But yeah caanus I came across same thought as I was thinking about the definition skill. But I used 2 examples in my mind of a plumber and a footballer. Footballer more people would most likely associate with skill. However a plumber is just as skillful just less likely to relate to it as much as the footballer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Steelbear has it right, Skill in everquest comes through challange, not going out at lvl 1 with equipment some lvl 65(like me) dont even have after 3 years playing. When your equipment are in the same lvl as you and the monsters you fight(as SoE have tried to balance it) then you learn how to get the most out of your spells and how to move and engage to survive <br />
<br />
I am not suprised at the amount of idiots that exists in BoT these days....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">EQ requires the social skills, ability to type, and a certain amount of reading comprehension, unless you plan to play a druid or necro.<br />
It does not require great reaction time or manual dexterity, no fight is decided by you pressing the right button 0.3 sec faster then the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">There is most definately skill involved in playing everquest.  Is it absolutely required to succeed?  Well that depends on how you define success in EQ.<br />
<br />
If your only measure of success in EQ is the gear your character has, then skill is not necessarily required.  Hell, you can buy better gear than some very skilled players I know have.  As others have said though, when the **** hits the fan, it will be very obvious who's skilled and who's not.  <br />
<br />
You can play baseball with only a minimum of skill, but that doesn't mean there's no skill required to play it at all.  I think the biggest problem most have is that to play a sport such as baseball at the top of the game, professionally, you HAVE to be very highly skilled at that sport.  The same is not necessarily true in EQ.  Some people just ride their guilds coattails and &quot;succeed&quot; in the sense that they get the most uber phat lewts, despite only having the most rudimentary skill at actually playing the game.  That doesn't mean that there is no skill involved in playing EQ, it just means that you can get around it and still get the phat lewts.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Grellaart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Skill, yes i think so. If your in a high level guild, taking down high level baddies, strategy would be a better word. Each player must know his role. For shamis, debuf, slow, watch yer aggro, tank mez if u need to. I think shamis take more skill than most, since we are mini tanks, enchanters, clerics and overall balls of fury all rolled into one :D</div></div><hr />
