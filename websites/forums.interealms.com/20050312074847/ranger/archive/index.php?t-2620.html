<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerOfTunare</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I was heading through EC today I ran into a halfling named (something) woodentoe, when hailed he said he was headed to freeport for an appointment with a fletcher about his superior wooden shafts.  I investigated Freeport but couldn't find anything.  I tried hailing two fletching merchants near the NFP bank but got no response, asking about the shafts proved useless too.  Anyone want to check this out?  May have something to do with the new tradeskill recipes included in the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Wed May 08 19:26:27 2002] Jimble Woodentoe judges you amiably -- You could probably win this fight.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:26:28 2002] You say, 'Hail, Jimble Woodentoe'<br />
[Wed May 08 19:26:29 2002] Jimble Woodentoe says 'Hail! I'd love to stop and chat with ya but I'm running late to an appointment in Freeport with a fletcher interested in my superior wooden shafts.'<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:11 2002] You have slain Jimble Woodentoe!<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:11 2002] Your faction standing with Storm Reapers got worse.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:11 2002] Your faction standing with Mayor Gubbin got worse.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:11 2002] Your faction standing with Merchants of Rivervale got <br />
<br />
worse.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:11 2002] Your faction standing with Unkempt Druids got better.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:17 2002] You receive 5 silver, 8 copper as your split.<br />
[Wed May 08 19:58:22 2002] --You have looted a Bundle of Hardwood Staves.--<br />
<br />
tried combining the staves to make arrows or bows with standard components and procedure, but no luck...<br />
btw, the staves have the graphic in inventory that cinny sticks have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeryn</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay well he follows the path straight for Freeport, and nothing I've tried makes him miss a step.  Sorry, didn't log it to get specifics but I tried all I could think of based on the one little blurb he gives you for &quot;Hail.&quot;  &quot;What wooden shafts&quot;, &quot;I am interested&quot;, &quot;Why are you late&quot;, that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
He depops almost immediately after the trail ends in East Commons, just a little before you actually hit the zone, so I zoned across to see whether he'd spawn in West Freeport after a bit and continue on, and he doesn't appear to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerOfTunare</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked the fletchers in NFP Crizzar, they didn't say anything.  Perhaps there are other fletchers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torth</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't fletch much and if I do its usually in kelethine.  I remember a merchant at one of the inns near the orc camps sells fletching parts, I think bows.  Try checking that merchant and one in Kithcor, he might be taking the staves from Morin Shadowbane, merchants near EC/kith  zone and another near HH or even RV too FP.  Perhaps Kithcor himself? Its just a thought.</div></div><hr />

Are these new?  Also, in the bowyer book, they make mention of STEEL, and Ceramic bows.  Have these always been there?<br />
<br />
Also, I have heard from a couple people about mithril arrowheads.  Is this true, and if so, does anyone know the recipe or have a link where I could find it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeryn</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Confounded little Halfling... He won't actually come out and say who he's meeting specifically by name. I tried hailing the bow and arrow component vendors in North Freeport as well, nada. They don't respond to questions like &quot;Who is Jimble Woodentoe?&quot; either.<br />
<br />
I s'pose next would be looking all over the Freeport zones for more new NPCs, rather than the ones we do know about.  Also, considering Jimble never stops moving for anything, I might go back and try peppering him with questions again to make sure he was in range to be answering me.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like Wolverine found something new in the boyer's guide.</div></div><hr />

Yup, been there since day 1.</div></div><hr />

P.S.  I'm going to check out some of the places Torth mentioned as soon as I can.  I just wish that halfling would stop walking and talk for a second=p.</div></div><hr />
