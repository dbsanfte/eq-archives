<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daeroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I'm a level 49 Wood Elf of Tunare.  When I try to talk to Telin he says I have not proved myself... Is this a faction issue?  I currently /con aimiable to him.  I was told he wouldn't talk to you at all if it was faction... Or have they made it so you now can't even start the epic unless you are 50 or 51+ or something?  I know many that started the quest a while back and can still work on it. <br />
<br />
If it is faction does anyone know what my faction needs to be and what the order of positive faction is?  Eg Warmly, Kindly, Aimbiable etc.. what is the order on that so I can figure out where I need to get to?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated as I'm currently a total stand still trying to start this.  I haven't killed anything that should have messed me up. So if aimiable is lower then I require do all wood elves of Tunare start out that way?<br />
<br />
