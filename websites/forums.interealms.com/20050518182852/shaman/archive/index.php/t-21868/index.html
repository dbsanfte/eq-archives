I love to read the Crucible and I post here all the time, but even I can't stand to read thru all the bs that has been posted the past few days.  The good ideas are getting hidden and buried.  Gloriana with the help of all of us came up with a good list of shaman concerns in the petition.  I suggest that we concentrate on defending that petition and trying to get some of those ideas taken care of.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion from 5+ years of playing this game that Verant/Sony has their vision of the game, their vision of content, their vision of class balance, etc.  I was a little baffled at that at first but I have come to accept that over time.  I do feel, though, that the developers do not understand the dynamics of experience groups nor of raid stacking in the higher content world.  What looks good on paper does not always translate to actual play in Everquest.  Such is the plight of shaman because we look so good on paper and in some instances like easy LDON we can just grab 5 melee and go to town or we can take down old world content boss mobs in 10-15 min fights.<br />
<br />
I continue to believe that Sony will not fundamentally change the basic shaman spell lineup but they might re-tune it.  We should follow Brenlo's advice and focus on rational discussion and backup to present our case.  Now, I am at a bit of a loss myself on how to do that from a numerical standpoint.  I just know that when I am in a GOD group my spot heals which are only used in an emergency are not sufficient for their intended use.  I know that in a raid situation that having long casting DD's (that don't pack much punch) rarely make it to typical clearing mobs who are dead by the time it lands.<br />
<br />
I know that not having a wearing off message for FA can't be overpowering and the duration is purely annoying.  I know that having a AC buff that I (as a grouping shaman) have never used because of stacking issues can't be &quot;working as intended&quot;.  I know that I never use disease dots, I never use single target buffs except for FA, I know that not being able to out of group shrink with confirmation is mind boggling.  I know that cannying all the time creates carpal and really isn't part of balancing, and having an ancient spell in GOD to partially remedy that will be like torpor was in the old days - in the hands of very few because of a coding mistake.  Why not just double canny4 and extend the recast time???boggle??<br />
<br />
Anyway, way too long of a post but I'm hoping it will be helpful.<br />

Ranting and complaining has been proven to work for a lot of classes. Patient reasoning has been proven to not work for shaman from Kunark to GoD. Why should it work now, after the spell developer basically told us slow and stat buffs balance us?<br />
<br />
I love to read the Crucible and I post here all the time, but even I can't stand to read thru all the bs that has been posted the past few days.<br />
Then don't. Noone is forcing you to read these posts. Go ahead and post something you like to read. Add to a discussion you like. Complaining about complaints will not exactly lower the amount of complaint posts.<br />
<br />
The good ideas are getting hidden and buried.  Gloriana with the help of all of us came up with a good list of shaman concerns in the petition.  I suggest that we concentrate on defending that petition and trying to get some of those ideas taken care of.<br />
That list has been sent to the developers, it has been posted, crossposted and linked to dozens on dozens of boards. So have tons of others posts. If you feel any of them are particularly worthy of repeat attention go ahead and bump them.<br />
<br />
We should follow Brenlo's advice and focus on rational discussion and backup to present our case.  Now, I am at a bit of a loss myself on how to do that from a numerical standpoint.<br />
Lots of people did that. I have not bookmarked these posts but you can find mine by clicking on my profile.</div></div><hr />

The only ones who are not complaining are those who are too dumb to see that they are not pulling their weight anymore. When they see people with an IQ above room temperature post threads containing words they do not understand they start to tell said people to stop complaining so they can go back to being inferior to everyone else.<br />
<br />
In other words:<br />
Do not tell me to learn to play my class. Posting utter crap like &quot;there are millions of things to do in a raid&quot; and dismissing anyone daring to voice a complaint as a crappy player is beyond dumb.<br />
<br />
Tell me, what are these millions of things to do? And tell me why classes who just do what we do better can not also do these things?</div></div><hr />

Who cares if it's worse then a druid...if you want to be best at everything get Diablo 2 and a trainer.<br />
Heal, nuke, avatar, cripple, cure sickness, shrink, grow, deal with the adds.  Tonnes of stuff.  Use your imagination.  I get a kick out of you who say stat buffs are useless even though I get more tells for stat buffs then anything else.  Your prolly the ones that are also bitching about having to cast &quot;useless&quot; stat buffs on the &quot;idiots&quot; who think they make a difference.  You're as useless as you make yourself out to be.  You want to sit in the corner and bitch cause there is three other shaman on the raid then go ahead.  You want to come to the boards and express your lame, tired rants about how useless shams are then either quit or start another class.  If you get this upset over a game then it's time to move on cause eventually this game will end for everyone, you might as well leave now while you are still semi-happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyone daring to voice a complaint<br />
There is nothing daring about anonymous ranting about a video game.  I never said you were a crappy player.  All I hear is how crappy our heals are compared to this class, or our slows are useless.  I was  on a raid last night in GoD with 54 other people (4 shams including me).  I was constantly running around keeping the clerics alive from AoE, avataring, cureing.  If I can take the burden off another class for somethings then I am doing my job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The ones who are constantly bitching are the ones who only know how to stat buff and slow.  There are millions of things to do in a raid.  Don't bitch about your class...learn to play it better.  The ones who can't adapt, bitch.<br />
Every time I read this I find a new case of utter ridiculousness. Lets see.<br />
<br />
The ones who are constantly bitching are the ones who only know how to stat buff and slow.<br />
Of course that sentence is obviously false. Let us chalk that one up to hyperbole.<br />
<br />
1 ) Why is it that those same stat buffing idiots complain about their new &quot;past the cap&quot; stat buffs?<br />
<br />
2 ) Why is it that those same slowing idiots complain about their new less resistable slow?<br />
<br />
3 ) Why is it that the biggest complaints are coming from post time shaman? While they might not be better players they certainly must have a solid amount of raiding experience.<br />
<br />
There are millions of things to do in a raid.<br />
4 ) Even if that were true it still leaves a couple billion complaints about groups.<br />
<br />
5 ) There flat out are not a million things to do on a raid. There is healing + curing, doing damage, debuffing and buffing (+tanking for the tanks). You might be able to toss in a little positioning on a few raids.<br />
<br />
Don't bitch about your class...learn to play it better.<br />
6 ) Because obviously complaining about anything at all prooves I can not play my class.<br />
<br />
7 ) Can you tell me what exactly makes shaman able to learn to play their class better and prevents other classes from doing so? Me being able to outdo morons does not make my class balanced.<br />
<br />
The ones who can't adapt, bitch.<br />
8 ) And that makes you what?<br />
<br />
9 ) How am I supposed to adapt to being flat out worse of a class? Oh, I forgot. Shaman are inherently better players then other classes.<br />
<br />
Could you please post something again? That was rather entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I never said you were a crappy player.<br />

If you did not in fact say that may I ask who was controlling your computer for that first post?<br />
<br />

In other words you added less damage then a druid would have done, healed less then a druid would have healed, cured the same things druids can cure.<br />
<br />
If I can take the burden off another class for somethings then I am doing my job.<br />
By that definition healing a single point of damage and then logging off is &quot;doing your job&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I know what I can do... my point was you make a blanket statement about peoples abilities, and you don't even know them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry asshat. I WAS happy until the end of PoP, when they flushed my class down the can. You get a lot of tells for stat buffs? Congradulations. You can also cast spirit sight and acumen on people if you want to feel useful.<br />
<br />
Deal with adds? Isnt that the offtank and chanters job?<br />
<br />
Shrink/Grow? Wow. And I thought you were lame before that point... you sir, are off the charts now. As a side note, we require shrink devices to join.<br />
<br />
Use my imagination? How about I imagine that my class brings something to the raid/group that couldnt better be filled through another class, or filled close enough, with the other class offering much more secondary value. <br />
<br />
I've had my car a few years now. Lets say the manufacturers come out and take the engine out, and replace it with a crappier one. Your suggestion is, rather than try and get your car fixed, you should quit driving or buy a new one? <br />
<br />
Why is quitting or giving up always what complacent wankers like yourself suggest. Why not working to get somethign CHANGED? than you. If you have an elemental ++ cleric lying around, I'll change, and go about my business. Until then, **** while we try and get us AND YOU improved to be of equal value.</div></div><hr />

That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Everyone knows Shaman dont stack on raids and no amount of saying we are fine is going to make it so. If you feel you are fine so be it but please dont tell the rest of us who disagree with you we dont know how to play.</div></div><hr />

Based on when you first joined this forum (2001), I assume you've seen in the past 3 years many posts, filled with empirical evidence (to the degree it's available) highlighting various points of contention the shaman community has with SOE.  Those posts have been met with - at best - skepticism and - at worst - silence.  <br />
<br />
The second half of your post recounts all the complaints you share with many others in the shaman community.  You even make mention of the shaman petition, which was circulated months ago.  What results has that petition garnered?  None.  How exactly do you think the problems you reference are going to get fixed, then?  Another petition?  What precedent would lead you to believe version 2.0 would be met with any more action than 1.0?<br />
<br />
SOE has shown, through their own actions, that they only respond to histrionics.  Well-mannered, thoughtful posts are met with silence.  SOE established the precedent of only responding to the loudest, most vocal of protests.  Furor throwing a fit about monk mitigation, the warrior agro protests, etc.  These were responded to with changes to game mechanics.  The shaman petition accomplished nothing at all.  <br />
<br />
We would all love to play a game where the developers responded to reasonable, logical posts.  Sadly, they don't.  They only respond to significant threats to their profit margins.  <br />
<br />
Witness the recent summit, which was precipitated by an unprecedented number of player defections, massive player discontent of a scale I've never seen in 5 years, and numerous high-profile guild disintegrations, two at least of which went directly to the primary competitor, Worlds of Warcraft.  SOE only responded with the placebo-summit when it became obvious that a HUGE number of high-end, multiple-account players were leaving out of frustration and taking their subscription dollars with them.  So they invite 60 high-profile site moderators and guild leaders to a wine-and-dine session in an attempt to dazzle them back into complacence.  <br />
<br />
You can attach to the developers all the nobility and integrity you want.  It won't change the reality of the past 5 years.<br />

<br />
I hate to say looking at the way things have worked from the &quot;proposal&quot; to the complaints about our GoD spells, to the current &quot;rants&quot; over the new spells, it realy looks to me like the only way shamans are given abilities that are stauts quo is in a reaction to weeks and months of shamans ranting.  Long literate, well thought out posts were repetedly dismissed out of hand by SoE representatives, while pasionate rants got attention, and eventualy, at least small boosts to some shaman abilities, to where they were on par with the internal healing percentages for example.<br />
<br />
SoE has repeatedly demonstraited that they will only do something in responce to series of long angry venting rants, canceled accounts and poor sales.</div></div><hr />

You want lots of damage...be a monk or a wiz. 30 minute fights make us more necessary for slows and what not.  The &quot;problems&quot; you are having are the 30-second fight makes shaman obsolete (which is still a bunch of crap if you ask me).  You want to do more in 30 seconds then we can right now.

Hey, when was the last time you logged on into EQ?<br />
<br />
How many of those classes that are &quot;balanced&quot; towards short fights are running low on mana(which is the only criterion to look at when comparing effectiveness to efficiency or rather the diminishing power over time)?<br />
<br />
Are you getting it?<br />
<br />
Go to VT, the only place where fights are anywhere close in duration to what we are discussing(and that's if you are doing it with 1 group nowadays maybe) and then compare Shamans to another class in terms of healing, dps etc. then come back to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heal, HoT, buff, slow, haste eh?<br />
<br />
Healing, HoTs and Slows are one and the same thing, if we want to talk about functions, with Slow being as unstackable as it gets.<br />
<br />
Buff and Haste? <br />
<br />
Again, one is part of the other and both pertain to the same function and have *abosolutely* jack and **** to do with fight length, which is what we were discussing. Right?<br />
<br />
If you'd read and think instead of throwing out moronic sentences, you'd notice that Necros have more utility than Shamans, but more importantly, that this wasn't supposed to be solely a comparison between Necros and Shamans.<br />
You are free to compare Shamans to other classes performing similar functions in realistic long term encounters.<br />
<br />
In VT, the place where Shamans would become gods, if Shamans got better short term DPS and Healing according to you, a Shaman might be healing and doing damage on top of the Slow(that is only provided by 1 of no matter how many Shamans at the raid). <br />
<br />

I have to admit, he may have something here.  Thinking back on it, I can't believe the times I've missed that I could have been shrinking and growing people more, or if they didn't know I could shrink and grow them, I could have told them that I could do it any time I wanted to!  Pretty much as much as they want!  All raid long, through a whole LDON, whatever...anytime, anywhere.   Oh my God, they probably never even realized.  And I'm responsible.  I have to take 100% of the blame, the full dose, right up the snout.  <br />

I feel I've cheated my guildmates, groupmates, friends.  I could have even been shrinking strangers in POK!  I don't know why I'm even saying this out loud, but...I feel ashamed.<br />

All those hours I spent not shrinking and growing people.  My God, what a fool I was!  I had so much right there, sitting right in the palm of my hands, and I didn't even do ANYTHING about it!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Nobody says that Shaman can't be useful on a raid.  But once buffs are done, you only NEED 1 Shaman.  Our other skills are replaced very easily by most other classes.  A Ranger can Nuke, Dot, and heal, but it doesn't mean that is what he does on a raid.  And yes, I have been healed by a Necro.  Talk about a class that has come from solo hell to fit right in.<br />

It's an opinion thread, they won't read it, they know our opinions.  If they are interested, they'll see the SoE fanboys are a) outnumbered, b) lacking any real argument.  Hey, maybe they'll give you a job, you'll fit right in (not a fair insult to SoE guys, aimed at Ryan mostly for his comments on &quot;overpowering&quot; slows and buff impact).<br />
<br />
As for your tool comments, no one has directly insulted you ... well till my fit right in comment, and you open this up.  Priceless.  You won't argue against balancing, but you do at every turn and then call your fellow shamans tools?  Classy (Oh, that's sarcasm in case you didn't recognise it).</div></div><hr />

Why waste your time offering adverse views then?  Do us all a favor and save yourself even more time by not posting at all then.  Or is this just a cop out?  If I am going to tell someone they are wrong, I would think enough of my ideas to defend them with facts or something I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet you felt the need to claim Shamans couldn't get improved for short fights without turning them into gods for long fights...then, when I logically dismissed your ignorant statement and asked for arguments, you suddenly play the &quot;I don't care, I have fun&quot; card or how I like to call it the &quot;I am a clueless monkey pretending to be smart&quot; card.<br />
<br />
You definitely fit right in there with your buddy Gagner. The more I think about it, the more I believe you are onto something there with the way reputation works on these boards.</div></div><hr />

I've downloaded the updates 2x in the past 3 months, but everytime I even think about logging in, I'm hit with the reality of what the game had become for shaman, and I dont feel like starting over, so maybe, just maybe in another month or so, I'll decide where I stand on the game. But for now, I'd probably have to say while my account isnt cancelled, my displeasure isnt an empty threat. I dont see sony fixing any of the major issues for us, and I dont see myself playing eq with things as they are. And I'm not.</div></div><hr />

The problem that SOE has is how do you make us better in the 30 second fight that doesn't make us gods in the 30 minute fight.<br />
Never did I say that you couldn't do it, I said its going to be tough.  Get your facts strait please, tnks.  Boy you sure are getting all worked up when someone exresses a different opinion then yours.  Have a good weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Opinions&quot; are great. Everyone can have one apparently and it doesn't even have to be based on facts. You just say something, call it an opinion, and it magically gains legitimacy and becomes &quot;untouchable&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have little ability to handle being disagreed with on either a practical or personal basis, even to the point of obsessing over rep points.  That's not an asset in regard to using  internet message boards.  You need a hide like a rhino to use these things.
