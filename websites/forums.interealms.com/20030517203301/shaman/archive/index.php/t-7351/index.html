<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hoping to lead a raid on him, just wondering what kind of force is needed, what tactics to use, how to even get there (:o), etc. Need help with this one guys :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look for strategies on Reavers.<br />
<br />
Ghiosk spawns off the first reaver (after he chain-spawns, he ends up as Ghiosk). Fights like a reaver. Dies fast.<br />
<br />
So do the typical reaver force...<br />
<br />
Rogue to get you in and operate the lift.<br />
Monk/Necro/SK to pull the reavers.<br />
Tanks to take the reavers down.<br />
Clerics to heal the tanks.<br />
<br />
Raid force typically waits outside near the gazebos, only the rogue and the puller goes in and takes the reavers out one by one. Reavers proc blind, so don't let your clerics tank.<br />
<br />
Reavers are 100% MR, so while some people have been able to land a spell or two on them, it's usually not worth bothering. I've never been able to slow them. When 1 dies, another respawns on top of it (chain-spawn). The number of reavers is random, but finally either Ghiosk, Rak, Neh, or a yard trash ghost/specter will pop at the end of the chain. I've heard of 76 reavers in a row, but I usually see 1-5.</div></div><hr />
