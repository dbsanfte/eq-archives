<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xaelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyo,<br />
<br />
Well I've been thinking about it and narrowed it down to those three races to make a shaman. Heres what Im thinking about each race.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir - Looks cool, good quests I hear, nice stats.<br />
<br />
Froglok - Looks badass especially when casting doing flips n stuff, not sure if they get any good quests, also nice wis n stuff.<br />
<br />
Troll - Looks ugly as hell, but has regen and can use that Symbol of Innoruuk, good str n sta, but lousy wis.<br />
<br />
Soo, not sure which to choose. Troll is only there because of the regen n the clicky effect quest thing which I heard is very cool. Do Vah Shir or Frogloks get any equally cool quest items? Is the regen on the troll n the symbol worth being ugly n having exp penalty? Do Frogloks get an exp penalty as well? What do the Vah Shir and Frogloks look like in Bear Form? Alrighty thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">vah shir all the way.<br />
<br />
vah shir are brown in greater bear form.<br />
<br />
troll regen is nice but thier exp penalty sux. frog stats aren't great but they look cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well.. think of it this way.. you dont have to make that pesky choice between new asstastic models or old classic EQ models when you pick a frog.<br />
<br />
Their models are just good period.. plus they are small size, which means nothing mostly.. except its one less person to shrink.<br />
<br />
Frog stats are fine.. they are weak on strenght. but its basically a worthless throwaway stat anyway. Can get their stats to 100sta/105wis with beginning points Im fairly sure.</div></div><hr />

Excuse the hell out of me for asking a sincere question. I was going to use the search function but wanted to post afew other questions anyways. /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I wasn't going to be an Ogre shaman for some reason I think I'd go with Froglok just so I could shrink myself down to ankle-high to an Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cats-Ok starting stats, quests are a pain in the ass but if you like that kind of thing there are a ton, some that you HAVE to do (ugh).<br />
<br />
Frogs- if I see one more of these Im gonna be sick.  Stats suck, the flip is cool, but they displaced the rightfull residents of Grobb, so they suck<br />
<br />
Trolls- exp penalty stinks big time, necklace has uses but not something to base a race decision on, plus I dont even know if it still is questable since trolls start in Neriak now.  Regen is usefull for about 50 levels, but not worth 20% of the experience you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Excuse the hell out of me for asking a sincere question. I was going to use the search function but wanted to post afew other questions anyways. /rude<br />
<br />
dont mind soup , this is a question that gets asked so often its kinda annoying, i can relate to the irratation.<br />
<br />
anyway , ill say what i always say....<br />
<br />
There is only 1 race with a true advantage and that is ogre. They are the only shaman race with the &quot;no frontal stun&quot; ability<br />
<br />
Other races have natural regen , but once you get to 30-40 its of no use and its nothing a iksar regen BP cant fix which is not that hard to get.<br />
<br />
<br />
It boils down to 1 and only 1 thing. What are you going to have the most fun roleplaying , what embodies a shaman to you. To me it was a native american so naturaly the barb was the closest to that idea so here i am.<br />
<br />
Im 65 now and have enver once regreted it , if iw anna look like a orge or anything for a lil bit i have my potions , but oddly enough i always use halfling ;)<br />
<br />
So again , its all about fun , in the end there is no difference. Just think abut whats the coolest awnd there ya go.<br />
<br />
good luck .\</div></div><hr />

Yeah.  It has been since the upgrade.<br />
Go troll. That's what you're doing with this stupid fuscking thread anyways.<br />
<br />
The thread is pretty clearly named and yet you felt the need to come in and abuse him.  There certainly is a troll here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">2 things I'll add to the mix, if I rerolled for stats/abilities now, I'd go ogre, although saying that I don't think I could live without the tail =)<br />
<br />
Secondly, the frog quests are actually pretty good, I spent a day motoring through them with my froggy cleric, and whilst nothing amazing, the rewards would be utterly fantastic for an untwinked fresh player at the level required for them, a couple of the quests were broken or just stupidly obscure (The cleric additional initiate quest gave me nightmarish deja vu of trying to find quest bits in SonH, /shudder, anyone know what drops the journal needed for that currently?  Frog Exiles and Yun blah the poisoned didn't have it)  But they were mostly spot on being vague enough to not be too easy, but not annoyingly pointless either.</div></div><hr />

Go ogre if you are powergaming.<br />
if not make an iksar! we own :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sounds like you dont like the way trolls look. Go with one of the other two, and yes troll does have more benifits. I went Ogre. I definatly dont look like a little pansy thats why I chose him (big mean and cool looking) not cause of his starting stats or abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Phleggma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Seeing a lot of the same opinions.  If you're planning on being endgame with your shaman, I think that any more Ogre is the way to go.  Regen is overcome by Topor.  Once you've got Topor, regen is almost laughable.<br />
<br />
There is nt replacing the unstunnability from the fron that ogre's have, and in end game, that can mean the difference between getting that crucial heal/slow off and not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I went with an Innoruuk worshiping troll.   The snare necklace is awesome.  I don't regret my decision one bit.  Though I did kind of think the old world trolls looked cool when I made Bhum.   I still think they look cool and if I didn't want to use my lizard I would still be using old world models, /cry I miss the butt scratch.  To be truthful I am not entirely sure if the regen makes a huge difference as I haven't played another shaman race up to 60.  I don't really even notice it.  The exp pentalty really isn't as bad as some people are saying.  I made 60 in a reasonable amount of time, probably faster than lots of other classes because I had the ability to solo all the way up if I so choose.  In the end choose what you like, the no stun would be really cool but I don't really miss it all that much.  I don't think you need to plan to be an ogre if you play the end game.  From what I have seen very few of the shamans in the top tier guilds on my server are ogres.   Just choose what you think looks the coolest.  For me I pictured an evil shaman that lives in the swamp that makes potions and spreads poison and disease through out the lands, then I figured the troll kind of fit that description.</div></div><hr />

That 5% of the tiem is when i am castign and i get smacked and stunned and interrupted. Big deal.<br />

An ogre could be tanking then a mob can hit them for 10 dmg from the front and interrupt their casting. It's blind luck. And it's definetly somethign not worth spending 15% xp penalty on when u get no regen.<br />
<br />
On the other hand u coudl pay 5% more xp penalty on top of ogre and get regeneration. Somethign that helps almost every moment of your shaman life. When u fight u need it. In downtime u need it. when hurt and runnign away u still need it. Helps mitigate dots on you also.<br />
<br />
They say regen is not as useful later on. Well i cannot speak for 60+. But i am a troll who has an ikky bp. and i get 22regen/tick sitting. I am about to hit 2natural regen upgrades at 50 and 51 and since healign with stoicism is done at the END of the tick. That is when the natural and spell and item regen heal me too. Effectively it improves the heal by a lot and as i level by even more. Unlike an instant heal. Plus once u get to 55 u will be in the planes where xp is better than normal zone su won't feel it. Go troll and worship innoruuk. Or don't and spend the rest of your life wishing u had when u see trolls and iksars around u get mana faster than u. Hp regen for shamans = more mana faster.

incorrect. the bonus unstunnable with ogres is that a 'bash' attack does not interrupt. if you are not an ogre and you get bashed, your spell stops right there. you dont have a chance to channel.<br />
as an ogre you can channel through a bash if its from the front.<br />
with channeling aa and max channeling i channel pretty decently, but lots of times i would have only to get bashed. constantly, when PLing, i get hit by a bash..it's embarassing to let a level 10 die in kurns because you cant channel a heal through two level 9 skeles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hey, I started my troll a few months ago, and I knew all the advantages and disadvantages going in.  For me, well, the Troll made the most sense.  I'm solo'ing almost all the time.  The snare necklace is irreplaceable for me.  Couple that with the regen, and then using a JBB (Ikky's can't) and he's pretty unstoppable for his level.  So you're looking at a 20% xp penalty?  I combat this by solo'ing higher levels then others would be able to with little to no mana used.  My typical fight consists of Slow&gt;DogDog&gt;E-Bolt&gt;multiple JBB's with Canni 2 inbetween&gt;Snare at 40%&gt;JBB till dead.  By the time it falls, I'm back at FM and pulling again.  No need for KEI, and I rarely even need to blow a Stoi on myself, though it's up of course.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, if I was an Ogre, I'd likey have a decent arguement for that as well.  It's kinda what you make of it.  I'm a Troll, and I can't see myself performing better as anything else.<br />

Weigh it, pick one and don't look back.<br />

This is wrong, I've cast through being bashed but not stunned as a Vah Shir many times. The vast majority of interrupts you get aren't from stunning anyway so it doesn't make a huge difference on race. What race you pick really isn't important enough to debate over, the effects on the game are too small. Just pick something you want to play and dont second guess it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read my post again. It happend that u got hit and the roll was made and u lost (u didn't channel). Sh!t happens.<br />
I have gotten bashed before and channeled and i am a troll.<br />
It's simply a matter of luck. I got punded horribly by 2 seafurries before. There was a 3rd but slowed. Gate went off. Pure luck on that one. Just like when fighting u get hit for a ridiculously low amount of dmg 20's or 30's and yet it interrupts you.<br />
It's a random chance.<br />
Not gettign bashed is nice but payign 15% for it sucks.<br />
On the other hand 20% xp penalty for regen is worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I’m playing a Vah Shir shaman and like others have said about their shaman I’m happy with my choice.  I don’t like playing evil races.  It’s just not my play style.  I have a young gnome necromancer that I play as misunderstood as apposed to evil and he has the goal of being liked by every NPC in the game.  And so far he’s doing a decent job of it.<br />
<br />
If you’re the type of player who never takes a character above 40th or 50th level then your choice of race will have more of an effect on you.  It will also have more effect if you don’t twink your character.  At the high end of the game equipment and AA points will greatly balance the scales between the races.  But you have to get there first.  As a low to mid level player your race will affect where you can go and how easily you can tank.  But what you have to ask yourself is what’s more important to you: the numbers behind your character or your character itself.  If you’re more interested in game mechanics then by all means chart out all the pros and cons of regeneration over immunity to critical hits and other such abilities.  But if playing your character is more important to you, then none of that really maters.  Choose a race that’s fun to play.  You’re going to be stuck in that skin for a long time.  If you can’t stand looking at your reflection you aren’t going to have much fun.  <br />
<br />
The only regret I have with my kitty shaman is that I can’t get a clicky snare effect.  I soloed my way to 38 and that would have been really nice.  But would it have been worth play a troll for? Not for me.  So choose a persona you feel comfortable with and go out there and have fun.</div></div><hr />

Playing for over 4 years Ive been in almost every situations many many times and can honestly say being stunned is a rarity in itself. I think the shamans perception of the  'awesomeness' of ogres unstunablity, was carried over from the ogres warriors. Ogres warriors do benefit a great deal from this ability true, but do we really care if we miss a round of hate? ........nah hahah :)</div></div><hr />

ALL, not some, not half, but ALL my searches since the upgrade turn up nearly zero hits.  The exceptions are threads that are new and I already know they're there.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that some of the older shaman feel like they've already made all these great points over the years, but I can't find them.  So s'cuse the hell out of those of us that have played the game for years, but are new to being shaman.  Believe me, if the search worked I'd LOVE to be able to find things out immediately instead of waiting for someone to answer me AND have to sift through the pompous and yet naive statements from those that would rather be jerks.<br />
<br />
Seriously, such flames are total nonsense.  If you think someone is waisting YOUR precious time... READ ANOTHER THREAD!!!!<br />
<br />
Or perhaps that's to difficult as well?  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I love my Vah Shir shaman.  She is lots of fun to play, particularly since she has a mesmerizing tail.  Being a Vah Shir gives my character an extra bit of personality.  Hey, it ain't about the stats, it's about fun.<br />
<br />
And people:  relax.  There are only so many subjects to explore on shamanism in EQ.  The same questions are gonna be asked repeatedly.  If you don't want to cover the same ground, don't read the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Flip a coin, heads is Troll and tails is Vah Shir.  It it lands on edge, play a Froglok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I've got a froggy shaman, but if I had to do it again I'd go with troll because I duo with my warrior and it would be great to have a clicky snare.  As it is now, I can't risk some zones (mainly indoor) because of the risk of trains when mobs run.  (yeah, I can root, but that's not guaranteed to stick)<br />
<br />
Also, if you are in ldon and you don't have a snarer, the clicky snare will save the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I would seriously consider Ogredom as well, especially if you're into comparing which is &quot;better.&quot;  Someone already mentioned no frontal stun.  Another thing to think about is if you ever plan on joining an uber guild.  If not, a second advantage to being an Ogre is superior stats.  Doing a simple comparison with every other race, the Ogre outshines everyone else in total major stats and only lacks seriously in charisma, and I think since charisma is really a &quot;cheap&quot; attribute (i.e. very easy to get 25 cha from opal steins, 9 cha from simple jewelry, etc-- harder to raise other stuff), Ogre wins overall statwise--  again, this will only matter if you're never ever going to be in an uber guild.<br />
<br />
Besides, in terms of looks, the best look is probably wood elf shaman.  Plus, if you're evil, you can get a froglok stone which gives you 1 charge of illusion: guktan anyway, which you can return to neriak to recharge.<br />
<br />
It is great being kos, because then you won't feel icky after slaughtering highpass keep bards, nobles, and guards, butcherblock dwarves, katta guards/wolves, etc.  Or you could go the other way around and try to be loved by everybody.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, one other thing-- lots of people seem to underestimate the slam ability that trolls, ogres, and barbarians get.  It's sooo nice.  It's fun in LDoN to run behind someone and whackem behind the head when they're about to CH.  Seeing that interrupted message is addicting.  Sure, you don't connect too often at all, but when you do, and you manage to interrupt them (sometimes you land and don't interrupt anyway), you appreciate that you have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Troll. Because we are the rarest of the Shaman and rare is cooler than all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">All I can add is this:<br />
<br />
I've played A froggie shammy and I've played an ogre shammy. They both have +'s and -'s.  You've seen many of them listed here. <br />
<br />
Ogre unstun from front is nice.  Froggies have higher innate wisdom and versatile.<br />
<br />
Froggies have a cool home. Trolls have none. Ogre city is nuts, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Froggie quests are better than all, IMHO. The shield upgrades, the armor, the necklaces, and amulets, etc. etc just rule. I don't think any of the other races can touch it. I know Ogre can't.<br />
<br />
Ogres are better tanks and therefore better soloers. Froggies are not gonna melee too much. Even in OT at 43 I had a hard time soloing when I had to step in for dogdog. But then, I've never bene much of a soloer. That's why I made an alt Necro . :)<br />
<br />
Froggies look cool. And their /commands are hysterical. /cheer is great but the /bow is just so flamboyant, it's great.<br />
<br />
Kittys get Safefall. Lizzies get forage. Ogres are untunnable from front. Trolls are homeless. Froggies have no XP penalty.<br />
<br />
But in the end, you have to be what you WANT to be like several have already said.  Try one and if you don't like it, switch. It's a GAME. you can do that. <br />
<br />
In the end, the only thng that matters is that you are a shaman and therefor, you are gonna be great anyway. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Suprised nobody has mentioned how useful racial Sneak is (Vah Shir).  It makes questing and general NPC dealing so much easier.  Bad faction with an NPC?  Get behind him and Sneak, instant Indifferent faction.<br />
<br />
Of course, Vah Shir look like they have something stuck up their bums when they're running. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">While I am a barbarian and love being a barbarian shaman...I use frog and dark elf potions alot. I wish I had LoY when I first started, or I'd be a frog shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I've often reqretted where I threw my extra points when I created my shaman, but I never regretted the choice of troll as a race.<br />
<br />
After 4+ years of EQ, my shaman is finally lvl 64 with the Spear of Fate in hand.  It's been a looooong hard journey.  With much thanks to many friends and my guild its been enjoyable.  I might hit 65 by Christmas!<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a race that levels quickly, don't choose troll.<br />
If you want to be accepted in the majority of cites, don't choose troll.<br />
If the phrase, &quot;You've ruined your own lands, I'll not let you ruin mine!&quot;, offends you, don't choose troll.<br />
If you want a race with a real starting city, don't choose troll (stinkin frogs, that one still irks me).<br />
If you want a race with good quests and racial armor, don't choose troll.<br />
If you want the easy route, don't choose troll.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I vote Vah Shir, not only do they look cool, but everyone will think you're a Beastlord.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">If you're looking for races with abilities that will last through the entire life of the character, then just about the only choice you have are Ogres and Vah Shir.  ;)<br />
<br />
Ogre immunity to stun does have its uses, though it is severely overhyped.  Being bashed doesn't instantly interrupt your spell when you've got a channeling skill of 200+ unless it stuns, and at level 65, I rarely get stunned when I'm bashed.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir, on the other hand, have 2 racial abilities which are used for your entire career:  Safe Fall and Sneak.<br />
<br />
Safe Fall may not seem like much, but when you're running with SoW, at least a Vah Shir doesn't take chintz damage every time he/she steps over a rock.  It saves the aggravation of seeing the damage spam the window all the time.<br />
<br />
But Sneak...ah, Sneak.  Sneak ensures that a Vah Shir can buy and sell absolutely anywhere he goes.  Even at 65, there are merchants/races that won't sell to me, but Sneak-o-Sell fixes that.  And at lower level, Sneak actually helps when you're trying to get past mobs without aggro.<br />
<br />
Think the ability to buy and sell anywhere isn't worth much?  Then go talk to a Troll or Iksar.<br />
<br />
Both of these racial abilities will be used your entire life.  The usefulness of just about every other race's racial abilities fade over time, even regen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Frontal stun interrupts account for about MAYBE 5% of all interrupts in game. MOst of the time when u DO get interrupted it's because u:<br />
<br />
1. Moved too much<br />
2. Are getting beat on.<br />
<br />
<br />
That 5% of the tiem is when i am castign and i get smacked and stunned and interrupted. Big deal.<br />
<br />
No.  The big benefit of ogre &quot;stun immunity&quot; is not immunity from the &quot;you have been stunned&quot; message.  It is the fact that bashes do not force an immediate channelling roll for ogres, and they do for all other races.  A very sizeable % of my interrupts are immediate interrupts from bashes, so ogres have a nice ability.</div></div><hr />
