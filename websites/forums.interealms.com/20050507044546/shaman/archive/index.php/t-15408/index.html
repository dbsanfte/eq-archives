Get me killed?<br />
<br />
Hardly. Don't you know that every drink gives you instant mana! ;)<br />
<br />
Hell, even my Enchanters drink.<br />
<br />
Oh and as for RL, well I've been sober for about 3-4 months now. I never once played EQ sober before that. I couldn't stand it, too damn slow of a game. I figured the downtime was put in there for drinking brew, snorting lines, popping pills, and smoking herbs. Depending on your habit, of which all of the above was mine.<br />
<br />
Once I figured out that I love leveling, the absurd slowness of this game doesn't bother me so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, but I can stop whenever I want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't drink. Got alcohol poisoning in my early 20's. Turned me off to the stuff forever.<br />
<br />
However...Lortab 10. Now THERE'S a mellow gaming session. :) I'm one of the few people I know that actually look forward to visits to the Dentist. ROFL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">in a slightly related story about in-game drunkness in EQ...<br />
<br />
One time a fear raid I was participating in was taking a very long time to start, so I had a mage summon me some alcohol and I started chugging it down and acting wierd becuase... well... there wasn't much else to do. almost immediately after that not only were we told that the raid was about to start, but that I was in one of the two breaking groups - and the only shaman in those two breaking groups. I didn't want to say anything and look like a moron so I just zoned in. Boy was that a mistake. I could barely walk in a straight line towards west wall, and after just a few casts I found myself out of mana because of the huge wisdom penalties.<br />
<br />
We lived but it was still a pretty funny experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Obviously, all of us shaman must have been drinking too much when we opted to take on this class.<br />
<br />
What other class tanks every mob from landing slows while bearing chain armor..<br />
<br />
What other class strives and looks forward to getting a button that gobbles up 1900+hp at will... and wish the refresh period was lower!<br />
<br />
What other class derives the sick role reversal enjoyment poisoning spiders and snake mobs..<br />
<br />
What other class looks at spending 100-120K for our most basic level 60 spells..<br />
<br />
What other class looks at necros as pretty okay people and fun to team up with..<br />
<br />
.. the list goes on and on, but you start to get the idea :)</div></div><hr />
