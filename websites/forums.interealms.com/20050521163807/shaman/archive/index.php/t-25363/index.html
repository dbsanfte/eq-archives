<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm scratching my head trying to figure out what the difference is between these two spells. <br />
<br />
They come about a level apart. <br />
<br />
Howling Haze appears to be a direct replacement for Wailing Haze - a single target slow.<br />
<br />
Grim Lethargy appears to be a group slow.<br />
<br />
So far so good. In EQ1, the group slow was worse than the single target slow, so it was rarely used.<br />
<br />
Except that Howling Haze does not have a replacement. The level 30 spell is it, all the way up to level 50. So Howling Haze is the BEST single target slow we get.<br />
<br />
But Grim Lethargy gets an upgrade in the 40's. I forget what it's called, but the point is - is Grim Lethargy equal to Howling Haze in terms of slowing capability, or is the replacement as good as Howling Haze?<br />
<br />
Which do the upper level shamans use? Howling Haze or Grim Lethargy or the 40's Lethargy? Which is the most slowest slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Mourning Soul is intended to be our &quot;end game&quot; Slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dreadful Lethargy is still higher in levels than Mourning Soul. And I'm not sure I want a slow that prevents me from attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, but it's group Slow.  The fact that there are drawbacks to using Mourning Soul is a dead giveaway to me at least that this is the &quot;end game&quot; Slow.<br />
<br />
Note that the spell description states that you are immobilized while Mourning Soul runs . . . it doesn't say you are prevented from doing other things.  Frankly, at the level you get Mourning Soul, your melee is worse than meaningless.<br />
<br />
No one is forcing you to cast the spell, but given the published lineup of spells, I'd put a significant amount of money on Mourning Soul being our end game Slow, and quite likely the model for any expansion upgrades to Slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Without some concrete numbers and anecdotal evidence, it's hard to really say. However, I take &quot;immobilized&quot; to mean that you are rooted in place, not that you can't melee (going by EQ1 terminology). So, if MS has a much higher slow percentage than GL and HH, I wouldn't mind being rooted in place while my slow ran it's course (for the most part). That said, if it has an exceedingly long duration, I would probably opt for using normal slows on a day to day basis and save the good stuff for raid encounters.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea, that's my interpretation as well.  MS would have to be a very significant Slow to offset the disadvantages of being rooted.<br />
<br />
Still, I don't see being rooted as such a huge disadvantage in most situations.  Sure, if someone gets too far away I can't move closer to save them, but that doesn't bother me.  (So, if you are someone in need of healing in my group, keep that in mind.  ;)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thinking more of a soloing situation.<br />
<br />
Currently I pull with slow, ho, dot, dot, ho completes for damage strike, melee, dots wear off, ho, dot dot, ho compeltes for damage, melee....<br />
<br />
Now usually when I pull I'm running out to get something, then dragging it back to camp where it's safer - no roaming adds. if I pull and then am rooted, it means that it's not very good for me to pull with... and I prefer to have things slowed onthe way to camp for my own safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And there's also the issue if camp is in a not so safe spot, and a mob wanders up while you've got the slow on... you can't shift slightly to prevent the add. Some camps there just isn't a truely &quot;safe&quot; spot, just a spot where adds are less likely... if the slow is a minute, it would stink to see certain doom approaching in the form of a nasty add... and your groupmates yelling at you to move...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In the case of pulling, simply pull with a lesser Slow and lay on the good stuff after you get where you want to go.<br />
<br />
In the case of an impending add, simply cancel the spell.  (Right click in Maintained spell window, cancel).<br />
<br />
I don't want to go back to the days of Turgurs.  Current implimentation of Slow seems fine.  The fact that the current implimentation has made us legitimate healers doesn't hurt either.</div></div><hr />
