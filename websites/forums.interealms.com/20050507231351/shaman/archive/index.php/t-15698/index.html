<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Repiv Dashammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a Broke shaman looking for ways to make cash. i was told that the dragons in ww are soloable by us. anyone know a easy way to do this?<br />
Im lvl 65 dont have torpor or Quis(like i said im poor)i have the 3k 64 di spell and bane but not thats about it..any ideas? is this even possible for me? ill check back later thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They're light blue, of course they're soloable =)  A level 51 solo'd Yeldema at one point, though I doubt one of the AE'ing nest dragons would be doable at that point.  Level 58 KM is all you really need, though it's 100x easier with torpor or Q.  Event stoicism might keep you up against them.<br />
<br />
Keep to the nests, most of the wanderers will beat you silly before you even know what's happening.  Also keep an eye out for adds.  Avoiding them is far harder than killing the actual dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah it can be done without torp/Q ( not by me personally ) but we've seen logs posted here. Gunna be alot harder, and the key  to soloing dragons in WW are:<br />
<br />
#1.Getting them single and keeping them single<br />
#2. Keeping an instaclick up/resisting the ae's<br />
#3. not getting screwed by the random dispell<br />
#4. Mana management<br />
<br />
Last time I went and solo'd one it was so easy it was silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im sure thats possible.  However the effort required on a few of those dragons makes it not as proffitable per time spent.<br />
<br />
I would go to Old Sebilis.  At 65 your innate resistances will be enough to resist about 70 % of the spells there, for the other 30% use your own resist spells.  Mobs there have low HP and the 61 pet can easily take them out with little difficulty.  <br />
<br />
I know at 60 I can clear about 2K an hour if I can get a good camp.  If Im wandering around and killing what I can find my haul drops to around 1K an hour, which is still nice cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeldema's easy because he doesn't cast, he's just a melee mob. Some of the low-end casting dragons can be soloed, if you work to counter the AE dispell. Don't see how you'd make much money from them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WW dragons are quite good cash if you get the right drops, Greater \ Great dragon heads can be turned in in kael for barbed boots \ shoulders, both of which still go for 4k or so on veeshan.  If you get MATCHLESS or PRICELESS mantle or legs, you can get quite a bit from them too.  Mantle is usually like 15k for matchless 10k for priceless, and legs like 12k or so for matchless 8k or so for pricless.  WW dragons used to be insane cash, I remember pulling in over 40k in a day before out there, but that was early Luclin so it isnt nearly as lucrative now.</div></div><hr />

You can kill nearly any dragon in WW, but like some others have said, you probably won't make much money except for mantles and the bracers.  Most of it doesn't seem to sell well other than a few certain pieces, on Cazic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You should be able to solo any of the nest dragons in WW without difficulty. I soloed all of them at 60, well before pop even came out, and they were easy then.  They should be a complete joke now.<br />
<br />
I also soloed a few of the canyon dragons at 60, and it was very tough due to their high resists.  At 65, though, they are easy as well.<br />
<br />
Just pull with malo, slow, dot, and heal yourself.  Very easy, but it might take you a few tries to get the hang of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I go to WW and trio with a bard a ranger friend.  The dragons are pretty much cake nowadays.  I have done a couple of em solo as well, not for the cash so much, but just to say that I did it.</div></div><hr />
