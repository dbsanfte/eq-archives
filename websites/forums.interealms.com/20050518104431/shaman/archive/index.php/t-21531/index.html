The good:<br />
<br />
new DoTs, new nukes, all that crap. new canni (possibly big chunks/recast like the ancient?) and a new pet<br />
<br />
the bad: new stat buffs, new disease slow. whoopee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let me reiterate, they are taking ..seeminglky most our spells on test, = good thing, if they are testing our spells, it may end up better? or worse? we know nothing still..  I think you should be actually gratful you see these on test.  It means they are at least looking at shaman spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have you learned nothing from when the last 3 expansions were released? look at the stuff on there. Single target str/dex/agi? a str/dex combo buff! awesome! a new Disease DoT! And a new disease slow... duo seru attempt incoming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ohh, I see now...not a Lucy expert, sorry.  Now that we are on the same page, it looks about normal to me.  Adding new stat buffs would hopefully give us the impression that the cap will be raised tho.  A new pet is OK too I guess...they aren't worth much in GoD except an extra 20 DPS or so depending on how much mana you want to waste.  I guess we can pretty much expect the 61-65 spells from PoP, just better versions from 66-70.<br />

\BTW this does not mean a new pet,k its just another thing they are testing with our previous spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To me, it looks like we'll be in for a truckload fo spells with OoW.  Kind of the Mr. Obvious withthat one but.. hey.<br />
<br />
It's all just copies of spells for now sothat they have the general idea of spells we'll be getting, although no names, and such. they are just placeholders for what we may get later.  Although, seeing a possible PR nuke would be nice. ANywho, nothing to get worked up on yet. IMO,  I prolly wont worry about any of it til much closer to release time. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Those are just placeholders for the new spells. If you remember when they first put the GoD placeholders on test, many of those spells changed a lot and some became completely different spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Look like they have put our PoP spell ,and after they will uograde them .

<br />
A rote 10% upgrade across the board on a few spell lines. <br />
<br />
Just like pretty much all the expansions. Ooo maybe we might get 15% Or in some cases the almost game breaking 5% differance.<br />
<br />
On one of the things that all casters pretty much require to keep playing.<br />
<br />
Thier bread and butter if you will. The spell lines. <br />
<br />
SoE has thier head stuck so far up thier ass it is pathetic. They are releasing expansion after expansion to thier flagship product and turning that product into a mismanaged farce of what it was.<br />
<br />
If I was the developer for spells here is what I would give you. <br />
<br />
Dear Shaman,<br />
<br />
I realise that over the years the game has changed a great deal. When you made your shaman you were the combat priest. The walking fortress. The healer for your nations. So this is what I would propose. Our balancing team has decided that after many months of avoiding and or ducking the problem that I would be allowed to revamp the shaman class. So here is my proposal to all of you.<br />
<br />
1st. Shaman across the board will gain the ability bash. The skill cap will run along the same lines as your weapon skills. However the weapon skillls will also be looked at to take into account they have not changed in caps since level 40 and we have an additinal 30 levels after that don't you know. So all weapon skills will be able to be raised to new levels as well. The new cap for shaman is 250 for all weapon skills that caps out at level 70. There will be a list of AA's as well that are reasonably cost that will allow you to tailor weapon use abilitys as you see fit. The new hard cap for weapon skills is 510 for meeles. And while they (And you)may not be able to reach that at this time we figured it would be nice to know as more details come to light.<br />
<br />
2nd. Statistic caps are also being raised to 510. The caps are being removed as well for diminishing returns  on effects from high statistics. There will be a cap from item statistics however of 310. The planer power AA's and such will allow people to exceed that cap as it did for total stat caps. So burning aa's will let you get closer but not all the way. To get your statistics maxxed at any one time. Please take advantage of your newly revamped Statistic buffs.  Meeles please note, make friends with shaman fast. <br />
<br />
3rd. The singular advantage of clerics as being the numero uno healers, noone else may apply is being lessened. To this extent. Shaman (And thier fellow priests Druids) are being given Resurection abilitys. For Shaman this is a spirit walk ability. You can call back dead heros spirits and let them live again. But true resurection is not something you are able to do. For maximum xp gain please have a cleric res the remains of the body withen the full three hour time period. But the effect of the spirit walk will allow dead teammates to rejoin you. While using a sutible regent for shaman Like rum, and dead chicken carcass and possibly a voodo doll or such. (As in Res ability zero percent xp res.) when body is looted a remains graphic is placed there as a Res placeholder (Much like a corpse but with no loot and such, maybe intresting graphic with the Shamans god of choices mark upon the remains) Druids have an animal reincarnation effect where an animal must die to let the hero live again. (as in Some animal part as regent)<br />
<br />
3a. The heal advantage of clerics is being changed from 100 66 47 (Or whatever it is) to 100. 95 90. For direct blast heals. Large heals will be scaled as follows. 100 (C heal) 75 (Druid heal) 50 (shaman heal) This will give the shaman a 3500 hp 10 second heal Grats. The other healing abilitys will be balanced as follows. Shaman will have the best single target heal over time. While the number may not be as great as a clerics. the efficancy and duration will exceed the clerics. Shaman are primarily over time players. So a new primary heal over time for shaman will be as follows. Heyokahs blessing. Range 150. 500 hps a tick healed. 8 tick duration base Affected by Healing AA (Including Crits) There will be more spells in the expansion that I do not wish to talk about at this time that deal with healing and situational effects. But know this. Spells will be brought into line so a shaman can heal as well as a cleric in certain current combats. Clerics are being changed somewhat to make them viable and fun to play without needing to be the numero uno mugwhump of healing. <br />
<br />
4. Damage. Fights are so much faster now. We know this. However some fights will be luclin in length. Some will be old world in length. some will be GoD in length. Find what you are good at. And enjoy. The cookie cutter has been smashed and made into the developers crappy idea nerf bat. (Yes we actually made one. And beat the developers when they come up with crappy ideas.  hold on.. Bad idea sense tingling.. Whack!)<br />
Sorry where was I... Oh yes. damage.  Well. Shaman are DoTers. (Hold the groans) Not nukers. So we are giving you a new line of spells. Actually several new lines. First and formost. The mother of all dot spells. Mana consumption is as follows. With the new line. Mana is removed only when the dot Tick is registered. So if It hits for one tick it costs you that one tick of mana. Not the whole thing up front. This fixes mana expendatures. Damage will be appropriate. Like say 900 a tick. for 5 ticks. then you would need to recast the Poisen dot. Since this is a new line this will have the crit chance checked by both DD crits and Dot crits. The bane line will be changed into a lower resistance Dot. Much like the druid line of Stinging swarm spells. The disease line will be slightly less damage but will incorperate Cripple type effects. At no additional Aggro. Also Rains and DD will be given upgrades. Look for them. And the 22% hard coded resist rate has been removed for rain spells. (Yes it was stupid. Forgive us, &quot;Someone get the bat&quot;)<br />
<br />
More will follow I ahve to get to work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Before everyone freaks out, keep in mind they just made a thread asking what we want as shaman and a AA list for OoW. If you havent posted in either thread i suggest you do before you cry chicken little. Also remember this is the first entry which i think we would have learned has nothing to do with the final spells sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nothing to see here, move along. These spells (if they even become spells) are not finished. They're going to change, some might be deleted, new ones might be created ... it is the same with every expansion. I daresay we will have quite a few new spells to play with when OOW comes out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">New disease slow is awesome (if they implement it).  Grummus is such an awesome spell, and I was hoping they made nihil disease...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm assuming these are indeed placeholders since they're just copy/paste of our existing spells. It makes sense for them to upgrade the spell lines across the board if they're raising the level cap. Quite simply, this is the logical continuation of our spells post 65. Any class changes or balance issues will likely be considered seperately. <br />
<br />
I'll be curious to see how they shape up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just make sure you keep them bookmarked with the specific page of each spell.  As teh names change around and they try to hide them they'll be difficult to find again with search, but if you have a bookmark to the specific spell entry number, you can always return to it easily.</div></div><hr />
