<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people will tell you no, but then again most people are too lazy to make their own groups and just want to sit at a zone in and shout LFG.  I think its worth it, but you'll most likely have to take some initiative to set up your own groups.  There are some really good items you could use that come from the non-raid zones that it only takes a group to get.  With some time you could get flagged eventually for Kod-Taz where you could pick up some Elemental quality items.   But initially you could get some needed upgrades off the various named in the non-flag zones.  With the up coming increase to level 70, its only going to make these areas that much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take a moment and read this page (http://home.cwru.edu/~srp5/Gate_Tiers.htm). That's the guide I used, and I was flagged for Kod'Taz, Ikkinz and Yxxta earlier this morning. <br />
<br />
Some advice:<br />
1. Get yourself geared in augged LDON/bazaar gear if you do not have access to elemental armor.<br />
<br />
2. Max your healing AA's (HA, HG, AHA, AHG). Also be sure you have buff extension AA's ... sewer trials and Vxed/Tipt runs can make for a LONG night, and often there isn't time to constantly rebuff. I started doing sewer trials and Vxed/Tipt runs at around 150-175 AA. LR5 helps.<br />
<br />
3. I'm still leery of pickup GOD groups, but that could just be my server ... I will urge you to take along a group of people who have worked together before and with whom you play consistently. GOD isn't really a place to go experimenting with new folks unless you're sure they're reliable. The slightest mistake will kill you and wipe your group.<br />
<br />
4. If you are not at the top of your game or close to it that night, stay away from GOD. CR's are a pain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best advice I can give is go with people you have grouped with before and are comfortable with, and have fun.<br />
<br />
Dont group with people who are skittish about risk, they will just make your experience there miserable.<br />
<br />
Make sure that you carry an ample supply of invis potions with you even if you can cast invis. They are insta cast, and if cast when your current invis starts blinking you dont break invis, which is very important if you happen to be traveling through populated areas. I think I have died only once in GoD from invis dropping, and that was because I was too busy chatting to pay attention.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye open for see invis mobs. Once you become familiar with the zones you are playing in you will know which these are and where they are found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely on the healing AAs.  Also there's a couple things you need to know. Certain mob types have special abilities:<br />
<br />
Noc (Purple guys with funky teeth): procs Chaos Claws, RAMPAGES. hits harder than other mobs in the area by 10% or so.<br />
<br />
Kyv (Archers): procs Chaos Claws, has VERY high ATK. They usually see invis, and run really fast. In some areas they are unrootable.<br />
<br />
Turepta (Spiky Turtles): Nothing too special really. High Defense.<br />
<br />
Stonemite: Usually immune to root. Procs a long lasting DoT spell which you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flying&quot; Flies: Immune to root.<br />
<br />
&quot;Walking&quot; Flies: nothing special really.<br />
<br />
Goos: Nothing special.<br />
<br />
Mastruq: Around 30%, they do this &quot;Dark Aura&quot; thing which is a self melee rune and absorbs 90% of all incoming melee damage. having someone to nuke these guys at the end is handy. Usually Warriors or Shamans, though they can be clerics too.<br />
<br />
Ikaav (Snake things): These have an innate rune which absorbs 50% of all melee and nuke damage. It's annullable. A lot of people forget this for the DD in the first ikkinz trial. Annul Snakes! they also summon a single Ukun pet thing when you engage them, which will always have 50% slow mitigation, and hit for usually 500ish. If you keep the pet mezzed it just depops when the owner dies. Sometimes they procs a reflective aura which reflects nukes back at the caster. can be Wizard, Magician, Enchanter. Chanters will cast Anya's Quickening on anything in range :p<br />
<br />
Ixt (Goat Women): Summons 2 pets when engaged, which will depop when mezzed. Procs a 200dd with a 2.0 sec stun on the tank.<br />
<br />
Ukun (Dog things): Usually see invis, especially in Vxed, Tipt, and KodTaz+. Procs Chaos Claws, also can go into a frenzy which I think is AE ramp + a DoT on everyone near it when they're low health.<br />
<br />
Ra'Tuk (Big tall dudes with axes): FLURRIES, procs Chaos Claws. Lots of HP. Enrages.<br />
<br />
Cragbeast (Yellow Lizard things): Procs a DD/Stun on the tank. has a large hit box.<br />
<br />
Pookas (Green winged dudes, in Vxed/Tipt only): Snarable, don't summon. Commonly charmed for nice DPS.<br />
<br />
Golems: Unslowable in Yxxta and sewers, slowable elsewhere. I think these have high defense. nothing really special otherwise. Can be Warrior or Shaman.<br />
<br />
Taelosian dudes (Ghost or otherwise): ghost ones are undead. Oftentimes are casters.<br />
<br />
Aneuk (Dudes with the chains and the mace and one eye): Casters more often than not, usually shaman or cleric.<br />
<br />
Hynid: in Vxed/Tipt they all see invis.<br />
<br />
That's about it. if anyone wants to correct anything be my guest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you not high level geared or ina  raiding guild i would suggest no, this is aim at high level raiding guild mainly. that being said you can obviously get some spells and gear if you can get groups for the expidition, but i would still advise no if not elemental equiped or in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ikaav pets (ukuns) ... ignore them. Mezz them and forget about them ... they will depop when the Ikaav dies. Focus your energy on annulling ASAP and getting them slowed. Keep them interrupted.<br />
<br />
As for what BaraCudar said ... no. GOD is aimed for the upper level player, that's for sure, but you certainly don't need to be in a high end raiding guild or elemental equipped to have fun. Check my Magelo ... I'm not elemental equipped, and I certainly wasn't anywhere near it when I started sewer runs and playing in Vxed/Tipt. You DO need nice LDON armor (some bazaar pieces are ok) in order to do it, however. I have not yet seen a shaman succeed in these zones without nicely augged LDON armor. Focus effects: IH4 is a must ... BA4 is nice to have.<br />

Ra'Tuk's enrage. I've lost more pets in KT that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>grismora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow i definatly appreciate all the helpfull comments that you guys have for me looks like i need to do a million more ldons  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ra'Tuk.. I commonly refer tothem as PPB's.  Thats Purple People Beaters.  Invariably, (i do have SCS3 mind you), I can be in a KT group, and have a tank with excellent aggro abilities, I bounce one Nihil slow on these guys,and I'm a bloodstain on the ground.  I'd have the same happen if nihil lands. And occasionally, they just peel off the tank at 15-30% and wail on me for kicks, I can slow it once and watch it be ebat on,and it still decides to beat onme at low health, never understood that.<br />
<br />
Generally, 3 out of 7 times, these guys beat me into a bloody pulp. Kyv occasionally do, but these guys are odd like this frommy experience. or perhaps they have something against Vah Shir.</div></div><hr />
