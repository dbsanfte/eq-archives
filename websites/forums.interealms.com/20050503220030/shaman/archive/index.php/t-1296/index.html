<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Graknit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well... I'm new to the board, so first off, hi everyone.  :)<br />
<br />
Next, I've recently stripped off a 51 and 47 melee, and a 30 Enchanter... sold their gear, started a Shaman/Druid pair.  Besides the fact that a big ol' troll and a lil' wood elf look kinda cute standing together keeling things, I figured the stacking DoTs would be nice as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, naturally, the Shaman is pretty well twinked out.  I got most of the items I wanted for him... Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, Iksar Regen BP (as Fungis are now 80k+ since the rumored drop rate nerf... /sigh), some other decent stuff.  Also got a pretty good trade on some JB Greaves.  Now, they're nice indeed... but I could get around 25k pp for them, and they're by far my most expensive item on either of the characters (Iksar BP is around 8k, GEBs are around 4-5k).  Was thinking about trading/selling them for a JBB.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I know I want a JBB when I hit 45 with the Shaman; the thing's simply insane.  So, how much do JBBs go for on your servers... how hard is the camp (never did Seb and only a little of Karnor's before)... would it be better to just keel HGs or Geonids for cash to buy a JBB and keep the pants... and where are JB Greaves in the hierarchy of Shaman pants?  Only moderate, or pretty high still?  Will probably keep the Greaves 'til the Shaman can use the bracer, kinda senseless to get it before then.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any replies in advance.  :)<br />
<br />
24 AC, +8 Str, +8 Dex, +8 Wis, +75 Mana are the stats.</div></div><hr />

Its always best to do a search on the top right corner before asking some questions as some of your questions have been answered already. :)<br />
<br />
Here a link to the JBB pricing threade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd keep the greaves.  It sounds like you'll be capable of scraping together the cash to buy a jbb when the time comes.  Those legs are some of the better ones that you'll be able to lay your hands on for quite a long while.  If you were going to sell part of your current gear to help fund a later jbb purchase, I'd consider the REIF.  Personally, I've always felt that the REIF lost most of it's usefullness once you start killing with a JBB - one poke with the spear every 8 seconds isn't contributing a lot to a fight even with its' occasional proc (barb spirit hammer with it's proc might be a different story, but my shm is a troll so I don't have any BSH experience). <br />
<br />
I don't know about your server's economy, but on Veeshan that spear will make for a good start on a jbb (prices range from 5k to 10k for the spear.  not sure of the current going rate on a jbb, but I paid 16k for mine in October of 2001).<br />
<br />
Oh, and one last thing - get rid of those dr00d booties ;-)<br />
