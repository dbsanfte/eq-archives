Only issues of which I'm aware are the UBI-Soft co-branded ones, for specific languages.  <br />
<br />
Currently, all the &quot;normal&quot; servers are based in the US, with Antonius Bayle being UK-based.  There might be a 2nd UK server, but this is the only one I can think of.<br />
<br />
PS.  Bristlebane has a very large and very active community of folks from the UK and Europe.<br />
<br />
Edit:  There are other euro-based servers that display on the login screen -- they are English-language servers, I believe.  I've never tried them.  I was under the impression the UBI-Soft ones were seperate from these.<br />
<br />
Anybody know for certain?</div></div><hr />
