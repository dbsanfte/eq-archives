<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally finished up the Coldain Military Wristguard quest after having the harness in my bank for 8 months and I was happily surprised.  <br />
<br />
With EA3 I am getting at least 2 more tics out of BoN and I can't tell how much more time out of Pox because test subjects keep dying before it finishes. :p  Gonna hafta try it out on something bigger I guess.<br />
<br />
The focus effect does not work with SoF, but I highly recommend going after this quest and I think the CMW is the easiest item to get with EA3.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just get one of those sky bracelets from special friends in NToV....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow! 2 ticks! Thats sweet. Thought they rounded the time down, which would mean 1 tick. But seems like it rounds up then. Thats 428 more damage from 1 bane! :)<br />
<br />
I better find the broodmother up soon!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is definitely 2 tics.  Had 7 trials with BoN regular and compared that to 7 trials modified by EA3 and there was a 2-2.5 tic difference everytime :)  The damage difference is very noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone have a link to a walkthrough of quest?</div></div><hr />

A few tips:<br />
 - Make a level 1 Ogre of Ralloz Zek for this quest. <br />
 - You can buy the Wolf Harness so yo can skip a few steps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just got my Obulus Death Shroud and tested it out. I Baned myself and calculated  the damage difference between normal bane and focus bane. PC damage modified to NPC damage gave 214 damage difference when taking regen into account. Thats the same as 1 tick. Ack, I had my hopes up for 2 more ticks :(<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Managed to write it wrong. Meant Coldain Military Wristguard and NOT ODS :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Obulus Death Shroud is mana preservation, not extended affliction... right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">correct. ODS should have no effecton damage of DoT.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know the drop rate of the harnesses, or the spawn rate of coldain war wolves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, ODS is a mana focus item ONLY, with no effect on DoTs.  There are only 3 or so EA3 items out there and I believe the rest are pretty high-end drops.<br />
<br />
Coldain war wolves will spawn pretty regularly if you are killing all the dorfs and wolves that wander around the river that leads to Thurg.  For some reason I have found the Coldain war wolves more often near to the wurm cave ent.  I am guessing you could get a wolf per hour or so if you flatten the spawn regularly.<br />
<br />
 Killing the drakkael bloodwolf, err whatever, will not really dent your Kael faction and is worth it if you happen to see the mob up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bleh, managed to write it wrong. I DID get Obulus death shroud today, but also got Coldain Military Wristguard. So it was the CMW that I tested with and yielded 1 more tick. Sorry about that :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">got a bone clasped girdle about 2 weeks ago ad must also rave of the goodness of extend affliction 3 =)<br />
a must have (ill prolly wear this belt to lvl 60, heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Will i lose a lot of faction with Coldain if i have to kill all the PH's to get the war wolf to spawn?  Im at max ally, i dont really care if i fall down to amiable but anything lower i want to avoid.<br />
<br />
<br />
One more thing, where is the wolf trainer in kael located? a loc would be great since im not familiar with Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah! Did the final turn in to Broodmother today. BIG Failure!  I made sure Korf the Dorf was up.  Turned in harness to BM with my lvl 1 troll. Logged on main, to find Korf had disapeared.  I went to BM and followed her until she stopped in front of the mines, and then she went back to her usual spot in the caves! Sent petition and an email but have no answer as of yet.  What went wrong?  It seems Korf despawned, as he is supposed to, but never respawned with the quest loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Walruss Touth: Not sure about this, but heard about BM attaching to other mobs than the dwarf as a pet, Korf might have been running off too early then?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ran a little experiment yesterday with regards to additional damage output from EA3 with BoN and found some interesting stuffs.  Was able to get my PR down to 5 and cast BoN on my self with and without the CMW several times.  I found that:<br />
<br />
1.  I never took more than 94 points of damage from initial hit.  Bane usually hits for 150 on opening strike.<br />
<br />
2.  Damage without CMW was pretty consistently near 1270.<br />
<br />
3.  Damage difference with CMW was varied with a low of 136 and a high of 322.  <br />
<br />
4.  Lower value differences in damage were more common than higher ones.<br />
<br />
Not sure if these inconsistencies are due to innate regen, my dial-up, or something in programming, but I was pretty surprised.  I also had a bear of a time landing BoN even with a PR of only 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">afaik dots are nerfed vs PC chars. 66% of total damage only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok i redid the quest and got my shiny bracer! What i did wrong was camp my shaman near Korf before the quest is triggered.  So basically i was deep inside the mine where Korf normally hangs out.  When i turned in stuff with lvl1 troll and relogged shaman, Korf had disapeared since he had moved outside the mine.  I was not aware that he did this the first time.  Second time i just camped right outside the mine and Korf showed up.</div></div><hr />
