<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about this the other day. The original point of slow mitigation was to allow content to be more finely tunable so they could make mobs slowable without making them gimped. There should be more choices in designing mob DPS than Full Slow, No Slow, or Grummus only.  This is fair enough, we've caved and accepted it.<br />
<br />
So why is there still content where mobs are outright immune to slows altogether? A &quot;Slightly&quot; slowable mob only sees a 16% reduction in DPS when slowed by a shaman. If you need to tune a mob's DPS to a certain point, why not simply lower the delay of the mob slightly and then add at least some capability for slow to do SOMETHING. That way a class who slows will have something to bring to the table. They use slow mitigation as an excuse to gimp the ability, then ignore the ability to implement it in the name of &quot;making content challenging&quot;.<br />
<br />
What do you call a rogue without backstab? a ranger who can't cast. Imagine if content mitigated  backstab so it was a glorified &quot;kick&quot; in some areas. Some mobs were outright immune to it. This only affects rogues, because they are the only class reliant on this ability to be desirable or useful. You look at the &quot;active&quot; skills melee classes receive that are similar, manually triggered boosts to DPS (I guess you could consider Flying Kicks, Ranger nukes, Sk spears and Bst nukes with thier 30 second recasts along this line?), and all those classes bring other utility to the table besides it for which they are desirable.<br />
<br />
Case and point, Look at the 1 groupable ikkinz trials. You have the named which hit for 2200 and are slow immune. I fail to see the point of this, other than to further punish people who strive for any form of group diversity. I'm all for making content fun and challenging, but I still fail to see why the dynamic of removing slows entirely from the picture does anything other than completely ruin the benefit we bring to any sort of group. If it was at least slightly slowable, I could toss a nihil on it at the start of the fight in hope that maybe, just maybe the 15% slow it would provide would somewhat lessen the humungous gap in the ability to crank out hp/sec we're stuck with.<br />
<br />
Even for raid content, the elimination of slow is simply a lame idea. in time, all the gods (save quarm) are immune. Granted, the CCable mobs are slowable, but I fail to see why removing a dynamic of the fight makes anything more fun? I'd like to know I'm there and able to make a difference in the fight other than being relegated to /rt cures.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the vxed/tipt/ikkinz example, Two clerics, or a cleric and a druid with NO SLOWS should NOT be more suited for content than a shaman and a cleric. End of ****ing story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One thing I really wanna know is if there will ever be another disease only slowable mob (And if so, will they make it mitigate mostly? :P).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good thoughts there Grizlor, but they're wasted here - meaning that we, the players, can't do a jack to the game mechanics and SOE DEV's don't really read these forums, we're a dead weight as a class for them.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, because, in order to present the same degree of difficulty if they were fully slowable, they would need to hit for 8800.

If they hit for less they would become considerably easier once slowed, and if they hit for anything over 4000 they would have a high probability of 1 rounding any tank they faced on engagement.

After arguing with Tugela on the Sony sight about whether or not we should even be capable of main healing, I find this? Ok, you don't think we should be healers, and you're on board with turning slow off-so what was it again you wanted us to do?<br />

<br />
Ah it is the warrior with the shaman twink again who comes to tell us (who play a shaman as main) that we should not whine.<br />
<br />
In case you missed it twink , Grizlor was talking about mobs being slowable a little bit instead of being imune. And I have to agree with him that there is no reason at all to flag mobs slow imune at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agree Grizlor,<br />
<br />
marginalizing anyone's contribution to a group, where only 6 spots are available, is just hurting the game overall. Every class should have the same chance to contribute in a group in a given zone.<br />
<br />
Or when you really 'must' have such encounters, create other encounters in the same content, that favor those classes to balance disadvantage and advantage out. From the descriptions posted so far, i seem to miss the GoD encounters, that favor shaman in a group... <br />
<br />
On raids i have a slightly different view. So what, if some encounters on raid level are slow immune or mitigate heavily? Some encounters need crowd control, on others chanters are basically useless and struggle for a raid role. Same goes for content, that favors melee strategies or burning down the mob with casters. Some need massive healing, some would work with 2 druids ;).<br />
<br />
Sure i would like more chances to contribute in a raid. But as long as i can find any role in a raid (be it slowing, buffing, patch healing, curing or a bit dps) and don't sit around completely useless, i am OK. I am no hardcore raider though, so things may differ there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman's utility in GoD group ???<br />
<br />
Mostly none... <br />
The mobs die so fast that slow land way too late or, when resisted, you don't have time to recast it.<br />
Dots ? no time<br />
DD ? no time or just one ice nuke or 2 poison nukes (yeah... I made 1k dam on the mob...)<br />
Heal ? with the mobs who hits for double/triple 1k-1k5+ ? Just barely a patch healer...<br />
<br />
Shaman's utility in GoD raid ???<br />
<br />
Mostly none...<br />
The trash mobs dies so fast, I wonder if it's even useful to cast slow ;)<br />
The boss mobs ??? They all mitigate mostly or are immune to slow...<br />
Dots ? We have the time to land them on the bosses (forget the trash)... but no way to control our aggro like necros ;), so we dots a lot and die or dot only a bit and that's all...<br />
DD ? forget the trash... boss ? long casting 1k- DD or medium casting 0.6k DD... anyway a lot of mana and time for a marginal dps...<br />
Heal ? on the trash, heal who :D ??? on the bosses... barely a patch healer, but nothing more...<br />
<br />
You want to be useful ? to bring something to your group or raid ? <br />
Forget LDoN and GoD, play on PoP and previous expension...<br />
<br />
GoD is a funny expension (I really mean it :D) but the worse for us (with LDoN).<br />
<br />
I feel more useful with a group of low 50 in Disco 1 in Seb than in GoD honnestly  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Correction, Gegen, lowering the dependancy on shaman would be making mobs with tissue paper HP who hit for relatively low damage.<br />
<br />
Making moderately massive mobs that anally rape tanks for 8k on a good round creates a NEED for shaman in there slowing... But hey, your slow is only 16% effective? It's not April 1 yet...<br />
<br />
So, tell me, what do druids and necros bring to the table in the realm of 2k-a-swing-with-600-DD-proc+DoT mobs with no shaman in the group? Spot healing? Pffft. Oh, oh, Zefeers? A pet to eat some rampage (Properly treated, by the way, BooBoo can be quite a little monster. Like a tribble with a scalpel)<br />

The new Holy Trinity, by the way, is Warrior + Cleric + Cleric. My good ol' &quot;Unholy Trinity&quot; of Shaman + SK + Rogue / Mage just doesn't work in modern content, and that makes me a saaaaad panda</div></div><hr />

We dragged my 46 cleric (to replace my shaman so my friends and I can continue to progress) through the PoJ exe trials last night- only other healer in group was 65 shaman.

Ok maybe yur correct, theyre lowering the needs of certian classes and allowing necro's/druids chance at spots.. <br />
if thats the case, cas us shaman and our chanter kin have the same ability to solo as necro's and druids have? i remember asking one or 2 druids to join a group, their reply was 'no thanks i can solo fine' <br />
and if we cant be given the ability to solo as well as druids and necros, can we have different abilities then?? cos as far as i see we've remained unchanged  for way to many expantions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Answer to your question:<br />
<br />
Because Slow mitigation was not introduced to be able to balance content better, but to outright nerf an ability that was deemed to powerful. <br />
The ability was so powerful that every group had to have one of the 4 slowing classes in order to be effictive or efficient(5 if undead). <br />
In order to remove the dependancy Slow was nerfed so that it wasn't a required function anymore. SoE forgot 2 important things when they did that however:<br />
<br />
1) 4(5 respectively) classes out of 16(is it 16?) can slow. Is it really that bad to have to invite 1 of them to your group, when there are areas like healing, tanking and crowd control(either in form of pulling or handling adds) that can only be covered by 3, 2 and sometimes just 1 class?<br />
2) There is a class called Shaman that the ****tards from SoE designed and balanced around this very ability for many expansions<br />
<br />
Great ****ing job, SoE developers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Exactly - what's the point to mob slow mitigation if slow immune mobs are still being used as well.

<br />
You may be right but it hurts Shaman more then any other class. If they are going to do this they need to give shaman something else to do. As it stands now we are not worth much in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">While I do not agree with the cross class comparrisons (mitigating CHeals is a lame argument seeing that most clerics don't use CHeal in GoD anymore and thats what we're talking about here), I do think the immune flag is a pointless kick in the crotch.  Of course, there is the fact that an 18% slow isn't going to make or break an encounter on a mob that can crank out over 1200 DPS especially if you have to wait 5-10 seconds into the fight for the slow to land.  Still, I'm sure there are some, even in this community, who will argue that this is a good thing like Tugela despite all evidence to the contrary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You have the named which hit for 2200 and are slow immune. I fail to see the point of this, other than to further punish people who strive for any form of group diversity.<br />
<br />
If the mob wasn't slow immune, but was say 20% slowable from mitigation, then to have the same final dps after slowed the mob would need to do 2750 dmg unslowed in the same time frame as it does the 2200 when slowed.   If this mob is quading its now doing up to 11000 dmg in that time frame, instead of 8800, until its slowed.  The more mitigation you allow for the more a mob will do before its slowed.  At 40% its doing almost 15k dmg in that time frame pre-slow, meaning its going to kill any tank near instantly.<br />
<br />
 Slows make tuning a real pain which is why you see so many immune mobs now.  They have to tune an encounter, where a mob is slowable, to where its X difficulty once slowed, to not have mitigation or slow immune status it makes current day mobs that hit for 3k+ impossibly difficult until its slowed. They need to just give rid of the entire slow spell line and give us something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, because, in order to present the same degree of difficulty if they were fully slowable, they would need to hit for 8800.

Apart from you completely missing the context of Grizlor's post I recall you replying several times to a debate about how you can design encounters to put out DPS in ways other then straight DPS. In case you forgot it let me give you an example: <br />
Have a MOB hit for half but proc a DoT that brings it to the desired amount of DPS. Suddenly cripple becomes useful, the cleric cure+heal line becomes useful, cures for every class become useful and most importantly effects depending on straight melee DPS - like slow and the defensive discipline become less of a deciding factor.<br />
<br />
You could also add DD procs, AEs, damage shields and a lot of other things to MOBs, each of which can make the encounter as hard as you desire without just scaling up straight melee DPS.<br />
<br />
ACtually, I'm thinking they're trying to get rid of this &quot;need&quot; to fill slots with enchanters/shaman so that other classes (such as druids) have a chance to get in.<br />
That &quot;need&quot; has not been there since early PoP. You can replace a 65 shaman with a 65 cleric in any zone where slow is mitigated and be better of if you can find someone to haste your group.<br />
If the MOBs you fight in under a minute a druid will be better too.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not a shaman, I play one a bit for raids/grouping as it is my brother's character, but I play a (omg flame me cuz I know you will) druid main.  In case you didn't notice other classes had the problem of bringing NOTHING to groups not too long ago... i.e. druids<br />
If you mean &quot;before PoP&quot; I agree.<br />
<br />
and necros.<br />
Necromancers have been undervalued a long time but the last time I remember them being even close to useless was in ToV.<br />
<br />
Long ago paladins and shadowknights had the problem as well.  So, basically they're lowering the dependancy on filling certain slots in groups... good old warrior, cleric, and enchanter/shaman trinity comes to mind.<br />
Which is exactly why we are complaining - the problems are back, only now it is shaman who can not find a group based on something else then charity or false perceptions.<br />
<br />
While it still is a problem that you guys are basically becomming outdated, as it were, you're just running into the same problem other classes had a while ago.  Yes, they should think of another way to do it, but perhaps there will finally be a new use for shamans instead of just slow (as I've read many of you have wanted for a while).<br />
Which is why we are complaining, analyzing, brainstorming, polling and so on. Just because other classes have been undesirable in the past we should not be made obsolete now.<br />
<br />
You do not want your druid to be useless. We do not want our shaman to be useless. If I had my way noone would be useless. Is that too much to ask?<br />
<br />
So, tell me, what do druids and necros bring to the table in the realm of 2k-a-swing-with-600-DD-proc+DoT mobs with no shaman in the group?<br />
Druids: Charm, Snare, Harmony, Stun<br />
Necromancers: Damage, Mez, FD, Rez<br />
A lot of that depends on the zone though.<br />
<br />
The new Holy Trinity, by the way, is Warrior + Cleric + Cleric.<br />
I think I am going to have to steal that line. Sad but true.<br />
<br />
Edit: As to the original question: because 95% or more of the new MOBs are designed via templates and the three templates for named MOBs are:<br />
- slow immune, AE<br />
- slow immune, rampage<br />
- slightly slowable, procs a DD or flurries<br />
<br />
And I am not sure if I am actually wrong. There is some creative design with the raid encounters but the MOBs themselves seem to be copies of one another with the only new thing being the dog pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm still waiting for content where cleric/druid cheals are mitigated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your complete heal was partially effective.&quot;<br />
<br />
 I remember a certain proc (balance) that the guards in Emp room can do.  Makes it so that NO healing can do more than 300 hp, and cancels out heal over times.   We need that to be on 75% of the mobs next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">CH really is not much of an issue for this content.  Everyone has always known that EQ rested on a few major sins that prevented any worthwhile balancing or interesting content , the foremost of which were:<br />
<br />
-slows (nerfed to hell and back in PoP &amp; GoD)<br />
-complete heal (rendered mostly useless in GoD)<br />
-defensive disciplines (not just Defensive)(more broken than ever, but just wait for the next expansion and you'll be seeing &quot;this mob in immune to yoru riposte/defensive/etc discipline all over).<br />
<br />
As you see, they have been repenting for these sins, which is good.  Of course, they are doing it in their typically hamfisted way.  Unlike the clerics (who were compensated for their CH nerf by an expansion designed completely around their other heals) the slowing classes were pretty much not compensated at all for this massive reduction in their power.  <br />
<br />
We were hit especially hard because our other abilities are also less useful in the new content.  While we were once (anyone remember e-bolt on a dar ghoul knight?) a formidible DPS class because of our DoTs, they are largely useless because the disease ones take far too long, and the poison ones were mowed down in the crossfire as SoE nerfed the Tashxx line by jacking up the aggro on poison counters to an insane degree.  Our other ace in the hole, excellent mana regeneration, has also been flushed down the GoD toilet, which is all and only about mana pool.  Finally, we have healing, which is woefully inadequate.  Spear of Torment, Malos and Tnarg/Daluda's Mending is what we are now, and that is pretty much all we are now.<br />
<br />
Does anyone think that a class whose core spells are Spear of Torment, Malos, and Tnarg's/Daluda's Mending is adequately balanced?<br />
<br />
In short, Jaradis is pretty much right, unless they want to something tricky like starting mobs at a &quot;challenging&quot; DPS level and then increasing them to a &quot;unacceptably high risk of 1 rounding any tank&quot; DPS level about 25 or so seconds into the fight.  That would make the slows useful without the insta-one round problem.  That might be a little cheesy, though.  Otherwise, they should just consider the spells removed and balance all slow classes keeping in mind that slows have been effectively removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Everquest has degenerated into a game with 3 and only 3 roles.  Fast DPS, fast healing, and tanking.  There is no point for any other characters.  If your class in not at or near the top of any of those lists, your class sucks, because that is all there is to EQ anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the real issue for Shamans is not why did SOE decide to mitigate slow only (or make mobs immune to slow).  The real issue for shamans is that our strongest secondary trait, healing (as Uggok beat me to pointing out), has always been balanced around our ability to slow.  So shamans are in the position that we have both abilities cut out from underneath us at the same time.<br />
<br />
Imagine beast lords being told that there pets did not need the bonus that necros, mages, and BL just got, because they can slow, and the others can not.  It’s the double whammy that in unreasonable.  We get the worst heals of the priest class because we can slow.  Then in the upper content game, slow is commonly mitigated, or totally ineffective.  So now I’m a crappy healer and a poor slower.  And of course on top of that the areas where this is the case, the mobs also die so quickly that the shaman’s main damage output, dots, are also not effective.<br />
<br />
I am willing to go along with the idea that a 75% slow is uber, and may need to be “mitigated” to make it easier for Soe to design content.  But it seems unreasonable to me to constantly be told that my shaman needs to be balanced around his 75% slow, and then take slow away!  This is the thing that really makes shamans useless.  Not just that a lot of things mitigate slow, but that our class is balanced around us slowing 75%, and then the game takes the slow away. <br />
<br />
As Grizlor implied at the beginning of this thread, if there were areas where most of the mobs severely mitigated, say rogues backstab or druid nukes, to the point that they were near useless, the case would be just as unreasonable (although in the case of the druids they still heal fairly well, the rogue would be very gimped.)  A whole set of zones where the play style of a particular class is routinely undercut seems like poor design to me.  If there were a new expansion where commonly mobs had 360 vision, and did not have backs to back stab, rogues would certainly be right to complain.  And yet this is what SOE is putting out in the case of shamans.  <br />
<br />
If SOE admits that they do not have the imagination to design content around slow (although all I think they need to do is talk to veeshanMurtak for 10 minutes to come up with ideas), then SOE needs to just say fine, now every Mob either mitigates slow or is immune, oh and here is the updated line of heals for shamans since their heals were balanced around a 75% slow (or DD spells or a new cripple line etc).  I’ve never heard people claim that BL’s would be balanced with only 47% the dps of other melee classes because they has slow, or that enchanter’s mez should only work 47% of the time since they have slow.  I just do not buy that shamans would be unbalanced because of slow if we received close to druid level heals since it seems that slow mitigation is the way of things.<br />
<br />
Before anyone else says it, yes if high content shamans could heal close to druid lvl and still slow, they would be able to easily replace clerics in older content.  I have to wonder though why this argument seems to only be used against shamans.  I’ve been in bot groups where the time equipped cleric out tanked our group’s bazaar equipped SK, and even the SK grudgingly admitted we were better off if the cleric pulled and tanked.  I’ve been in PoN and PoD groups where elemental equipped rogues tanked. I’ve been replaced as slower by better-equipped BL’s (I mean literally given the boot from a hard Ldon group once a better equipped BL was found).  Most time equipped players can already replace bazaar equiped players in old content. If high-end shamans were to receive up grades to make up for mitigation, it would merely place them on par with other high-end classes already.<br />
<br />
I’d rather see SOE use some imagination and make mobs that had differing ways to be challenging besides outrageous melee DPS and mitigating slow, but I understand that that may require more work than SOE is willing to do.  I do wish that if SOE is going to design content where my shaman is no longer useful, they would let me take the exp and lvl of equipment I’ve accumulated for Tormac and make a BL with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some good points here, its basically Sony's way of saying that Slow was never intended to be so powerful, so they are going to go in the other direction and totally gimp the crap out of it. Every group wants slow when they are killing slowable high hp mobs, but the games evolving to the point where the true healers (druid and cleric) don't need mobs slowed to keep up with thier dps even when they are hitting for 2k a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">While I do not agree with the cross class comparrisons (mitigating CHeals is a lame argument seeing that most clerics don't use CHeal in GoD anymore and thats what we're talking about here), I do think the immune flag is a pointless kick in the crotch.  Of course, there is the fact that an 18% slow isn't going to make or break an encounter on a mob that can crank out over 1200 DPS especially if you have to wait 5-10 seconds into the fight for the slow to land.  Still, I'm sure there are some, even in this community, who will argue that this is a good thing like Tugela despite all evidence to the contrary.<br />
<br />
Sorry, an 18% slow will make or break this encounter, it would turn it from being a marginal encounter to a safe one. If you had ever tanked in Ik you would know this. Also, these fights are frequently opened with riposte/invul discs, so you have anything from 12 to 48 seconds to debuff the nameds before they start doing any damage. Thats enough time to get it slowed. To see the power of slow/debuffs you just need to look at the yellow con klys. On engagement their dps is comparable to the nameds, but once debuffed (their are basic strats for doing this safely) they are trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What do you call a rogue without backstab? a ranger who can't cast. Imagine if content mitigated  backstab so it was a glorified &quot;kick&quot; in some areas. Some mobs were outright immune to it. This only affects rogues, because they are the only class reliant on this ability to be desirable or useful. You look at the &quot;active&quot; skills melee classes receive that are similar, manually triggered boosts to DPS (I guess you could consider Flying Kicks, Ranger nukes, Sk spears and Bst nukes with thier 30 second recasts along this line?), and all those classes bring other utility to the table besides it for which they are desirable.<br />

Hello, weapon immunity.  GoD introduced this notion, but it hasn't really set in yet.  Many mobs are resistant (or susceptible) to weapon types and now melees all have to have a decent weapon of every type.  Casters have lived with this for a long time though with spell resistances.<br />
GoD and the new melee changes (endurance, etc) have pretty much turned melees into casters who don't have spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Case and point, Look at the 1 groupable ikkinz trials. You have the named which hit for 2200 and are slow immune. I fail to see the point of this, other than to further punish people who strive for any form of group diversity. I'm all for making content fun and challenging, but I still fail to see why the dynamic of removing slows entirely from the picture does anything other than completely ruin the benefit we bring to any sort of group. If it was at least slightly slowable, I could toss a nihil on it at the start of the fight in hope that maybe, just maybe the 15% slow it would provide would somewhat lessen the humungous gap in the ability to crank out hp/sec we're stuck with.<br />
<br />
Even for raid content, the elimination of slow is simply a lame idea. in time, all the gods (save quarm) are immune. Granted, the CCable mobs are slowable, but I fail to see why removing a dynamic of the fight makes anything more fun? I'd like to know I'm there and able to make a difference in the fight other than being relegated to /rt cures.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the vxed/tipt/ikkinz example, Two clerics, or a cleric and a druid with NO SLOWS should NOT be more suited for content than a shaman and a cleric. End of ****ing story.<br />
<br />
The Ikkinz single group trials are more about better equipment than better heals I'd say.  Two clerics would probably cut it even if they had crappy gear, maybe.  A well equipped cleric and a poorly equipped druid would probably fail.  I did Ikkinz group trial 1 with a cleric and we did fine.  The bosses in there do around 900-1200dps on a defensive warrior.  Those trials are mostly to keep out poorly equipped players because GoD is a raiding expansion.  Anyone and their mother can get past the 4 sewer trials, tipt and vxed if they have an enchanter in the group.<br />
<br />
Having the Ikkinz bosses slightly slowable might not be a big leap, but as is, a well equipped shaman can make it through those trials with a cleric as the only other healer.</div></div><hr />

BUT, before you said ...<br />
Well, because, in order to present the same degree of difficulty if they were fully slowable, they would need to hit for 8800. I'm sure that you can (or should) see why that would be a problem. If they hit for less they would become considerably easier once slowed, and if they hit for anything over 4000 they would have a high probability of 1 rounding any tank they faced on engagement.<br />
So, in your first post, you're saying that immunity is the only answer for this encounter because your tank gets one rounded, but in your reply to my post you say:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">In answer to the question;<br />
&quot;Why does new content still use slow immunity as a viable means of tuning difficulty?&quot;<br />
Because EQ is getting old and wrinkly and because of its dependance on an old engine I would guess its pretty limited in where they can innovate other mechanisms. In theory though, I think it could have been good to add a new interdependable new ability to each class which could have given an extra life to the game. Ie instead of directing power to have adverse effects to each class, it could have possible to branch out with other possibilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Saying that an 18% slow is vital to this encounter seems a bit non-sensical.  If the shaman is slowing the mob by 18% and then healing 47% as well as a cleric, you're better off just taking another cleric (as most groups do) instead of a shaman and not bothering to slow the mob at all.  Clerics don't get resisted on heals.<br />
<br />
And saying that slow immunity is the only way of making the encounters challenging is incorrect.  You're disabling the main duty of an entire class or classes, sometimes on nearly all mobs in an entire zone.  You would presumably have a similar challenge if mobs were made fully slowable and all heals were disabled, if most or all the mobs in an entire zone were immune to all forms of DDs and DoTs, if they were all immune to every form of melee attack, etc.  They're all methods of increasing the difficulty of the encounter, and yet they would all totally marginalize entire classes and by my way of thinking, that's unacceptable.<br />
<br />
For me, it's incredibly frustrating to go on a raid to Yxtta and find that most of the mobs in the zone are immune to slow, root, and mez.  That leaves shaman as the 4th best class to heal groups that usually don't need heals and otherwise strugging to get off DDs before the mob dies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">heh.  The practical fact is that debuffs dont matter anymore on these kind of fights.  I was trying to explain this to a druid friend of mine, who loves to use his debuffs.  I can't convince him to save his debuff agro and just nuke more, sooner and then the mob is dead and it's over.<br />
<br />
For examples sake - take the Tipt boss.  It lives about 70 seconds tops.  For my group configuration, we have a cleric who casts Holy Light back to back until the mob is dead, and then a secondary healer (that would be me) who casts their quick heals as needed.   <br />
<br />
For Tipt I heal rampage and spot heal the tank as needed.  What I don't do in Tipt is kill myself slowing.  If the guy isn't slowed on the second cast (right as riposte fades), then I shift to healing/nuking.  The slow is so insignificant and the fight is so short that what difference does it make, really?  It won't change the way the tank has to be healed.  The cleric will still chain light and a 2nd healer will still patch as needed, whether the mob is slowed or not.<br />
<br />
Another example is the first named in Ikkinz, even if it had a small slight slow, like the Tipt boss, it really wouldn't change how the tank has to be healed.  So it doesn't matter, better to up your DS and let that extra damage kill it 6 seconds faster.<br />
<br />
Unless a slow is completely unmitigated it isn't useful in situations where a tank still has to be healed with chain lights and assist heals and the mob is dying in 60-70 seconds. <br />
<br />
We did Ikkinz the other night but subbed in a Paladin in one of our usual DPS slots (bard, warrior, cleric, shaman, rogue, paladin).  Instead of having me heal, we decided we would let the paladin do it, and have me doing DPS (/laugh).  <br />
<br />
When I am a healer, I malos, then Bane and Blood of Saryrn before riposte wears off and then heal heal heal.  When I was dps, I malos then spirit call... then bane, blood of saryrn and spear of torment/velium strike.  I was summoned like 50 seconds into the fight, saved by DI + taunt.  Summoned again the next tick, saved by AE taunt and managed to live the final 20-30 seconds just using spear of torment.  Talk about feeling inadequate, when a paladin (who doesn't even have full healing AA) can successfully takes my place on healing and I can't do more than 5000 dmg to the mob without being summoned multiple times.<br />
<br />
Heh, just like Grizlor - LR makes all the difference.  ;)<br />

<br />
Tarthug, you are abstracting responses to two different posts, but if you want to take things out of context to prove your point, I guess there's nothing stopping you ;).<br />
<br />
In the first response I was talking about the effects of increasing dps to compensate for an applied mitigation in general, and why that is a bad idea (it would be a crap shoot depending solely on whether slow got resisted or not) on boss mobs. In fact, if you continued reading the response you quoted, you would see the following statement (which you chose to ignore for reasons best known to yourself) &quot;So, severe slow mitigation (in this case slow immune) is required in order to keep the event challenging.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the second response I was talking about your specific question about applying an 18% mitigation to the encounter as it stands. 18% less dps from the nameds would render the encounters trivial, particularly since the mob could be slowed with no risk in the initial engagement. These trials are gatekeepers to restrict progression to the most highly developed characters, making them 18% easier would undo that, unless the MRs on these guys were so insanely high that debuffs rarely stuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't think that is necessarily true Henora, most time's Ive died in IK on the nameds, its been due to late heals combined with damage spikes. Part of that may be due to lag, part of it due to the fact on many occasions I've been with healers on their first run to Ik. However, even a highly mitigated slow, such as 18% for example, would increase my effective hp (in this case by about 2k). That is enough to significantly increase my survivability. The healing setup wouldn't change much as you pointed out, but the likelyhood of success would be that much greater.<br />
<br />
I agree with your approach to focus on healing after the invul discs fade rather than slowing in Tipt. If it isnt slowed at that point you are better used keeping the tank alive, not to mention that the possibility of your overstepping the hate platform if you try too much.<br />
<br />

<br />
What if the slow immune nameds in the Ikkinz trials had a lower delay, but were slowable to the point that *after* the slow their delay would be the same as it currently is. <br />
Since the damage output before Slow wouldn't matter at all(You said it yourself that those are pre-tanked with furious or any other melees' invul disc etc.), how would that change the encounter other than giving the Shaman the chance to contribute and actually make our own gimpy heals a little more effective?<br />

I like things the way they are, trash are slowable, nameds are not. The trash are good enough reason for having a slower present and I'd prefer not to have the throw of a dice determine if we win a named encounter or not, if its all the same to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not the one asking for these mobs to be slowable, you'd have to ask that of those who are :). Two clerics wouldn't double the rate the warrior gets healing btw, since these groups have backup healers. The real difference is about 20-35%, depending on which class you are using as the secondary healer. In any case, both shaman and druids work perfectly well as backup healers. The other thing to bear in mind is that these fights are not only about healing, they are also about dps being enough to finish the fight as fast as possible (ie before your healers mana runs out, or before the mob gets a lucky damage spike). In that respect shaman and druids bring somewhat more than clerics due to their superior DoT capabilities. So it all evens out. The one time we had two clerics in IK, they didn't perform any better than our cleric/shaman and cleric/druid combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Again Giac, taking from two responses about different things is placing them out of context.<br />

In the first situation we are talking about increased dps to match the slow. If slow is bounced then the mob will be doing full dps, with the tank allmost certainly going down. If it lands you get an encounter like the ones that currently exist. That only makes the encounter more difficult in sense that it depends on the roll of the dice. If it rolls well, you get to try to win the fight, if it rolls badly you die. Doesn't sound like much fun to me.<br />
<br />
In the second situation we are talking about mitigation being applied to existing encounters. If slow fails you are left with an encounter as they stand now. If it lands you get an encounter considerably easier than what it is now.</div></div><hr />

My usual group for these trials has been warrior, cleric, druid, shaman, bard and wizzy. Normally the cleric and druid handle healings so I'm doing dps. It's sounds like we're going along the same plan you are, mob gets pulls, warrior fires off furious etc. Personally I've had no problem stacking bane and BoS and then chain nuking with spear and gotten no aggro at all.

What makes you think verant wants these encounters to be any easier? They presumably knew how difficult they where when they made them and made the mobs slow immune to put them at that level of dps. Most likely if they where to change the mobs so they where no longer immune they would increase the dps to compensate so that the slowed dps stayed the same and the encounter would in essence get harder as you mentioned since you would have to have a slower and have to land the slow to bring it down to current levels. In addition they might increase the amount the mob hits for to increase the dps which increases the worst case dmg in one round and increases the risk of a 1 rounded tank even once slowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You completely miss the problem with that.   To create a mob that is slowable with a 50% slow, without mitigation, it would have to do twice the DPS unslowed to achieve the desired DPS once slowed.  Which for mobs in GoD, and even PoP, means that your tanks are going to be dead instantly on pull if you don't have the mob instantly slowed.   The more you want to slow a mob the more DPS its going to do unslowed.<br />
<br />
Just get rid of the damn spell, give us something else, and balance us without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">But why is a specific level of dps desirable?<br />
There is no particular reason to have encounters designed around slow.  Throw in a slower and yeah, its easier.  But, throw in a mezzer and its easier too.  Add charmable mobs and watch it become trivial.<br />
There are so many ways in which this game is under/overbalanced, why is this one facet so scrutinized?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I've (rarely) seen groups with no slower that were happy that way.  I've NEVER seen a group with no healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If they worked at it, there are plenty of ideas that could implement exp with no healer needs (like a mob with 2 million Hp that has to be killed within 2 minutes of aggro or it despawns, but when you kill it you get hefty freakin exp to make up for the long time.   Have the mob not hit back but instead have a moderate damage shield.  Could even have it drop items with single charges of a heal that, like PoSky keys, dissapear when you leave the zone.<br />
<br />
  Thought that one up in what... 3 seconds?  And there are plenty more avenues for consideration.  But since nobody has EVER seen content that was providing advancement without the simple outline of &quot;Find mob, hurt mob, heal friends, finish killing mob&quot; these concerns get no voice at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Who knows, maybe when the Berzerker epic is more widely known people will realize that in the middle of it they are put into a room for a 1 on 1 fight with a mob which is challenging, but possible, for a pure melee class.  And probably shows some decent reward too.</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to say you guys should be useless or osmething, but just that SOE is trying to A) phase out slow because they hate it to begin with and B) reduce dependancy.  Now they're doing it in a very lackluster way in that they are makeing shaman useless because your heals don't compare and neither do your damage capabilities compared to other classes when we're dealing with 30second mobs.  <br />
<br />
Also someone complained about not having the soloability of other classes, well last I checked it takes me ~5-7mins depending on root breaks and what not to kill a mob at pofire tables (and no nuke kiting isn't mana efficient for the time I have to spend medding) whereas it takes my brother (a shaman) about 3 minutes and that is constant because of canni.  Enlighten me on how that isn't as good as the soloing I can do?  In fact he sat there and watched me solo one and laughed at how long it took me boasting he does it twice as fast and never has to med, so yeah, don't complain about that if you haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
There are lots of abilities that are overpowered in this game.  Slow, CH, charm, and warrior discs, heck even to a lesser extent stuff liek snare/root made some things wayyyy too easy, but they've ogtten around that.  It sucks that you have been built around one of the VERY overpoewring things in the game and that it is hard to get around it without makeing mobs immune (at least for unimaginative robots like SoE it is hard :P) but.. god I forgot where I was going with this /sigh... maybe I'll think of it later and edit/reply.</div></div><hr />

If it lands you get an encounter like the ones that currently exist. That only makes the encounter more difficult in sense that it depends on the roll of the dice. If it rolls well, you get to try to win the fight, if it rolls badly you die. Doesn't sound like much fun to me.<br />
As is I do not get to contribute beyond being 1/10th of a cleric. Does not sound like fun to me.<br />
<br />
In the second situation we are talking about mitigation being applied to existing encounters. If slow fails you are left with an encounter as they stand now. If it lands you get an encounter considerably easier than what it is now.<br />
Or the designers could *gasp* go for the middle ground - an encounter that is a tad more difficult then now without slow and a little easier with it.</div></div><hr />

Right?</div></div><hr />

/yawn<br />
Perhaps if your posts were not so abstract, replying to you wouldn't resemble trying to hold a cat still in the shower.<br />
<br />
In the first response I was talking about the effects of increasing dps to compensate for an applied mitigation in general, and why that is a bad idea (it would be a crap shoot depending solely on whether slow got resisted or not) on boss mobs. In fact, if you continued reading the response you quoted, you would see the following statement (which you chose to ignore for reasons best known to yourself) &quot;So, severe slow mitigation (in this case slow immune) is required in order to keep the event challenging.&quot;<br />
Of course, my main wasn't a warrior, so I can understand why you wouldn't look at this from a shaman perspective.  Shaman have slows that throw against 2 resists, MR and DR. This provides several options for making shaman more desireable in GoD groups.<br />
<br />
Option 1) Make the DR resist on some key encounters lower so that a simple DR debuff and Gruumus would likely land first time.  This way you don't impact other resists that might increase caster DPS as very few damage spells throw against DR.  Now a mostly mitigated slow on our 61 DR slow will not land for 18%, it's a slower cast, but less of a crapshoot.<br />
<br />
Option 2) Ignore the crapshoot fears and with Tash or OOC and Malos, and the new resist modifier slow, give it a 95% chance of landing first cast.  This gives us even reason to be there, but doesn't make it impossible for an enchanter to do the role.<br />
<br />
With these options you would scale mob DPS up and create a need (one reasonably doable by several classes, but best done by shaman) for the class in these encounters without making them any less difficult.  For a small risk of a first cast failure, this seems reasonable to me.  I'd sooner take a small chance and know I've made a reasonable contribution, AND that I'm actually wanted for a key encounter, than mitigate the risk and ride someone elses coat tails by taking the easy out and flagging the mob immune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To state the obvious: after 12 seconds (give or take a few more depending on the start of the tick) riposte discs fade. What happens then? That extra 12% dps would make the event for practical purposes unwinnable by anyone other than a fully time equiped warrior on a consistent basis and even then it would be a hit and miss affair. So, if the roll of the dice means you get resists on your slows, you lose unless you have one of the very best tanks on the server. If your slow sticks you could win with a pre-elemental VT level warrior. If they were to design the event as it stands with slow as an element it would be reduced to a question of the roll of the dice for most groups doing this content. Trust me, you don't want these things slowable, they will be much harder and frustrating if they are.</div></div><hr />

This would make the event unwinnable be allmost all groups without a shaman if it was tuned to the same difficulty it is currently at. If the slow was applied over the mobs at their current setting, the encounter would be rendered trivial for elemental groups, and probably doable by most VT level groups if they had a shaman present.

<br />
If there is a 95% chance of slow sticking on first pass, but only with certain classes present, why bother with making it slowable at all since the mob will allmost certainly be slowed by the time invul discs wear off. The argument that this will create a need for slowers is invalid since the trash creates the need for slowers anyway. It's not like these classes aren't going to be there. Introducing things like this into the event will make the class makeups that can do them even more rigid than what it is now, and for a progression target that is a bad thing. I'm quite happy with the way it is set up now, the encounter is tough but doable with fairly flexible group compositions.</div></div><hr />

How would you, as a shaman, see either?<br />
<br />
And no, I have not seen groups without a slower or healer either. But I have been on a Tipt run where I did not cast a single slow. As for healing, well of course you need to heal the damage you take. That means you either avoid damage completely - and I have seen experience group do just that to great effect, not to mention soloers - or you heal the damage.<br />
<br />
If they worked at it, there are plenty of ideas that could implement exp with no healer needs (like a mob with 2 million Hp that has to be killed within 2 minutes of aggro or it despawns, but when you kill it you get hefty freakin exp to make up for the long time.   Have the mob not hit back but instead have a moderate damage shield.  Could even have it drop items with single charges of a heal that, like PoSky keys, dissapear when you leave the zone.<br />
<br />
Thought that one up in what... 3 seconds?  And there are plenty more avenues for consideration.  But since nobody has EVER seen content that was providing advancement without the simple outline of &quot;Find mob, hurt mob, heal friends, finish killing mob&quot; these concerns get no voice at all.<br />
Exactly. I do not mind having to have a healer in the group but the cookie cutter design of GoD (and to a lesser degree the previous expansions) makes some classes' shortcomings painfully obvious. Freely mix and match hard hitting MOBs, high HPs MOBs, swarm MOBs, AEing MOBs and wall MOBs like your above design and some(not all by a long shot but some) of the current balance problems will vanish by themselves.<br />
<br />
I am sure this and other boards will gladly come up with literally hundreds of general MOB designs for SOE to use for free.</div></div><hr />

Grizlor, as you SHOULD be aware, you being the expert healer and all, it is not overall dps that kills tanks in these encounters, it is burst dps that does it. The dynamics of these encounters are more like raid nameds, not the usual PoF trash you are used to healing on. My warrior has been taken out with 3 clerics on one occasion, but has done fine many times with a cleric/shaman or druid combos. 3 clerics should have had no problem, but through a combination of bad timing and a major damage spike, they failed. At 15% increased dps, incrementally larger damage spikes will allmost certainly kill me with the druid or shaman as a secondary. If by any chance slow did not stick (and you know that is going to happen, otherwise why bother removing the unslowable tag) we would fail for sure unless we were got lucky.</div></div><hr />

So you are saying that the current encounters, which are by your admission doable with a shaman would be undoable with 12% more DPS? The only way that might be true is if they were currently just shy of onerounding the tank on every single round - in wich case the shaman would be 100% useless in the first case.<br />
<br />
Pick an opinion and stay with it - either the encounters are so hard a shaman is useless on them because you basically need a CH rotation or they are easy enough that an extra 12%(or better 6%, so the encounter is actually a little easier after slow) damage will still make them winnable with a shaman.<br />
<br />
It cannot be both. Unless of course you want to talk about creative encounter design. But the last times we had that discussion you never answered any of my questions so I am going to assume the current encounter design suits you just fine, which does make sense for a warrior.<br />
<br />
So, if the roll of the dice means you get resists on your slows, you lose unless you have one of the very best tanks on the server. If your slow sticks you could win with a pre-elemental VT level warrior.<br />
Are you telling me the difference between a pre-Elemental tank and a post-Time tank is less then 12%? The difference in HPs alone is easily more.<br />
<br />
If they were to design the event as it stands with slow as an element it would be reduced to a question of the roll of the dice for most groups doing this content. Trust me, you don't want these things slowable, they will be much harder and frustrating if they are.<br />
If you define 6-12% harder without slow (which should not be a problem for you, as you do have a shaman along, right?) as &quot;much harder and frustrating&quot; then yes, they will be.<br />
Of course said encounters are easily twice as hard when you take a shaman along instead of a second cleric currently or if you try them with a knight instead of a warrior. Tell me: Why is that ok?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our biggest problem is lack of fast DPS. And a slow that For all intents and purposes is being tuned out while we are not given the tools to support our groups when that is happening.<br />
<br />
Okay To fix us. <br />
<br />
Let that funky new slow that we get Penetrate Slow mitagation. If it is a 25% mitagated slow Make it go for full effect. 50% Have it go for 75% 75 percent have it slow for 50% and if immune Have it land for 25%.<br />
<br />
You still have to check for MR. It makes the slow Viable in many areas where the mitagation Hurts us the most. Cause a beastlord who has a slow mitagated isnt expected to keep people alive. just slow and kill. A chanter isnt expected to keep people alive when slow is resisted. <br />
<br />
We are hurt cause Our primary ability (Slows) Directly effects our secondary Ability. (Heals) That is what is crippling us. We are balanced around the assumption that we have slow on the mobs. but slow doesnt always land. And can be resisted alot. So we are always in the hole. The added mitagation just basicly took away any heal efficency we have due to always having to cast slow and possibly Malos first.<br />
<br />
Then having a shaman in the group is an advantage. But not a head and shoulders advantage over other slowers. Who can bring other things to the table. An we will be able to heal in more content and be useful even in the Uber fights. You know. Like Chanters that Charm stuff to make it really dead fast. Or beastlords who Dodge tank Uber hitting mobs (I tihnk they get that) <br />
<br />
Let us do our damn Jobs properly. Debuff, Buff and heal. <br />
<br />
If we need fast damage Give us a High damage Dot. That isnt coded with a base resist and 24 second recast. Like hmm.. 750 DD and 2 tick Dot for 500 Each tick. Affected by DD AA and such and Dot AA as well. Not as useful for soloing cause of root breakage and pain of keeping on mob. but fantastic for A quick pulling group, while taking advantage of the history of shaman with Dot aspects. <br />
<br />
There problem solved. I mean think about it SoE. Do you really want one of the fabled support classes so mad at you that the next game around you will only have people logging in that enjoyed EQ the first time around and have no complaints? Cause that is a very small number. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Murtak, there are two aspects to healing.<br />
<br />
Firstly, there is the healing required to keep up with the mobs total dps. If the dps was very even, but exceeded the rate of healing available, the tank's hp would slowly diminish until they were dead. In most situations where you stand a chance of winning, this one included, healing is more than sufficient to keep up with average dps. Unless your healer goes oom, its the spikes that get you, not the average dps.<br />
<br />
Secondly, mob dps is very seldom even. You will have periods of low dps, average dps, and high dps (damage spikes). Setting up a healing strategy you need to account for these spikes or you will lose. On raids its simple, the next tank AEtaunts and picks up agro, but that isnt realistic in 1 group scenarios. If the dps over a short time frame (between heals) exceeds the tank hp, the tank dies (obviously). The frequency with which this happens varies depending on the frequency of healing, the size of the heals and the tank's total hp. Changing the mobs dps will increase the frequency of these potential lethal damage spikes. Now, the frequency of healing can only be changed by increasing the number of healers, and the size of the heals can only be changed by moving to a higher rank of healer. Since most healers in KD are equivalent in that respect, the only other variable that can be changed is the tank hp. As mob dps increases you will need more hp on your tank to accomodate the larger damage spikes, and more hp to cover the inevitable hp attrition that follows chain healing. This incidental attrition will increase as the ratio of available healing/dps gets smaller. So the difficulty of the encounter increases exponentially. Likewise, with lower dps, your tank needs fewer hp to survive the spikes and is much less likely to suffer hp attrition. So the encounter becomes exponentially easier as dps decreases.<br />
<br />
Btw, I dont have exact numbers, but I expect a mature VT level pre-elemental warrior will have about 1000 - 1200 hp less than a mature elemental warrior, who will be around 1000 -1500 hp short of a mature time warrior.

<br />
I'm well aware of how slow works Giac. Increasing dps through lowered delay is the same thing as increasing hit max with the same delay. That is obvious. Lowering mob hit delay doesnt lower PC casting time, so the increased damage spike is still there. A damage spike is all damage done between time A and time B (usually these would be heals). How that damage is incurred, whether it be from individual hits or high hit rate is irrelevant. I'm not sure what you are trying to get at.<br />

8500 HPs vs 11000 HPs. That is a 23% difference, not counting shielding, AC or AAs.<br />
<br />
Learn to add :). From VT to ele is 1000-1200, from ele to time is 1000-1500,  or 2000-2700, pretty much the range you noted. Next: we are talking about adding a slow, reducing dps by 15-18% on existing content, or, alternatively increasing dps by 15-18% so the net dps after slow is what it currently is. I think those were more or less the two alternatives presented by others. So, a total range 30-36% difference in dps in potential scenarios (one making it doable by VT warriors, the other potentially impossible for all but time warriors). Thats roughly in the same range, or do you disagree?<br />

Most clerics in the zone have the same heals, the same aa, the same or similar focus items as all the other clerics in the zone.<br />

Most shaman in the zone have the same heals, the same aa, the same or similar focus items as all the other shaman in the zone.<br />
You guys disagree?<br />
<br />
Would you mind enlightening us as to the difference between damage and HP attrition?<br />
<br />
Hit point attrition occurs when the preceeding heal does not fully heal damage taken on a consistent basis. Effectively the total hp of the tank is reduced and he/she becomes more vulnerable to damage spikes. So, if you land a heal on your 11k tank, but it only takes his hp to 10k, you are working with a 10k tank for all practical purposes. If that is happening on a consistent basis sooner or later you will lose.<br />
<br />
And it by the very same logic it becomes exponentially easier if you add more healing to the group like maybe adding a druid instead of a shaman.<br />
Your point?<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. It would make hit point attrition less likely, but it wouldn't really help when coping with damage spikes, which is more affected by timing of heals than anything else. When you have a group with a single healer then I think attrition is the dominant factor and that is pretty easy to deal with. You can either cope or you cant. It gets more complicated with more than one healer though since timing becomes an issue. When you are facing extreme damage output, its most efficient to have heals evenly spaced rather than bunched together. Of course, if you have attrition on top of that your are on a losing game and PC dps becomes really important (you have to win before the mob does). Obviously in the scenario that plays out in IK you dont generally have that sort of control, so its spamming heals and hoping for the best. Clerics have a lot more options to do this of course. The difference between a druid and shaman might seem large taken in isolation, but as part of the total heals from the healing team, the differences become realtively small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Tugela is on my ignore, so I might be missing some argument here, but...  If you need a time geared warrior and 2 healers against unslowed mobs, why is it such a bad thing to require just a time geared knight and a single cleric when the mob is slowed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I'm well aware of how slow works Giac. Increasing dps through lowered delay is the same thing as increasing hit max with the same delay. That is obvious. Lowering mob hit delay doesnt lower PC casting time, so the increased damage spike is still there. A damage spike is all damage done between time A and time B (usually these would be heals). How that damage is incurred, whether it be from individual hits or high hit rate is irrelevant. I'm not sure what you are trying to get at.<br />
So according to your argument a MOB that hits every 30 seconds for 20K is just as hard to heal on as a MOB that does 2K damage every 3 seconds?<br />
<br />
Learn to add :). From VT to ele is 1000-1200, from ele to time is 1000-1500,  or 2000-2700, pretty much the range you noted.<br />
 :confused: So are you telling me that 2500 is not a valid number when you said 2000-2700? Oh, nevermind, you say yourself that this is what I said. Could you make up your mind as to whether I am right or wrong? It is hard to argue for or against someone who changes his opinion in mid-sentence.<br />
<br />
Next: we are talking about adding a slow, reducing dps by 15-18% on existing content, or, alternatively increasing dps by 15-18% so the net dps after slow is what it currently is. I think those were more or less the two alternatives presented by others. So, a total range 30-36% difference in dps in potential scenarios (one making it doable by VT warriors, the other potentially impossible for all but time warriors). Thats roughly in the same range, or do you disagree?<br />
Well, if you increase your own 12% number (which is double of what the rest of us meant) a little, then arbitrarily double it and disregard the effects of shielding, AC and possibly AAs . . yes.<br />
<br />
In the real world? No.<br />
<br />
Any sane person, if they were to adjust content to make it a little more difficult without slow and a little less difficult with slow, would increase the MOBs attack rate by half of said slow's percentage (12% as per your own numbers) thus giving a net increase of 6% in MOB DPS but not maximum hit.<br />
<br />
Now, are you going to tell us why it is ok for a cleric to outheal a shaman by more then 100% but not ok for a shaman to decrease MOB DPS by 12%?<br />
<br />
Since most healers in KD are equivalent in that respect . .<br />
- snip open mouths by me and Grizlor -<br />
Most clerics in the zone have the same heals, the same aa, the same or similar focus items as all the other clerics in the zone.<br />
Most druids in the zone have the same heals, the same aa, the same or similar focus items as all the other druids in the zone.<br />
Most shaman in the zone have the same heals, the same aa, the same or similar focus items as all the other shaman in the zone.<br />
You guys disagree?<br />
Since you were talking about adding more healers to make up for increased damage I can only assume you do not consider druids or shaman healers. That certainly does explain a lot.<br />
<br />
Hit point attrition occurs when the preceeding heal does not fully heal damage taken on a consistent basis. Effectively the total hp of the tank is reduced and he/she becomes more vulnerable to damage spikes. So, if you land a heal on your 11k tank, but it only takes his hp to 10k, you are working with a 10k tank for all practical purposes. If that is happening on a consistent basis sooner or later you will lose.<br />
I think I am going to stay with calling it damage. I tends to make it easier for other people to understand what I am saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it by the very same logic it becomes exponentially easier if you add more healing to the group like maybe adding a druid instead of a shaman.<br />
Your point?<br />
Not necessarily. It would make hit point attrition less likely, but it wouldn't really help when coping with damage spikes, which is more affected by timing of heals than anything else.[/QUOTE]<br />
Oh yes - larger patch heals do not help deal with spiky damage. How could I forget that.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
When you have a group with a single healer then I think attrition is the dominant factor and that is pretty easy to deal with. You can either cope or you cant. It gets more complicated with more than one healer though since timing becomes an issue. When you are facing extreme damage output, its most efficient to have heals evenly spaced rather than bunched together.<br />
As opposed to heals landing on top of each other being a good thing when the tank is taking less damage? Of course you time your heals to not overheal. That is like saying one should be careful to not attack random mezzed MOBs. That is not even knowing to play your class, it is common sense.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have attrition on top of that your are on a losing game and PC dps becomes really important (you have to win before the mob does).<br />
That atrition thing boggles my mind. Are you saying your tank actually steadily drops in HPs after each CH? And just a few sentences earlier you told me a druid's larger heals would not help in this type of encounter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">The irony of the slow dilemma is similiar to the irony of the CH lock<br />
Both would require a complete reworking of the game to &quot;fix&quot; properly.<br />
<br />
And both are far too much work, in resources that I expect Sony to ever fix.<br />
<br />
Slow Rework would be to flat scale it.  Rather than Percentage Scale it.  Adding new higher Numbers with expansions.  AlA Damage Shields and Regen.  A shaman slow could reduce 100 DPS from a mob.  Chanter 80 DPS BSt 60 DPS etc.  Then you no longer have this dilemma of making a mob with 2k DPS unslowed, just to get it back to the target of 500 DPS slowed.  You then create a situation where the mob is 600 DPS unslowed<br />
500 DPS slowed.<br />
<br />
Of course you'd have to rework healing at the same time.  Increase Shaman hps/hpm.  Perhaps remove CH at the same time.<br />
<br />
Once way way way long ago.  DSes/Regen/Slow were all fairly similiar in power.  24 Point DS was huge speeding the kill enough that you could be effective with killign faster unslowed mobs.  However DS/Regen straight scaled.  While Slow percentage did.<br />
<br />
Ultimatley you could vastly improve the game by retuning every encounter, and by retuning Heals (Especially CH) and slows.<br />
<br />
However, they wont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">This would make the event unwinnable be allmost all groups without a shaman if it was tuned to the same difficulty it is currently at. <br />
Why not?  The event is already unwinable without a cleric and a very well equipped fighter, why not a shaman?  For the 13% or so a 40% slow translates to on the highest mitigation level I'm sure a second cleric can cover that damage anyway.<br />
<br />
If there is a 95% chance of slow sticking on first pass, but only with certain classes present, why bother with making it slowable at all since the mob will allmost certainly be slowed by the time invul discs wear off.<br />
Sorry, but what was your argument about a crapshoot again?  Pick an opinion and stick to it, or admit that you were wrong.  If I have, as a SHAMAN, plenty of time to slow it and it can be slowed, there is NO crapshoot.<br />
<br />
The argument that this will create a need for slowers is invalid since the trash creates the need for slowers anyway. It's not like these classes aren't going to be there.<br />
This is the issue most shaman have with GoD, there is no need for shaman slow here and in fact, most trash dies so quick that replacing a shaman with a DPS class is frequently more efficient.  Our spot is far from certain (well, it is far from certain if you one box and don't have a warrior or cleric main).  Introducing a need for shaman on the boss encounter gives us a good reason to be there and with heavily mitigated slows any slow equipped class CAN fill the role with a marginal drop in effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, what I'm saying is that a mob that hits once for 3k every 6 seconds does the same damage as one that hits 10 times for 300 each in the same time frame. 3k is 3k, the package it's delivered in is irrelevant.<br />

<br />
Didn't change my opinion, I just paraphrased what I had said originally, which was comparing mature elemental warriors to mature VT ones or mature time ones in 2 alternative scenarios. You were the one who came up with 2500 (which is the approximate difference between a VT warrior compared to a time one) with the implication that my numbers were incorrect, which is not the case. I'm not sure what your issue is here, you appear to be responding to sentences and paragraphs in isolation and not considering the context of the discussion. Focussing on minor details such as the meaning of sentence construction doesnt add to constructive debate. You do that a lot in your posts, not only in reply to me, and I can't say I care much for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if you increase your own 12% number (which is double of what the rest of us meant) a little, then arbitrarily double it and disregard the effects of shielding, AC and possibly AAs . . yes.<br />
<br />
I didn't increase the number. 15-18% were the numbers kicked around earlier as the magnitude for a slow in this encounter. The point of discussion was why are these mobs were unslowable. My opinion on the matter was that they were flagged as such because having them slowable would create significant balancing issues due to the extreme nature of the dps. It would either render them too easy, or too difficult. Tuning them would be a major issue, and would probably result in class make ups for these encounters that are even more rigid than they are now. That might be ok for a regular loot mob, but for a progression mob IMO it would be a problem. Obviously I'm not in favor of untagging these mobs, but if they were made slowable the magnitude of the slow would have to be considerable smaller than the numbers bandied about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you really a tank?<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard of ripostes creating a damage spike?<br />
<br />
Heals can only land between &quot;swings&quot;, never can a heal hit between attacks so if a mob quads for 1k min and 2k max, you will take between 4 and 8k(assuming he doesn't miss) *before* any heal can land on the tank.<br />
Dude, you need to attend the warrior school again on top of the Shaman school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Not to change the topic, but I have a question more in line to the original post.<br />
<br />
Why is protecting the damage the first answer to the equation of mob damage vs player healing? <br />
<br />
To be interesting and challenging there has to be a fair chance that the mob can kill the players.  If a mob only melees, and then has 75% of its melee teeth pulled, to where it has no realistic chance of killing anyone, then yeah there is no real point in that mob, or the encounter as a whole.<br />
<br />
SOE’s answer (and the answer bandied about in this thread at times), is if a mobs needs X dps to have a fair chance at killing players, and then has its melee dps reduced up to 75% by slow, the answer is to increase the mobs melee dps to where slowed it still does X dps, or just make slow ineffective.<br />
<br />
But why is mitigating slow automatically considered the first line of mob dps versus healing balancing?  Caanus Grey talked about mitigating healing directly (with his mention of the healing cap proc).  I must admit I like that idea.  This would have several advantages IMHO.  Formost it would break the lock that clerics have on raids.  This may be a sore spot in my guild because we have a shortage of clerics, and for us to do any interesting content I need to talk to each cleric and druid and make them swear on their mom’s soul that they will make it to the raid.  I’m sure many small family guilds have similar problems.  A raid mob that mitigated healing would make raiding more accessible to smaller guilds that cannot count on fielding enough clerics, as now more classes with healing.  <br />
<br />
Ok, this would not be fair to clerics if it was common, so other new ideas need to be implemented as well.  The PoF imp is another really interesting idea in my mind.  While I’m not excited about fighting Irene (sounds like a pain), mobs that eliminate player healing and damage though mezs seem are another example of ways to balance player healing and damage.  Give the mobs more offensive choices besides melee damage.  Make combat less straight-forward.  Make the equation more complex for bigger challenges, don't just ramp up the mob damage to insane numbers. <br />
<br />
I know, I know, these kinds of mobs are a horrible pain for both players, and devs to code.  But they would be new and interesting, rather than the straightforward (and terribly predictable) solution of ramping up mob damage to insane lvls, and making slow ineffective.  If they had the right kind of exp and drops I’d love to fight them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I really do think that a lot of zone design is limited by a cookie cutter approach. If you do not have varied MOBs you are wary of anything that might trivialize them since if you can trivialize one of them you can do it to everyone of them.<br />
<br />
Thus slow mitigation, fear level caps, mez immunity, unsnareable MOBs and so on.<br />
<br />
Why this is only applied to offensive abilities and not to defensive abilities like CH, disciplines and the like I can not imagine though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Actually defensive is gimped on some in a way.  From how it was explained to me all mobs have a minimum value that they will ALWAYS hit for if they hit you at all, and then a certain increment that they scale up from that to hit the max value (ie - hits you for 200 minimum, and any value over that in multiples of 10 up to 400).   Defensive only reduces that variable increment, so by making the max and min hit value nearly the same defensive becomes useless and tanks should use evasive instead to reduce damage.</div></div><hr />
