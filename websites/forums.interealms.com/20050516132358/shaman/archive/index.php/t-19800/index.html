<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To be honest, I am quite surprised and amazingly pleased to see that Sony has added a new server called Morden Rasp.   While I will agree that there has been many wailing about the demise of EverQuest, the product continues to move along based on the &quot;New&quot; vision of Sony Enterprises, i.e. more about the money instead of the vision. <br />
<br />
I do not want to sound naive, as adding a new server does not solve the numerous issues within the game.  But given the continuing rate of expansions for EverQuest Online and other EQ branded products, who know where Sony would be willing to invest next.   The bottom line is the bottom line.  <br />
<br />
In closing, many lately have questioned the game direction.   From my standpoint, the Dev team appears to be heading back to its roots.   Dev posts are popping up across numerous boards (regardless of ownership/ad issues).   EQTraders has had very strong interaction from quest/trader skill Dev?s (just check out any one of the skill forums to see numerous interactive posts).   And EverQuest Online Forums is starting up new sections as well.  All of this appears (to me) to show that the management of EverQuest is stretching itself to meet its community base.   <br />
<br />
Here's looking forward to greater interaction on Shaman issues with the development team.  Better to look forward than remain in the past.</div></div><hr />

New server good idea.<br />
Being on Bristlebroke though this server is crying out for a split but still no chance of this being implemented.<br />

<br />
Um they took splits away and put as a pay service.  Hey you can move with your equipment now too right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">while there are many rumor abour EQ is slowly die, they make a new server to show them EQ is still growing<br />
<br />
anyway, they will earn tons from new server, since lots people will transfer there like their last new server, that is pretty easy money($75) from each transfer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep, from what i read this is all a ploy for more money.  note that this isn't a typical server split, in which case 1, 2 or 3 current servers allow people to split onto the server for free.  this is a new server, where they should be following the rule of &quot;no char transfers to a new server for 6 months&quot; (i might be wrong on the 6 months, but it's a long time).  instead you can immediately pay them 75 bucks to transfer now.<br />
<br />
i'm not normally a soe conspiracy theorist, but this one just stinks so bad it's obvious.</div></div><hr />
