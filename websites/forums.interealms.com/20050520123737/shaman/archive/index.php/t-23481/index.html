Ancient, like I'll ever see that?<br />
New invis looks promising, lets hope it is one<br />

<br />
&quot;Increase Hitpoints by 1965&quot;  The healing we want, but as an Ancient.  Do we get 2 Ancients or does this mean the Ancient Canni isn't ancient?  I doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also looks like some changes to Ancestral Aid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Every class is getting two ancients. With the duration on spirit veil I'm praying we finally get a fixed duration invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its my personal hope they swap the Ancient heal with a DOT if the Ancients in OoW are anything like past expansion versions. Would be kinda weak to have such an important spell as an Ancient. The Luclin Ancients were nice, but hardly &quot;defining&quot;. To be perfectly honest, I think they should create an Ancient with a &quot;longer duration group FA&quot;, say 15 mins. That way, we still get the more PITA version, and those who get there can get the better one. Thats what I think Ancients should be used for, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The ancients should most definately be convienence spells or a bit of extra dps like they were in Luclin, not fixes to class issues like they have been in GoD and appears to be in Omens. <br />
<br />
Luclin we got what Ancient Bane of Nife (small dps upgrade) and Feral Avatar (20% boost to Primal Avatar).<br />
<br />
GoD made a serious upgrade to canni available only as an ancient while most classes got a dps spell. Class fixes as ancient are dumb.<br />
<br />
Omens we get another canni upgrade and a healing upgrade as ancients. Two core compents of our class. At least the rest of us are getting pained memories (hopefully). <br />
<br />
Druids and clerics are both getting 1 dps increase and 1 healing increase as an ancient. Each priest's ancient heal is almost exactly 10% better then the base one, which of course means a much bigger difference to clerics then everyone else (SoE seems to have an obsession with straight% changes). Still not sure why the canni line was ever made an ancient though. They should have continued our poison dot line as our ancient or even the ice nuke line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm trying very hard to keep the faith. I'm looking for a compelling reason to have my shaman as a nonbot (over my brd/rog).<br />
<br />
I see what is on test.  I do not see anything which redefines the shaman's roll in a group.  I do see some effort.  But groups are very predictable in the ways that they pick classes.  Most groups pick for efficency.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to lose sleep over a remove detrimental(1) spell when I have remove detrimental(6) (RC3).  Sure it may cure a pooka of stonemite acid, but not much else.<br />
<br />
On test I see:<br />
- Shaman are a 3rd rate healer<br />
- Shaman are a 3rd rate damage doer<br />
- Shaman are a first rate buffer of buffs nobody wants<br />
<br />
If we aren't going to get anything on the above 3, which we have pleeded and begged for.  How about improving the existing spell lines shaman already have?<br />
<br />
Frenzy and voice of the berserker were created with the belief that a shaman could sacrifice 30 seconds of casting, for improved melee damage over their duration.  Can't you add this spell line and improve it to make it so shaman DPS is around 40-50 in melee? (note you'd have to solve the problem about mana regen while not on a horse/sitting, or we'd never melee).<br />
<br />
I really miss going toe to toe which I did from level 1-50.  Sure I wasnt efficent at it, but a shaman COULD do it.  And somewhere that notion stopped.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a self only line of defensive buffs (the turtle spells) which give 50% mitigation for attacks under X damage.  So if you get hit for 3k they do nothing, but if you get hit for &lt; 1500, perhaps they mitigate 50%.  0.5 ct, 18 second duration, 12 second fizzle rate (i.e. the time before your spell gems reset)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still not good enough.<br />
<br />
Ancients should be upgrades, period.  The best spells to upgrade imo, apart from Canni, would be Champion or Curse of Sisslak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well certainly better for the most part , i say thats about 1/3 our spells looking ok now. all priest getting a ancient heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Group FA with a short-ass duration.  I wonder if this is even TGBable..not that all my DPS melee huddle together in their own groups anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm I think its too early to actually know whether shamans will be more or less demanded. SoE could use this expansion to balance shamans, and one of the quotes I remember back along was that cripple was going to be more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The remove detrimental spell is good.  It has a 12 recast time.  RC3 has a substantially longer recast time, AND cannot be used on someone out of group (e.g. MT).  This has the potential to be a significant contributer to raid functions against mobs with certain effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Spirit Veil : Finally a fixed duration invis? Maybe...<br />
<br />
Pure Spirit: Remove Detrimental(1).<br />
This is Good direction to make shaman &quot;Master Curer&quot; in Raid.   If shaman can cure ppl without dispell whole their buff  will be useful for raids ---- Compare  to RC 3 [Remove Detrimental(6)] and New OOW aa [Remove Detrimental(15)].       However,  if you need chain cast pure spirit 10 times(6* 10 cast time + 12* 10 recast = 180 sec total, same as RC AA recast) to cure 1 ppl, it will remain junk spell not worth to cast.   It will need some boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so they made our second upgrade to canni ancient alos.  *** ?<br />
<br />
Do the clerics have yaulp ancient or the chanters have KEI ancient or the BST have SD/whatever  ancient?<br />
<br />
I dont get the idea behind upgrading our base skill set then making it a ancient spell so that no one can get it. I mean i can understand healing... sorta ... but this is our basis off which our spells are balanced, so they are going to this these spells into our mana regen calculations evne though we dont have them.<br />
<br />
Now this is making me mad. Out of all the things going on, i can get over them, but this is really pissing me off. One of the reasons i was going to buy OoW was for the new mana regen, i figured they would make up for what they did to us in GoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sigh. Im trying to enjoy the game for what it is, while its still here, but damn man, are you guys trying to piss me off? Cause your doing a good job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lit,<br />
<br />
Pained memories is a version of the new canni for all of us that will never see an ancient spell. I think its currently slated for 68 (wish they'd make it 66, not like we haven't waited long enough for a canni upgrade). <br />
<br />
People that can get ancients will be getting two ugrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">True darkpaw thnx for bring that to my attention. I havent been following the spells like i used to cause i cant, im trying to just enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
But i still stand by my post that they are making the wrong spells ancient. Give us the canni as a drop and make a new DoT for us. Make a ancient malos and give us the healing upgrade. These abilities are too critical to our class to make ancient when you talking about making them better in anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Crippling Spasm needs a -ATK component to it.  Druids get a debuff that does:<br />
<br />
3:  Decrease AC by 19 <br />
4:  Decrease ATK by 130 <br />
7:  Decrease Fire Resist by 72 <br />
<br />
Decreasing a mobs ATK by 130 is FAR better than our new &quot;cripple&quot; spell which effectively does nothing.<br />
<br />
Add -150 ATK to Crippling Spasm and we have a debuff that might actually be worth casting, because I sure haven't used Cripple in ages, it does nothing.<br />
<br />

<br />
1:  Decrease AC by 19 <br />
5:  Decrease ATK by 105 <br />
<br />
Why are druids getting debuffs like this when shaman aren't?  WE are supposed to be the debuff kings, not druids.  These should be OUR spells, not theirs.  They already get better HP buffs (with a mana component) and better heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I guess they want to make sure people playing Druids are kept happy :) And also with Shaman numbers dropping, someones got to pick up the slack in the debuffing department :p<br />
<br />
Seriously though, we have more serious problems than just our debuffs... I have zero confidence that SOE will do anything to set our class apart, they'll just continue to blur the lines between the classes until utility classes (Whose strength is the ability to do a little of everything) no longer have any real use at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People don't pay attention do they?<br />
Druids have had attack debuffs.     for Ages. <br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1436&amp;source=Test  at level 44<br />
for example.  They have one at 56.  And 62.<br />
<br />
It doesn't do as much as slow does in debuffing.  But usually more than cripple EXCEPT please don't say cripple is useless.  If you have a mob with Flurries or Procs.  Cripple noticibly reduces these.  In fact, I wouldnt be suprised that the Neg Dex reduces more DPS from Procs/Flurries than Neg Attack does.   At very least, the spike damage reduction makes healing much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All in all, I like what I'm seeing with this round of changes on our spells.   Compared to first go around, these offer promise of value for the 66 plus lvl Shaman for their group or raid.   At the very least, they allow the 3rd and 4th Shaman's on raids something to cast while waiting on Champion to reset (6.5 default duration is the devil).<br />
<br />
I expect to see a upgraded Malos type spell, which could be what Pure Spirit (Unpure Spirit) ends up.  Vindictive Spirit could end up as a upgraded version of Tigir's Insects.  Something like a targeted AE 60% Attack Decrease, Disease Counter of 24, and Hate reduction of 300.<br />
<br />
And it would be cool to have some sort of Proc spell for our pet(s).   Something akin to BST's lvl 39 Scorpion Strike which adds a 92 poison proc along with a hate decrease of 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hopefully that new pet would be one of the GoD spam pets, with the poison proc. But I hope it duel wields, however unlikely that is hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I hope they do not change Vindivctive Spirit to a Targeted AE, As a PBAOE it will hit as many mobs as are in its range, and not hit the caster, with its current range of 100 (which I doubt it will keep) that could be a LOT of mobs. This will be very handy on Trial type raids in which killing a mob spawns many adds (like the P1 trials in Time)</div></div><hr />

Jaradis, you are totally right, and what is amusing is that on mobs that mitigate slows heavily, druids already reduce damage more using hand of ro/ro's illumination than shamans do.<br />
<br />
Funny huh?  Shamans deserve to slow a level 'above' what other classes mitigate down too.</div></div><hr />

I think its time, though, to put the Shaman class back on the &quot;King of Debuffing&quot; map by ADDING a -attack component to the Cripple upgrade. Our &quot;cripple&quot; line SHOULD be much better than the druid one, period. Much, much, much better. Adding -attack to it would do the trick, eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see anything bad in this wave of changes.  Perhaps they are listening after all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just dont like bad arguements.  You can't compare Ro Debuffs Vs Cripple and say well that means shaman are not clear kings of debuffing, and totally ignore Slow.   Slow (even mitigiated) + cripple are way more than any druid debuffs.  Heck slow alone does more than both the neg attack spells together.<br />
<br />
I'm not against a cripple upgrade, or adding neg attack to it ((long as its not on same slot as the others, so it stacks))  but don't argue it based on another class, especially by selectively ignoring stuff.<br />
<br />
Here's a better arguement:<br />
Shaman 75 Slow Chanter 70 Bst 65  is a 5/10 advantage for Shm<br />
but with slow mitigation that advantage has shrunk to 1-5.  <br />
<br />
Some Negative Attk debuff to Shaman specifically, and not to bst/chts<br />
would help restore some of that gap.</div></div><hr />
