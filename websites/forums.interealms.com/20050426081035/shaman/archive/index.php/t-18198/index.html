<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi There<br />
<br />
I was wondering were people are getting the best AA for Time XP.<br />
<br />
Takes about 2 to 3 LDON's to get an AA.<br />
Agro Kite in HoH is pretty Fast.<br />
Upper Sand in BOT is constant stable AA.<br />
Frogs in PoS are easy if you can avoid the druid chain casters.<br />
<br />
What is the Experience the rest of you have?<br />
Please list both grp and solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for solo.. well, I never solo ;) I'll always 2 box<br />
<br />
For group, my favorite is bot with a druid and chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you 2box? I have a cleric bot that I enjoy, but wondering what would be more efficient - I'm sure some sort of DPS.  Often toyed with the idea of an SK, but 1-65 (again) just seems like way more work then I'm willing to dump into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont 2 box as i only have one account.<br />
and to be honest i like the challance of a solo or the company of a grp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and to be honest i like the challance of a solo or the company of a grp.<br />
<br />
Just need to take on bigger challenges with 2-box, and I 2-box in a group with friends quite often.  Don't quite see your point.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Duo is only possible with 2 accounts and 2 pc's.<br />
Unfortunately i dont have either so still would like some idea's on where people Grind aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bot is the best i've seen, places like inner south (huge room at the southern most part of the zone, not sure what its called on other servers), where there's tons of room to manOOver with a bard chain pulling mobs super early, like around 30-40%, brings em back and mezzes, giving me time to malo and slow them before the group even takes a swing at it.</div></div><hr />
