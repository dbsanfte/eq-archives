<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mods: If you don't mind, and if you agree with the idea, could you please put up a little sticky in the Buy/Sell/Trade forum that says something like &quot;Please include your server name in your subject&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing big, but it'd help.  I dislike clicking into threads that are pointless for me to read.<br />
<br />
Also, thought this might be a gentle reminder to all that read this that we have that forum and that's it sorely underused atm.  This board is amazing at helping fellow shaman out with information and ideas, and I'm sure we could develop a greater trading section that can be just as helpful to those looking for or selling items...and probably for better deals than other classes will sell to you for since we all know and share the pain of our spell prices, etc. :)<br />
<br />
So if you're looking for certain items / spells, take a minute to post and maybe you'll get lucky.  Link to the Buy/Sell/Trade section (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?forumid=8) <br />
<br />
This could be a good way to help each other out on our crazy spell prices when possible and if we're successful enough at this level, it should bring down prices in general as less shaman will be buying from the insanely priced buyers of other classes.  I know that I'd sell some of my stuff cheaper to a fellow shaman than what the current market is dictating, but with the bazaar you have no way of restricting certain classes to buying your items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought. :)<br />
