<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was before and during a sontalak kill, mostly because we had nothing else better to do.  While i was helping to buff i was complaining on our shaman chat channel about the rarity of even the words for malo/topor.  Anyways we charge sont, and he drops like a hot potatoe.  20 seconds later i notice what was being looted, next thing i see is &quot;soandso has looted spell: malo&quot;.  When i saw that i almost fell out of my chair, and after checking with the other shaman to see if they had it, and politely asking after we were TL to our bind point for it, I am now the recipent of this rarer than hell shaman spell and needless to say I am one happy shammy!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sonta is a great place for our spells.  As is Klandi.  However, many people can't get enough to do these dragons well and so their spawns stay up a long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We have so many guilds doing different things on RN, Ascent in doing PoTime and Iron Legends doing Befallen, and everything in beween. An old server and overpopulated, even velious mobs are hotly contested. <br />
<br />
You average moss snake has a longer and happier lifespan than Sont or Klandi. But keep up on the spawn and you have a chance. I got torpor at 64 (one month before getting 65 and Q arrgh) from a rogue GWurm roaming around near th zonewall between OT and Cleric Hill. One lucky bastard I was, I was headed to VP for yet another round of spellhunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You sure that klandicar drops kunark spells?  My guild has killed him over 20 times and I don't think we've ever gotten one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got both Malo and Torpor from Sontalak kills, so, yes, I am rather positive that he drops Kunark spells.<br />
<br />
It may be a relatively recent addition, though.  Both of mine were in the past 4-6 months.<br />
<br />
::Edit:: Bah reading comprehension is shot.  I can't speak for Klandicar, but I can look it up on my guild board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Klandicar definitely drops Kunark spells, but we never got any Kunark shaman spells off him.  In my experience, he dropped a lot of enchanter/mage spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah guild doesn't track Kunark spells that closely any more.  Greater Vocaration - Air, Water did drop from Klandicar a while back, are those Kunark spells or not?</div></div><hr />
