<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok im a 41 shaman on AB which as most people know is a fairly empty server. i need somwhere to hunt. from 27 i hunted in groups in dawnshroud going on to solo at 36 zeleks and wolves then moving onto solo the tribal gatherers etc outside me. all i did was pull with slow any wandering tribals. pul into tunnel sik pet. dot and med. was the best exp ive ever made! like 2 blue dots per kill and they went down fast with kei i was invincible and pet hardly needed healing if you slow the tribal. <br />
<br />
But those days are gone and i am now stuck for ideas on where ti hunt. ive looked at most posts and still am wondering. i need to solo really because grouping is too much hassel and normally there are no people to group with. i tried COM but the 2 front spirits were a bit hard for me handel and left me with very little hp and mana. any other ideas would be great. im thinkin DL but would they be too hard for me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">North shore of Eastern Wastes, Ulkthorks rhinos and walruses till 43-44</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Echo Caverns is great exp till 50, and you are one zone from town and Nexus for kei. Best exp in the game for 40 to 50 solo IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My personal Favorite is Tembious Mountains at the Grimling Caves.  Made mad exp killing them you either get 1 or two on a pull untill you can split them but they are simply puch overs for use with slow and our pets.  Best thing is they also drop Acrylia Ore and Windstones.  Both of those sale quite nicely in the bazaar.  They also drop lots of Etched runes that are vendor trash but some those sale quite well as well band they all stack and weight hardly anything.  I started going to those caves at level 39 I personlly dont think I have all that good of gear as I just bought items to fill my slots that were under 100pp each so most any shaman should be able to do well here.  Currently lvl 46 and they are all light blue except for the foreman but the cash has been so good I have not moved on to better hunting grounds as I want to puchase my JBB.  And if I dont find a better place I might stay long enough to get one them nnew fangled lizards.  Hehehe love the look of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally did Crystal Caverns from 39-46.  Here's how it went:<br />
<br />
39-40:  Orcs - by the time I hit 41 I had enough faction to sell to the Dwarfs there.  Really nice to hunt, sell and bank in the same zone.  Plus the named orcs drop nice items.  Cyrstal covered shroud, herbalists pack, crystalline belt, frozen 1hs &amp; 2hs (nice vendor loot), plenty of velium bricks/blocks.<br />
<br />
41-46:  Equally split between Terrors/Geos.  When geos were open I'd camp them.  Non-aggro until you kill tons of them (still dubious at 47 after 3 levels of killing).  They drop normal gems and the named geos drop chipped gems that sell for 15-180pp.  Normally drop 1-4pp per mob as well, super awesome loot.<br />
<br />
When the geos were taken I'd camp the 6 terrors in the great hall/broken bridge area.  4 spawns around the broken bridge, single pull, dark blue until 46 (then some dk blue, lt blue and green).  I'd pull with slow, melee and send pet.  Once those 4 were dead, I'd take the 2 in the great hall.  Again single pull with slow, melee, send pet.  The terrors drop decent loot.  pp, some gems, crystal fibers (which are lore so pet would always get one).<br />
<br />
For buffs I'd just use haste, regen, bearform, fury, ac.  Pet would only get haste.  <br />
<br />
Was a great zone for those levels, especially if you play at off times and like to solo.  For variety, throw in some crystal spiders and get plenty of crystalline silk.  It sells very well in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Echo is great for your level.  My advise would be to do Underbulks and Fungal Fiends until about lvl43-44.  The Stonegrabbers are great exp, but you wont be able to slow/dot/dot/sick dogdog on them like you will the Underbulks and Fungals (don't think I've had an Underbulk or Fungal resist a slow or dot).<br />
<br />
So, after you hit lvl43-44 and have max'ed your defense, then I'd say pull the Stonegrabbers with Slow and tank it &quot;in teh face&quot;.  It'll take you and dogdog a while to wear it down, but you'll get it.<br />
<br />
Also, watch out for Trillicor (named Fungal Fiend - has a stun/whirl dot - kinda like Clockwork Poison if you've ever tried to kill the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk) and Fireclaw (named Underbulk - hits hard and fast and if it's got the Fireclaw Talons he'll be procing out the wazou!!).  Never been able to stick a dot on Trillicor either.<br />

Read my post about soloing the Taskmaster Room a few posts down for information on killing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>saco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CC is a great place to hunt!!!! i just lvled 45...along with 1500pp in loot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i just dinged 41 myself...last 6 levels in DL. i started when i dinged 36, duod with a 45 or so bst for about 6 hours over 3 nights. made it half into 39, so 3 1/2 levels there, pretty nice xp. loot sucks, get an occasional peridot or other gem. it was nonstop pulling though, but even soloing the last few nights, single pulling a bit slower, i made it 2 and a half levels. keep in mind i always had kei (without it, my guess is it would be kinda hard here), and either temperance or virtue. temperance is enough, i can get that for 15 or free if you provide the peridot, while virtue, since it has to be mgb or group because of level, is way pricier (about 75-100 on my server), so i wouldnt bother with it. word of advice though-watch out even with invis on, i got too close to a red on my way to camp, then got an add, and got wiped out - of course just after i paid for kei and temperance lol (also my dumb ass for only having buffs and such memmed for when i got to camp to save a few seconds - ill never do that again :) )</div></div><hr />
