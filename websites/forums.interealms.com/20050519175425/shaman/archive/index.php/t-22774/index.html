&quot;Damage mitigation is a large part of what got Shaman into the mess they are in now. If what they really wanted to do was roll back mob damage, they could simply roll Slow mitigation levels back. Why create more variables in the balance equation by adding a different form of damage mitigation?&quot;<br />
<br />
You were addressing another issue and I don't want to say what your position is but damage mitigation is the essence of what the Shaman class has always been.  We are losing that ability because of stat caps, short fights, resisted/mitigated/slow casting malos/slow, and poor healing.<br />
<br />
If SoE will not commit to keeping us #1 at this then it is time for them to let us convert our shaman into another class and give FA, malos, and Fo7 to some other class.  If we want to slow and do dps we should be able to convert to BSTs, if we want to heal let us convert to clerics.  If we want to PL alts then we can keep our shaman.<br />
<br />
In your statement you forget that the devs could set the damage high enough that it requires mitigation and therefore requires a shaman, beast, or chanter.  They don't need to mitigate what we can do or make it so slow casting that it's useless.  When they do that they are merely writing us out of Norrath.<br />
<br />
[edit:  No I really am not suggesting an exchange of characters.  Just trying to point out that the essential characteristic of the class is and needs to continue to be damage mitigation.  Think of clerics not being able to heal enough, or warriors not being able to take the damage and hold agro, or the infamous Luclin snafu where a slow actually had the chance of hasting a mob.  Heals and dps are truly needed but can not replace the essential core function of the class without turning us into something other than what many of us have played and enjoyed for years.]</div></div><hr />

Thats not entirely true. Sure they could do it game mechanics wise but it wouldn't really work well in actual implimentation. Why? Simply because the dps before being slowed would end up being too high to survive. A mob doing 1k dps slowed might be challenging to a group and thats fine if the mob is doing 1300 dps unslowed because they get 25% slowed. The same mob would have to do 4k dps unslowed to do 1k dps fully slowed and would either have to hit rediculously hard or fast to do that. Either way the mob would be nearly untankable untill slowed. Assuming a standard 3 second delay the mob would be hitting for 12k around or quadding for about 4k a peice. Thats tougher than elemental boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Simply put high dps mobs can not be fully slowable and be viable in the game. With the latest expansions tending towards high dps low hp mobs for short but intense fights that means that slow mitigation is almost a requirement. The problem really is the exact same situation as our healing issues. In the way the game is setup today the difference between a fully slowed mob and an unslowed mob is too large for us to be viable at both ends. Either we're way over powered on fully slowable mobs or completely underpowered on slow immune mobs. The only way to fix this situation is to decrease the effectiveness of slow, IE slow mitigation, so the different ends are closer together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are right Taraddar and I did not mean no mitigation at all.  The amount of mitigation and our ability to mitigate it needs to be changed to make us viable in the higher level zones.  I never understood the reason for every 65 BST having a slow that's equivalent to Balance of the Nihil but only a few shaman are able to get it.  If shaman are not the best at slowing (mitigation) then SoE has changed the class from what is was prior to the high end zones and should give us a choice to change our toons.</div></div><hr />
