<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can somebody else confirm that Mortal Deftness (L58 Dex) stacks with HoS but does not stack with FoS?  This being the case I'm assuming that the HoS/MD combo is still broken(thus stacking) but the FoS/MD combo is working as intended(not stacking)?<br />
<br />
As a result, I'm thinking of bagging the FoS buff and going with IoS &amp; Talisman of Kragg.  I know it takes an extra spell slot but an extra 45 stamina and 55 dex is worth the minor loss to strength (alrdy maxed) and loss of 25 direct hitpoints which is more than made up with the extra stamina.<br />
<br />
P.S. The extra 55 dex helps my Pile Driver proc that much more.  Anyway, something to think about.<br />
<br />
For now on, IoS &amp; Tal of Kragg for moi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">infusion wont stack with focus.  i never use infusion for anyone but clerics do to the extra spell slot and my own lazyness.<br />
use it self buffed if your getting better results from the stats it gives you...nothing is to good for you when you self buff.<br />
i don't have nd3 yet but i heard krag+infusion&gt;soul for hp if your stamina is not capped...just what i have heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kragg + Infusion give you a 110 extra hps and 55 extra dex , compared to FoS, which is nice if you are using procing weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is true.  But I need the added benefit of the standalone dex buff to be able to max my dex to 255.  My base dex + gear dex is low.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm that MD stacks with HoS but not FoSpirit or FoSoul.  I suspect Sony may have just accepted this state of affairs, based upon the fancy new stacking rules you can see in Lucy for these spells.  The rules seem structured to prevent HoS from overwriting a &quot;better&quot; dex or &quot;better&quot; str buff, by stacking with them.  But one you move up to FoSpirit, the single target dex is no longer better, only the single target str, so only the str stacks with FoSpirit.  Then when you move up to Focus of Soul at 62, neither the str or the dex buffs are stackable.</div></div><hr />
