<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all , <br />
    <br />
     Finally was able to get Q today. My happy dance almost got my paladin killed heh but why brell gave him rez! My question is after Q whats is next in importance for my situation? I dont raid right now and by the time i do I'll have Focus of the 7th so i put that on bottom of list. Malos is that important? I have malo and malosinia isnt super expensive right now so i can buy it and put malos down lower. So i guess it comes down to Blood or Ferine Avatar. I do two box alot , full group some and solo here and there when i dont feel like running two so kinda wondering since i dont have cash to buy both spells some suggestions on next spell to buy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given you don't raid atm and already have Malo........<br />
<br />
If you two box a melee and don't have primal/feral avatar or a primal weap on your melee then get Ferine Avatar.<br />
Also if you are grouping you can happily keep 4 to 5 melee Ferine Avatar'd the whole time. God know how much DPS that adds!<br />
(Unlike the other avatars, Ferine has a ONE MIN recast rather than THREE).<br />
If you have enough AA/8th Shawl/etc you can keep more people Ferine Avatar'd (I do 6 on a raid normally).<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryn is pretty awesome when soloing OR duoing (if you tank).<br />
<br />
When soloing it wont break root (particularly handy when combined with 4-minute root + Ulthor).<br />
<br />
I have to admit I cast Ferine Avatar ALOT more than I cast Blood of Saryn...... but then I dont solo that much and duo a lot less than I used too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Zhorn was the kind of info i was looking for :) . Was kidna leaning toward ferine since my paladin doesnt have primal of any sort and i just have the regular avatar. One spot i can be lacking is dps when not casting. Quicker recast on ferine sounds cool too when i do full group with some friends. Again thanks for replying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I say, get bood of saryrn, (if you really solo for xp from time to time), and after blood get ferine avatar.<br />
<br />
Blood is -THE- dot to solo pop stuff, its dps is huge. Ultor is nice, but compared to Blood the dps is low, and other poison dots break root.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I raid I keep ferine avatar memed. I keep Blood and Avatar memed when I exp. If you 2 box a pally you might want to get ferine avatar first. <br />
Your in a win win spot. Youll like what ever spell you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tossup on those 2, go for whichever is cheaper or you find first probably.  Blood is some great damage, and if you ever want to solo in PoP, you're probably going to want it.  Ferine is a great dps boost for melees.  You'll be happy with either one, I'd go with the cheapest first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you duo mostly (ie: more than you group or raid) then i'd rate blood&gt;ferine, blood is about 55DPS alone and your paladin should grab aggro straight back after you cast.<br />
<br />
I do all my aaxp in Tier3 65 guild groups, usually melee heavy, so ferine adds a big chunk of DPS when spread over 3-4 melees. <br />
<br />
I don't usually use blood unless I'm in a DPS-lite group, I prefer just to use tears of sayrn/velium strike for good sub-30 second DPS.</div></div><hr />
