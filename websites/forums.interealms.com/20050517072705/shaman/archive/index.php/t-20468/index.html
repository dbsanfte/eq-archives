I believe talking to yourself in an empty (chat) room is grounds for insanity. :)</div></div><hr />

What kind of hammer are you thinking of using?</div></div><hr />

Well, a PoTime hammer of course. Anything else would be gimp  :D .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well.. i might have to agree that getting a channel for the elder shaman have been talked about for a while, it's usually something talked about in tells to people and something that wasn't going to be made public.  Why?  Well, it's not so much about proving your knowledge of the game, it's about proving that you aren't going to be doing the stupid thing that some kids do and spam the channels.  You are invited to the channel based on trust, and it's owned by someone that can take away your privledges if you so deserve it.  It has nothing to do with being an elistist.<br />
<br />
I agree that the message to others prob wasn't presented in the best way possible.  I myself will prob join it from time to time just to bull**** a little bit, but without a way of regulating the channel, prob won't keep with it.<br />
<br />
And if you think that I'm an elistist for saying this, you obviously haven't been in the channel when some idiot spams the crucible with the same message 100x in a row for no reason other than for his amusement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Considering that most of the people you are trying to avoid in the crucible channel probably lurk on this board from time to time, why advertise here? If somebody isn't mature enough to behave in that channel in the first place what makes you think they won't /join this channel specifically to annoy you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I do believe in theory the idea of a channel exclusivley for Shamans who are time flagged <br />
<br />
Warbear didn't say Time flagged, he said Time equipped.<br />
<br />
So do I get to join?  I just got a bracer from the Tier 1 trials.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait.  I'm still wearing a Vindi BP.  Oh well, it was worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm time flagged and wearing a vindi.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.  Unless you picked up an aten bp there really aren't any other options until you hit time.  <br />

Just checked my guild records and I won mine on 12/09/2002.  I'm fully planning on wearing it into retirement unless a time mold is rotting.</div></div><hr />

Still wouldn't mind having a Vindi bagged for resists, though.<br />
<br />
Oh, sorry - you said /hijack off. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">yeah because everyone knows that once you get a magical time flag all your spells change and playing a shaman is completely different.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly true, there are a couple other options as listed above and this one that I have now.  I wore my Vindi for a LONG time, got mine on 7/03/2001.  Upgraded to this on 4/30/2003:<br />

Sure, Time BP is better, but when I looted this BP no one had even found a Time BP yet.  As it is now, I'm not even looking to upgrade to a Time BP.   This is my next choice:<br />
