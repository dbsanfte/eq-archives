<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tikothepally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone else see a problem with this? Currently on Aro<br />
<br />
<br />
Torpor 60k<br />
Malo    60k<br />
Primal Avatar (never seen it)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quie- 45k<br />
MAlos- 45k<br />
Ferine- 15k<br />
<br />
<br />
The shaman is currently @ level 57 and climbing, and I don't plan on getting torpor or Malo. Might as well just push to 65 and get the good spells cheaper, rather than buying the old ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is just related to my server let me know, but Its rather annoying IMO. I think level 60 and lower spells should be purchaseable now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Supply and demand. Just be glad you have more options now then when alot of other people leveled up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not that the older spells are more expensive, it's that the older spells weren't cheap when they were new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morrighan Dreamwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm on A Ro as well, and as far as I can tell, the major reason Malo and Topor are still so expensive is two reasons:<br />
Oldtook &amp;<br />
Powahsorce (or however he spells it)<br />
<br />
Oldtook has been selling Malo for the same price for the better part of 3 to 4 months. <br />
<br />
I'm nearly to the point of of reactivating my Mage. Mage spells are less than 1/4 than that of Shaman spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/nod<br />
<br />
Those two have a habit of buyin our spells low and jacking up the prices on our server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quellious... <br />
<br />
Malo 60k<br />
Avatar (auctioned as &quot;the rarest spell in the game&quot; no lie) 40k<br />
<br />
<br />
Malos 30k...<br />
Ferine Avatar 15 to 20k...<br />
<br />
/boggle <br />
<br />
(not sure on the rest of the spells, only spell I actively search for is Malo)<br />
<br />
Simply amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow....I guess we are behind on Sol Ro =P<br />

Torpor 100k<br />
<br />
Malos (never seen for sell.....ever)<br />
Ferine Avatar 30k<br />
Q ~150k<br />
<br />
Maybe I should put in for a server change since my luck with runes hasn't been very good lately =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess this is the only area where Tunare is economically superior to other servers. Malo going price has been downed to about 25K (not malos, and no I am not kidding). Torpor I haven't seen for months so I dunno where that one stands. Probably still at 60K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah this is definitely stupid.. especially after these spells are researchable (even if it's not easy to do so).<br />
<br />
Want to buy a malo but not for 60k (malos 45k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still grinning got malo last night for 28k on Terris-Thule, now just got to get Pox n Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Q is going for 6K on my server just now.  I'm only level 58 but I'm already thinking I should just buy it as an insurance policy.  In fact, I may have to head home at lunchtime just in case !</div></div><hr />

Torpor 70K-80K<br />

AB really sucks. I am going to move to a cheaper server, maybe Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Saryrn<br />
<br />
Malo - ~40k<br />
Torpor - ~50k<br />
<br />
<br />
Quiesc - 50k<br />
Malos - 40k<br />
Focus of 7 - 40k<br />
ferine avatar - 30k<br />
Blood of saryrn - 40k<br />
<br />
i paid for both torpor and malo at 60.. so add that up<br />
<br />
90k for malo/torpor.. 200k for the 65 spells.<br />
<br />
290k not counting the lvl63/64 spells that on saryrn none sell for under 10-15k.<br />
<br />
for me to have a full spellbook will prolly cost 500k<br />
<br />
ya im a little more then pissed at spell prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh you guys have some low prices. Malos is 65k on Veeshan. I bought FA for 35k. Q is 80k I think. Fo7th is 140k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You all are so lucky.<br />
<br />
Drinal:<br />
Malo and Torpor 80kpp+, usually 100kpp.<br />
<br />
Quiescence is about the only other one I have seen for sale and it was 95kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">shaman 59 and 60 spells are a lot harder to get then shaman 64 and 65 spells.<br />
<br />
I would expect the disparity to get larger not smaller and the low level PoP spells are getting very cheep as the number of people with full spell books get larger.<br />
<br />
Not long ago I baught the 61 true spirit at about half the normal price (5k instead of 10k)  last night just one person had 4 copies of this great spell for sale at 1800p.<br />
<br />
A long time ago, before the Bazaar and the mana burn nurf,  I baught Malo for 10k and torpor for 17k.  The suply was good and the demand was low.  Things are starting to get better with research on line but it was very bad for a while with no one doing kunark content.<br />
<br />
I would expect the price of 64 and 65 spells to come down faster then the price of malo / torpor. A lot more poeple are interested in elemental planes then in spell reasearch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For once TT doesn't have the worst prices!  <br />
Ferine 15k<br />
Saryrn 20k<br />
quies 55k<br />
Fo7 90k<br />
Malos... /shrug, given to me by a guildie like 3 months ago, haven't been watching that one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Researching isn't going to lower prices - Guilds who are doing the places were Malo / Torpor / Primal research stuff drops ALREADY have those spells. I'd be willing to bet most just loot and destroy the &quot;junk&quot;. <br />
<br />
Never seen Malo or Torpor on Saryrn, though. Malos at 50k, and Q one time at 100k. Some people think they're funny...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you pay the prices you are as guilty as the folks who set the prices.<br />
<br />
And, NO its not strange that 61-65 spells sell for alot less than 58-60 spells. Look how they are obtained. Doesnt that make sense?<br />
<br />
In 6-8 months you'll be wiping your butt with lvl 65 spells.</div></div><hr />
