<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scratches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gday,<br />
<br />
Scratches is a baby Vah Shir Shaman, just recently gaining his 10th season.  He is a new stable-mate (read - &quot;alt&quot;) for a slowly progressing rogue in her 56th season.  Scratches calls the CT server home.<br />
<br />
I went with Shaman as I have discovered that I am abysmal at running other casters, failed at Chanter, Necro and Wiz, and Bards seemed to much work.  Plus I like to chat abit while in a group, so all that twisting was going to cramp my social activites :)<br />
<br />
Now that I have gotten over the first 10 levels, I was hoping for a basic run down of the shammy's role in life. I like to group, and am in a social guild. So what is Scratches going to be expected to do?  <br />
<br />
He isn't really a twink, but has been gifted a handful of midlevel items, some with stats some with resists. I havent actually gotten round to making a magelo for him yet *adds note to to-do list*.<br />
<br />
Having read through afew threads here, I have one specific question, not that I will be needing to worry about it for awhile but I just want to know ... regarding the pets and giving them weapons, if the pet dies or when you zone and pet goes poof , do you get the wep back? or does it poof? you would seem pretty darn brave giving it expensive weapons only to lose them that often.<br />
<br />
So, please inspire this fledgling shaman, he is eager to grow into a strong successful kitty.<br />

<br />
Welcome to the shaman life.<br />
<br />
The weapons you give your pet (and anything else you have given your pet) poofs if the pet dies or you zone.<br />
If you search, you will find a thread that tells you where you can find/buy very cheap weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion Scratches, the best thing a shaman can do in their early years is cultivate good relations with several magicians =)  With their summoning ability of items for your pet, and to increase your damage output, they will be one of your biggest assets.  Learn what their summoned items do, so you can utilize them!!<br />
<br />
Also in my opinion, take time every few levels to raise your casting skills to the maximum level, it is very frustrating to have fizzle after fizzle chewing away at your mana pool.<br />

<br />
Make sure you keep your DEFENSE skill max'd for your level.  This is a huge AC hit for you if the gap gets too big, and gets harder to keep up over time.  Also keep your 1hb,2hb, and piercing max'd for your level.  Weapon skills aren't crucial, but you will want to try hitting (you'll miss alot) stuff every now and then.  Don't forget to spend a little time each level to keep your divination &amp; evocation up to par.<br />
<br />
Dogdog weapons always poof, whether the dog lives or dies.  Think of them like arrows or throwing knives for shaman. :D <br />
<br />
I don't think shaman is a good class for someone who wants extra time to chat.  In good groups, we're normally pretty busy (though bards are busier).  I would think wizards would be a better class for non-keyboard intensive playing.<br />
<br />
Regardless, welcome to the community.  :cool:  We have a wealth of information on these boards, though some of it is buried quite deep.  ;)   Keep using the search feature to try to find the answers, as most questions are common and can easily be found if you look.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Happy leveling,</div></div><hr />

Not meaning to burst your bubble or anything, but a shaman is probably the closest caster there is to a bard as far as constantly doing something and lacking time to socialize.  Between Cannibalize, slowing, healing, debuffing, buffing, Nuke/DoTs, a shaman is one of the busiest casters in a group if not the busiest.  A Wiz or Necro is a LOT less work than a shaman (to play one well, that is) <br />
<br />
Just a heads up. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Welcome to club shaman, now go find a baby seal and club him too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
JUST KIDDING.  <br />
<br />
But seriously, reroll as a respectable ogre or troll, there are enough kity kats running around when they jack up the proverbial hairball norrath will collapse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings and welcome .<br />
<br />
Rule #1 HP/Sta &gt; Mana/wis<br />
Rule #2 Dont neglect Melee/Deffencive Skills .<br />
Rule #3 Barbs &gt; Troll/Ogers ... Except Uggok of the Dawntreaders from TT hes the exception too the rule .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I disagree with you on number one Grimbrear.  Untill level 24 and Cannibalize, Mana/wis is just as important as hp to a young shaman.  Untill 24 a shamans mana pool is limited to wis and +mana items, so untill then it makes no sense (to me, anyway) to gimp your mana pool into being too small.  AFter 24, HP and sta become much more important.<br />
<br />
I will concur with Frekkels; Shaman are always casting something.  Because of the high mana costs on our spells many shaman find themselves cannibalizing most of the time they are not casting debuffs/dots/buffs on other characters/npc's.  I have lost count of the times that I have been told &quot; You are a good shaman but you need to talk more&quot;, or &quot; You are too quiet&quot;.  If its a busy night, the only social interaction I have with a group is asking for a buff refresh or the canned responses that I have hotkeyed (&quot;Malo/Slow on %t&quot;. &quot;Haste fix&quot;, rooted, blah blah blah)<br />
<br />
Thats one of the reasons that I find other classes to be a bit boring; I've gotten so used to the pace of the shaman that trying to slow that down to a nuke or two or hitting auto attack is WAY too dull.  That and the mana regen.  Cant live without Canni....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Welcome Scratches.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy playing the shaman class, I sure as hell do.  What Sciek says is bang on though, I'm always casting.  Sometimes when chatting in combat my group/guild/tell spam looks like this &quot;I can't believe they 222222222222222222222&quot; ... &quot;crap&quot;.  The 2 key is my cannibalization key and I press it sometimes 10 times during a fight (over a 60-90 second period) when things get really hairy.  This tends to interupt any conversation and has really put a cramp in my cyber.  That said, since I got Cann5 (AA based massive cannibalisation) a while back and since most of my spells take forever to cast, I have been able to get a little more chat in.  Still, I find myself scanning spell message text, group health, group messages and scanning the screen for new adds that it's hard to focus on the social text.  It's a demanding class that requires you to stick to it.  You won't see the hectic mana regen and casting till you are level 39+ and it won't really hit home till you are well into your 50's.<br />
