<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was quite disappointed to learn I was KOS by all the new trolls.  My faction with the old broken skull clan mobs (i.e. Lyguna) was indifferent the last I checked.  And from what I heard from the people camping the guards in Gunthak, they have no faction hits anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyone figure out a way to raise this faction?  I only explored a bit of Gunthak, and the entrance of Nadox(worst pathing I've seen in a while, BTW).  I wonder if they just forgot to put faction in yet.  I was hoping for a new troll town, with some new quests and such.  It will be a major let if they are just fodder to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So even trolls be KOS ta da new trolls?  Bah, first we get shafted outta our home, den we ain't given a new one (me dinna count Neriak as a new home)!<br />
<br />
Grrr</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
of course your KOS  they are an enemy clan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, me read da story thru and while at first it seems like we hates eachudda, dat wozna clear by da end.  Me cudna bring meself ta read it thru again, and try ta figure it out, coz EQ's writers use bad grammar in a vain attempt ta sound grandiose but end up just obscuring da meaning.  If it weren't fer dis, me'd have unnerstood it first read thru.</div></div><hr />

<br />
blah blha  blah homosexual god makes green slimy toads. Blesses them with gayness then the gay empowered frogs rape grobb. Some rock is stolen and now they got gay pride posters all over what used to be a great city.<br />
<br />
Sigh....*kneels* God PLEASE make them release World of Warcraft faster. I swear I'll never make another baby jesus joke.<br />

Look out folks we gave them the idea of a freeport takeover now they will make a new expansion. &quot;Evil dawn&quot; where freeport falls and u get 1 new spell and they will use the search feature on all class message boards to find out what we have been askign for for the past 4 years and give us a little bit of that so we buy that too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">troll scratches head.....so we gets new zones, new mobs and new loot to grab and all you wants to do is make friends wid em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why shouldn't I want to join up with Broken Skull Clan?  Grobb clan is obviously on the decline, first losing the stone to BS clan, then losing their city to a bunch of frogs.  If a dwarf paladin can prove himself loyal to the Iksar, a Grobb troll should be able to prove himself to the Broken Skull clan.<br />
<br />
But this isn't gonna happen.  I explored their town a bit more, and from what I saw, it looks more like a town-like dungeon than a real town.  NPC's have generic names, rather than given names.  I didn't notice any vendors either.<br />
<br />
From the story, I thought there would be a uniting of the troll clans.  But it seems that the &quot;story&quot; in Everquest is becoming like the flavor text on a MtG card, it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read the story too... what I got from the story was I should have never been in Grobb since I follow Innoruuk.  Real disappointing.</div></div><hr />
