<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting to collect data on AC and the effects of agi. Hopefully this data will help those who are skilled at number crunching to develop some models.<br />
<br />
Data collection protocol:<br />
All toons used will be warriors. Three different races will be used to establish a base line for the effects seen. All toons will not wear armor to remove that variable from the effects of ac. Toons will be leveled and the AC information collected every 5 levels. At each check 4 agi buffs will be applied and the effects recorded, then 4 debuffs will be applied and those effects also recorded. All melee will be logged as the toons are leveled, on the chance that the combat data will help others with their data collect, if you want copies of the logs feel free to send me a message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to town if you want but we do have an extensive and  fairly complete agi parse already...thanks to the Bst's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd really like to see something comparing the hits I take with ~1800 AC on raids as opposed to say a lesser shaman who might only have 1500 AC and so on. Just curious how much AC is doing at that level for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, but what exactly are you trying to prove?  You are leveling a warrior and buffing it with every agility buff you have to determine what the shown AC number will be?  Is there something I'm missing with why this is needed?<br />
<br />
If you are trying to determine if agility has a (noticeable) affect on avoidance, then you need to have little to no variables other than the amount of agility on said warrior.  Then you need to parse vs the same MOB for around 1000-10,000 hits at each level of agility.<br />
<br />
You aren't going to get the data needed for determining if agility is meaningful just by leveling a new warrior from 1-whenever you get bored leveling the warrior.  Besides this fact, you aren't going to buff the warrior high enough in agility (most likely) to get meaningful results until said warrior is 47+ (hint: 10-30ish agility isn't going to have much, if any, noticeable or parseable difference from base--you need increments of 50-100ish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We know AC has 2 parts Mitigation and avoidance. The tank is not wearing armor so any changes should be avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We know AC has 2 parts Mitigation and avoidance. The tank is not wearing armor so any changes should be avoidance.<br />
<br />
THe problem is: even if you gain 50AC by buffing agility up to 305 and even if you know that its purely avoidance AC, is 50 avoidance AC different from 50 AC from gear/AC buff?<br />
<br />
This leaves you with one option, and that option is to parse 1,000-10,000 hits with a couple different levels of agility.  Otherwise, you are only telling us that 30 agility raised AC a few points and 50 agility raised it a few more and 200 raised it even further.  I can already tell you that you are going to see a gain (or loss) in AC for increases (or decreases) in agility assuming that you increase (or decrease) agility sufficiently to see a change in the AC number.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm pretty sure there is a chart around here somewhere showing how much AC agility adds, but I don't want to search for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be interesting to see if agility added to avoidance, rather than mitigation - I thought the beastlord parse showed it didn't though?</div></div><hr />
