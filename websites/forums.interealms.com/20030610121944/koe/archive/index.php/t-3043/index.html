<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because no matter how legitimate my<br />
         illness, I always sense my boss thinks I am lying. On one occasion, I had a valid reason but<br />
         lied anyway because the truth was too humiliating to reveal.<br />
<br />
         I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to<br />
         coming in the next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on my<br />
         crown.<br />
<br />
         In this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain. The<br />
         accident occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty.<br />
         As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my<br />
         wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
         &quot;Ed!&quot; she hearkened. &quot;The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it.&quot; &quot;You know where the<br />
         button is.&quot; I protested through the shower pitter-patter. &quot;Reset it yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
         &quot;I am scared!&quot; She pleaded. &quot;What if it starts going and sucks me in?&quot; Pause. &quot;C'mon, it'll<br />
         only take a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
         No logical assurance about how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person<br />
         who suffers from &quot;Big-ol-scary-machinephobia,&quot; a condition brought on by watching too<br />
         many Stephen King movies. It is futile to argue or explain. And if a poltergeist did, in fact,<br />
         possess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with that the rest of my<br />
         life. So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about how<br />
         her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who would suffer.<br />
<br />
         I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button. It is the last action I<br />
         remember performing. It struck without warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay,<br />
         it wasn't a hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty,<br />
         clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs. She (&quot;Buttons&quot; aka<br />
         &quot;the Grater&quot;) had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait under<br />
         the sink. At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly<br />
         offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws.<br />
<br />
         Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to their masculine region,<br />
         they lose all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves<br />
         compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not<br />
         even a well trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a<br />
         kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild animals are sometimes<br />
         faced with a &quot;fight or flight&quot; syndrome; men, in this predicament, choose only the &quot;flight&quot;<br />
         option.<br />
<br />
         Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed. It was a<br />
         dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never made it that far. The<br />
         sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold. When I<br />
         awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife,<br />
         the paramedics snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical<br />
         laughter.<br />
<br />
         My wife told me I should be flattered. At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation<br />
         out of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk.<br />
<br />
         &quot;What's the matter, cat got your tongue?&quot; If they had only known.</div></div><hr />
