<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has any shaman, or shaman duo managed to break fear?  After an insanely easy kill with yeldema, i have been looking for new challenges when my eye caught the fear portal when i wandered by there recently.  My original plan was to buff fully up, then zone in invis and hope that no shiverbacks or spiders see my invis.  I would then head to <br />
western wall and kill what i can, gating if i get too many adds.  My friends and guildmates think im nuts for trying this, and my question is are they right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do not underestimate Fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's been on my list of things to do, but the risk is pretty steep.  If you screw up and get a corpse in there with a near-full pop near west wall, it may take hours to get it back out.  It'd be a blast to do, but I don't know if it's worth the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'd give it a try, and gate if you get to much, but remember fear, unlike hate has a HUGE aggro range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've tried it 3 times solo. The last time was 6 or 7 months ago. I died twice and gated the other.<br />
<br />
The most mobs I was able to kill in any attempt was 4. The biggest problem was parking the adds without getting agro from new mobs. The agro range is pretty wide there. <br />
<br />
Once I finish all my defensive AA's, I may go back and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fear has one mechanism that can randomly screw you anytime you try it: scarelings. Regardless of how wal you're CC'ng your camp and controling aggro, you're always one shadowstep proc from a massive train.<br />
<br />
Plus, honestly, at 65, it's all light blues with 20K+ HP. Not interresting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fear was aptly named. I was never scared of a gof Fear run, but man...I RESPECTED it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmm ... <br />
<br />
I guess that the reason it's so easy for necros here is because of FD on the break..<br />
<br />
If you can get someone to kite the mobs around for you so you can zone in and run to the fire wall safe area and camp, then they gate out you log back in.... that should work well.<br />
<br />
I cleared fear the first time solo at 60..<br />
<br />
I went back later at 65, and the 61+ pets tank so well it's not even a challenge.. so i left..<br />
<br />
sounds impressive, but really isnt... necros are build for that style of fighting.<br />
<br />
I'm no sure how well a shaman would do there.<br />
