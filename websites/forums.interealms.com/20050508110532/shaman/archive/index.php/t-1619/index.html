<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious as to what sneak does for you.  Ya I know how it works, what i'm really getting at is do you actually use it?<br />
<br />
Example: I'm a lvl 45 cat shaman - I soloed and grouped quite a bit in the OT - ya I know the idiot trail ;)  But I never bothered with the braids for fear of capt Rotgrime kicking my butt :)  I know sneak is supposed to make me able to do these types of quests, but I guess I just don't trust the skill enough to just walk into the outpost and start trading with lvl 60 KOS mobs :)<br />
<br />
So the question I'm interested in hearing answers on is what quests have you done that you normally qouldn't be able to do without sneak, and let's hear those horror stories about getting seen, then promptly beaten down into the dirt :)<br />

<br />
some iksar came by and decided to hail mojo jojo in my direction and pounded my furry tail back to kaesora bind spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trick for sneak for those races/classes who have sneak but no FD or hide is staying out of line of sight and hope someone doesnt turn the mob around on ya like they did to kognar. I dont know the set ups of the turn in mobs your talking about but if you have room to invis into the outpost than make sure sneak is on and working position yourself behind the mob because invis will drop when you turn in and as long as nothing else is around to aggro or the mob doesnt turn around should remain indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like it will not help you much in the Outpost, then.  Rottgrime spends his time facing 6 undead marines .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have some high level friends it is possible to do it, but it will take alot of time, and frankly you don't need sneak to do it.<br />
<br />
Have a monk pull Rottgrime outside(sometimes takes 2 monks, tagging pulls), then have rottgrime charmed and hand in whips. Frankly it's not worth the effort, but if you were deadset on it, that would be one way to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
theres a helpful link for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just remember that link is from the rogue perspective of HIDE and sneak. As a shammy you wont have hide but can invis in place of that you will just have to make sure sneak is working before  your invis pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My halfling warrior has sneak, most useful thing about it I've found is being able to buy and sell in places I normally wouldn't be able to, such as Crystal Caverns or the birdy in South Karanas.  Also, can always get the indifferent price if they barely want to sell to me otherwise.</div></div><hr />
