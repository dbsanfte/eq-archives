<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally have my Guildies hunting in Skyfire at a regular basis at the VP entrance to collect shards for our clerics. The first time we killed all the elder wyverns at the entrance and we had 3 GW that popped. Since that day we cannot get a GW to spawn at the entrance. We are able to find 1 or 2 wandering south of the VP entrance each night but they are generally to far to see on track. So we may be missing more of the spawns.<br />
<br />
My question is whats the best tactic to spawn the most gaurdian wurms in the zone. Our casters are loving that they dont have to pay for the level 60 spells :) I just wish Torpor would drop :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GW's have a 24 hour respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GWurms can pop in place of the Elder Wyverns. Don't know if that's true of all the elders in the zone or just the ones in the VP entrance.<br />
<br />
How long did you try? I know it can be pretty random. Keep killing the wyverns maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With Kragg's Mending now available to shamans, might it be possible to solo guardian wurms now?  For a supremely well equipped shaman, that is.<br />
<br />
My impression has been that the problem was that Torpor simply couldn't keep up with a mob than could double for 500s.  But if you've got FT10+, Cann5, Torpor, etc., might you have enough mana to use Kragg's to keep yourself healed when torporing isn't quite enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To be honest, I very much doubt you would be able to channel through a cast of Kraggs.  10 seconds is a hell of a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">answer is no ...  and btw dont take a 60 necro to try and fear kite them ... nec couldnt get fear to land and was quickly sent to bind ... i soon followed .. but i did manage to get it to 40% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They would be tough to solo if at all. They double for 550 max but generally they hit me for less. I would say 30-40% of the hits where 400+ damage with my ac at 1050.<br />
<br />
We had a 55 rogue 60 warrior 55 cleric and me 58 shaman and they are easy kills.<br />
<br />
How long did you try? I know it can be pretty random. Keep killing the wyverns maybe. <br />
<br />
We did 3 or 4 rotations which are 20 minute spawns each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have tanked these a few times but never soloed...i debuff and bane for agro.  might have been a little tough on the cleric to heal me since i only have about 3k hp, but rarely get hit for full.  with cripple on i was getting hit in the 100s and low 200s most of the time.<br />
<br />
a side note: i don't see a shaman soloing them without uber gear, aego, and a ton of luck.  just my thoughts...<br />
<br />
btw i heard that killing the old wurms could spawn GWs, it seemed to work but it could have just been my imagination.</div></div><hr />
