<br />
For some reason my guild members at my level range are in overdrive and they are all leveling like mad. I've been doing quests (multiple failed swift claw sash for instance) and have fallen behind a bit. I need to catch up fast! <br />
<br />
The only thing I heard about in velious were cougars, but also that they hit fast and hard. Might be too much downtime.<br />
<br />
Please let me know your ideas. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If you hunt the Gorilas and Pandas you might do pretty good with loot as well.  Keep an eye on track between kills and go get any heretics you might see.  The Wak quest is working again so you can pick up one or two of those as well.</div></div><hr />

At 33 I went to Thurgadin in Velious. Hunted in the mines till 37(about 10hours worth of gamming).<br />
After that I went back to HHK for some payback on some Warriors and Raiders. At 37 the warrior were giving a FULL blue per kill. Needless to say i stayed there till 40. At 38 you can pretty much solo the Raider room as long as you have broken up the spawn. Remember HHK is an outdoor zone so you can use Harmony to single pull the mobs from the warrior and the Raider room<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

I am poor (253 plat left) after my last round of upgrades. If I head over there, I may be able to make some cash while getting on exp! Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoaquinBladehawk</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cougars in IC only hit hard and fast if they're hitting you...making them run away with Panic Animal reduces downtime significantly. I'd try them out, between IC cougars, Direwolves in GD, and various animals in EW, you can fear kite all the way to 51 or so pretty easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santi</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For sure HKH is a great place for exp. If are lucky enough to play on off hours there is a chance that you can get the basement to yourself. Start at the top floor. Harmony then pull using your arrow. Pay attention to the pathing of the mobs and you will know which ones to harmony. The great thing about HKH is that the guards are very close. At lvl 36 or so I was able to solo the warrior room and was getting a full blue per kill. At 39 you can hold the raider room and still get a full blue per kill all the way up to 42. It is possible to still get decent exp up to 43 but you will only see blue raiders about 1 in 10 so I'd say at 42 it time to hit EW.<br />
Good luck<br />

Once i hit 35 it was easy.</div></div><hr />
