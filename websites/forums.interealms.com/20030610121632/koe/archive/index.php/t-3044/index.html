Miller Brewing Company<br />
       Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201<br />
<br />
       Dear Sir or Madam,<br />
<br />
       I have been a drinker of Miller beers for many years (actually, ever since that other company<br />
       donated a big chunk of change to Handgun Control Inc. back in the mid 80's). Initially, my beer<br />
       of choice was Lite, but some time in mid-1990 while in Honduras I switched to MGD smuggled<br />
       up from Panama. <br />
<br />
       Now, for nearly six years, I have been a faithful drinker of MGD. For these past years, I have come<br />
       to expect certain things from Genuine Draft. I expect that whenever I see that gold can of MGD, I<br />
       am about ready to enjoy a great, smooth brew. But wait! Sometime around the first of the year, my<br />
       beloved MGD changed colors, so to speak. That familiar gold can was no longer gold!<br />
<br />
       Knowing that I am, by nature, somewhat resistant to change, I forced myself to reserve judgment<br />
       on the new can design. Gradually, I grew to appreciate the new label. That was until about May<br />
       of this year.<br />
<br />
       That was when I discovered (empirically) that I really didn't like the new design. Further<br />
       investigation of the cause of my distress resulted in the following observations:<br />
<br />
       1. Your cans are made of aluminum.<br />
       2. Aluminum is a great conductor of energy.<br />
       3. Your beer is commonly consumed outside, and thus, the container may be exposed to sunlight.<br />
       4. Sunlight striking the can causes radiant warming of the surface of the can.<br />
       5. The resultant heat (energy) is transferred through the aluminum, by conduction, to the contents<br />
       of the can (the beer).<br />
       6. Warm beer sucks.<br />
<br />
       This is a process that can be observed in just about any beer. However, this process is significantly<br />
       accelerated in MGD because you painted the damn can. . . black!!!<br />
<br />
       Who was the rocket scientist that designed the new graphic for the can and implemented the<br />
       change right before summer? Granted, this process may not be real evident up there in Wisconsin,<br />
       but down here in Oklahoma where the summers are both sunny and hot, this effect is quite a<br />
       problem. There's no telling what the folks in Texas and Arizona are having to put up with.<br />
       Knowing that you would probably not address this issue unless you had firm evidence of a<br />
       problem, I and several other subjects conducted extensive experimentation. The results of these<br />
       experiments are listed below.<br />
<br />
       The experiments were conducted over two days on the deck next to my pool. The study included<br />
       seven different types of beer (leftovers from a party the previous weekend) that were initially chilled<br />
       to 38 and then left exposed to sunlight for different lengths of time.<br />
<br />
       These beers were sampled by the test subjects at different intervals. The subjects, all normally<br />
       MGD drinkers, were asked at each sampling interval their impressions of the different beers.<br />
<br />
       The length of time between the initial exposure to sunlight and the point where the subject<br />
       determined the sample undrinkable (the suck-point) was determined. The average ambient<br />
       temperature for the trials was 95 degrees F.<br />
<br />
       Beer Type Average Suck-point (minutes)<br />
       Miller Lite (white can) 6.2<br />
       Bud (white can) 5.5<br />
       Bud Lite (silver can) 5.2<br />
       Ice House (blue and silver can) 4.4<br />
       Coors Lite (silver can) 4.1<br />
       Miller Genuine Draft (black can) 2.8<br />
       Coors (gold can) 0.1<br />
<br />
       It was evident that the color of the can directly correlates to the average suck point, except for<br />
       Coors which was pretty much determined to suck at any point.<br />
<br />
       It is to be hoped that you will consider re-designing your MGD cans. All beer drinkers that are not<br />
       smart enough to keep their beer in the shade will thank you.<br />
<br />
       Sincerely,<br />

       The Miller response appears below. They have had a lot of fun with this guy's letter. Enjoy. . .<br />
<br />

<br />
       Dear Bradley Lee,<br />
<br />
       Thank you for your letter and your concern about the MGD can color as it relates to premature<br />
       warming of the contents. Like you, we at Miller Beer take beer drinking very seriously. To that<br />
       end, we have taken your letter and subsequent experiment under serious consideration.<br />
<br />
       Outlined below are our findings and solution to your problem. May we add that we have had<br />
       similar letters from other loyal beer drinkers, mostly from the Southern United States.<br />
<br />
       First, let us congratulate you on your findings. Our analysis tends to agree with yours regarding<br />
       Coors. It certainly does suck at about any temperature.<br />
<br />
       Now, it was our intention when redesigning the MGD can to create better brand identity and<br />
       brand loyalty. Someone in marketing did some kind of research and determined we needed to<br />
       redesign the can. You will be pleased to know, we have fired that idiot and he is now reeking<br />
       havoc at a pro-gun control beer manufacturer. The design staff working in cahoots with the<br />
       marketing idiot was also down-sized.<br />
<br />
       However, once we realized this mistake, to undo it would have been even a bigger mistake. So, we<br />
       took some other actions. From our market research, we found a difference between Northern beer<br />
       drinkers and<br />
       Southern beer drinkers.<br />
<br />
       Beer drinkers in the South tend to drink slower than beer drinkers in the North. We are still<br />
       researching why that is. Anyway, at Miller Beer, it was never our intention to have someone take<br />
       more than 2.5 minutes to enjoy one of our beers. We pride ourselves in creating fine, smooth, quick<br />
       drinking beers and leave the making of sissy, slow sipping beers to that Sam guy in Boston.<br />
<br />
       It is good to know that you feel our Miller Lite can last as long as 6 minutes. However, may we<br />
       suggest in the future you try consuming at least two in that time frame.<br />
<br />
       After receiving your letter, we had our design staff work 'round the clock to come up with a<br />
       solution that would help not just MGD but all our fine Miller products. We hope you have<br />
       recently noticed our solution to your problem. We found that the hole in the top of the can was not<br />
       big enough for quick consumption. So, we have now introduced the new &quot;Wide Mouth&quot; cans. We<br />
       hope this will solve all your problems.<br />
<br />
       Might I also suggest that if you want to get the beer out of the can even faster, you can poke a<br />
       hole on the side near the bottom, hold your finger over it, open the can, tip it to your mouth and<br />
       then pull your finger off the hole. This is a common way to drink beer at parties and impress your<br />
       friends. This technique is known as &quot;shot-gunning&quot;. You should like the name.<br />
<br />
       Again, thank you for your letter and bringing to our attention the fact that there might be other<br />
       beer drinkers taking more that 2.5 minutes to drink our beers. Let me assure you that I am having<br />
       our advertising department work on a campaign to solve this problem, too. <br />
<br />
       Sincerely,<br />
