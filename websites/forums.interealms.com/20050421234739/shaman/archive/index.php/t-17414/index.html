<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hate to tell ya, but the protectors make soloing pog difficult at best, impossible at worst. as i remember they are on an 18 minute spawn, and they come two at a time. im also fairly sure that they track you even when you're invis, and getting hit before you get to a safe spot would be almost certain death. add the fact that they home in on you as soon as they spawn and it wouldnt be worthwhile trying to solo there unless you can drop them in a matter of seconds</div></div><hr />

Amazing cash, I tell you...amazing cash. But now, alas, it's gone. Perhaps at 65 you could kill the prots fast enough to make it worthwhile, but I doubt it. Bring a melee, or hell even a group. You'll get enough gems to make it well worth everyone's time.</div></div><hr />
