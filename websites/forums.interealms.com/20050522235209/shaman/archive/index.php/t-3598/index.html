<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there a quick easy and reverseable way to raise giant faction?  I say reversable because i value my coldain faction for alchemy components and i dont want to screw up my dragon faction for later questing.  I have killed giants a few times in groups, so they are now scowls instead of threateningly.  I came across Blizzents fang in my bank and was going to turn it in, but i have sortof low faction to do that... :eek:  The reward i get would be a large step into my JBB fund ) <br />

Is it going to be easy or quick at your level? Nope. You're not going to be able to preserve dragon while raising giant but you can preserve coldain while raising giant if you kill dragons.<br />
<br />
You need to be killing mobs with large faction hits to swop factions quickly and that means getting the hits off bigger mobs like Dain, Yelinak, Tormax, Statue of RZ etc.</div></div><hr />
