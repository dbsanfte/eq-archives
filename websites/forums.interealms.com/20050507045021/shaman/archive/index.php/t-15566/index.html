<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About a year ago SOE was having a real problem with this.  They have stated that using NPC's in this way is 'against the rules' and will put a warning on your account.  Contunied action could lead to suspension or banning of you account.<br />
<br />
Plus, why wouls you want to beat on something that cant defend itself?  Do find some low blues and beat on them.  With slow, cripple, and our stat buffs we have the easiest time of ANY class when it comes to raising weapon skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A friend told me a way to max all weapon skills, he's a rogue btw, and his hand to hand is now maxxed from this.  In erudin, right at the zone line, is a npc that is dark blue to a 63.  She hits for no more than 7.  Yeah 7.  He attacked her, and went afk,  45 minutes later, he was at 100 percent, she was at 80.  LOL<br />
<br />
I don't think this is illegal in anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Saw an afk ogre beating on the exterminator in Neriak Commons last week.  Had the exterminator at 70% and was still at full health.  Came back a few hours later and the exterminator was at 40% or so.  So I suppose that's one way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Project alpha might be okay to talk about here but this is something I _definitely_ wouldn't discuss on a messageboard.<br />
<br />
Sony does suspend and even ban accounts for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't see why they would. They are the ones who made these NPCs blue at 65 and hit like level 1s. It is totally within their power to fix. They don't, so the only assumption is that this is acceptable to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They're also the ones that made crappy zone pathing, and it's totally within their power to fix, but will still warn/suspend/ban accounts for pathing sploits.  You're in their world now. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Litgruv, that, my friend, was comic genius.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">got any necro/mage/beastlord friends?<br />
<br />
Check if they have pet hold, duel them, target their pet, autoattack on, /afk for a few hours...<br />
<br />
I know this worked as of 3 weeks ago, so unless they changed it in a recent patch it still does</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Savvik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The npc in Erudin has been fixed on the test server. Haven't had a chance to see if this patch fixed her on the live server.<br />
<br />
Based on the fact that they fixed her on test, I would say that this was an unintentional oversight on their part and as such caould be considered an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Confirmed that Senina Jolick can no longer be attacked on live servers, as of last night.<br />
<br />
Sucked, I told a friend about it so that he could work on his twink, and he ran over to find out that its been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if you are in a guild that raids, ask if its ok to melee some of the mobs, skills will go up real fast against reds.<br />
<br />
Never heard of a shaman not being allowed to melee though.. or even having to ask to melee..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1. Exploits are bad. Don't even think about it. Play the game normally like most people do.<br />
<br />
2. I have a problem with non-melee classes  meleeing on raids. My main is a warrior, and i'm frequently called on to MT. On big stuff like dragons, it's usually not an issue. But take a giant or something that isn't really looooooong... with all the rangers, rogues, monks, etc pushing and shoving to get their hits in, most of the time there just ain't enough room for chanters, clerics, and shamans to jump in and melee. Let that jackass pally stun a couple times out of habit, i lose my aggro, mob moves, or someone hit's it with knockback. Now i'm out of melee range, and the melee circle closes in to the mob an I can't reach the thing to tank it properly.<br />
<br />
Summary of #2, make sure there's enough room before jumping in. This doesn't apply to xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just go lurk around somewhere where you'd usually group and ask an xp group there if you can beat on there mobs in return for buffs.  Most groups are happy to have free shaman buffs.  Just make sure you assist the tank =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There's no reason you can't work the skills as you solo some exp.  That way you can go at your own pace &amp; not worry about what a group or raid might say, and you don't have to be the 'third wheel' to a group fighting for exp.  According to your magelo you're level 54.  You'd want mobs that are dark blue (skillups are less frequent on light blues) but not too far past light blue...  Just off the top of my head I'd say sol-B might be a pretty good choice, LDCs are pretty good exp in the mid 50s and don't hit too hard.  Also could try katta or velks, but the exp might be a bit slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I didnt see it mentioned, but the easiest way is to get a buddy, some low damage low delay weapons and head to an arena or duel it out. Works best with pet yielding clasess and classes that get haste (maing enc and shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">At level 54 some of the Seafurry in OOT are still dark blue. They only hit for 76 max so just have some regen on, pull one with slow and start to beat on it.<br />
<br />
I recently used them to max some of my pally skills, takes around 25 minutes to kill one using bash only :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bodyguards in EW are total wimps, hit MAX for 76 (and very rarely at that) have 10khp and are dark blue to 65.<br />
<br />
They have to be harmony pulled tho, so bring a druid/chanter/etc pal to work on melee skills together.<br />
<br />
Actually, chanter/shaman would be perfect.<br />
<br />
Chanter lulls, shaman pulls with slow (no need to tash/malo). and both go to town on him. When he gets low, chanter charms, shaman heals, break charm. Lather, rinse, repeat. Shaman and chanter dex buffs will get both of you maxed easily for maximum skillups.</div></div><hr />
