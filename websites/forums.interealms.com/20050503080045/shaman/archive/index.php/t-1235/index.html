<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearymist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am in need of a bracer/braclet for my 47 shaman.  I have no idea what would be good?  Any suggestions would be totally helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

*****EDITED****<br />
<br />
Thank you all so much you have helped me tremendously.  I am a Barbarian and I don't solo all that often.  My husband plays with me so I have a partner most of the time so when I do solo I totally sucked.  I did have a JBB that I borrowed boy was that nice but it went back to the owner.  It was great to have.  Hopefully when I am uber hehhe I will get one.  I am right now working on my Thurgadin shawl quests and have a couple of armor drops from Kael just need gems.<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well at 52 I'm still wearing a banded bracer and a bracer of the hidden, both 6ac. I'm in the process of saving for a JBB(7kpp saved, about 8kpp to go) which is 14ac. I'm still not sure of an upgrade for the other one yet, but I'd like higher ac rather than less ac+wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a fan of Sentry Bracers myself.  I have had a pair since lvl 15 ;&gt;.<br />
<br />
They are 9 ac 3 dex 2 wis/int 15 mana/hps and some other change like saves, dont remember precisely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anuenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 52 I'm wearing a Rune Etched bracer from Hate and I just replace a Runed Mithril Bracer with a Spirit Weaver's Bracer from PoG this past weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I have a JBB and a rune etched bracer from hate. <br />
<br />
At 50 thats does me ok!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course, the obvious choice is the Jaundiced Bone Bracer (ac 14, right click Winter's Roar every, 8 second cast, no recast delay), but it's pretty expensive.<br />
<br />
I think the common progression goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Totemic (+9 AC, +5 Dex)<br />
Ry'gorr (+9 AC, +2 Str, +2 Cha, +5 HP)<br />
Jarsath (no drop from Karnors... +8 AC, +4 Wis, +4 Cha)<br />
Sentry (+9 AC, +3 Dex, +2 Wis, +2 Int, +2 vsMg, +5 vsPos, +5 vsDis, +15 HP, +15 Mana)<br />
Coldain military wristguard (quest item)<br />
<br />
----big gap here- everything above is pretty cheap, everything below here is expensive----<br />
<br />
Dragonhorn bracers (ac 12-15, +8-12 wis, +4-8 cha)<br />
Bracelet of sense (ac 12, +15 wis, +6 all saves)<br />
JBB<br />
Barbed rubicite (+13 AC, +5 Wis, +5 Int, +35 HP)<br />
<br />
At that point you're thinking about Velious quest stuff...<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm currently weaing the JBB and a sentry bracer.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 52 I use a Jarsath Scale Wrist Guard (AC: 8   WT: 0.8<br />
CHA+4  WIS+4) and a Supple Scale Armband(AC: 3   WT: 0.1<br />
INT+5  WIS+5  MANA+25  SV FIRE+10).  Both are No Drop, and from Karnor's Castle.  I got the Jarsath at about lvl 10, just hanging around the entrance.  The Supple Scale I got at about 49, and I need to replace it very badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rune etched bracers here... alas no JBB.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to save for your velium blue diamond bracelets for resist gear. You will need resist gear soon.<br />
<br />
I swap out the rune etched bracers for the blue diamond bracelets based on the raid situation.<br />

Been going to hate once ini a while, all I got is leggings and vambraces.:\</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;--- has the WORST luck winning rolls on good bracers or getting them to drop when I have no competition....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">maybe i am just anally retentive, but how can we recomend an item when we know so little about you!<br />
<br />
Wots ur race, u solo or grp, caster oo melee??  blunt or piercing?<br />
<br />
All these items will affect our advice.<br />
<br />
ok hers a generalisation, based on how i play my shammy-<br />
<br />
poison etched bracer ac 13  dragon necrop (sells for 350pish)<br />
totemic bracer    ac 9 5dex   (i trust u know how to get this by now lol)<br />
<br />
if ur loaded then the choice is easy&gt;<br />
jbb and 12 15 dex or wis   bracer from UMB plains<br />
<br />
Explanation-  when i solo i melee the mob and rely on procs to help kill it: there fore i am always lookin to better my 220 dex.<br />
<br />
ok lecture over )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">JBB and a Nasthar Bracer (Chardock)  will be upgrading it to Wolf Callers as soon as I get my faction finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If yer lookin for a semi-easy to get AC/HP Bracer, you could also try Bracer of Scavenging, 9 AC 5 sta 5 dex, drops off the Bandit Lord, a mid-30s spawn in Warsliks Woods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">JBB/Jar Jar<br />
<br />
Jar Jar is doable for you in 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rune Crafters Bracer, and Bracer of Hammerfal for normal usage, swap in Jbb over hammerfall in guild groups or safe soloing places(sorry to disappoint.. but not gonna risk my jbb to pvp.. I dont care if that makes me a wimp =p)<br />
<br />
EDIT: The hammerfall replaced the jarjar bracer I had been using.. dropped 2ac for the bonus hps/sta on the hammerfall.<br />
<br />
If you are rich get one of those 12ac 15wis ones.. pretty snazzy and can let you go all out hps/ac in some other random slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get rune etched, cheap/easy camp and has +5 wis on it (if I can remember that far back)<br />
<br />
Wis = mana, mana = less downtime and more killing = faster lvls :)</div></div><hr />
