<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As Ceno said, invis dropped due to the hit. EQ tends to show the result of something happening in the line before the cause...Rolandal clocked him despite conning indiff, it was the hit that caused invis to drop.<br />
<br />
Defence raises on misses are the same, eg<br />
<br />
You get better at defence (x)<br />
Mob tries to hit you but misses</div></div><hr />

Sorry, couldn't resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never been in on a Rolandal kill.  And I dont know of anyone who actually does kill him.  But, since he is a quest npc, I suspect he drops nothing.<br />
<br />
Of course, this could be the one of the many times I'm wrong about something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">correct, he drops nothing except stuff that people may have given him. he's on CoV faction and is for circlet of falinkan quest i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah he is for circlet of falinkan.  The quest itself is buggy, I have had trouble with it on 2 occassions.   Giving the quest item for that hat before all turn-ins are completed (on MQs) and despawning.  buggy pos.  I never wanted the circlet but got it on a buggy MQ and now with the focus effect I am glad to have it.  :)<br />
<br />
good of you to warn the unsuspecting travellers.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What Darkoth said.. were you on a horse? Invis seems flakey at best on horses.. things con indifferent but still wack you as you run past.. have had much greater success moving around invis with horse turned off heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Henora, i'm trying to do this quest atm, is there anything i need to be careful about?<br />
<br />
On the invis thing, i've noticed mobs will con indiff, but if you get within their melee range, they clock you. Try running to the top of the wurm cave in GD. If you touch any of the indiff wurms... biffo time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Circlet of falinkan - seeing as I'm blocked from Alla's here at work (evil firewall!) and the Circlet is for Affliction Haste... hopefully which will continue to work with Debuffs!    What is required to do this quest? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okay here is the quest:  (I did all this stuff at ALLY to Claws of Veeshan.)<br />
<br />
Head of Staff Sargeant Drioc - Staff Sargeant Drioc (Kael - bank area)<br />
<br />
Teachings of Gkrean - Gkrean (Kael - Cleric in the inner arena)<br />
<br />
a chipped Fang - Vilefang (Dragon Necropolis - deep in the rats area)<br />
<br />
Then you are supposed to go and kill a giant in the Great Divide - he is Taskmaster Aboytt.  He drops a head and a talisman.  Go to Kardakor in the wurm caves in the Great Divide.  Turn in the head and the talisman and he gives you the talisman back.<br />
<br />
Now go to the Wakening Lands.<br />
Find Rolandal.<br />
Give him these items, get an Imbued Talisman.<br />
<br />
Take Imbued Talisman to Ralgyn in Skyshrine and you get the Circlet of the Falinkan.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
This is what went wrong.   Henora, Wizard and Cleric all have items for this quest.  We wish to MQ them to the wizard.<br />
<br />
Henora: Teachings of Gkrean, Head of Staff Sargeant Drioc.<br />
Cleric: a chipped fang<br />
Wizard: the talisman.<br />
<br />
Wizard is supposed to get the the quest item.<br />
Cleric turns in the fang, Henora turns in Teachings of Gkrean, Head of Staff Sargeant Drioc.  <br />
<br />
Henora gets quest item(imbued talisman).  Wizard still has talisman.<br />
<br />
This has happened to a friends MQ on this as well.  Rolandal does not appear to always require the talisman.  If you are MQing this make sure you have the talisman AND one of the 3 items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe someone had already handed in the item that the wizard had? This sort of thing can happen with any quest, whether multi questing or not, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grippa - would explain the problem and it was what we suspected.   However, the other group of people (a 2 box team) turned it in right after servers came up from patching and had the same issue.  I spoke with our server GM via email and he said that since we MQd it he could not help us, but would submit another bug report after looking at the turn in logs of myself and the other group I mentioned.<br />
<br />
I'd still recommend that the person who wants the item have more than just the item from Taskmaster Aboytt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mosheaehsom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The talisman you get from the Wurm in the caves isn't used to get the imbued talisman.<br />
<br />
You turn in the talisman, and then Rolandal tells you what items he needs for you to get the imbued talisman.<br />
<br />
If you're going to MQ this, the person getting the MQ needs to have any of the 3 items (head, fang, teachings).  The talisman itself isn't used during that turn in.<br />
<br />
I'd venture a guess that you don't need to follow the Taskmaster kill part of it if you really wanted to skip parts of the quest.<br />
<br />
Rolandal (and the final turn in mob, whose name I forget) despawns when the quest is successfully completed.<br />
<br />
The wurm in the caves doesn't despawn.<br />
<br />
And I had no problems invising into the spot where the cave wurm is, just remember that some of them do see invis, and avoid those...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the quest text is misleading at best then...This is from allakhazam, but I checked it against my quest text at the time we did the turn in.  You don't need to turn in anything for him to tell you what he wants.  Just hailing him results in text that looks like it might come from giving him something.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail Rolandal' <br />
<br />
Rolandal says, 'It would be my guess that you present this to me in hopes to find out more about the magics it possesses. Before I can do this I require some rare treasures that you must present to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
You say, 'what rare treasures?' <br />
<br />
Rolandal says, 'There are 3 items that I seek to continue my studies of some various and mysterious magics. Bring to me the teachings of a high ranking Kromzek that I hear goes by the name of Gkrean, a chipped fang from a beast deep within the Cursed Necropolis. Also for good measure, I require the Head of a Kromzek Staff Sergeant to prove to your dedication to our cause. Present these 3 items to me along with your Talisman that you wish to learn more about and I shall do my best to identify its origin for you.' <br />
<br />
To me this clearly says - turn in the 3 items and the talisman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mosheaehsom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just did the quest less than a week ago, so I'll have to check my log, but I know that I currently have the first talisman still in my inventory, and the circlet on my head...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I believe you!<br />
<br />
I was just trying to warn people that the spoilers and quest text indicate that you turn in 4 items.  So if you are trying to MQ this, it won't work unless the person to MQ to has at least one of the 3 main items, despite the fact the quest text says turn in those 3 items and the talisman.  If you have all 4 items yourself, you don't need to worry about it.<br />
<br />
If your logs show updated quest text, could you send it in as an update to allakhazam?  Our server GM said he would send in a bug report for it, lets see... April 27, 2002.  I would be pretty suprised if they did actually update it though.  :(</div></div><hr />
