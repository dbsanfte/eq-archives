<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the new tatle tale code telling the group who broke mez we were able to see that my pet did break mez a few times last night.  Has anyone else noticed this?  Do we know if this has something to do with project alpha.  My pet was equiped with the mage swords so there was no ae and mage pet did not break mez.<br />
<br />
It was also inconsistant and usually wouldnt attack a mezzed pet.<br />
<br />
I did send a report in showing the message of my pet breaking mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It may be related to the same sort of bug monks and such see when they FD, a mob gets in a last second hit which breaks feign.<br />
<br />
I think it's just related to the latency between your computer and EQ servers.  If the two systems are out of sync by even a third of a second, things like that can happen.  Unless it had been sitting there mezzed for a while, this is my theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye, I saw this happen twice while in Akhevia ruins.  The BL's pet that was with us kept on breaking mez.  He sent his pet to split the add while the enc attempted to mez it.  The pet got hit, she mezzed the add, the pet would hit the mez'ed add, and so on and so on.....<br />
<br />
This happened to us on patch night.  Another thing that's seems weird is gaining agro from someone.  Seems like the best way to obtain agro is to just heal someone.  Slowing, double dotting, etc.. didn't seem to work.  Appears that healing has two effects in agro, your healing of course (which acts like a dd i'd assume) and the other agro modifier is that you're helping a pc.  I could be wrong, but the only way I could get the agro off the enc was to chain heal her =/.  Only did this if a mob resisted her first mez, and the enc is lvl 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Runak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happened with my pet in the pit the other night.  Our chanter said it has always been that way, but no one has ever believed it until the awakening messages were put in.<br />
<br />
It has to do with the timing, yes.  If a pet is in the act of casting when the mez hits, they will finish the spell and break the mez.  Or if they are in the act of hitting the mob, they will continue the swing and break mez.  I guess mage pets with two spells break mez all the time.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've grouped with the enc and bl for over twelve levels now.  Hell it's the only group I'll join (c2+SP=happy shammy), would rather solo then do pickup groups.  There was a time when somethin' like this happend, but it was fixed when they came out with the patch for pet classes sometime last year.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's when they added the message &quot;Sorry master, unable to wake %t&quot; when your pet tried to break a mez.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's along the lines of what Xanden said.  Somethin' is iffy with how the packets are handled from server to client.  Like it's not checking at the end of a tick or the compression is adding more lag.<br />
<br />
I'll be heading out to Akevia again 2night, guess I could check to see if I'm right or just talking out of my ass.  My pick is the second one :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pets currently fighting a mob have often broken mez in my experience.  I think the messages that the mob is mezzed don't get to the pet logic quick enough so if they're in mid attack they'll break the mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you know...they claimed they reduced the bandwidth usage.  Logically, you would think that meant less packet updates from client to server along with a better compression algorithm.  If less packets were going to the server, that would mean less updates to your pc.  With us not receiving as many updates, your pet doesn't know the mob has been mezzed quite yet.  Which would explain why it breaks mez now.  Just a hunch though................<br />
<br />
might explain why it was so hard to take agro away from the enc and also FD.</div></div><hr />
