<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I originally thought trial by lashing was more geared to shamans strong points but was told trial by stonning was easier and didn't require high DPS groups like Execution.<br />
<br />
Well there isn't much info on this trial except that there are 4 mobs as usual ranging from Rockmen, earth elementals and spectres with 2 bowmen that are untargettable shooting you for 90-100 dmg per hit. <br />
<br />
Kill 4 mobs per wave. Doesn't seem to be a timer for completing this though.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know from those that have tried this trial is :<br />
<br />
1) How often do the 2 bow men shoot<br />
<br />
2) How hard do the mobs hit and can they be slowed rooted<br />
<br />
3) Are the bow menn up when fighting the mob boss<br />
<br />
4) what is critical in passing this test? High lvl war/tank? More healer types. Are chanters a must? Certain spells?<br />
<br />
5) Any specific tatic that helped and if you were successful or not<br />
<br />
I know that rockmen can't be mezzed but can they be slowed and rooted?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info and looking forward to trying this trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If this is the trial I'm thinking of, bloody forget about it.  Shamans might be more useful in it than they are in execution, but it's easier to do exe with 5 people, than this with 6 (including the shaman).<br />
<br />
When several friends and I got bored off our asses and did all the trials, stoning was the second hardest (flame being the hardest by a huge margin).<br />
<br />
But if you insist...<br />
<br />
1) How often do the 2 bow men shoot<br />
<br />
Fairly standard delay, maybe every 2-3 seconds.  The damage was negligable, but if they get on your casters it can interrupt a lot.<br />
<br />
2) How hard do the mobs hit and can they be slowed rooted<br />
<br />
Like 390 or some ****.  Half can be mez'd, I honestly forget if they can be rooted, and they can be slowed but mitigation is bad enough that it doesn't matter much.  If memory serves.<br />
<br />
3) Are the bow menn up when fighting the mob boss  Don't really recall, probably.  The event itself was way harder than boss for us, but then, we had a really well equipped 65 warrior, so most of our trouble was adds getting on healers, not their damage while hitting tank.<br />
<br />
4) what is critical in passing this test? High lvl war/tank? More healer types. Are chanters a must? Certain spells?<br />
<br />
An enchanter helps a lot.  You should have at least 2 healers, so that they can heal eachother.  You have to be ready to kite mobs, as well, they hit hard enough that casters/priests ain't tanking them for very long waiting for a melee to get them off.  And yes, a decent tank.<br />
<br />
5) Any specific tatic that helped and if you were successful or not  Not dying.  That might seem lame, but it was simply a question of not losing people.  Mezzing, healing, kiting, etc. whatever makes people not become corpses.<br />
<br />
For reference, order of tests from easiest to hardest for us was Torture, Execution, Suffocation, Lashing, Stoning, Flame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any trials I've tried, everything &quot;slightly&quot; slows (except bosses).  So no, not worth it in the slightest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have a pali along, it works great for keeping the spawns off the casters. Group healing is great AE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Passed on first attempt with:<br />
<br />
Bard, Monk, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman (me), Ranger<br />
<br />
I think that's correct.<br />
<br />
No magic to it. Use grow to your advantage. You are the arrow tank. Put your casters in a corner while they med/cast (you block). Aggro kite unmezzable adds.  Keeping Torpor/Qui on is enough to handle the arrow damage. Save a mezzable one until the end. Mez it, Med up with you guarding the casters in the corner.<br />
<br />
Monk tanked.<br />
<br />
All were 65 and pretty high AA's.  I'd think it to be near impossible in the first days of POP with no spells/levels/AA's.<br />
<br />
Levels make all the difference in these I've found. Spells/AA's help a lot.<br />
<br />
(Did a full run through Trials the other day and never slowed once other than bosses. Just not worth it. Prefer SOT)<br />
<br />
Exec - Nuke like Crazy. Spot heals<br />
Stoning - Arrow Tank, Caster shield for Arrow damage, Nuker, Spot heal<br />
Lashing - You are the Lasher killer. 1-2 Spear of Torments kills all the whorl/air things. Nuking when you're done on regulars/rooting as well<br />
Torture - Root mezzing for ench, Center point for aggro while ench/tank takes control. Nuke/Spot heal<br />
Hanging - Max nukes on the suffocation elementals. Save mana on rest or nuke as best you can.<br />
<br />
Flame - Pray.</div></div><hr />
