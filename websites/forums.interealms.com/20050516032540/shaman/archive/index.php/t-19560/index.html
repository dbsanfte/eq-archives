<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Palaric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Never thought it would come to this, but desperate times require desperate measures.<br />
<br />
I have an L65 Paladin and an L65 Cleric, and I am looking for a guild. Normally this wouldn't be the place, but with server transfers enabled I am willing to move servers, if I could just find someone to raid with on my time zone. That is something I am unable to accomplish on my home server, any guild that is where I want to be in the game is either Euro or East Coast and starts raiding hours before I am available.<br />
<br />
I am on Pacific, and for reasons beyond my control I am seldomly able to start raiding before 7 pm PST on weekdays.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a guild that raids at that time, still does Ssra and VT (have keys) and pre-EP PoP. Icing would be if there were designated raid nights, but the nature of the beast is to hit targets of opportunity when they are up.<br />
<br />
My PAL has the following unbuffed stats, 1332AC, 1109ATK, 4823HP, 3348Mana, 41% haste, FT6. Keyed for ST, Emp Ssra, VT. Missing MM (and a couple HoH trials), Saryrn, RZ for EP access. 105AA.<br />
<br />
My CLR has 1065AC, 2456HP, 4077Mana, FT6, Epic. Keyed for Emp Ssra, missing 4 shards for VT (just too lazy to farm them atm, have orb, rift, and container). Missing HoH trials, MM, Saryrn, Bert, and RZ for EP access.<br />
<br />
All current expansions enabled. Not sure whether I am going to get GoD, still plenty of useful pre-GoD AA to get on either toon.<br />
<br />
I have worked hard on my Emp Ssra and VT keys, I'd like to join a guild that still hits those targets, don't really want to rush by and skip them in favor of PoP only.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying either toon equally, I am able to 2 box reliably, but prefer not to do so on raids as it gets to be too stressful. I'd likely transfer one or the other first and should it work out well I would get the other toon transfered later on.<br />
<br />
If you think your guild could be what I am looking for, or know of a guild that raids on Pacific Time, please email me at palaric@alpenjodel.de please include guild name, link to guild web site or msg board, and name of guild leader, or recruitment officer, or paladin or cleric class leaders.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
