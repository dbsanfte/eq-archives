<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been grouping mostly with two melee types (Warrior and Ranger), and we've been having a blast through the levels.  I am quite anxious for the ranger to get Jolt though, so my heal load will be that much less.<br />
<br />
Lately we've started to group with a paladin and a wizard, and I've been wondering how best to buff the wizard?  I know every class benefits from extra HPs, and AC if I've got mana to spare.  The occasional regen if they are too trigger happy.<br />
<br />
What else should I keep them covered with?  Do they benefit from Agility or Dex?  Just want the opinion of the Crucible Collective...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give em agi, sta, hp.  Dont worry about anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I give them Dexterity because they say it helps with their crits. They could be wrong but it's cheap to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paladins at some levels might have a better AC buff than you.  I always asked casters if they would prefer HoS or their Shielding line before casting HoS (some will want HoS, usually chanters).  Agility doesn't make a big difference in AC for them most of time, not worth casting on a robe IMHO.  Once you get your group buffs, your life is 10x easier, just let the group buffs take over and they can click off what they don't want.... lets them make the decisions. ;)<br />
<br />
Robes are very low-maintenance compared to those mana-sponge melee-types. :p lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Casters get HP and sta.  Even the clerics who ask for str/agi/dex/haste/regrow too plz gwain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I often don't give casters (except chanters and clerics) anything at all unless I've got FM (at level 54 I don't have the benefits of canV). If I notice a wizzy is over-nuking or add control isn't good I'll give them HP and Dex - Dex helps with channeling if nothing else. <br />
<br />
The effect of stat buffs on most casters generally isn't worth it imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, if you are 60, just group buff everything and don't worry :)    If you are lower, go with Kragg's and sta (their ac is probably so low you don't need to worry about AGI, won't help much).   After that, just let group know if they want more buffs to ask you, casters normally won't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DEX seems to make it more likely they can get a cast off while being hit.<br />
<br />
AGI reduces the chance of them getting hit.<br />
<br />
CHA helps with Charm and Mez spells (NOT root and slow and such).<br />
<br />
STA has a slight HP buff<br />
<br />
STR...well, they are always asking for this because they are weak and carrying heavy things it seems.<br />
<br />
Yeah, do it all!</div></div><hr />

Correct.<br />

STR...well, they are always asking for this because they are weak and carrying heavy things it seems. <br />
Tell them to buy a weight reduction bag.<br />
<br />
Yeah, do it all!<br />
You could. Or you could do useful stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dargadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The DEX benefit is based on personal observation.  I have a much easier time getting a spell off while being punched in the face if my DEX is high than when it is low.<br />
<br />
The more-AGI-you-get-hit-less benefit is stated clearly in the documentation.<br />
<br />
As for telling them to get a weight reduction bag, I like to think I am there to be helpful to my fellow group members, not act like a jerk, but you can play it any way you want.</div></div><hr />
