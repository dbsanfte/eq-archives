<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a chance to play LDoN last night. I found that the lfg tool is being used more, but there are still people just looking in the zone they're in... hopefully that will change.<br />
<br />
Anyway, while I was in the dungeon (it was a complete pickup group) things started out alright and it looked like we might finish it. Then we had a bad pull and a couple deaths. Then, the puller decides to go exploring and bang, he gets aggroe and we're all dead. We get back together and try to finish, but we run out of time. It was around the end of the time limit that I notice that the second shaman in the group is not casting at all. I'm slowing, backup healing, rooting, and not getting any higher than 20% mana. He seems to be in the front lines alot fighting beside the tanks. So I mention to him that he should backup heal. Then he tells me that he's oom!<br />
<br />
I play in pickup groups mostly, and the odd time you get a moron that you have to deal with, it seems like everywhere I turn since LDoN was released I'm hearing stories of morons like this. Someone please tell me that people like this are going to go back into the shadows when the novelty of LDoN wear's off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There have always been stupid people. You were probably mostly unlucky with your group though.<br />
<br />
Seems to me the biggest problems with LDoN are that people are not used to dungeons these days, and you can't just leave a bad group.<br />
<br />
I levelled my ranger almost exclusively in dungeons, but a year or so later when I was levelling my shaman it was much harder to find groups in dungeons, and I imagine that trend has continued up until now. There are probably level 65 people who've never set foot inside a dungeon. Not entirely their fault, but PoP is so much easier these days, it's been hard to find groups in dungeons even if you want them.<br />
<br />
So now, these people with mostly outdoors, single pulling experience are hitting LDoN and have a new set of skills to learn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, Kianor is correct.  The stupid people have always been there, its just that they have been burried in PoP zones, only making an apperance to train the zone.<br />
<br />
I was with a ranger last night that didnt know that Sow couldn't be cast indoors (level 61).  He didnt know that harmony wouldn't work indoors (LEVEL 61!!!!)<br />
<br />
Its going to be painfull, but it will take a few weeks, maybe months, before some people realize that they hate dungeons and stop going to LDoN.  Then good groups should be easier to find.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Mill...but hopefully this will change fairly quickly for most of the LDoN crowd as they get used to playing in a dungeon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I was a total moron in LDoN this morning.<br />
<br />
I bought the downloaded version of LDoN.  When I could get on after its release, I ran to Halas, did my hailing, got my stone etc etc.  <br />
<br />
This morning, I get in a group with some guildmates and we try an adventure with 5.  Just before we zone in, we grab a 6th.  Then we realize he can't do the adventure so we leave it.  <br />
<br />
LDoN 1 Gart 0 - since leave it is a &quot;loss&quot; even though we didn't even zone.  <br />
<br />
So, we group him, get the adventure and try again.  <br />
<br />
I can't zone.  No red text after getting adventure, nothing.  <br />
<br />
We figure it's a bug and leave adventure to have me camp and try again.  Leaving the adventure even without zoning into the dungeon is, again, a loss.  <br />
<br />
LDoN 2, Gart 0.<br />
<br />
It doesn't work the second time either.  <br />
<br />
LDoN 3, Gart 0.  <br />
<br />
3 losses without even zoning into the dungeons.  <br />
<br />
I don't get it, and it's time to head to work.  I take a minute to go to EQ Live to see what kind of wierd bug this is.  I see a message with a post indicating a problem similar to mine.  I look at it.  A reply says &quot;go to advanced at login and check LDoN&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I had never downloaded the stupid thing.  <br />
<br />
I thought the download was automatic if we bought it online.  I don't remember going to an advanced tab for LoY.  <br />
<br />
But I felt like a moron.  <br />
<br />
So, I can see that downloading LDoN should help me in zoning into LDoN zones.  <br />
<br />
It's odd I could get adventure stones, augment my charm with the adventure stone, get adventures, etc., do everything including getting my loss column racked up, except actually zone.  <br />
<br />
Be nice if they added a message for morons:  &quot;You need to download LDoN before you can start your Adventure!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was asked for sow on an adventure and explained it wouldn't work. I was then told I was lazy for not having shrew. I explained the difference between me being lazy and this being my first adventure so I couldn't possibly have the points to buy it. I also explained that run 3 should be enough at his level. He said he had it. We all had it. The laughable thing about this was that it wasn't a sprint anyway, it was a fast paced haul through the dungeon. Sow speed really wasn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Still gotta love the new expansion though. Leader on our server has now done 18 adventures without fail. Jeez, it's only been out about a day.</div></div><hr />

To me this says that some players of EQ are in a very sorry state of mind.<br />
In all seriousness this person who has 18 completed adventures really needs to take a step back and look at his life.<br />

In my 30s, I did...well, more Cazic Thule, then Kedge Keep instead of ... whatever the hell people did in their 30s, it sure wasn't Kedge Keep because we were always alone there.  What'd they do, go from SolA to Guk?<br />
In my 40s, I did SolB instead of LGuk.<br />
In my 50s, I did OS instead of KC.<br />
In tier 1, I did PoN ... but I dunno, PoN and PoD seemed about the same to me.<br />
In tier 2, I did PoS instead of PoV<br />
In tier 3, I did HoH instead of BoT.<br />
<br />
Then I got PoTactics and SolRo and I won't even touch the open zones any more.  Unless it's an Agnarr raid, you're not getting me into BoT without a cattle prod.</div></div><hr />

Kedge Keep, ahhhh, this time around when we were in our high 30's to mid 40's we spent some time in there, they put portcullises on all the halls, odd.<br />

PoP sure makes it easy to level in a nice relaxed setting, but I prefere dungeons still. Best place I like right now is droga and veksar, dinged 60 last night, first time a character of mine ever got that high, haha!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing I see a lot of is people talking about pullers.  In most of these dungeons, you dont pull.  You move.  The agro ranges are small enough that you can move into a room and grab the first mob, maybe get an add, maybe not... and definately not agro the 2 mobs standing on the other side of the room.  <br />
<br />
If you are setting up a camp and pulling to the camp you are in trouble in LDON.</div></div><hr />

My first adventure took 30 min at normal difficulty.  4 of 6 people have never done a LDoN adventure.  Our ranger couldnt zone into the dungeon for  15 min because he didnt realize he hadn't download the LDoN files on that computer he was on.  We started pulling without him.  Where did you get 18 hrs for 18 adventures from?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, pre-Kunark, I'd say the place of choicefor 30s would have probably been High Hold Keep. I did that for a bit on my ranger, and I remember the lists, and running to the guards, and the ease of fighting right next to a bank/vendor and being able to bind 10 yards from the camp, even as a melee? I didn't really like it there though.<br />
<br />
Maybe Rathe Mountains Hill Giants, or the bedroom in Lower Guk. I think there were still some level 30s outside Paw in SK when I was there for my totemic quests.<br />
<br />
Post Kunark, would have been Frontier Mountains/Overthere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually I'm worried that PoP has made me stupid.  A minimal amount of aggro management skill has been all thats been required from me in the last few months.<br />

<br />
We were setting up mini camps (if that term exists). We'd sit, let the puller pull to us, then get up and move as he got further away. It actually worked quite nice... it got the mobs away from their friends, so if they started running they weren't really close to aggro more. <br />
<br />
So when I say that they pulled, it was kind of a progressive thing... we moved with the puller :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One thing I'm liking about LDoN is LoY zones are emptying out :)  Leaving nadox and Dulak boats all mine. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is one reason why I'm holding out on buying LDoN for a few weeks. The thought of all those Horse Jockies who have been hunting outdoors for their entire lives with no clue on how to fight in dungeons sends a shiver down my spine. It's truely frightening to meet people who have never seen Lguk, SolA/B and Seb, then they try to defend themselves by saying they hunted in a dungeon: Paludal Caverns *cough*<br />
<br />
Another nice side effect of LDoN is that I can now grab any camp in Droga and Inner Acrylia -- hardly a peep there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Auraura_H</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think using words like &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; is over-doing it a bit. I run into a LOT of kids on this game and I think that is who you are running into. I would think it's merely inexperience or the failure to read up and learn. I'm not saying kids are ignorant, because they aren't. Some just learn how to play the game differently than most adults. It's more of a trial and error thing.<br />
<br />
Most kids don't have the patience to sit and read thoroughly before diving in. I'm old, so I do nothing but read, it would seem. I wont hold that against them.<br />
<br />
I think if people are ALREADY expecting a set of experienced LDoN players they are selling themselves short. The expansion just went active a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
Now I'm on Strom server, and when it comes to finding competent groups of people to play with it can be a challenge. It's not just a well rounded group... ie warrior, cleric, shaman, wiz, ench.... etc, it's actually finding people who'll listen and do their specific job and wait for their casters and all that is necessary to successfully get through a train and difficult mob.<br />
<br />
As for lacking dungeon experience... I've found if you don't get into Paludal, Echo, Sol A then you don't get the experience. Staying topside is nearly useless, especially after level 25.<br />

For some reason I was checking the autodownload about a week ago and noticed that LDoN was not checked also. It was weird because I was seeing files that I thought were for LDoN getting patched everyday, but I guess they werent all of them. <br />

Have people beaten the hard quests yet? We tried 1 but aborted it after killing 2 mobs.. they quad for 900 and mitigate slow, we didn't have a bard/monk puller (2 tanks to clear the room is what we were using).. but seems to me it's semi impossible to do =/</div></div><hr />

I haven't done it myself yet because all my groups have had just me for a healer, but quad 900 is definately possible.  You'd need a good tank (EP gear, full defensive AA), a cleric, and a good backup healer (you) to do it well, but it definately isn't impossible.  Quad 900 is just a little more than what pofire mobs in castle1 do, and I group there all the time.</div></div><hr />

Paludal caverns does not a dungeon make.<br />
<br />
And frankly, LDoN dungeons are sissy dungeons.  The aggro radius is so small, we just pacify our way through 50% of the mobs and gank the target.<br />
<br />
But it is still an improvement over EVERY dungeon since kunark came out.<br />

2. A warrior barges into the room and gets smacked until an enchanter can mezz the extras.<br />

How does grouping with a (to at least some extent) badly played level 21 shaman in a Luclin zone that just barely qualifies as a dungeon zone (it has a roof! its a dungeon!) relate to 'what PoP (the expansion that has relatively nothing besides instant travel for those under level 46) has brought us to'? And what exactly has PoP brought us to anyway? The problem of bad players has existed since release or earlier, and I still have not heard a single story that can top the ones I've heard of a monk who was lovingly nicknamed 'Amtrak', a nickname which he earned during the summer of '99, or a certain cleric who would (quite reliably) gate everytime a heal would make the difference between everyone living and everyone dying/zoning, who earned that reputation late '99 and then reinforced it with Kunark's release. You know, those people you could really count on to crap out when their contribution would make the difference, or could ruin your entire month just by being in the same zone. Most 'idiot' stories people tell now days are of people who are trying but just don't know what/what not to do, IE educatable if you're not an *** about it. Back in my day we had real idiots and morons, in addition to walking (encumbered mind you!) across Antonica twice a day only to get kicked off the boat to Faydwer while zoning.  =p<br />
<br />
Its also humourous to see SolA being pointed out as 'the popular spot' to someone who used to routinely see no one in the zone besides a level 40~ dwarven paladin (no goblin aggro!) and whatever caster was camping Gabbie.</div></div><hr />

Try the easy mission types first if you want to do High risk adventures.  Collection and Slaughter are the easiest, imo.  I've done 2 adventures now, one easy and won... and one hard and won.<br />
<br />
It was certainly easier because we had a bard to pull, but my group certainly wasn't uber, at least in my opinion.  We had bard (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14185&amp;resize=true), shaman (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=485691&amp;resize=true), cleric (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=54970&amp;resize=true), wizard(twink) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=661350&amp;resize=true), warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18306&amp;resize=true) and rogue (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=767869&amp;resize=true).   We don't have elemental/VT/ssra gear but we are well equipped for our level of the game, I linked our magelos.. our tank certainly doesn't have 9k hps.  We did a collection quest and finished it with about 10 mins to go.  The cleric died twice, I died once.  I managed to hold things together on heals with the cleric dead and 3 mobs in camp.  We evac'd once early on a big overpull.  We did Mistmoore, High Risk, collect 28 items in 90 mins...finished with 10 mins to go, or so.<br />
<br />
Another group of my guildies did a hard adventure and though they did not win - their group was cleric, paladin, enchanter, ranger, monk, bard... they got a named that dropped a priest/caster mask with 80hp/90mana and haste of solusek on it.  So even if you can't win, hard dungeons have some nice loot dropping off random nameds.<br />

When you hit the pre-order button while logging in, it is supposed to check the download LDoN box in the patcher, and usually it does. I've heard from a couple people that their download box would sometime spontaneously uncheck itself. That's probably what happened to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I don't know, I've had pretty good success so far with my adventures. The biggest issue is getting everyone moving along, barging into rooms, and not waiting for someone to pull. LDoN isn't anything like pre-PoP dungeons, where wanderers, repops, casters, awful pathing, aggro through walls, high assist ranges, gaters, etc. kept out incompetent people. LDoN dungeons are pretty easy and stupid from what I've seen (move forward and hit stuff until you win), though I haven't tried hard difficulty.</div></div><hr />

When did they make it less resistable than turgurs? woohoo</div></div><hr />

I think using words like &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; is over-doing it a bit. I run into a LOT of kids on this game and I think that is who you are running into. I would think it's merely inexperience or the failure to read up and learn. I'm not saying kids are ignorant, because they aren't. Some just learn how to play the game differently than most adults. It's more of a trial and error thing. <br />
<br />
This is very true. Went into an adventure with a shaman in a group of 5 all mid 20s -- on Stromm btw so not much twinking yet. Shaman was carrying a stein and staff, meleed the whole trip, except to cast regen on herself, would not buff anything, even when we got cursed and couldn't move because our str was like 1, would not root park, would not back up heal, etc. So, i'm fuming away and i'm going to blast her after we finish the mission..., but then we finish and she sits down and says she's got to go cos her mom's calling her to do her chores....Heh felt like a real meanie and glad i never said anything.<br />
<br />
Newbie level adventures are great fun. Wonder how long it's going to last though. And if it does, will anyone ever go back to the old haunts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My sentiments exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">My first adventure took 30 min at normal difficulty.  4 of 6 people have never done a LDoN adventure.  Our ranger couldnt zone into the dungeon for  15 min because he didnt realize he hadn't download the LDoN files on that computer he was on.  We started pulling without him.  Where did you get 18 hrs for 18 adventures from?<br />
<br />
All I can say is please let me join your groups then.<br />
Or perhaps you should not do Adventures that are much too easy for you.<br />
What exactly was this adventure that you completed in 30 mins ?<br />
Quickest 1 ive completed was in just over 45 mins and that was normal level with kill a certain amount of mobs and 4 of our group with EP gear.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">2 nights ago I did an adventure in Everfrost, and I'm pretty sure it must have been on the hard setting because when we won we got 76 points each. The only other one I have done I KNOW was on easy, and we got 51 points each. <br />
 We had to kill 54 mobs in 90 minutes, and we killed the 54th mob with like 2 minutes left on the timer. It was Shaman (me), Ranger, Ranger, Cleric, Cleric, and Warrior. All lvl 65. The group was awesome... I got agro from a bounced slow once and saw my health hit 1% before a cleric healed me. I know we couldn't have survived without both clerics, so it must have been the hard setting.... <br />
<br />
 So yes it has been done...</div></div><hr />

LOL... Amen  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">This expansion will really kick the asses of the people who leveled strictly on the kunark cycle!  I haven't tried any adventures yet on my shaman, just got the expansion for my main first to check it out and see if it was worth it.  I know for those who avoided dungeons, this will be a rude awakening!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I love this expansion for the simple reason that it actually requires an element of skill. Especially if you try some whacky group set ups (did one 2 shaman, 2 warrior, druid, mage. Won easily).<br />
<br />
The wheat is getting seperated from the chaff here in short order. I already have names written on scraps of people all around my desk of people I won't be adventuring with, and some are even in my own guild! I have also noted that if you have a bit of an extra level of play ability, you get invited to good groups more. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you are not good at your class (or at least competant) then word will spread, and you will end up being forced to improve your skills or head back to BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hey Darjeeling, glad to see you posting again.  Would you like me to attempt to resend your old password to the email associated with your new account?  PM me if you'd like my assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I did have a 60 Enchanter ask us to hold her spot in a PoN grp while she completely logged out and logged back in. She had just dinged her 6th AA and wanted to see &quot;Baron&quot; in front of her name.<br />
<br />
I almost puked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm..kinda pissy there? I know a lot of people who got excited when they first got baron and either zoned out or logged out so it could be seen. When there's something wrong in your mind with people getting excited over their achievements in game, however small you might think them to be, there's something wrong with you. Take a break from eq or something if you are that bitter.<br />
<br />
Besides, that took what, like 2 minutes for her to do?</div></div><hr />
