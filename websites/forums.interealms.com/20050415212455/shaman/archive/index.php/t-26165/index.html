<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I logged in to discover a very annoying new bug - I am unable to see any of the mouse roll over pop-up windows (gear, spells, buff timers). I'm going to be very unhappy if I can't obsessively check my buff timers constantly.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experienced this? I tried loading the default UI, but I had the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, working fine for me. I keep it hovered over the Leopard slot in my pet buff window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kheera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd searched for this on the EQLive forums earlier... evidently it's a Windows function call (not EQ) that glitches after the computer's been on for 29 days or more straight.  The solution is to reboot the computer, then you're good for another 29 days of mouseover popups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I've had that happen to me, too. Restarted and it's been fine, now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man, I thought they'd fixed that. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man, what kind of freak doesn't reboot their pc in 29 days? Oh yeah, that would be me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help :)</div></div><hr />

One thing about Black Tuesday (second Tuesday of every month, when Microsoft releases their security updates) is that it usually forces people to reboot their computers.  Unfortunately (?), there were no critical patches released this month, so I wonder how many people are going to get hit with these kind of little glitches that crop up after extended up-times.<br />
<br />
I have a machine currently at 343 days of uptime, and I don't consider that very high.  Of course, it's not a Windows machine.</div></div><hr />
