<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I tried the tech supoprt forum, but the only suggestion I got was &quot;upgrade to win xp,&quot; which really isn't an option for me.  So, I'm hoping someone out there can help me in this forum.  Basically, my computer crashes a lot while playing everquest.  It crashes to the desktop with an error message about page faults  or memory or something.  It crashes with a little window that says &quot;everquest has performed an illegal operation, a log is being generated&quot;.  It crashes with no error message whatsoever (I'm just suddenly back at the desktop and EQ is gone).  Sometimes it does this weird thing where the monitor shuts off as if it was in power saving mode, and I can't for the life of me get it back on.  And, finally, it just spontaneously restarts sometimes.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't experience any of these problems unless I'm playing everquest, so I'm pretty sure its an EQ problem.  I've tried downloading the latest drivers for my graphics card (geforce 2 mx with 64 mb).  I've tried replacing the power supply (heard this would fix the restarting problem; it didn't).  I've tried downloading and installing service pack 3.<br />
<br />
I have 786 megs of ram, a 12 gig hard drive, a decent video card and processor (duron something or other).  What am I doing wrong?  Please, please, please help, if I crash one more time I'm going to go ballistic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may also be over heating if it just reastarts for no reason like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Windows 200 is my OS<br />
<br />
If its a heat issue, will running with my case off help (because I am running with the case off at the moment)?  If not, what else can I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try turning off any programs running in the background. <br />
<br />
Next step, disable your sound card in windows setup, buggy sound drivers seem to be a major problem with many people. Other than that,  upgrade drivers if you haven't already, especially if you have any exotic hardware. <br />
<br />
...if all else fails, reformat and do a clean install of windows, than add EQ and see if it still crashes with nothing else on the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try checking your heat (as someone said above).  I had problems like these when playing EQ and one other game, but never any other time.  The CPU was overheating, got me a new power supply with a better fan and that did the trick.<br />
<br />
Also, check to see if you are overclocked.  If you are, try going down to the certified speed.  I doubt the OS has anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
Cheap way to fix this (I did this recently when my power supply fan on a different computer was dead), take off the cover and aim a room fan at the box.  Gets annoying, but it works until you can replace the power supply or add a supplemental fan.<br />
<br />
If this cheap way fixes it, then look into buying a new power supply with better fan output or adding a supplemental fan to your case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First thing that popped through my ehad was a faulty memory chip.  If there  is a way, try and borrow some chips from somone you know doesn't crash and try that for a bit.<br />
<br />
Plus try all the others, power supply, heating ( Sometime the case off will heat it up more since you don't have controlled airflow )<br />
<br />
And my experiences with 2000 havn't been very good, I feel 98 Se is better than 2000, but am liking XP more now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have two suggestions.<br />
<br />
One was mentioned already - go for a clean format on your harddrive and reinstall with the latest drivers of everything.  I've seen some very odd problems get cleared up by doing this.  I reformat and reinstall clean about once every two years simply to keep my OS nice and clean...<br />
<br />
Two, try another video card.  Borrow one from a friend preferably, and install it on your newly installed PC.  Everquest is a funny game sometimes.  I was using a Radeon 64Mb something (I forget now) and no matter what I did, Everquest had zoning problems.  Logging in, or actually zoning from one to the next - I would get booted.  I bought a new video card as an upgrade and boom, everquest worked like a champ.  Go figure.  I'd call it a fluke except I had a friend who used to get random boots to the desktop (no warning or errors like you said) and when he put in a new video card that behavior stopped.  It's probably just buggy drivers not getting along with EQ, not verants fault, but it seems that EQ finds video card problems...  I hope you figure it out - nothing sucks more than a computer acting up and not allowing you to enjoy your video games.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Am having similar problems atm and have tried damn near everything.  I have every option possible off, old models, clipping to nil, phone lines checked, ram right below 512, case off, house fan on the box, tried multiple ISP's/modems and still LD or spike to near LD every few min.  <br />
<br />
I am running a P2 with 98se and NEVER had any trouble with EQ till SoL was installed.  Even with full chat and graphics during raids I used to be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A new isue I just heard of for the first time today has to do with linksys router/firewalls. It seems the latest drivers for the firewall breaks and reestablishes connection every 20 minutes to change the IP address to help prevent hacking. This seems to be playing heck with EQ players. The solution is to go back to the old drivers. Don't know if this helps ya or not, but can't hurt to put the info out. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You mentioned updating your video driver: did you update your sounddrivers too?  I was crashing to desktop until I got the very latest sblive drivers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have you limited the amount of ram to 1/2 gig EQ can not handle the amount of ram you have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, thanks a ton for all the suggestions everyone.  My current plans are to:<br />
<br />
1.  Put the case back on.<br />
2.  Go get the latest sound drivers (I play with a nosound.txt file in my EQ directory, so I didn't think sound could be an issue, but then again I do listen to MP3s while I play)<br />
3.  Remove the stupid ATI TV Tuner card I have (no one suggested this, but I don't use the card anymore and I figure it can't hurt).<br />
<br />
If none of that works I'll try stealing, er borrowing my housemate's ram and graphics cards to switch out with mine and see if that helps.  If that fails, I'll cry, beat my computer with a stick and then come back to the crucible to beg for more advice :0)<br />
<br />
One more question for wolfborn01: what's this about too much RAM for EQ?  I remember windows 9x had issues when you had too much RAM (I did a double take when I first found that out, then propmtly installed windows 2000), but I thought win2k didn't have such problems.  To be honest, I like to run with lots of the new models turned on, and so I can use all the RAM I can get.  However, any more info on this would definately be appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you feel like chopping holes in your case and adding fans, check out www.overclockers.com<br />
<br />
Heck, if you want to look at some really odd looking computers, check out their forums, the case gallery.  Some of these people do &quot;simple&quot; stuff, like painting the case to a nice shiny finish, while some do things like adding a watercooling system to it.  I even saw an experiment one time on cooling... guy overclocked a 300mhz system over 1 gig - but he used liquid nitrogen to cool it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Loramin,<br />
Sounds like you've got a good start on the problem.  A faulty RAM chip would certainly cause the problems you describe.  Also, faulty video drivers (or drivers that EQ doesn't like, ie ATI) can also cause it.<br />
<br />
I run Win 2000 on one of my EQ PCs, and have no problems.  Make sure that you have the most current win 2000 drivers for your video card.<br />
<br />
I'd re-install Direct X 8.1 just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Also, if you weren't aware, Win 2000 is built from Win NT, which means that the latest service pack needs to be run after installing new software.  Win 2000 isn't as bad about this as NT is.  You can get away without re-installing the service pack most of the time, but in your case, you want to get all your bases covered to narrow down the problem, so it would be a good idea.<br />
<br />
If you dont have service pack 2 (3 is out now, but haven't heard if it introduces any new bugs yet), you can download it from Microsoft's website (don't try this if you use a dial-up modem), or you can order it sent to you on CD for free.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was having a simular problem with my computer <br />
<br />
I found that limiting the amount of ram is being used fixed the problem then again I am running on windows 98. But when I looked this up on the EQ web site I don't think there was a specific windows version they where running it on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Loramin, I just figured out my problem after a month and since you are also running a GEforce2 I would HIGHLY suggest reinstalling the basic drivers for your vid card.  I did this yesterday and was shocked.  No more crashing, no more weird lag, and no more PL.  <br />
<br />
Something with the new GEforce drivers + my system hates EQ!!</div></div><hr />
