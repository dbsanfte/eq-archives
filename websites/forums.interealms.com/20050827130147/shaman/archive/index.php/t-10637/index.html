<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My situation: 57 Shammy, Run3, Regen3, MC2, and 4 points unspent (and most of a 5th). I have been considering the wisdom of not getting MC3 (was pathing toward can5). I basically have a very slim to no chance of getting torpor in the next 6 months or so, due to play time and other considerations. With all that out of the way, my question above stands. Can I make Can5 work well for me if I can't get torpor? If so, what kind of HP's do I need, and how do I get there? Are strategies that make it work in certain cases? <br />
<br />
I am at 2089 HP self buffed right now, with AC 1004 self buffed, in my standard gear. I do have a horse, JBB, solstice earring and Ikky, if any of those make a difference.<br />
<br />
Thanks, I have learned many things reading these boards, and look forward to learning even more.<br />

get 60 before you even worry about any of that.<br />
<br />
And yes its worth it. <br />
<br />
as long as you have more than 1924 hp and Kraggs Mending you are gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had canni5 for a few weeks before torpor, it's definately worth it, though you might wanna try to squeeze a few hundred more hps out (and get 60 first too)</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh. I know I worry too much. On the 60 issue, the playtime is interfereing with that. And I hate to not see xp bar move, so I work regular till frustrated then switch to aaxp to see the bar move. It may be corny, but it keeps me playing.<br />

<br />
Okay. I had alot of worries about agro below the 40 percent line, etc. Is it essentially a non-combat use thing no matter if you have torpor or not?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With your hit points (even self buffed), if you have Cann5 and you do it during battle you will definitely gain aggro quickly.  I would either get a bunch of +hp items, find a good high level cleric to always group with, or wait until level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clerics now sell ageo and virtue like chanters sell c3.  Lasts 3 hours and will give you plenty extra hp.  I need just a little over 1 aa for cani 5 I cant wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For people with Torpor and enough HP, cann 5 can be used in combat..and that's pretty spiffy.<br />
<br />
When you're under about 2300hp or so ubuffed, using it in combat can be REAL risky, so you probably won't.<br />
<br />
Since you won't be using it in combat with your setup, the fact that you have Kragg instead of torpor is a non issue...use cann 5 in your downtime.  Is it worth it then?  Hell yes, it's worth it for everyone now that Kragg is in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">canni 5 is never ever ever used when it will get you low health agro. Only thing thats good for is a trip to your bind point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Under 15-19% health, or so, you will get low hit point agro and nothing will taunt the mob off unless you die or get healed about that mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes,  Canni V is worth it before Torpor. As stated, restrict it to downtime useage until you get enough HP to avoid low hp aggro, and use KM to heal. With torpor you can start risking low hp aggro, although its best avoided if you can help it. Torpor is more efficient too.<br />
<br />
Is Canni V worth it before 60? Hell no - xp to 60 first. Ok ok so your xp bar doesn't move so fast, but 60 is worth it.<br />
<br />
With regards to getting torpor - try the emperor in Old Seb. Even if you don't get torpor, with luck you'll get some other bits and bobs to sell and raise cash to buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes can 5 is more than worth it anytime. Ive been going without torpor and had cann 5 for quite a bit now. <br />
   At first i didnt have alot of hps over so i used it more after pulls to catch up mana etc. Now my hps are finally over 3k and i can use can 5 during battles and still no torpor. I do have to watch what i am doing and depends on if its places where adds can happen but cann5 is a must have. Torpor may be more efficient and quicker but can5 and 2k heal is still lots lots better than can4 alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can't get Cann5 until at least 59 or 60 I think (don't remember) so getting it prior to that isn't really an issue.<br />
<br />
Definitely get it as soon as you've got the HPs to make it viable. Torpor only improves on the already good situation with Cann5/KM. It'll take you a while to adjust to using Torpor vs KM, but the mana difference makes it worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a simple answer ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes , its worth it , work on getting more HP though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Andisoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can 5 works GREAT with Torpor 2 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I cann5 all the time but generally end up with about 40% hps and torpor running. Not gained aggro yet even when I havent been cleric buffed and hit 30% hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am hurting for HP gear myself. about 28-2900 hp self buffed.  Raid buffed I can get over 4500, which rocks with Cann5. <br />
<br />
Right now, I get nervous Canning down during a fight, Self buffed, although I dont gain LH Agro at my current levels.  PoP mobs cant take out 300-600hp in a single hit.  If I were you I would get 60 first. Then get it but make sure you are Cleric buffed if you even think you may want to use Cann5 in battle.<br />
<br />
Nothing worries a group more then their slower Canni-porting himself to bind during a fight. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's worth it no matter what.  Best shaman AA skill there is.  MC3 is a hard row to hoe, but you'll enjoy the leetle bit of extra mana regen too.  Think of that third MC point as a FT1 item and think of what you would do to get such an item.   Then grind on ahead.  I'd stop AAxping for now tho and get 58 ASAP.  The percentage heal you get at that level will make an enormous difference in how you play.  I suspect you'll become a hp whore shortly after that level.  I didn't become too addicted to hps until I got canni5 meself.  Now I'm over 3100 hps unbuffed, 5650hps raid buffed.  That gives me a significant amount of leeway to use Canni5 during just about any fight.  <br />
<br />
Short answer: Get canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xoralundra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Get to 60 first, or better yet, get to 65. Then head straight for it. It should be the first thing you aim for when you decide your AA path.</div></div><hr />
