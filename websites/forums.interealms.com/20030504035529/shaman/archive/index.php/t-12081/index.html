<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tikothepally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im trying to level my shaman up from 56 asap, but have been discouraged that Malo and Topror are more rare than Malos and Quiesesence, and that they cost like 1.5-2x as much as the level 65 spells do in the bazaar. Should I just skip over them and try to get to 65? Or make an effort to get them through research camping etc?<br />

thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say you should at least try to get torpor if at all possible.  It'll make the road to 65 a lot more pleasant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really really like quiescence. I didn't think it would be possible to like something more than torpor, but quiescence was it. I havent gotten malos yet, and its on my list, but its one of those &quot;if i get it great, if not, its not gonna kill me&quot;. This maybe cause i have Malo, however. I agree with Kami, try to get torpor if you can, unless you just want to plow to 65 and you have the cash for quiesc or have access to rune drops. It will make the trip much more pleasent.</div></div><hr />

I have access to some plat, but Quiescience is cheaper here than Torpor, that was my original question :)<br />
<br />
thanks for the input so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's another thread somewhere asking the same exact thing...  Just go for Q, why spend time and/or money getting Torpor when you'll just have to upgrade it at 65?  Get flagged for PoV and 65 won't take very long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">skip malo, but grab a torpor if theres one for sale, if not dont worrie about it<br />
<br />
the snare portion helps alot while soloing for channeling, well not exping solo .. but farming greenies for charms etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the other hand...with Malo, Malos doesn't really matter that much, so the rune can be better served for someone else in your guild (once you have quies, FA, and Fo7 anywho, though blood of saryn is ok).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">quiescence is awesome i never had torpor but i have the 65 spell. i'm only one in my guild with it and i cast on the MT before pulling gods and hard mobs, since theres no slow/snare to it, the melee's don't mind having it cast on them.<br />
<br />
it also helps when you are the healer for your group, 200mana compared to 400-450 and is effected by spell haste and spell casting reinforcement.  i usually don't bother casting it when a cleric in the group cause their elixer spells over write it, even when i cani5 and say i'm healing myself they still feel the need to heal me and waste both our mana, but i guess clerics need to feal useful in xp groups.</div></div><hr />
