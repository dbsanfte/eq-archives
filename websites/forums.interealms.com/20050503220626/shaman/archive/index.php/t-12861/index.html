<br />
Im returning to EQ from a big long break (very much needed, burnt out!) anyway im starting a new account with EQ:New Dawn in the UK im just wondering can you still use the OLD EQ models or do you have to use those horrid luclin ones now?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can still use the old models......UNLESS you want to use a horse...then you must have new models on for your player characters race in order to use it. YES it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can have all the 'new style' models off and still be a Vah Shir or a Froglok and use and see horses and stuff on those races.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have an amulet of necropetence you can use and see horses with no dependancy on your race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm only using the original models, cuts down on<br />
lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use mostly new models, except trolls...I still think the chubby troll is best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The new Iksar model looks like its squatting to take a dump while its actually standing.  The wood elf race looks like its hunched over to the side while standing so somebody can stick something up their butts.  All classes when they walk now kind of walk like Christopher Lowel.  I just dont like em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.  Not even before they &quot;fixed&quot; it so that you had to have luclin models on to summon a horse, could you have both up at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ive heard rumor that you can use the new lizard mounts with the old models... is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Still a fan of new models here.  There are some animation issues I kinda dislike but overall I find them far far superior to the blocky, bland, uninspired old models.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah grump<br />
<br />
If my bear cant ride a horse then fooey.<br />
<br />
Well I know horse is standing mana regen, but... bear is bear.  Come on.  <br />
<br />
Fact is, bear for me means decent vision without added vision buff, and means added wisdom and a tiny hp regen.  Altogether, I hate to lose bear for horse.  And also I see myself as a big huggable bear.  All that together, well...  its hard to resist bear form.<br />
<br />
My big big goal is to be a Great Bear.  Sigh...   you are telling me that makes no nevermind?   <br />
<br />
I'm Lv 52 and charging on to 54 for Canni3.  But really once 54 I know I will do the bit extra for 55 and honorable Great Bear.  Except I'm hearing now, forget it.<br />
<br />
My shammy is an alt.  I will stop leveling when it makes sense.  Is 54 the place to stop?   Is Great Bear a figment of the past?<br />

I know it's not quite what you're after ... but become a little bear, shrink yourself once, then grow 3 times =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The new &quot;Space Marine&quot; barbys look pretty good, but I can't say the same for the &quot;WWF Smackdown&quot; ogres, &quot;Atkins Diet&quot; trolls, or &quot;Help me I'm puffy!&quot; Iksars.  At least they made an old model available for cats $$. :p</div></div><hr />
