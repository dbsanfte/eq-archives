<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has any tips on soloing in Sol Ro Tower. I'm sick of sitting for hours LFG cause I'm on CET time and most people that are on at that time are in GoD or only money hungry farmers that just want stuff for their twinks or to sell. Only decent I item I have from PoP is the Shield from Xuzl. Most of the rest I got from Hard LDON. I would at least like to try and upgrade my legs and boots. The legs have dropped for me twice in groups and both times I lost to a class that cant use them. Any more I just flat out tell them it's NBG by class if I do manage to get a group. If you got any tips let me know cause i know spliting the ones at the stairs would be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The protectors/sentries are immune to root and hit hard. They have a huge agro radius, so if two are close together you will have to deal with them both at once. I imagine a really well-geared shaman could probably solo one, but it wouldn't be fun. People used to solo the ones near the zone in by exploiting a pathing bug. I'm not sure if this is still possible.<br />
<br />
I think at one point you could solo in some of the towers (e.g., Xuxl's tower on the far left), but the last time I was through there, the mephits summoned. This was a change, and would make soloing there uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
I have had success duoing here with a monk, and I'm sure it would be doable with any melee partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How can you get to xuzl's tower? Just train and pray?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you train, you will prolly die...depends on luck really.<br />
with my gear/aa i can solo zone in mobs if i get 1 at a time..it can actually be a tough fight depending on how often you are getting max hit.<br />
i would suggest you get a class that can single pull and partner with them...i duo with clerics here, monks, SKs..never tried a chanter....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nemuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure it would be productive to solo here. However, I did duo breifly with a shaman here (i was playing necro) and did fine although short lived as rest of the group arrived. Agro range on these are huge and resistance to snare makes pulling single a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get a monk partner and enjoy the fun. The new monk lull makes this place awsome.</div></div><hr />
