<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khattasah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went from 30-36 in Dawnshroud Peaks fairly quickly. Key is the Mushroom Palace, a large house full of different shrooms on the Southwestern side of the zone between zone to Grieg's End and Sanctus Seru.<br />
<br />
30-34: Going to need a group, or at least a tank partner. Park yourselves on the eastern side of the shroom palace next to the double-arched entrance. Buff up your tank buddy and prepare for battle.<br />
            Pulling shroom #1: You don't even need to enter the palace for this one. These shrooms are aggresive and will aggro as soon as you come within their range. Shroom#1's aggro range extends outside the palace itself. All you need to do is walk up against the wall to the left of both arched doorways. The shroom will aggro from there and come running out after you. Pull back a ways from entrance and attack at will.<br />
<br />
           Shrooms #2 and #3 are in the first room right in front of you. Step up slowly on the shroom to the left and eventually you will get his attention and he will come out after you. Do the same for #3, he is much easier when #2 has already been pulled.<br />
<br />
          Shrooms #4 and #5 are in the room to the left where you pulled shroom #1 from. To pull #4 without pulling #5 you must step up slowly towards the large pillar in the center of the room. Come in a straight line from the doorway to the pillar and he will come after you. #5 is easy once #4 is gone.<br />
<br />
         If you are quick with pulls and don't have much downtime between them you can get #6. Re-enter room where 4 and 5 were and then simply step to the rear-right corner, where the wall bends. If you stick your head out around the corner you will see #6, and he will see you. ( Watch out for #1 re-spawning when pulling #6. Seems spawn time for these guys is somewhere between 10-12 minutes.)<br />
<br />
       Remember, try to not pull with a spell because in the rooms that have 2 shrooms in them you will have guarenteed adds. Also make sure you pull shrooms completely out of the palace. If you have them out and they start to flee they won't re-enter, but if they begin to flee while inside the palace they will start pulling friends out from other nooks and crannies.<br />
<br />
     Level 34-36: Now you have a pet so just solo these suckers. Completely buff yourslef and at least give your pet Talisman, Strength, Dex, and Quickness. Park your pet outside and pull as instructed above. Run out and have your pet attack to distract the shroom, now you are ready to turn and cast, I would usually cast a simple Envenomed Breath and then run up to take the hits. Don't leave your buddy alone too long, he really isn't all that tough.<br />
<br />
    At 34 I was getting 1 blue bubble of exp about every 2-3 shrooms, and took me only about 45min to an hour to get a whole bubble, depending on how much downtime I had after pulls. Not too shabby in my book.<br />
<br />
   These guys drop mushrooms than can be sold from 2.5pp-4pp each. The NO DROP ones can be used for a quest for additional XP in the zone at one of the camps, and ocassionally these little punks will drop LORE jewels that are used for the Twilight Armor Quests. I usally sold these and made about 100pp-200pp on each one. Once I sold one for as much as 250pp, but I think the guy was desparate. All in all, I would make about 100pp off of the shrooms every 2-3 hours, not including the jewels I sold.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some of you.<br />
Good luck and happy hunting, fellow Shammies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks a bunch for the great info on DP... I just hitched a ride to the moon and camped there, as I couldn't find a willing group. Going to make it happen tonight though! <br />
<br />
I have a question RE: Lag in the zone.<br />
<br />
Is this a problem for you as well? It seems pretty nasty for me and I was wondering if you had noticed the same. <br />
<br />
Thanks again, and looking forward to getting my doggy!<br />

The mobs ( shrooms) have low hp and dont hit hard.  This was some of the easiest exp I have yet to find and I will be bringing my new shammy here in a few levels.</div></div><hr />

Aye..lag is a problem for me also. I remember hunting in BW and having the same problem...too many damn trees. Seem to remember being advised to do a hard reboot after you zone in...supposed to help tho I've never tried it.<br />
<br />
Set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Still in Dawnshroud and having a blast... about to ding to 32 (i get to play once in a blue moon these days, with a baby, work, QT with the lady, etc) and plan to stay in the zone for a few levels. <br />
<br />
I did try to do a Hard reboot to alleviate the lag issues, but it do anything. The lag isn't as bad as it is in the bazaar, and I will continue to play through...I will say that it's one of the slower zones to fight in...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if any of you play on Cazic-Thule and are able to group with a 31 shaman, come to dawnshroud around 10pm PST and send Skol Longcut a tell.</div></div><hr />

Okies I'm lvl 31 atm with my Shammy on the Saryn Server.  I was curious is it impossible to single pull these 'shrooms say with somethinglike Ebreath then once it is far enough away from the rest just do the root/rott - cannidance routine for soloing or  is it just a suggesstion to gorup till at least 34 with these things?  <br />
<br />
BTW ignore the signature   i just dinged 31 this past weekend and forgot to change the siggy to reflect the new level before posting lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes it is possible to single pull the mushrooms in DSP solo.  I did it last  night, even with the equipment that I have (REIF, Ikky plate) there was too much down time doing this camp solo for the exp to really be decent.  I would advise getting a partner for this camp.  I did it with a paladin and later on with a druid.  Both were fairly effective.  I pull with slow as with regen up and the ikky BP they weren't really even putting a dent into my health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for recommending this great spot.  I was there yesterday and it is fantastic.  I would like to add a few things I noticed about this camp.<br />
<br />
First of all I camped in the area I guess would be considered the back-door on the hillside behind the temple.  There were no wandering MOBs here and it was a very safe place to med up. The other side was full of wandering Zelniaks and Lighcrawlers.  When I first got to this camp I had a rogue partner.  We started out with him pulling, but it didn't seem to work well because of the strange pathing.<br />
<br />
I decided to pull instead and I noticed something interesting about the aggro for the mushrooms here.  I could pull any mushroom with slow, and no matter how close it was to another shroom, it would not come with it.  If on the other hand the other shroom saw me, it would aggro very quickly.  This meant that pulling from the temple was a breeze.<br />
<br />
The pathing from the back of the temple is very strange.  The only shrooms that come straight at you are the ones outside.  If I pulled any others, no matter how close it was to me, it would go the other way and come all the way around the temple to reach me.  One time it took so long to get there I medded up another half bar of mana before the fight started.  <br />
<br />
One last thing to be careful of.  There is a single arched entryway at the back.  There is a shroom that spawns when you walk near this entry way and he will drop from above.  You'll see a message &quot;the ground beneath you begins to sprout mushrooms&quot; or something like that.  So remember to check this spot before you pull another shroom from inside, or you will have an ADD.<br />
<br />
Exp. was very good here and I could usually solo about 3-4 shrooms before needing to med up.  With my rogue partner we could usually clear the temple (8-10) pulls before needing to med.  This is by the way at 35th level.  Now 36th! thanks to the mushrooms!</div></div><hr />
