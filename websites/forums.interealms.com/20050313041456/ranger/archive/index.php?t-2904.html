<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eorendil</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I'm a ranger of the 30th seasone and I've done all the footwork and faction work in the Rain Caller quest.  I have it all but one thing, the hair from the goldenhaird mermaid.  I've done my research and under the suggestion of a couple higher level friends I sit endlessly outside and inside Kedge waiting for someone to show up to try for Phinny (for an epic I believe).  I've had my eye on this ever since I made my trueshot and though I know there are potentially much better bows (its basically a trueshot with stats and double range) in the game its the principle of the thing.  I guess during my time online people are too busy doing planes and other stuff to go into Kedge because it is dead. <br />
<br />
I'm honestly feeling a little disappointed.  My guild (bless them) isn't in any way going to be able to help me because of its size and, for the time being, disorganization.  If I wait till my character is level 40+ to get the mermaid hair I'm afraid I will likely be able to afford a &quot;better&quot; bow by that time.  I really want to finish this quest.  I've put a decent amount of work into it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm putting this out to my brother and sister rangers for advice on what I should do.  And for those of you on Terris Thule I'm hoping maybe you'll know of some people who might be going to Kedge.  I have the assistance of a 38 bard but for now that's it and though she keeps telling me she's going to go in and ge the hair herself I've been successfull, at least in the short term, in keeping her from commiting suicide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaeadin Stormcloud</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will only need a couple of people around level 55ish to get this done.  I'm not sure how difficult it is to mobilize a couple guildmates but if I were you I would check tracking at the zone inside Kedge and ask for the assistance of 2-3 people over guildspam if she's up.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can go there with a group ( level 35-45ish) for fantastic experience (assuming people dont kill themselves every 20 min when enduring breath wears off).  Once your in the zone let your guild know that nobody else is in kedge and that if anyone would like to make some killer experience then they should join you.  A small group of level 40ish people can easily handle the first room in kedge, just leave the Impaler alone unless your well balanced.<br />
<br />
If you want to find the mermaid, you need to head down the tunnel in the first room.  After going down a short distance, the area will open up into four rooms (North, South, East and West).  I cant recall which one leads to the Mermaid, but it will be one of the rooms with a hole in the ceiling.  Head up through the hole and you will find the mermaid a short distance ahead.  Make sure she is dispelled a few times and she wont be much trouble.  She is a druid so expect damage sheilds.  Good luck with the quest : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harijan</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">get a partner/friend  and take advantage of the best xp zone in the game, par none. <br />
<br />
Or solo them, if you pull the lancers to zone line, and beat on them for a while, zone out and heal, when you zone back in the lancer will still be there at the zone line patiently waiting for your return.<br />
<br />
I leveled 28-29 in there with a partner in 12 kills, Take advantage of the zone xp bonus, best xp I have ever found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Goldie is pre-Kunark. She doesn't need people over L50 to take out. I did it with one group that was mostly about L40, with one person that was L35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if she's an easy solo, she'd be green now and if pulled solo it would be easy enough.<br />
<br />
Eorendil, you're on Terris, it's been so long since I've done the quest but I think I could help you out. I actually have a Mane Attraction for CHA gear that I don't really need. That goes to Sanford, the feather goes to the princess, and from there it's a simple MQ. Let me see if I can find some time to get the gold dust piece. I have to admit though, I'm tempted to try to solo goldie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vogel</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As others have mentioned, a group of 40s should be able to take her with little trouble, even a well balanced group of high 30s would probably be ok. Just be careful of the exploding fish and EB timers. Oh, and she can be stubborn about showing herself, took me over 3 hours to get her to appear (same with the princess actually.) <br />
<br />
While there are certainly a whole host of better bows in the game, Rain Caller is great for the level you can get it and, as a ranger only bow, is rewarding in a role-playing sense as well. I certainly love mine! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trendari</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what we did:    Get a druid of at least a level that the mermaid cons blue. Bring yourself and another melee friend and the druid. Invis and swim down to where she is and pull her....swim back to zone and go ahead and zone once you know she is there behind ya. Have the druid be invis and when she and her train come target her and root her and zone himself (he can have an assist on you so can be casting while she coming in).  Now when you zone-back, she will be rooted and other mobs gone and you can then solo her at zone...have the druid remove the damage shield she has and nuke while you melee her.....easy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eorendil</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sent ya a message Underbrush.  Any assistance would be appreciated but as with anything I will continue to plug along regardless.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice guys.  And, Tendari, all I have to say is WOW! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could solo her easily UB.  She spends far too much time casting to do much damage to you and even then, she doesn't hit for much.  Just dispell her to drop her damage shields and its a cake fight at 60th.  Same basic strategy to solo Estrella, another easy solo in there.<br />
<br />
And Eorendil, if you catch her up and can't find anyone to help, send me a tell and if I'm not involved in a raid, I'll come assist you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, I figured it was like that. Another one of those mobs that was tough at the time but 20 levels later is soloable.<br />
<br />
Eorendil, if you catch me between raids I'll get a ride over and show you around level 1 and 2 of Kedge. You won't get any loot from Kedge but it remains one of the best places to xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm usually popping in and out of Kedge to see if Phinny is up so if you see me online I can probably help as well (raids pending :D)</div></div><hr />
