<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else notice that mounts are nerfed?  I used to be able to cast a really fast mount, ie. one that starts and stops on a dime.  But now, I cannot  :/    <br />
<br />
I believe it's because of the clipping plane fix they just did, but I'm not sure... <br />
<br />
Yer pal,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh, if thats the case then they didnt &quot;nerf&quot; the mounts, they fixed them. :)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You must have a slow mount to begin with  Twoflower.  It used to be that you could make a mount that would start and stop as fast as if you had no mount, just the mount's speed.  It was great for kiting without snare, not just for sitting and medding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed, as much as I'll miss this bug with my chain horse, its not a nerf, its a fix =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it's a fix, what's the point of buying anything other than the slowest horse? The 137k horse should definitely stop on a dime. That's what you pay for. The mana regen is the same. The health regen is the same. The ONLY thing the most expensive horse offers is speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that was originally supposed to be the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So am I misunderstanding here? On the fastest horse, you could cast while moving? If that's the case then yes, it needed to be fixed. However if the issue was that they stopped too fast, then I think they should have left it alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about racing out racing all the healers/slowers/buffers to the mob, i always thought it should be a guild goal to hand out/farm horses. Sometimes it doesnt feel like it cause your used to it, but your horse ( 103k one ) is blowing away SoW its not even funny.<br />
<br />
Thats not #1 important though i agree, cause if i hadnt made out so well from my droga venture, i wouldnt haven one, id be saving for something else like equip upgrades or spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue was that they could start and stop like you weren't even on a horse and move at bard speed. I don't think thats fair just on the most expensive horse, maybe on the drop only ones though. <br />
<br />
When they changed the option to have horses turned off and still get the benifit it at least worked the same for everyone. This only benefited certain people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">haha the last thing I wanna do is outrace everyone to a raid type mob. That's a quick trip to bind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think litgruv means for example racing to old raid content like Ssra, NToV or VT, where you still have to run a fair distance to get there.<br />
<br />
A Chain horse is very handy for places like these where it can actually shave a minute or 2 of the time it takes for you to reach the zone, which in a race situation actually means a lot.<br />
<br />
I don't agree that a guildbank should buy everyone chain horses as it would simply cost too much, although I do belive that they should help ensure there CHers all have at least a rope horse for chaining outdoors.<br />
<br />
This bug basically meant that instead of taking ~4 seconds to go from standstill to full speed or visa versa, the horse would do this pretty much instantly, making horseback kitting and the like far too easy.  Not to mention it had implications in PvP too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I * used * to be able to move, turn and cast while turning on my Enchanter. This really helped in Seb as I was able to shave a smidgeon of time off of casting.<br />
<br />
The ability to do that was explained to me as the distinction between the computer thinking you are not moving and there being a difference between where the computer thinks you are and where you are.  Otherwise when you stop, you need to sit there for a full second or so before being able to cast.<br />
<br />
(That /\ has to be one of the worst paragraphs in the annals of English Composition. Yeesh)<br />
<br />
I do notice that on the cheapy horse he needs a second to &quot;Giddyap and go&quot; as well as &quot;Whoa Nellie.&quot; (stop)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yea. in PoP it doesnt help alot i guess, but pre pop and even with LDoN itll be a nice help when your racing to a mob in Kael, AoW is valid target if you in elemental as well as Emp and VT. Not to mention im a adventurer, i travel to Seb, ,Droga,CoM, Hohb and many out of the way places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm, when buying a faster horse , there SHOULD be benefit.  You get what you pay for.   Fair, lol.  Even the slow mounts could be cast so that they would start and stop at top running speed.  So not sure what you're talking about when you mention how unfair it is.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I think that this 'fix' was inadvertant.  I believe it had to do with the clipping plane that they fixed a patch ago.  All ya had to do was go to the bazaar or somewhere really laggy and make sure that you were experiencing premium screen lag at the second your mount was being summoned.  <br />
<br />
Ahh well, that gravy train has been derailed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">or just have your mp3 player open and press 'add' just when the horse was about to go off.</div></div><hr />
