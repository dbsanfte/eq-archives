<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I know these get posted all the time but I am getting a little frustrated.  I am just wondering if I am missing a good place to mash with these two guys (I play them both).  I have played all the normal 50 or so zones (ie. KC, Dulak's, Char)  I dont think I am ready to handle the planes just yet so I am a little stuck.  Either loot or xp, doesnt matter (although both would be nice =)).  Groups are chill but sometimes I just want to chill out and play for a while.  For those of you that know, what would be the best place to kill with these guys?  Hell, even if you dont know, any advice or ideas?  I just want to make sure I am not forgetting any good zones or spots.  If you dont want to give away your spot (and I dont blame you), email it to me.  I play on Saryrn.  Thanks a lot for any advice...  Locke05@hotmail.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had seriously good fun, duoing with my wifes monk in CoM at these levels, do the stables for the Spectral Courier, do the Temple, Clear Temple basemant to pick up your Icon. Clear the Goo house, and the two houses pass it, that seem to nave no name.<br />
<br />
If your doing well/leveling, try the U-turns/Gazebos.<br />
<br />
And don't forget to pick up the 6 notes, for your epic.<br />
<br />
You might get lucky and happen across a raid who doesn'y need Lord Ghiosk's books.<br />
<br />
And the best thing about CoM, apart from the odd raid, THERES NO-ONE THERE !  No trains, no whiners, no camp/kill stealers, just you, your partner and lots of static mobs, Bliss :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CoM is changing in tomorrow's (7/10/03) patch so be carefull if you go there.<br />
<br />
CoM can take you to 54 pretty easy.  I think the front end of zone (templ/stables) area started to go light blue around 52.  The goo house was still DB at 54 and most of the back bowling alleys are about the same.<br />
<br />
Dulaks Harbor caves should be good till about 54 if IIRC and the loot was great.<br />
<br />
Of course you have the Nobles in HHK.  When those were camped I would head to Kaladim and zone in and start pulling the little dorf Fort at zone in.  8 mobs, same exp as HHK, more HP and a little tougher to break but never, ever camped (I think I'm the only one on my server that ever camped them).  Should take you to 54 ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LoY is great at those levels. Dulak's Harbor, you could be doing boat 2 or 3 together, and maybe get yourself some Rust Encrusted Leggings. It has a good balance of exp and cash drops in my mind, including the chance of diamonds and blue diamonds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gambum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hornets in Burning woods.  From DL, hug the left wall till you see the Hive, there's a gully behind it, set up camp there.  Mobs have low hp and very low MR/CR, if you have a jbb you'll rip thru them.  3 static spawns, easy to split and a ton of roamers that are easy to single.<br />
<br />
The zone is very quiet and a little more accessable than CoM.<br />
<br />
If you have an Ikky monk, forage for radiant metorite for the shackle quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks so much for the responses all.  I camped CoM a while back when I was like mid 40's but I never really went deeper.  I might have to give that a whirl.  I tried to duo that 3rd boat in Dulak's and it was a little too much for me at the time.  Then again I just hit 51 so I have better slow and heal (damn that was a great spell lvl).  Anyway thanks for all the ideas guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd suggest Nadox...  taking down shrine bruisers at the entrance to Torgirian Mines.  Easy to single pull, they don't run at low health, drop 6-8pp each plus weapons and gems, and there's plenty for you to take down... and usually very little competition in the zone.</div></div><hr />
