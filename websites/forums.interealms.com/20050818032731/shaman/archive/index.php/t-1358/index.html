<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well .. i had typed alot and the stupid system is crapping out .. GRRRR...<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
This is like any other planes .. and there are plenty of breakin guides .. go to yahoo and type EQ Growth guide<br />
<br />
- Hard to get a PoG raid cuz of tree-huggers protecting their factions<br />
- Watch for the 1(sometimes 2) protectors.. Zone wide agro .. and cant be mezed.. They come running as soon as you pop uninvised or when they pop.. Takes 5-10 minutes for these guys to get to your east-side camps<br />
- Most armour drops on west side of river... zone-in is on east side.. (yeah just like fear.... you have to fight your way through for the good shaman mobs)<br />
- Watch for mini-mobs &quot;yelling&quot; for help ( i think all planes do this???).. not sure if it's an agro radius thing .. or line between puller and mob.... They yell for their &quot;friends&quot; (mobs of same type) to help.... <br />
<br />
If any groups on Veeshamn want a troll shaman</div></div><hr />
