<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I finally got IGS a few weeks ago, and now one of, if not my best items seems to be outclassed.  At the moment, I have both, and I'm trying to decide what to do.  The death shroud seems really great, and I could use the cash from the IGS for some much needed upgrades (lvl 57 and wearing a spider fur cloak, jarsath bracer, etc).  I'm sure that the best answer is 'keep them both and swap'.  That seems a little silly considering that would give me two good shoulder items, and total crap in about 4 other slots.<br />
Any advise from those in the know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tricky!<br />
<br />
How far off 58 and cann4 are you? I remember being amazed at how good this spell was after cann3, mana became easy to come by.<br />
<br />
It's entirely a personal decision. Live with the ob shroud for a week and see if you notice a significant difference perhaps?<br />
<br />
Personally I'm not gonna swop out items I like the stats on for focus items, I have a plan and Im sticking to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you are really hurting for cash I wouldnt recommend selling off the IGS to fund other upgrades, granted I'm on tallon so my view is most likely not the general one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Death shroud was selling for 65k on my server . . . or the ppl were asking that anyhow.  Others were WTB it, so i imagine they came to some sort of agreement.<br />
<br />
The death shroud is the more valuable item now.  Seems funny eh?  I'd sell it and wear the IGS.  Reason being, when they add more focus items later on, the shroud will lose value.  The IGS will remain same value.  It has the same attraction for the same classes, very nice melee shoulders too with excellent resists for raiding or general use.  With NPC casters being smarter nowadays, it might be a good idea to stick with some gear that gives resists.  Would suck to get nailed for full dmg on a couple ice comets.  With decent resists that wont happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Would sell the ODS.  Just remember that all the wis and mana regeneration you have means nothing if you get nuked flat because your resists are lacking. <br />
<br />
It still irks me that trolls can't use IGS.  One more reason to get my SoE finished up :)</div></div><hr />
