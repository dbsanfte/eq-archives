I really like this picture.  From our last Vindi attempt.  Vindicator jumped us but this was still our best attempt.  Here we are using a &quot;walking backwards&quot; tactic that FoH uses on Tormax.  Wulfran and Rizz, our main tanks are buried amongst that pile of 3 giants.  Two of the giants are pets.  The rest of the melee deal damage from behind, while the clerics and wizards stare at the walls =(.  In the end lag had the better of us.<br />

Old friends getting together again.  This was on our Cazic Attempt with Legion.  Jinxter I've known since level 6 when he gave me a Damask robe, and went on to get both of us kill countless times in exciting new places.  At about level 24 Togashi and Jinxter started talking to me about this new guild called Legions of Tears.  A few weeks later I joined.  Eventually it did end in tears, but this guy called Rizz, who was for awhile an officer of LoT encouraged me to join his guild KoE.  So whenever I bitch and winge you can blame these two, Jinxter and Togashi.  For you new lot to the guild Togashi use to be KoE as well.  Ironically our guild faces the same dilema's with people leaving today as it did 12 months ago.<br />

This next picture is from what I like to recall as our &quot;Cobs&quot; Naggy raid.  Here we see an intelligent discussion between myself and the raid leader regarding nagafen tactics.  If you can't read the purple text the first line says.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Does Dragonsbane work on Nagafen?&quot;.<br />

Just a little Guk AE with Ransure (Taul) - a pretty small pull this one.  Keep in mind all that damage shown cost me under 350 mana.  Hmmmm, is that the ghoul lord on target?  <br />

Another shot from the &quot;Cobs&quot; raid.  (we should raid Cobs more often IMO)  Here the elite forces form a blockade in case any &quot;gimps&quot; decided to be funny.  Nice position guys.<br />

Here's Koe completing part of the Giantsbane quest for yours truely.  Wulfran got a little bitchy about levitate - you know them barbarians, afraid of heights.  Notice the large amount of people?  Ye of little faith.  Should be noted we took down the same NPC yesterday for Mister J. Love with 1 War 1 Shm 2 wiz.  Yes, thats right.  4 people, no cleric.  Bite me.<br />

Here's me on the second playable day of Luclin.  Two's always better than one I always say.  The effects didn't stack though :mad: <br />

And this last one is what Rizz likes best about being Guild Leader.  Notice the bodies in the background.  There's more out of frame.<br />

<br />
We lose people, and we gain people.  In the end, good people stay on our friends lists.  Sometimes I yearn for &quot;the old days&quot;, and sometimes I look to the future.  Perhaps life is a balance of both.<br />
<br />
In any event, great pics!  Best pic I got of the fight is still in my brain, not my computer - and it's of Vindi mushing my face into pulp :P<br />
<br />
{edit addition, no other changes made} -- Rizz is God:)</div></div><hr />
