<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Taken from TSN's website (Canada's equivalent to ESPN)(Dec. 11)  - There is something quintessentially Canadian about the raging battle for forward spots on the Olympic team. If nothing else, this competition is a celebration of the tryout, a ritual that every Canadian boy worth his salt experiences every year. And it is one that even the game's biggest names must go through to prove they are worthy to experience Salt Lake City. <br />
<br />
Now, that's not exactly true for the five forwards who were officially named to the Olympic team last season -- Mario Lemieux, Joe Sakic, Steve Yzerman, Paul Kariya and Owen Nolan. <br />
<br />
But for every other Canadian candidate up front, the tryout has been the thing. <br />
<br />
Going into the Canadian team's mini-camp in September, players such as Keith Primeau, Mark Recchi, Pierre Turgeon and Joe Niuewendyk appeared solidly entrenched within the top 13 forwards. Players like Brendan Shanahan and Jarome Iginla were not, so much so, in fact, that Brenden Morrow and Alex Tanguay were initially invited to the camp while Shanahan and Iginla only got there because of last-minute injuries to Sakic and Simon Gagne. <br />
<br />
Now, though, Iginla and Shanahan are fully expected to be amongst the 13 forwards named on Saturday, while Nieuwendyk, Recchi and Primeau find themselves on the bubble and Turgeon is no longer a consideration. Neither, for that matter, is Jason Arnott. Iginla and Shanahan have literally played their way onto the team and they're not alone. <br />
<br />
Coming out of the September mini-camp, Eric Lindros, Michael Peca and Theo Fleury were excellent bets to make the team. After slow starts for Lindros and Fleury in New York, the two Canadian members of the Rangers' fly line have stepped it up and it's difficult to imagine them not being on the team. Peca's play this season makes him an automatic, which means eight of 13 spots are spoken for. <br />
<br />
Iginla should make it nine, and while there's some chatter that Shanahan's spot on the roster is not yet carved in stone, we're prepared to say he'll be there. That's 10 spots gone. <br />
<br />
Of the young guns invited to the September camp, guys like Alex Tanguay, Brenden Morrow, Anson Carter and Simon Gagne, the Flyer winger has elevated his play like no other, to the point where he's a favorite to a claim a spot. There goes spot no. 11. <br />
<br />
That leaves only two berths and we still haven't found room for Nieuwendyk, Recchi and Primeau, all of whom were on the 1998 Olympic team. And then there's the Ryan Smyth situation. For a time, his broken ankle looked as though it would dash his Olympic dream but it's looking more and more like Smyth, who was entrenched as a top 13 forward before the injury, will be named on Saturday. <br />
<br />
And we can't ignore what Joe Thornton has done. Ditto for Anson Carter and Jeff O'Neill, who are still in the picture, but barely. <br />
<br />
We'll suggest that Smyth will get one of the final two spots, leaving Nieuwendyk, Recchi and Primeau or Thornton, Carter and O'Neill all vying for the last vacancy. Take your pick, but we're giving an edge to Nieuwendyk, because he has two things going for him. One is experience, the other is how well he's played this season and, let's remember, the tryout is the thing. <br />

DAMN we look good!!! And our forwards are supposed to be the weakest part of our roster...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe Fazzie I was thinking the same thing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forwards are one thing, who's your goalie again? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And another thing Wulf...if you think for one minute your Canadoh team is gonna try and squabble on USA home turf this Olympic year, you're sorely mistaken.  I can't wait for the home team chants of USA USA USA during the games, man it already sends a chill down my spine :)<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;BOTH&lt;/b&gt; teams have the depth, after all, what other contintent in the world can sport these kinda players and number of players, as well?<br />
<br />
http://nhl.com/olympics2002/usa_chart.html<br />
<br />
Just as you listed the ones in your post, I'll post USA's. :D<br />
<br />
Drury, Modano, Roenick, Weight for Centers<br />
Amonte, Guerin, Hull, LeClair, Tkachuk, Young for Wingers<br />
Leech, Rafalski, Chelios, Suter for Defense<br />
Dunham and rookie Blues Goalie Brent Johnson<br />
<br />
Should make for some exciting hockey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Goaltenders: Curtis Joseph, Sean Burke, Martin Brodeur, Eddie Belfour (Patrick Who? He's a great tender but definately not irreplacable, as the above show)<br />
<br />
Defense: Chris Pronger, Rob Blake, Scott Niedermayer are confirmed. Others vying are Al MacInnis, Adam Foote, Scottie Stevens, Wade Redden, Ed Jovanovski, Derek Morris and Eric Brewer <br />
<br />
There's the rest of the guys in running.<br />
<br />
As I said before: the US Team has a good group of forwards but their goaltending and blue liners aren't as strong as us. A lot of the US d-men are pretty long in the tooth (yeah I know MacInnis is pretty close to 40 too but he's not our entire corps :p ), and while Olympic hockey isn't as physical as the NHL, its a lot of games in a short time. The question for Team USA is goaltending: last time around they had the Beezer and Richter, now they lack a proven winner.<br />
<br />
Crowd Chanting &quot;USA, USA&quot; bah! Whatever! All it will take it Roenick getting run over by Lindros, or Pronger lowering the boom on Amonte to end that.  :p Canada vs USA should be magnificent to watch.<br />
<br />
Real Question of the Olympics will be this: can Hasek single handedly win his team the gold medal again? Will teams have learned from the last Olympics in Nagano, to put some traffic in front of him?</div></div><hr />
