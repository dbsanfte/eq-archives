<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laguna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't have much experience with PvP.  The other night our guild got together in the arena and dualed eachother for fun.  I made out pretty well.  Then I fought a bard friend of mine.  He ran circles around me, drained all my mana, debuffed me, then proceeded to pound me down.  Malos would land and I could hit him with epic dot.  Nothing else landed, dog-dog did very little damage and I was dead in about 10 minutes with him at about half life.  He even managed to cure himself of malos and and my epic dot on and off throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice for soloing bards PvP?  Perhaps one of the magic based spells from LDON would help?  Any way to resist the mana drain or the debuffing?  I'm pretty much a PvP newb but I can't see how any mana-based class could stand up to a lvl 65 bard with descent gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have no chance unless you bring a truck load of clicky items with you and the bard falls asleep as the keyboard.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't offer much advice, but as far as how the songs work... mana drain and Occlusion/Harmony of Sound (resist debuffs) are not resistable.  Psalm of Veeshan means obscene resists.   The chants also further debuff your resists once they land.  Good luck... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Outdoors 1 on 1 I don't waste my time fighting bards. They are the most annoying class in EQ to pvp against. They mez you easily and strip all your buffs. Their manadrain is unresistable and fast. <br />
<br />
My advice is to stand in one spot and chain cast spear of torment when they run in range. Their main weakness is they lack healing. You can nuke lesser geared bards to death if you are lucky. I also carry items like Ivandrys Hoop for bards. Chain click that sucker on them for some mana-free damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just another little thing that might help is if you have Virulent Paralysis.  It might not land, but maybe after malo you might be able to get it to stick.  This would stop the bard from running around you and keep him in range for the nukes.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you can get the spell: Bane and land that on the bard it would make very short of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can't dot a bard.  (or reliably debuff them at all) ... they can dispell anything you land on them at a whim and then just bring their own buffs right back up, and continue to debuff you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only way to have any hope in pvp against a bard is:<br />
1) have max crit nukes<br />
2) hope he doesn't have ancient mez<br />
3) fight him in a closed area where you can be in the middle<br />
4) chain nuke him with spear of torment and hope enough land to kill him<br />
<br />
If any of these conditions are not met, you will lose. I have never died to a bard, and I have only killed a bard once. The time I killed the bard, I got lucky with a couple of full dmg crit SoTs.</div></div><hr />

Note to Tukko: Virulaent paralysis checks against disease, Malo does not debuff disease resist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get an extended range item and use SoT.  Malo and Nuke for all youre worth before he takes your mana, then use epic if he is still alive at that point.  Stinging warts are fine but Disease dot yourself and save the debuffing of the potions.  Stinging wart is considered a buff and will be stripped as soon as he passes you again.  The new snare potions might work on them.  I know they worked on lvl 66 mobs in PoE.  Not long but for a bard, its long enough to make them rethink their strat mid fight.  And thats to your advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">basically ya wanna make the bard have to think about what they are doing. If ya can counter their normal routine of manadrain debuff kill then ya have a chance. If ya can get the bard into a defensive mode early ya might be able to push the advantage and kick his butt. Definitely don't wanna be outdoors, way to easy for them to run away and regroup, the smaller the area the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">gate</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only a stupid bard stays within range long enough for you to load on many dots to prevent curing. <br />
<br />
Bard will outrun you, cure, come back, manadrain... rinse repeat. Then you die/run. Ancient mez only accelerates it all.<br />
<br />
Depending what resists the bard has, strats may vary. If you can actually land spells on him you have a sporting chance. I'd suggest insid.decay followed by dogburn and then VP. Add malos + root + blind and just keep applying the latter two and throw in a blood of saryrn once in a while. If you get root to stick, don't nuke and use dots without intitial damage. <br />
<br />
Versus a bard with good resists, do what Shiner and Einnod suggests. Or just save yourself 20mins and run/gate at once.</div></div><hr />

The malo line does not debuff disease resist.  It will have no impact on your ability to cast Virulent Paralysis on someone/thing.</div></div><hr />

kk malo doesnt debuff disease thats why we get the unresistable disease buffs such as this one below.  <br />

1 sec cast time, unresistable, pop that on the bard then hit the bard with the VP. problem solved (unless he has really high disease resist, then your still screwed)<br />
<br />
And sure it will only last as long as the bard doesnt dispell it or ya nuke him, but it could mess up any plans he has made for your death.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You do not beat competent bards in a duel.  Indoors (Thurgudin) would give you a possible chance, since they won't be able to run away with their speed songs.  With no mana, you're left to melee, and while bards aren't great DPS, they still kick our butts at it, plus they will still be able to cast on you.<br />
<br />
Bards are nothing but an exercise in frustration.  The fact that you survived 10 mins is actually pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Muhahaha,<br />
<br />
Easiest way to fry a bard is by doing something they don't expect and don't have songs up for :P<br />
<br />
Bards are expecting you to cast, and will have things like mana drain, mez, cures and selo's memmed ....<br />
<br />
What bards won't have memed when fighting casters are their Damage shield and close range DoTs songs up (which is how they fight melee).<br />
<br />
Sooooooo, easiest way to beat a bard is nuke SoT until your mana is gone, then Can4 and MD, VP (for root), Spirit Call, and Rabid Bear (after MD, you don't use any mana, you just melee them to death because most won't have their counter Melee songs memmed).<br />
<br />
Personal favourite weapon to use while Rabid is the 2HB stick from PoFire (its got a 400DD proc), Righteousness (100DD stun) or Spinebone (Cold DD proc) ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, once you use this approach, the Bard may be prepared for it next time .....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem with that plan is you have to have a really solid weapon.  After probably 100+ bird kills we've seen exactly two of those staffs, neither of which I happened to be on for :(<br />
<br />
I'll add the option of getting 2 SKs to HT him at the same time to my earlier option of just gate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have never dueled so I can't really give that great advice just a few theories I've thought up.<br />
1. Shiny brass idol effect: instant cast devine aura<br />
This would seem pretty handy for duels granted you can't cast for the duration of it's effects, I am not sure if you can melee though. If at the least it would throw him off gaurd.<br />
2. Blind? I am sure he can cure this but if you can land a few blinds on him it would give you a chance to reposition yourself.<br />
3. Spirit call, and suspend minion would both seem very handy here too. Suspend your pet untill you feel the time is right, I am sure he can dispatch the pet quick unfortunatly.<br />
4. We got a few handy pots too, one that comes to mind is a spirit shift.<br />

anyways I hope that helps at least a tiny bit.. good luck.<br />
oh yea /feedback nerf bard!!!!!!!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've duelled bards 5 times, 2 wins, 2 losses, 1 tie.<br />
<br />
Basically to win any duel you want to pit your strength against your opponent's weakness.<br />
<br />
So against your typical warrior -- with low DR -- VP, disease dots, hide behind tree to avoid arrows, tell funny stories /ooc, and laugh.<br />
<br />
Against your typical enchanter put low level disease dot on self to avoid mezz, put on high MR, get in close for melee, bash, and overwhelm with dps.<br />
<br />
But against a bard -- your biggest strength is dots, and he knows it, and he has a powerful defense against it.  He'll be singing resist songs out the wazoo, you'll never land anything on him.  Dots against a bard = your strength against his bigger strength = victory for bard.<br />
<br />
But a bard's biggest strength of all is mobility.  Don't fight a bard in an outdoor arena.  Ever.  No point to it:  you're going to lose.  Any time you try you are putting your weakness against his best strength = victory for bard.<br />
<br />
One weakness of many bards is:  they panic easily when you take away their mobility.  The trick is to fight in a tight room where it is hard to maneuver.  High keep is good for this.  Rooms or houses in many zones work fine.  Inside a building in Thurgadin is excellent.<br />
<br />
Another weakness of bards is:  they really are not that good at melee, offense or defense.  If you have worked your melee skills, you could probably match a bard both in dps and in defense.  And you are a much better healer than he is.  <br />
<br />
My best victory was when I (ahem) let a bard sucker me into a duel in Ice Clad Ocean.  Good spot for him, wide open areas to run, great visibility.  I bound under water near the gnome village; cast and fully buffed a pet, then suspended it.  <br />
<br />
We started the fight a short distance apart.  When we said Go, I immediately gated.  Then I taunted /ooc that he couldn't kill me because he couldn't even find me.  <br />
<br />
Next I used a potion to cast Illusion Gnome, and moved to the gnome village.  I went inside an igloo, unsuspended my pet, and told him to guard there.  I put a DS on with a potion.  I went outside to the door of the next igloo.  Kept taunting /ooc.  He tracked me down, of course, figured out that I was in the village, finally figured out that I had turned into a gnome, and came charging in on me.  I ran inside the igloo to hide.  But he knew he had me now, so he came right into the igloo after me.<br />
<br />
I stepped in back of him into doorway of igloo, clicked Rabid Bear, and commenced to melee.  In fat old bear I completely blocked the doorway. Selos is worthless when you are locked inside an igloo.  With Rabid Bear, maxed 2hb skill, and Bone Shod Great Staff, my melee was about the equivalent of his.  <br />
<br />
But Alpha Dogdog, guarding one igloo over, immediately came to help, and started attacking right through the wall of the igloo.  Took Mr Bard a moment or two to realize what was happening.  He turned to attack the dog, realized that was a mistake, and turned back to hit me again.  <br />
<br />
In between swings I constantly cast cancel magic on him, stripping his buffs as quickly as he could re sing them.  I had 11 junk buffs up, then a low level disease dot to avoid mezz, plus Focus, Sta and DS.  He cancelled 8 of my 11 junkers.  Every time he hit me -- and he hit me a lot -- he took damage from the DS.  I also cast Malicious Decay on him several times:  it's just a debuff, it does no actual damage, but its unresistable so it lands every time.  I did that to make him worry about why he wasn't resisting this &quot;disease dot.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I had myself wedged hard in the doorway, but he still managed to interrupt me some.  Even so, I was able to channel through Spirit Call 3, and 5 more dogs popped into existence.  (It was quite crowded inside that igloo by now, but almost everyone there was on my team.)  <br />
<br />
I channeled through one Quiescence, and that was enough.  Quiescence heals 50 hp per second; bard melee isn't quite that much.  If you have backed into a corner or wedged yourself in a doorway, you can probably channel Quiescence at least one time out of three tries.  <br />
<br />
But just in case, I had a 10 pack of Stinging Wort set up on a hotkey, for 300 point instant heals if I had gotten down below 30 % health.<br />
<br />
Once the bard came inside the igloo to kill me, it was all over in maybe a minute and a half.  He got me down to about 45 before Q hit, but I was back up to 60 and rising when he fell into the snow.  <br />
<br />
Also, when he got down to about 25, he stopped fighting and tried to run away, trying to squeeze past me out the door of the igloo.  I couldn't hit him well at that point, because I was twisting to make sure I had that door blocked:  but the six dogs didn't have any trouble eating him up.  <br />
<br />
So.  If you're going to duel a bard, find a mobility-restricted environment.  Inside an igloo is great, but any small room where you can block the door is fine, as long as you can trap him in there with you.  Get a lot of junk buffs up.  Give yourself Focus, Sta, a low level disease dot, and a potion damage shield.  Plan on doing all your damage with melee and pets.  Wedge yourself in so that it's harder for him to interrupt you, so you can heal yourself and get your swarm pets out after he's trapped.  You have strong enough heals to overcome his melee damage.  He doesn't have strong enough heals to overcome yours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">All of you bluebies have no clue. First of all if the bard has = gear to you then you can't kill him. all my resists are over 300 so bard DoT in pvp do nothing to me. they try and drain my mana but always have c5 on like i do and canni5/ breath of trushar means i can out regen that mana drain. as far as trying to kill him if the shaman has better gear it's simple. Bust out the poison nuke. ya it's only 400damamge or so pvp but u chain that on him and he will eventually go down. now if the bard has tme gear don't even bother trying to nuke but for those bards with average gear just keep a malos on and drop nukes.<br />
<br />
Now for the newbie that said shamans suck in pvp. I personally am damn near unkillable in PvP. with my BoT i can keep myself above 75% to avoid DT easily and shamans can just load up the fat DoTs and drop some cold nukes. Granted i have 6 clickies and keep potions on me to break mez and a full bag of pumice to dispell the crap out of ppl. Shaman by no means suck in pvp but if you don't know what your doing you can get rocked. Shaman own in mass pvp also i am personally responsible for lots of death in mass pvp simply because i can malos someone and then use ornate legs to chain root them. I call the racial assist then and ppl jump on the person being rooted and get owned.<br />
<br />
It's all about knowing what to do if you are clueless like 99% of the bluebies then your gonan get rocked. But for someone like me who is in the top guild on my server and lives for pvp ( only reason i play is to get better gear to pvp ) shamans rock and i love being one.<br />

Yes, Kumarri, it is clear that in your strategy you know what to do:  you kill bards who have lesser gear than you do.<br />
<br />
I personally think it's more fun to win when you are geared at about the same level as your opponent, and manage to out-think and out-fight him.  But on your Redbie server you are free to have fun taking out people that have inferior gear, if you like doing it that way more.</div></div><hr />

Red server players just love to put down &quot;bluebies&quot; on other servers, yet they constantly complain about being ganked, and those who dont complain about being ganked are like our fellow Kumarri here who does the ganking, killing lower level or inferiorly equipped players just because its &quot;fun&quot;.

So u wouldn't be able to sit there and tank them while they mana drain and expect to stay alive. <br />
<br />
Trust me no shaman can kill a time geared bard cause they have resists to the point where 80% of nukes won't land and most of them will regen enough HP with there songs to outdo our melee. So yes you can basically only kill inferior bards on pvp servers it's just the way it is. some class just don't match up well to others and a bard is the worst class for a shaman to fight simply because they can cure everything we put on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">btw the igloo trick was genious my hat of to you sir :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">also i can kill lots of other classes just fine with = or better gear bards just happen to be the only class that can't. problem is on my server that everyone is worse geared than Pande ( my guild ) cause we have a stranglehold on the server. The only ppl that can have = gear to me or better are my guildies or server transfers so it's very hard to ever get pvp where it's a well geared player fighting against us. the thing on our server is that the 2nd and 3rd top guilds on the  server ( none time flagged and as of 5 days ago they dropped there first PoP god xegony ) are allied and have this nice bluebie rotation of mobs pop and below so that they don't have to fight. but we regulary have to fight both guilds together so usually when me or my guildies are fighting it's 3 to 1 odds against us. Ya they may have worse gear but the odds make up for it a bit. <br />
<br />
We also like to c@ckblock  and we go in alot and own them on mobs just cause most of them talk alot of crap and train and hack and crap. the reason the ppl on our server aren't well geared is because they only get what we let them have. thats basically how it is. <br />
<br />
Pretty much every player from a blue server that has come over has seen our mass pvp and just had there jaws drop. Until all of you see it you guys can't trully understand the nature of pvp servers. Pvp on our server is brutal and thats putting it lightly. mass pvp battles include bind rushing CC'n xp killing and generally dirty tactics. it's just teh nature of the server. <br />
<br />
As it stands right now pande has a lockdown on GoD. when any other guild enters GoD we have hit squads dipsatched to kill them and make them leave GoD. <br />
<br />
And i'm sorry for how i came across b4 that wasn't my intention. i tend to post when i'm ready to go to bed and am tired and don't always think through what i was typing. i don't want to get into a war since these boards are here to help all of us and for us to share info so if I came across kinda crossly them i apologize. <br />
<br />
Anyways now that u guys can transfer u should come check Tz out. <br />
<br />
Would be cool for you guys to get the real lowdown on how everyting goes down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well.  <br />
i'm sorry for how i came across b4  I accept your apology.  We're all trying to learn how to play the game better here.  There's plenty to learn.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go out on a limb here and try to point something out to you, Kumarri, friend to friend.  That doesn't always work well in person, and it often gets messed up when you try to do it in writing, but here goes.<br />
<br />
Speaking frankly here, Kumarri, you came across in your earlier post as an arrogant thug.  Your apology seems to indicate that you don't want to come across like that, and yet the facts seem pretty clear that you are  an arrogant thug, in a guild of arrogant thugs.  Probably that's not your intention.  But it certainly sounds like that is the procedure your guild follows:<br />
<br />
The only ppl that can have = gear to me or better are my guildies or server transfers so it's very hard to ever get pvp where it's a well geared player fighting against us. ... the reason the ppl on our server aren't well geared is because they only get what we let them have. thats basically how it is. ... when any other guild enters GoD we have hit squads dipsatched to kill them and make them leave GoD.  <br />
<br />
That's a pretty clear indication of your intentions there.  I think you're also trying to tell me that its not really your fault that you can't get a good fight with an equivalent-gear bard, because you kill them all off before they can get equivalent gear.  <br />
<br />
So I appreciate your invitation to come over to your server.  I'm sure it's well meant.  But honestly, it looks to me like it give me this choice:  Do I want to come over and get beaten up by the playground bullies, or do I want to come over and be one of the playground bullies?  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.  I think you and your guild must be having fun.  Apparently the other guilds are too, or they'd leave.  And if y'all are having fun that way, who am I to say you shouldn't get to do that?<br />
<br />
Still:  <br />
Anyways now that u guys can transfer u should come check Tz out.  Would be cool for you guys to get the real lowdown on how everyting goes downIt isn't how everything  goes down.  You like to play the game a certain way:  with your guild ruling the world and killing anyone who tries to advance to equal you.  Other players like to play the game another way:  with guilds competing to advance, sometimes cooperating, sometimes duelling or guild warring.  Still others like to play still another way:  with a spirit of family and fun in taking on progressively harder adventures.  <br />
<br />
So isn't it -- ummm, arrogant? -- to claim that the way you like to play the game is the way everything  goes down?  <br />
<br />
That's all.  We've probably hijacked this thread too much already.  I won't say any more, but you can go ahead and have the last word if you want.  Peace to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Damn you, Macnair, I was just typing something up about bully vs. victim when you beat me to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">macnair, you are batman.<br />
<br />
I've not pvped on my shaman but one of my original char was a bard on rallos, there's no way I would have followed anyone into a small space like an igloo, but it's a great story, I love how you go bear to block the entrance<br />
<br />
not that it's a big deal either way but you have to remember that kumarri and pandemonium are on a pvp server.  the whole point of why ppl roll there is to kill or be killed.  i don't know anything about the guild but it's not much different than what happened on Discord.  EQ isn't a true pvp game but one of the tenets of pvp is that for you to win others must lose, king of the hill, capture the flag are invariable iterations of team pvp.<br />
<br />
it IS a bit odd that kumarri comes here as opposed to the TZ board to gleefully cackle about his guild... but mainly because he still seems to be having so much fun with EQ as opposed to the rest of us... but I think it's a bit judgemental to call him a bully for bonking on weaker opponents in pvp.  after all, as you point out in your own post the prime directive in PvP is to be able to identify and strike when you sense your opponents' weaknesses</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I am with Temuchi on this. One chooses to play on a PvP server. The basic premise on a PvP server is that nobody is truly immune from the attentions of others. Don't misunderstand - PvP servers are not some chaotic anarchistic dog-eat-dog slaughterfest. But your friends list becomes real important, your guildies become real important, who your guild is allied with / neutral with / KoS to becomes important.<br />
<br />
What Kumarri says about ruling the roost...at the end of the day, there is nothing physical to stop other guilds forming an alliance and knocking them off...perhaps.<br />
<br />
On VZ, where I play, there is a top dog guild - Defiant. They rule the roost too...they do a good job of ruling the roost, but there is only like 100 of them. If the next 3 or 4 guilds (Ancient Dawn, Zephyros, Aerist, Aduentus) could ever stop fighting each other, and all concentrate on Defient, Defiant would be knocked off their throne, for sure. Defiant is smart enough to know this, so are kinda neutral / ally with 2 of these guilds, and assist them in small ways, while actively pursue KoS policies against the other 2 - ensuring a ongoing war between these 2nd rank guilds, while they quietly farm time / GoD...very smart.<br />
<br />
Frankly, being the top dog guild on a PvP server onlyy really effects a very small percentage of the server population - unless you are directly competing for that guild's zones / mobs, you can do pretty much as you please. And with instanced zones, you can get gear good enough to compete with the top guild - not as good, but good enough if you have enough troops.<br />
<br />
The sad thing about PvP in EQ is that while skill helps, the botom line is better gear / more levels / more AA will generally triumph, and that weight of numbers counts for a lot.<br />
<br />
Playing on a PvP server is not generally about getting ganked and Corpse camped and smacked around - we exp and progress just like you guys on the blue servers, we just have an added element to our experience, and an element that, for me at least, keeps the game fresh.<br />
<br />
I should point out, that I am not in the top dog guild, not even in the 2nd rank guilds (although I was for a long time, so feel qualified to speak). I have poor gear and few AAs, but I enjoy PvP, and sometimes, against a stronger opponent, just surviving is a victory in itself. I try to compensate for my weaknesses with sneaky tricks like farmed snare items, potions, clicky DD items, but when I get &quot;pwned&quot; (not a rare occurence, alas), I generally send the guy a polite /tell, loot n scoot the zone for an hour, and get on with life...<br />
<br />
So, although Kumarri does come across as arrogant, I would invite any of you to come across to a PvP server. We are human (or elf, or peck or darkie) too, you know! You might even have fun and make some good friends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">one of my original char was a bard on rallos, there's no way I would have followed anyone into a small space like an iglooYeah, this was a big flaw in my plan, and I knew that there were very decent chances that he'd just refuse to come inside.  A lot of bards seem unwilling to duel in indoor zones at all.  <br />
<br />
Bard mobility is a huge advantage, and comes very close to meaning this:  a bard can force a win if he is winning, or create a draw if he is losing; while his opponent can do no better than force a draw if the bard starts losing, and cannot avoid dying if the bard starts winning.  Why would a bard willingly give up a stacked deck like that?<br />
<br />
In this instance, I was doing a lot of /ooc taunting, saying things like &quot;You bards are great at running away and expecting me to chase you, I don't see why you're so reluctant to come to me&quot;  and &quot;Could someone port in one of their ranja or druid alts to track for Mr Bard here, he can't track, he can't see me even though I'm standing here in plain sight, and he expects me to come track him down so we can do this duel thing.&quot;  The plan was to get him goaded enough that when he finally figured out where I was, he would come charging in to wax me good and proper.  I felt like I had a decent chance against him if I could get him into a tight box, like an igloo.  So my hope was to get him mad enough at me that he would accept that battleground.<br />
<br />
If he had decided not to come inside, it would have been a draw.  He would not come in, and I would not go out.  <br />
<br />
I'm far from claiming that I can beat any bard any time.  My record against bards is adequate but hardly overwhelming:  2 wins, 2 losses, 1 tie.  It would be 1 win, 2 losses, 2 ties if he had stayed outside the igloo.<br />
<br />
I think it's a bit judgemental to call [Kumarri] a bully for bonking on weaker opponents in pvp.  after all, as you point out in your own post the prime directive in PvP is to be able to identify and strike when you sense your opponents' weaknessesWell now.  I did use an analogy about playground bullies, but I didn't say  Kumarri was a bully.  I said he was an arrogant thug.   Please:  let's keep the record straight here.  ;) <br />
<br />
It's not like I made up stuff about his behavior or attitude.  Didn't I provide a fair number of clippings from his own posts to illustrate the point? <br />
<br />
I don't want to requote them all.  I'll just note that in his posts he scorns Bluebies, he calls players from other servers clueless, he brags that his guild immediately dispatches hit squads to kill off any other guild that even comes into the GoD zones, and he congratulates himself that he has much better skills than his opponents when actually he just has much better equipment than his opponents.<br />
<br />
You can say that what he is doing is basically the same as two evenly matched players testing themselves and having fun by using their skills and insights to find and utilize a mistake or weakness on the part of their opponent.  But you'd be mistaken if you said that.<br />
<br />
Well.  /shrug.  It's a free country after all.  I said that if he was having fun killing players who could not possibly challenge him, he could do that.  And that for myself, I thought it was more fun to PvP when the opponents are about evenly matched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Speaking as a non-guilded shaman on TZ, I see it to be a cold, dark day in the Nine Hells before the other two guilds get their acts together and dethrone Pande, simply due to the fact that the gap between Pande's gear ( Time + GoD ) is much, much greater than Indignation or Discordia's ( Ornate, VT, Early Elemental ).<br />
<br />
But that is not what this whole bit is about.  It's about Bards versus Shaman in a PvP / Dual atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Having started and grown up on this server, I can safely say with full confidence, if you are fighting a equally geared bard, who has a minute idea of what he or she is doing, you will lose.  I have defeated bards before, but that was due to their ineptness.  Case and point, charming mobs in OT to attack me instead of manadraining me.  As an Iksar shaman, I had completed my Fear clickies, and sent them running.<br />
<br />
You can't outrun them, and you can't dot them, so as stated before, the best bet is to malo-x and attempt to burn them down.  However, if you are fighting them in an open area ( STUPID YOU ) you still have a chance to live.  You need to generate more health per tick then they can twist.  In the OT fight as stated above, this was done via my being on the No Rent horse from Befallen, casting Stoicism on myself, and keeping up Regrowth.  Had the bard been able to twist more than three dots on me at once, I would have died.  Had the bard been higher level, I would have died.  Had he knew what he was doing, I'd have died.<br />
<br />
See a pattern?<br />
<br />
Of course, in three levels, I will have to deal with Pande in all of their uber geared glory.<br />
<br />
Joy for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Utter and complete joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">2 years ago when i started EQ i wouldn't have called myself a thug or anything like that or ever thought i would  be able to push my weight around. I'm not going to BS anyone i'm not the nicest person in game to my enemies. I let very few ppl L&amp;S and i will do anything to win. Maybe it's me, maybe it's the way the server is. All i know is somewhere along the line i gave up on trying to be nice about things to my rivals having been backstabbed a few times and stuff like that. So yes i do bully ppl i take revenge to the ppl that condoned deleting my account by an ex guildmate and i take every opportunity to make there life as misserable on the server as possible. <br />
<br />
Tz is prolly the most cuthroat of all the pvp servers and It tends to make alot of us nto to terribly nice to each other. <br />
<br />
Yes i came accross arogant and at times i can be. i try and check myself as much as possible but i can only do so much :p<br />
<br />
as far as not posting on TZT that message board is never about EQ anymore and it's pretty much a load of BS comeing from discordia and indignations declarations of victory cause they only had 400 geared/naked corpses in certain zones during pvp battles. Posting there is useless now and ppl just talk US politics on there pretty boring</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW Mac the igloo story was hilarious.  I just have a nice picture of the bard outside the igloo contemplating what to do then steaming full on into it.  The door slams.  We hear a little bit of noise and then thats the last you hear from the bard.  Good story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A question about bard abilities though - they have a Shadow Step song.  I wonder if that would have worked.  Would it teleport through walls?<br />
<br />
Granted, I dont think many bards would have it memmed, though - what bard would expect to fight inside a closed environment like an igloo?<br />
<br />
Still, a great tale.  Good job on it (as you've already heard from many people)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Macnair, great story. To everyone, not all red server shamans, or players for that matter are idiots.</div></div><hr />

your best bet for killing a bard is decay+disroot when he try's to drop a train on you.<br />
<br />
otherwise I just gate or zone, bards (and MB/LB/DT) need to get beaten into a bloody pulp with the nerf bat.<br />
as it is now one well geared bard can shut down 50+person raids indefinitly. <br />
killing a bard is always a stroke of luck or just a stupid bard.<br />
<br />
my personal favorite win vrs a 65 bard took place in paineel. the 20k fall he took from my disease root (into hole from near the toxx zl) definitly was more than he could handle.<br />
<br />
if you play red and dont carry pumice/crimson pots at all times you are just begging for death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">hehe funny post there Macnair..<br />
<br />
About pvp ing a bard as a shammy, with VT gear or better is pointless. I will go that far, to say. a good skilled bard can own a shm even they are only wearing Tov gear for that matter. Everytime you malos the bard, he will dispel it, in the very same second it land. At the same time, he keep manadrain and dispel song on you. Should it habben you land you 2 best dots on the bard. he will just run away and cure them. 10 sec after he will be back. playing some good old manadrain song and dispel song. After a few minuts, he will start dotting and meleeing you down...<br />
Random shm R.I.P<br />
<br />
I agree with shinerbonk here. If it should habben, that a bard ask you for Duel. You should find a small indoored place for the duel... Get you best Pr nuke up and have you DS potion clicked on, in you 5th buff slot or lower down the linie. Make sure you have you 4 right click items rdy and at last, get crimson potion on you aswell. Note, if you should get tashed or dottet and find that you whant to Use you group cure. make sure to recast crimson potion again, since it will take the buff aswell.<br />
<br />
Edit..<br />
For us shammies attacking lesser geared people on red servers is weak...<br />
Well all i can say, those are the only people left we can kill with our dots. So really, dont see why, we should feel bad about attacking them ? hehe<br />
MY concept is. Kill everyone who is Kos to me and my guild. regardless if its the last new chick in Pov, who just need one more blue to ding 200 aa. <br />
I hear serveral times per day, pleads dont kill me, i just need 1 aa more for my new aa skill. After i kill Mr random guy, all his kindness get¨s tuned 180 degree around. and suddently he saluts me with all kinds of unknow words.. So i made a macro for those kinds ..../movelog random blue server, have a nice day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>laxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I would say that as a bard, shammies are the least feared enemies. Even tho they are deadly in group pvp, in solo they lack the dps punch vs a bard. Aria will dispell all dots, and resists will stop the dds.<br />
<br />
About the igloo thing, that bard surely was semi clueless..P<br />
Fading memories stop pets and swarms from attacking, and anyone who cant dispell or melee himself to death on dmgshield have it coming..P<br />
Also, VP is kinda rubbish cuz it can be cured (ie doesnt matter where it lands in your bufforder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">VP is great vrs a training bard. you can decay and vp in less time than he can run past you, and if you root his ass into the train he will be dead before his corpse hits the ground. I have done this several times. the draw back is that dis root is so resistable even after decay. <br />
you would think shaman would get at least one usefull spell (or aa) with a friggin resist modifier built in.</div></div><hr />
