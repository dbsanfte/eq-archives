<br />
Everyone probably knows how to canni-dance, if you don't then please  search the forum for it.  I'm posting about another nice button/macro that every Shaman should have.<br />
<br />
Once I hit canni 3 and 4 I stopped canni-dancing, instead, I made a button that does canni 5 times:<br />
<br />
/pause 50, /cast 2<br />
/pause 50, /cast 2<br />
/pause 50, /cast 2<br />
/pause 50, /cast 2<br />
/pause 50, /cast 2<br />
<br />
You will have to adjust the pause times for lag etc..  The basic idea is to bust out 5 efficient canni's and not have to push or click any buttons 5 times.<br />
<br />
I use this button in many situations:<br />
Mob has been slowed, tanks and everyone is engaged, hit the canni x 5 button.<br />
Mob is nearly dead, and puller will be leaving for another mob, hit the canni x 5 button.<br />
Going afk really quick? hit the canni x 5 button.<br />
<br />
Can you cast other spells once you have started the macro? Yes.  You will either have to interrupt the canni that is being cast (usually by ducking, (hitting 'd')) or you can 'spam' the spell you want to cast and it will jump in between canni casts (and overwrite them).  I'm to the point now that I constantly hit my X 5 button even if I'm healing, nuking, doting and buffing.  Which means, between every normal cast, chances are a canni will jump in there.<br />
<br />
Of course this does not work with canni5 (AA ability) why? It has a 3 minute recast (trust me, I'd have been long ago if I hit AA Canni 2 or 3 times in a row)  :)  (1924hps x 3 is a quick death)<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope this helps the Shaman that don't like clicking constantly.<br />
