<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vrark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
Was killing Wyverns in CS and started thinking there must be mobs I can kill that will give me more than 1% per kill?<br />
<br />
What should I be looking for, do I need to kill white mobs to get more than 1% (not sure it's worth it in that case...)<br />
<br />
Is there some kind of table around, something like (false data here)<br />
<br />
Shaman lvl 48<br />
Mob level    XP<br />
35-39         0.5<br />
40-45         1.0<br />
46-47         1.5<br />
48-49         2.0<br />
50... etc<br />
<br />
I would assume zone with good XP modifier make it seems you need lower level mobs in them to get the same % of XP.<br />
<br />
Vrark,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Echo caverns - the room next to the Deep - 9 spawns and at 48 you'll have some time between on cycle and the next to rest a second.  alpha pet and melee em - if you have stoic it will be easy, i didn't have it when i did it and was a little tougher.  kei makes it trivial.  no jbb needed, just slow and maybe a dot or 2. the rock guys you can slow but don't even try to nuke - only ones that will be a real pain is Fireclaw but the XP is nice when he pops ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zone in to Nadox. There's a large ZEM in there, and the lava elentals get a boost because some of them are under the lava. The downside is that unless you like swimming in lava (which is doable) there are only 3 there. 25 ish minute respawn<br />
<br />
2-3 % at 49 on the elementals. 5% for a named (it these sometimes spawn when you kill one of the normal ones).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nadox Elementals is where it's at. At 48 you should see 2-3% per kill for sure, and swimming the lava isn't too bad because you can actually get out of it on the right wall to target the mobs before jumping in again to cast slow for the pull. Just make sure you get your fire resist up as high as possible. At 122 I was taking 10hP damage from the lava; at 82 (before self resist buff) it was 29 HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you ain't just whistin dixie.<br />
<br />
very nice loot. 2 blue diamonds, 3 sapphires and other assorted jewels and about 400pp in about 3 hours. but that might have been luck of the pull.</div></div><hr />
