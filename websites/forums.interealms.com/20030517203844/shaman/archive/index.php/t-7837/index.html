<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey i got my Iksar Scale last night and now comes the final hand in. This is where my problem occurs. I got the Iksar Tear MQ (payed a good chunk of cash but wasnt gonna wait more then 7 months to complete my darn epic). Now i have done all the hand in up the killing High scale Kirn. But i have done the shield of falsehood hand in about 7 times total, maybe 8 and am currently allied with True Spirit Faction. Now before i try to do the hand-in for the Spear of Fate i was wondering if there was any way to check if my faction was good enough to acquire my epic. Although i havent tried this yet, and rumours say it will solve my problem i was wondering if before i do the hand in and ask about 'What is lost?', 'What of the Spear of Fate?', 'What of these Black Holes?, 'What powerful shaman?', 'What of the cosmos?', 'What of the breach?'. People say that if i get conversational replies to those messages then I am able to hand in my Iksar Scale. Was just wondering if anyone can confirm this. Thanx:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To play it safe I wouldn't turn in the scale until you receive a message like &quot;Your faction with True Spirit couldn't possibly get any better&quot;. You can be an &quot;ally&quot; but still not have max faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Valgoth said - make sure you get a Max Ally message before doing the hand in - easiest way would probably be to either do the Shield portion again of you have the components or can get them easily - or since your an Iksar - go kill a Iksar Manslayer in Field of Bone - talk to the spirit - get the gem - go to NFP and do the dirst piece turn in again and see what message you get - if it's not &quot;You faction with True Spirit could not get any better&quot; than do a few more hand in with the gems (small hit) or the Shield(bigger hit).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah the shield is really convenient especially with PoP i doubt i will have to do the shield quest much longer too cause i have been allied maybe after the 2nd or 3rd hand in. But yah i'll wait till my faction cant get any better</div></div><hr />
