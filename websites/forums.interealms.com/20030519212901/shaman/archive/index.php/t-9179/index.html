<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent seen this mentioned before so I thought I would add it.  The senties and rats in PoJ are really easy.  At least the ones near zone out.<br />
<br />
I set up pet in hallway to zone out and pull back to that hallway.  No mobs path here so you will not get adds.  Just be sure to root mobs when it is low health.<br />
<br />
Another note there is no faction hit on those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If there is no faction with the rats then why do they agro you when you are killing  certain types of Prisoners in PoJ?  SOme of my Guildies and I went into PoJ, after we did a PoI raid, via a whirlwind tour of the tier 1 planes and we were killing some of the wiged thingies (think they were the griffs) when we got agroed by the rats  and nearly got wiped from the agroes of the rats.<br />
<br />
note: I did the best with my greater healing and slow and dots I had at the time as I had not had a chance yet to scribe my new lvl 51 spells yet seeing as i had leveld during the PoI raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The rats attack becasue of your level. Weird I know, but true. If they see you figting in the hallway, they will jump into the fray. After a certain level (I know they dont assist at 60), they will ignore you no matter who/what you are beating on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also one of the prisoners (dont remember his name but he is an iksar) will assist the rats.  My sugestion is to kill him first ... he is more difficult then a sentry.  A plague and 3 banes plus tanking to kill him.<br />
<br />
Everything else usually takes 1 bane and 1 plague.  Plus dog dog of course.</div></div><hr />
