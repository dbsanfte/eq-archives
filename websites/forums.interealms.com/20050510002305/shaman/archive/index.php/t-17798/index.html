Right now looks like a copy of regular FA, but stay tuned for changes.<br />
heh, AA button avatar maybe? :p<br />
thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, I guess that could be cool, but really only very useful if it's either better than FA in some way or at least has the same 1 min recast.  Otherwise I have to keep FA memmed anyway most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Praying for group FA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh it makes my day every time i see the /cheer animation after i cast avatar on someone...I think thats the sole reason i deal with casting it on people at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd rather have stun immunity and some sheilding % attached to it, so that it actually is better than Ferocity in a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From the three different listings of Divina Aura 1, 2, and 3, I'd surmise that it may be an AA.  I also found this while looking up turgurs, it's not in the above listing, source is Test: Curse of Turgur (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2267&amp;source=Test).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">maybe it is some new AA for expansion ?</div></div><hr />

The end is nigh, everyone run for your lives !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know it's far to early to make the comment - but I'm gonna do it anyhow.  Anyone take a look at Beastial Alignment III?  /Wave to anyone ever wanting to have any form of avatar again depending on the casting constraints of where they're taking that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Must be an AA hence the II and III versions.<br />
<br />
Still listed as single target.<br />
<br />
However, this hints at new AA's to come and that would be cool.<br />
<br />
Can we get something for PVP too? :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Bestial Alignment = Rabid Cat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Beastial alignment is beastlords, it looks kinda like ferocity. This doesn't seem to exciting but curious yeah. Oh and they are shown to use mana and the levels look the same so maybe that is yet to be altered.</div></div><hr />

hrm this sounds like a pet buff  <br />
<br />
... or actually a ranger aa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Very interesting with Divine Avatar, lately it's probably one of the spells I cast most, but maybe I am dense, but I can see no difference between the I,II and III, maybe someone can point out the obvious to me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Group avatar would be sweet as long as it's MGB-able.<br />
<br />
Hm, let us think about this. It lasts 6.5min, with SCRM and +25% EE about 11min. MGB refreshs after 80min(?). Now you would need at least 7(mgb group FA) + 1(mgb Fo7) shaman for each raid. Wasn't that what we wanted? ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, I hope this spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3497&amp;source=Test) will make it to the live server!!!</div></div><hr />

Sounds more like an upgrade to Rabid Bear if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sethrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sounds more like an upgrade to Rabid Bear if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Actually, that is the Beatlord AA Frenzied Spirit.  In fact the stats are exactly the same.  I expect it will be an upgrade of it for them.<br />
<br />
Also, the Beastial Alignment thing is being speculated to be an AA for beastlord that turns them into their warder type. It would be kind of like the mage's AA that turns them into elementals.<br />
<br />
Check out the beast boards for more details, they have a thread discussing the Lucy changes like we do.</div></div><hr />

Looks like a complete heal for themana bar.  The big question is what class gets it.  It soulds like a cleric spell, but mana regen like this I would think falls under the Enchanters umbrella.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, that will be a warrior AA and counts toward melee balance ;)</div></div><hr />

You aren't thinking about it...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When would you need max dps? Right before a big mob. Would that last more than 9 or 10 min ? Likely not...</div></div><hr />

Depends, are they Luclin mobs? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Looks like a complete heal for themana bar.<br />
<br />
HAHAHA, but they nerf the 32 mana song because &quot;there is too much mana regen in the game&quot;... omg that's rich. :p<br />
<br />
My guess is that one goes live the same time as Ancient MGB True South, and the group FD song.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the melees will bitch that they want FA for 24 / 7. Even for trash mobs and tradermode... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This may just be the way they give everyone extra spell gems without actually giving them extra spell gems (i.e. grind out 18 or whatever AA and you get to use certain spells as AA abilities instead of spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Of course, what would truly be heaven is if these were new AA for melee classes, so they could FA themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The enchanters have an AA that gives them all their mana back, called gather mana : http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2753&amp;source=Live <br />
Might be the wizard version of this AA</div></div><hr />

heh, AA button avatar maybe? :p<br />
thoughts?<br />
<br />
My guess is that this will be a weapon proc/augmentation.  Would be par for the course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, the mana replacing spell is listed as &quot;self&quot; only.  Wouldn't surprise me by the name if it went to a paladin or cleric as an aa.<br />
<br />
As far as the divine avatar goes, I would be more than happy to have it as an aa, even if it was the same as FA.  Sure, give me a free spell slot and something to do with the aa points I don't have a use for.<br />
<br />
As far as getting aa abilities to replace spell gems, I thought that was what clickies were for ;)<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear is broken.  It is also stupidly underpowered to where it is little more than a joke where SoE can say &quot;look we gave you a damage aa&quot; while snickering at our class DPS behind their hands.  We are well above that...though it can be a fun toy in PvP.<br />
<br />
Overall, any aa improvements will make me happy right now.  I am losing interest with nothing to exp towards :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I highly doubt any of these changes are for shaman, my guess would be that these are for melee class balance.   Grats VI on not having new ideas and taking more tricks from the shaman bag and handing them out ... again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As Gard said, I'm skeptical these are AAs or spells. They look like new augment abilities to me. At least the ones with the I, II, III, IV, and V tags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heh, add this to the list of tricks I would be MORE THAN HAPPY for SoE to &quot;take out of my bag.&quot;  Some people may get off on being a buff dispenser that might as well be botted; I don't.  Especially pain in the ass buffs like FA.  Hell, feel free to give AAXP shrink, PE, IoS, etc etc.</div></div><hr />
