<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hoi all. Heres the deal. Just made Level 40 and wondering where I should head to now. would like to make 50 in the next week and since its been awhile since I was this lvl, Im wondering where I should head to. I normally play about 3 hours a nite and can usually get a warrior or sk friend of my lvl to come with me. you can check my gear in my sig, and both the sk and warrior are pretty twinked out. I wouldnt mind doing some dungeons, but keep in mind I have a mount. so Any suggestions?<br />
once I hit 44 gonna go do stoicism quest quick and run to karnors to get the last piece i need for canni 2. Im also wondering has anyone tried doing the snare necklace quest since we trolls got bumped?<br />
thanks in advance all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent a lot of time in the 40's in echo caverns.  I also spent the early levels in Kaesora. Oh and Mons Lethalis, I went there alot too.<br />
<br />
Around 48-49ish I moved on to ME and the Hole and spent my time there until I was 53 when PoP opened up and I was very happily able to aviod Velks.<br />
<br />
Many other people spend the 40's in KC.  I wished to aviod this like the plague, but if you can stand the people there, the experience is good, just don't go away with any of their bad habits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. 40-44 on the beach in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
2. 44 get Stoicism<br />
<br />
3. 44-51 Elementals in Nadox at lava river zone in from Gunthak.<br />
<br />
All of this is solo except for the final Stoicism turn in and mob kills.<br />
<br />
If you put your mind to it, all of this in a week is a very good possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you deside to fight in KC make sure you BUY ALL your Kunark spells from OT.  As fighting in KC quickly distroys your OT faction.  Tenabrose mountians I found quite nice at that level range.  Two more people would have made it go much faster.  If you go there fight near the Grimling Forest zone or go stake a claim at one of the grimling caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya Absurdum I am not sure if you still read these posts and yours was a several months ago. Since I can't remember when they got rid of KEI for those below 46 was this all with KEI?  I know we have Canni but things go much quicker with it. Hold the Bashing. I use Canni alot. hehe  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If not mistaken this was really close to the time KEI was taken away from the lowbies (46+ requirement added).  All these places are still very do able.  The fact you dont hae kei just means your going be killing maybe three or four less mobs an hour.  Though to be honest if your in an out side zone with a horse you will not really miss KEI all that much.  What I did was save all my money for a JBB then a lizard. <br />
<br />
I would pull the mob with slow run to my camp spot jump on my lizard and start nuking the mobs and then Stocism myself and contiue to bracer DD them (Dulak / Guntak Fort area).  Pet would beat them from behind and I would tank but not melee so I would get full sitting mana regen.  Was non-stop killing tht way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Growmoss for the info. Will try that after I save up enough for the Drog. LOL. As for now me and my pet are leveling in Echo Caverns.<br />
