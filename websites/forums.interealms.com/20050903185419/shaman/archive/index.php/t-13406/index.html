<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to pass on what I learned in game and in here.  My main is a 62 Paladin and I recently started a second account to play a shaman on.  I got to level 41 and found I could group with my paladin.  With KEI on each I was able to roll through 41-45 at a pace of about 1 KEI = 1 Level (about 3 hours).  Decent loot and all those important epic pieces.  <br />
<br />
I used the hallway between the left and right stables as my pull spot and rarely get an add from the open courtyard area.<br />
<br />
I know CoM is a good spot for longer but kinda getting burned out on it.  Thinking of PoJ or maybe Sebillis so will let folks know on a good place to duo PL in this range.  So far I am loving shaman and find myself soloing at times just for the fun it brings (62 levels of paladin teaches you groups are good but sometimes you wanna feel power).<br />

I won't even try.  When I was in my 40's, I hit the stables area with a rogue, druid, shaman, and warrior and we needed to run a few times until we got it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My shaman friend went to CoM and fought at the first bridge...he was lvl 42 and was pulling 3 at a time..he is a Troll..was in bear form...and also had Fungi Tunic plus stoicism...but he was able to do it pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">41 would be a litle rough.  Most everything is going to be 2-3 pulls.  <br />
<br />
On an update, Got to 48 now and will prolly finish up 49 soon (about 2 gold to go).  The smallest stuff just turned light blue but exp is still good.  I am thinking I will move on to Velk's or Seb next but CoM has been very good to me.  I will mention this, I did have the army behemoth spawn 3 times for me and was always in the upper spot in the left stables.  In addition, the most common spawn point for the spectral courier for me has been the left side of the right stables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jubakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I came to CoM solo as a 45 shaman. With KEI, I was absolutely able to own the bridge area. Once you break the spawns it's cake.<br />
<br />
I start by parking dogdog just short of the first two spawns at the entrance. Both will come when you pull so just let dogdog engage, root one and call dogdog back to you.<br />
<br />
The next spawn area is a trio across the bridge. I found that if i rooted the the left one, only the center spawn would aggro (usually). From there, there are 2 spawns on both the left and right sides that you can grab one at a time.<br />
<br />
With KEI, I was able to clear all 9 and still have time to pull an extra or two before they repopped. I'm currently 46, have all 6 drops for the book (did turn in), and will probably stay there until at least 49. Plus a couple of raids to get my other epic pieces.  :)<br />

<br />
There is normally very few people in the zone (most of the time I am the ONLY one). The exp is great and getting the epic items is easy as they drop frequently.<br />
<br />
Most of the pulls here will net you at least 2 mobs, and sometimes 3 if there is full spawn and noone else in the zone. Most 2 pulls can be handled easy enough by rooting one and moving out of melee range while killing the second.<br />
<br />
When pulling the trio past the gate (at the entrance) a good method is to cast root on one, then pull the other 2 back to the zone line. Root another one of them there and then zone out. When you zone back in only the rooted one will be there (or on his way back depending on your zone speed) and you can engage and kill him alone. You can repeat this for the duo pulls also if they are getting the best of you. <br />
<br />
Takes a little longer this way, but its safe, and breaks the camp spawn up nicely so that you have enough time to kill one before the others spawn from then on.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, the exp is great. So CoM from 45 - 50 (or so) should definately be checked out if you havent been there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so whats the percent per kill ? at 44 im getting 5! a kill in TM with the sonic wolves and bats and lil aliens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How did your level 41 friend have Stoicism? Its a level 44 spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went and checked out TM, and at 47 I was getting less than 1% per kill fighting the sonic wolves and the annoying bats (immune to root).<br />
<br />
In CoM, I get over 1% per kill at the same level. Plus there are no roamers that constantly jump into your fights.</div></div><hr />
