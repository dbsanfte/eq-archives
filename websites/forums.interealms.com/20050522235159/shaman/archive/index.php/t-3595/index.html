<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on the newish Kane Bayle server and there isn't a ton of stuff out there to buy. I am starting a shaman, at this point as something to do, but I imagine I will play her a lot after I get 60...only 4 lvls away :) Anyway, I want to twink...I like to twink have been buying all I can and want to know of some things that I can go loot for her when I start playing her. Here is what I am working with so far:<br />
 <br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=307780  <br />
 <br />
I would like to get her a nice weap or two, I think I can get an icegrinder from ew, this true, is there a piercer better than spine chill/thunder runed that I can solo?<br />
<br />
Basically looking for good upgrades, or items that can fill the holes in her gear, a decent exp camp with good drops is of course prefered to farming greenies :) Lvl 56 wiz btw :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Icegrinder drops in Great Divide for sure.  (What's GW?)  Icegrinder is a very rare drop, however - much more common is a Wraithbone Hammer from City of Mist.  Might tide you over until the Icegrinder drops.<br />
<br />
Rune-etched Icewurm Fang drops in Velks, I think, but it would be a tough solo camp.  That's probably the best shaman piercer for melee damage, and melee will carry the first 20-25 levels easy.<br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr mail from the Ry'Gorr fort in EW is always good.  I see you have some.<br />
<br />
Charred Guardian Shield in Sol A is an obvious choice.  If you want to go all out, Bone Braced Buckler drops in the Grey and is an AWESOME shaman shield - AC25 STR10 WIS10 HP55 Mana55.<br />
<br />
For the wrists and neck, Ry'Gorr is easy to get and better than banded.  <br />
<br />
For the neck, Ivory Imbued Collar drops in Chardok and is very nice.  <br />
<br />
For face - Frost giant beard if nothing else.  Arctic Wyvern Mask would be great, but it's player-made and not a camp.  Crystal Spider Eyes from Velk's are very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">REIW comes from kael last i knew not velks.<br />
Also if you decide to head to kael for it may want to knock off the storm giant commoners in the house right before the bank.Greenie mobs at your lvl but can drop rune covered torque a decent lil neck piece 7 or 8 AC and 3 wis/int usable by all casters.<br />
Keep the treeweave over rygorr mail as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">REIW drops from one of the Oracles in the Noble House.<br />
<br />
He wields it when he has it.<br />
<br />
Oracle Bloodstorm was the one who dropped mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These are all great suggestions, now some questions:<br />
<br />
For the bone braced buckler...how would I go about getting this? Where does the guy spawn, placeholders etc I would love to get this shield...can I solo it as a 56 wiz?<br />
<br />
The torque looks nice too, and my last shammy had a REIF I would absolutely love to have another one. I am not too familiar with Kael, just a few arena raids. I see the noble house on the eqatlas map, but I didn't see any oracles in the allakazam bestiary. What lvl are they, do they summon, how hard do they hit? Basically, can I get this solo, or with a 58 sk partner, what type of force is needed to get an REIF? Also, can I invis myself to the area to see if there is one up, then bring the necessary force in?<br />
<br />
I much prefer that I can solo the items, or with a 58 sk partner, getting 54 cleric, war, chanter isn't too difficult for me so I can for a very nice piece that wont take too long to get, but more than that I would rather count out.<br />
<br />
Rygorr I will buy if I cant get any other pieces myself, unless you have a strategy for a wizard to solo the rygorr fort.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help, and realize that I am asking a lot but hey, that is why I came here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Updated my magelo to reflect my current gear for her. Still looking for the info I asked about tho...maybe I am just a gimp, but I can't find it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One major suggestion, apart from the REIF :) swap the TW for an iksar regen tunic (ceremonial iksar chestplate) 5k or so, but i think you could solo the guy who drops it in traks teeth (IIRC).<br />
<br />
You might also want to pick up a black iron medallion from runneye, AC 6 wis 5 mana preservation 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would love to put a regen bp on her and would gladly pay 5k. I think I could solo it but, don't I need to be able to track to run the forager cycle??<br />
<br />
Any info on the reif...I know these 2 pieces will make a huge difference in the quality of my twink. I would happily buy them and have been auctioning for both for about a week, but NOBODY is selling and I am quite sure there aren't many on server yet. Probably less than 10 of ea.</div></div><hr />
