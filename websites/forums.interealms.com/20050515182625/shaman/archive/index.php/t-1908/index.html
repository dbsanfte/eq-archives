<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czakoriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started a Barbarian Rogue last week on SZ just to fool around a bit (never played a rogue).  I got him up to lvl 8.  Was in Everfrost Tundra (from what I understand it is a &quot;goodie&quot; controlled zone).  Got PK'd by a high level good who felt inclined to kill me...not a problem cause I kinda expected it from the warnings, and I pop at home bind point just in front of guards on your way to Halas.  Cool...Then I before I can do anything I get rooted by a Shaman...Manbeast (good alignment) was his name.  He had to have been lvl 34 or higher cause he summoned his pet and proceeded to kill me.  Ok whatever.  I pop again in the exact same point he roots me again.  I say what are you afraid of coward...why not fight me like a man.  I fly the finger.  He then continues to kill me about 8 more times as he camps the home point.  I guess the only reason he stopped was because another newbie player sent a tell to another member of his guild.  I didn't petition (although I wish someone would grind his nuts into dust) cause I really dont believe anything would have been done.<br />
<br />
Problem I have with SZ.  Players should take a faction hit when killing others of their own race (why can't we all just get along...) I also feel that regardless of the race players should be alowed to choose a diety alignment the want to roleplay.  Class is a different story if you choose to be a Paladin, Shadow Knight, or  Necros your alignment will be assigned.  As a Barbarian Rogue I had 2 gods to choose from Neutral or Neutral.  Big choice.  As a Dwarf you have no choice you are going to be Neutral regardless of the class.  Come on....wouldn't it open the game up if you were able to pick the alignment versus the being stuck in one.  I personally love to play the Barbarians and regardless of the server I roleplay 99% of the time an Good-like alignment....so why is it that the only available &quot;good&quot; rogue is a freakin wood elf.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for the rant.  And if you are reading this Manbeast ...Beware of the shadows for I will be there waiting to slit your throat, steal your coin, and kick your corpse...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah I got some friends in Iggles looking for you...sucks to be you!<br />

If your starting now as a newt/good its very hard to get up in lvl in the regular noob zones. Alot of greifing goes on, and I imagine it will be worse now that you can have more then 1 character.  It does however payoff if you do stick with it. If you can get past all the BS and make up to the high-end game, there is nothing better then a low pop, pvp, no rules server. (imo of course)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sullon zek was a mixed experiance for me, i spent almost the entire last summer's EQ time on SZ, leveld a mage to 20, then deleted him, lvld a rogue to 21, then deleted him, then got the point and left for greener (or bluer :D) pastures.  The guild i was with (Angerthas), was alot of fun, and good people. The problem is that there are very few good hunting grounds out there for good team and i really didnt wanna go to a differnet alignment.  There is non stop ganking, almost no even con's fight each other, but if you con green to a newt or evil, your toast.  I found that it was generally for the people with much more free time than others (can live with the PKing and still have enough initiative to make lvl 60, go to CB and gank people), and the people with an inferiority complex (why else would you insist on killing people you could toast easily.  There is no honor, or roleplaying, or cooperation, or pretty much anything that makes the blue servers fun.  But that is why SZ is dying very quickly.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you need an example of the type of person who enjoys SZ, go to one of the SZ boards and read the quality of posts exhibited there, youll soon see why most who try it out decide to leave.<br />

Bind camping is perfectly legal on SZ.  Petitioning will not get you anywhere.  Also, if you expect the Iggles to punish this guy, you're dillusional^^<br />
<br />
The teams are not as imbalanced as goods and newts like to whine about.  There is one evil guild that is ahead of the neutral team.  The rest of the evil guilds are still doing Kunark era encounters.  Newts are farming first broods and doing ST.  &lt;Hate&gt; is doing NToV and some Lucling stuff.<br />

Good team is doing epics.</div></div><hr />

being frustrated because some inbred dip-**** got his jollies bind camping a level 8 for no reason ,other than griefing , has nothing to do with being weak or strong . <br />
<br />
I'm just glad this server exists to shunt a big chunk of the human refuse from the other servers =)<br />
<br />
<br />
A server where a level 60 can sit around and have his pet kill you at your bind point , ad infinitum , gee that sounds like fun . After we're done there lets go have a nail gun fight =p , wheeee .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well... Sullon Zek is definately a challenge. I start a rog/clr there... i despise low lvls so they are both lvl 8 right now. I find the server fairly interesting. If i had more time i would prolly play there more.<br />
<br />
The main thing to keep in mind about Sullon Zek....<br />
<br />
Its the Self Proclaimed Penal Colony of Eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think it's funny how the perception of SZ is we all lvl to 60 then sit in noob zones and bind camp.  Sure greifing goes on, but its not really that hard to avoid it. Its actually motivation to lvl up and get revenge on people who have wronged you.  <br />
<br />
I dont expect people like Tweadledumb to understand how things work on SZ, I'm sure he feels much safer with his /petition hotkey ready and waiting when someone pisses in his Cherrios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">agreed with Grump.  If it isn't your bag, just leave man.  PVP is not my thing so I don't do it.  It's neither good nor bad,it just is.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ takes too much time for me to PVP.  It's that easy.  If recovering from a PK was quicker, it may be more viable, but because of the dynamics I choose (note here : CHOOSE) not to.<br />
<br />
<br />
..that and I like to solo a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Sure greifing goes on, but its not really that hard to avoid it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teller of this story, although I dont agree with the /petition thing as I know better, had MANY MANY options to stop the griefing. :rolleyes:  Like all pvp servers I imagine it changes 50+ but I am sure not by much... you have more tools then sure but this is the griefer server.  Dont see how you can try to deny it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The teller of the story picked a barb rogue. Rogue is not a easy class to start over from scratch. Its even harder in the area he picked. Qeynos to Halas is some what of a newt/good war zone. Czakoriah did however pick a class that dominate's in the higher lvls for pvp. Looks like he also found someone to drive him to lvl up and seek out some revenge on Manbeast. I'm glad to see he took this attitude and didnt go with the, SZ sux, your all 14yrs old greifiers with no life excuse. <br />
<br />

<br />
I didnt try to deny anything, but if your not on a pvp server 50+ dont try to &quot;imagine&quot; you know what it's like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you have half a brain it is very easy to avoid being griefed. The higher level PvP is much more group oriented, often my guild has gone against 30 neutral opponets. I am evil, but I got killed by red druids many times while leveling up. Just get some friends that you can xp and pvp with and you will enjoy the server much more.<br />

Socialization to prevent victimization. I guess that's a pretty good summary of why I don't like PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this char was any class/race combo and this was occurring he could have done nothing to stop it.  Other than /q.  But there should be other options than quitting the damn game.<br />
<br />
And I know griefing VERY well.  I also know the 14yr old pissed griefer stereotype is true a majority of the time.  Will be more come summer.  I played UO from release for 2 years.</div></div><hr />

I do have a character on SZ actually =p<br />
<br />
And I have never petioned anyone on that server.<br />
<br />
My observations are from experience.<br />
<br />
But your reaction,and the smack talk are to be expected I guess,comes with the server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just like your assumptions that lvl 60's do nothing but bind camp, and that the... <br />
&quot;server exists to shunt a big chunk of the human refuse from the other servers&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Also my /petition comment was directed towards you and the blue server you play on. Not on SZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The level 60 comment was a generalization.<br />
<br />
I have been bind camped by level 12's before .<br />
<br />
But you missed the point,which is bind camping and griefing for griefing's sake alone. Which occurs at all levels.<br />
<br />
Neither of the other points you mention are assumptions,they are in fact my observations of the server.Having played there for some time.<br />
<br />
Yes I do play on a blue server now,guess that makes me weak eh?<br />
<br />
I got sick of the juvenile,petty,greedy  people who populate that server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Not ALL 14 year olds are bad. :) I'm 14 but I play on a blue server. I've never thought, &quot;Damn, I feel like killing someone 35 levels lower than me today&quot;. Truly, being a shaman it would be uber easy, but I don't see a point in it. If I have some agression to take out I'll punch my wall or my pillow or something, not go hunt newbs....Maybe SZ IS ruled by a bunch of 14 year old social outkasts, I dunno. Sure, PVP is really fun. Hell, I've always wanted to have a guild war with one of or allies, just hasn't happened yet. But I just don't see how it's &quot;fun&quot; to camp a PC when..A) He's pissed cuz I'm making his first (unless he's got another char on another server) gaming experience suck. B) I'm sittin on my butt mashing the /petattack button and watching it chew him up. *Sigh* what to do what to do...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I wish people would stop talking about how often bind camping happens (not the thread starter). It doesn't happen that often. Infact, at level 22 I haven't been camped at bind spot yet. I've also only been griefed twice. Once by a level 45+ wizard, and once by a mid 30's rogue who backstabbed me while I was soloing. Also, no, I don't sit in empty areas and level. As a good bard, I leveled 1-12 in FP\nro, and Nro is an evil\neut controlled area, not good. Very fun to play a bard when 50% of the people who attack you can't kill ya.<br />
<br />
When you get griefed...write their name down, and swear to yourself to get them back. Don't send them lame tells, just makes you look like an idiot. Motivates you to level like someone else said in this thread. Eventually, you can get them back if you try hard enough.<br />
<br />
SZ is a fun challenge, are you up to it?</div></div><hr />

- But but but ... in UO people ganked you 10 vs 1 for a &quot;challenge&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
SZ is a fun challenge, are you up to it?<br />
- Didn't we hear the &quot;challenge&quot; argument with UO? And fun for the griefer right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Everyone who play on pvp servers are pimply 14 year old kids that live in their parents basement and take out their social ineptitude and sexual aggressions by being complete asses in EQ.

Actually I kind of enjoyed UO once I got past having to deal with the grief players on a 1 vs 10 type thing, and instead facing (those very same) grief players in more of a 10 vs 1 scenario ;)<br />
<br />
-Valka<br />
<br />
ps. then UO totally messed up their criminal system, and we all left.<br />
<br />
oh, and yes I think PvP in EQ is nuts. You can't fight end game mobs with rusty weapons and patchwork, and you can't fight contested mobs either. All it would take is one really good train to wipe out anyone in a fight, and forget about ressing back in.</div></div><hr />
