<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is cani II worth doing the quest for?  it's only what 10 more mana per cast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it is.  I noticed a huge improvement when I got the spell at level 42 or 43, somewhere in that area.  It definitely seemed to help me out when I was duoing with a monk in Dreadlands.  I'd say do the quest.  Plus it's a pretty good quest: you have to go around a good sized area of Kunark and get to see some different spots you probably wouldn't ordinarily see, and I got a lot of experience for turning it in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CannyII is less efficient (HP/Mana ratio) than all other spells in the line. It is , however, much faster than CannyI.<br />
<br />
If you can manage to get the bones from Karnor, it is well worth doing the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hm...<br />
<br />
According to eqcaster's spell info:  <br />
<br />
4 casts of Cann is 200 hp, and gives 80 mana at Lv 24, 112m at Lv 60.    About 96-100 mana at Lv 44.  Nearing 50%<br />
<br />
3 casts of Cann 2 is about 200 hp, and gives 90 mana at Lv 39, 118m at Lv 60.  Estimating 96 mana at Lv 44.  Just a teensy bit behind Cann in mana per hp, but you take it in bigger chunks. <br />
<br />
Not sure of the mana production at specific intermediate levels, and I hear that there's a recast delay in Cann 2, so you can't chain-cast.  EQcaster doesn't show it.<br />
<br />
Anybody confirm or deny the delay for me?  Got the clay and the bone chips, will be in Trak's Teeth this weekend.  Probably do the quest just fer the satisfaction of keepin my spellbook full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do the quest.  CannII is a real improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I sure as heck wouldnt wanna go back to canni 1.  I just cant wait to hit 54 to get canni3 as even canni2 isnt fast enough anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only problem is there is NO WAY this is a level 39 quest, without significant help this is more a 45+ or even 50+ quest. However, now that I have it I would go out of my way to get that help if I had to do it again.<br />
<br />
 Get it, you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>whytstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree Can2 than Can1.  Never went back to Can 1<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The quest is not possible at 39 even if you’re the most twinked shaman who lived. Why it's a quest anyway is beyond me. Should be a dropped spell in say Dreadlands or off higher level caster sarnaks in OverThere.... <br />
<br />
As far as getting to 54 for Canni 3.... I was so looking forward to it as well. It's a nightmare for me to cast. I regularly chain fizzle it 3 - 5 times in a row. I never can cast it 5 times without at least one fizzle. It's so bad that I no longer use a hotkey. I just Canni dance manually. I'm 56 now and last night during an Umbral Planes raid, the lag was so bad that I couldn't afford to fizzle so much so I dropped back down to Canni 2. <br />
<br />
I'm specialized in Conjuration so that is partially why, but the fizzle rate is still ridiculous for someone who has casted it 10,000 times.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe EQ Casters info on these spells is still incorrect.  If someone who knows how to parse the spell.dat for the info could actually post the data on the spells that would be great! :)<br />
<br />
The Cani line was changed some time ago to make each one progressively more mana/hp efficent and to do it in larger chunks.  Cani 1, 2 and 3 can all be cast between ticks for the Cani-Dance.  Cani 4 has a longer recast time and can not be cast between ticks.  But it's mana efficiency paired with regrowth still makes it better than a Cani3 Cani-dance by chain casting it.<br />
Not to mention it fizzles alot less than Cani3 still apparently.<br />
<br />
Cani2 is a obvious improvement over Cani1 and I strongly suggest working on the quest.  It's not as hard as it seems with a group or asking politely for the necessary drops.  Even getting it in your late 40s is still very useful.  I got it around 45 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cani 4 has a longer recast time and can not be cast between ticks. <br />
<br />
Cann 4's recast is only half a second longer than the rest of them. You can still canny dance with 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sat in KC trying to get the bone chips for about 6 hours today.  They droped several times, but the only way I could have gotten them was to train the entire zone including the party trying to help me.  Was unwilling to do this, so I'm still without =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm using the eqcaster program which supposedly looks at the .dat file.  It seems to present all the new spells and effects as soon as they pop up.  So far, it's been spot on from what I can see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">need the link for the walkthrough for a friend...anyone still have it or know of one?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gaeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Is the spell scroll no drop? IE could someone use a higher lvl char to do the quest and pass the scroll down to someone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The McFerrin's Feast (Cana 2) scroll is dropable and the quest is MQ'able, at least it was in OOT with Oowomp. (Heh, I did have to beg a druid to stop killing him tho). I had a gnome rogue turn in the bonechips and I turned in the clay, diamond dust (which I did the old school way before it was made easier) and the yun powder. Plus, the dust, powder and clay are dropable anyway.<br />
<br />
And I give it another vote for worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm thankful I was 50th long before Kunark came out, because the Cann II quest was definitely too hard for a level 39 spell. But, the spell itself was worth getting. I used Cann II until I got Cann IV. I kept using Cann II because III had ridiculous fizzle rates. Cann IV fizzle rate is somewhat annoying too, but I can live with it...not as bad as I remember III being. But it's IV o'clock and I have II go II the bank and pick up my brother be-IV I'm late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I always thought the yum shm powder was the hardest part (blew my first attempt when my MQ partner had the wrong powder). Nevertheless Can2 is worth all the trouble. And the recast delay fits nicely to combat cast it, you get one hit in between every cast without loosing any man regeneration.  With my REIF and sltw I even get 2 hits per reacst delay.  Nice damage output while cannibalizing full time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a pain for anyone below 50.<br />
However, if you're lucky, you can pretty much get everything just by occ'ing and just coming across it.<br />
<br />
If you are actively trying to kill the stuff that drops the stuff for it, it is  a pain.<br />
<br />
and Karnors is a faction killer for evil shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
So be careful there.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can buy the pieces, I did.<br />
<br />
Most of em anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never got the bones so I never got canni 2 and i'll say that once you get in your 50's and still have canni 1 you pretty much have sore hands clicking hte canni dance button.  Canni 3, was a godsend even though it's a fizzle fest.  Canni 2 woulda been SUPER nice to have.</div></div><hr />
