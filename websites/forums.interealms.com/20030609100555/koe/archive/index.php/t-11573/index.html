<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Folene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our middle school in Oregon was faced with a unique<br />
problem. A number of girls were beginning to use<br />
lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That<br />
was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they<br />
would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens<br />
of little lip prints.<br />
<br />
Finally the principal decided that something had to<br />
be done. She called all the girls into the bathroom<br />
and met them there with the maintenance man. She<br />
explained that all these lip prints were causing a<br />
major problem for the custodian who had to clean the<br />
mirrors every night.<br />
<br />
To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the<br />
mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to clean one<br />
of the mirrors. He took out a long-handled squeegee,<br />
dipped it into the toilet and then cleaned the mirror.<br />
<br />
Since then there have been no lip prints on the<br />
mirror. There are teachers and then there are<br />
TEACHERS.</div></div><hr />
