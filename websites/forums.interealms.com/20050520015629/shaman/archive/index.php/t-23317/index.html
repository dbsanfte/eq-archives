<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I think about it. <br />
<br />
The Game as evolved around Quick Death to Mobs and keeping everyone alive during it.<br />
<br />
Where do we stand in all of this?<br />
<br />
Some where way out in right field.<br />
<br />
We dont heal other quick enough and we cant add Dps fast enough to make a difference in most group now. Let alone Melee for a damn.<br />
<br />
We are a Chain Class but most likely mitigate damage like a leather class.<br />
and most of us min the mid to low range gear shamans would be raped by a unslowed mob 10 lvl's below us.<br />
<br />
Now dont get me wrong. there is no other class I would rather play then a shaman. and I have tried but none ever gave me the joy as my shaman did.<br />
<br />
I know this type of post is nothign new to anyone here. But on the same token this is a rant!!!<br />
<br />
Your Rant or Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a shaman, why would you ever fight an unslowed mob 10 lvls below you?  This doesn't seem to even be a fair statement to make.<br />
<br />
But that's just me, and my shammy is all of level 30 now.  ;)</div></div><hr />

My thought is more in line resists of slows and if a mob like what happened to me in Nadox (I like to solo there when killing time)<br />
<br />
I did not see the Resist message and started to melee. at the same time my wife asked me a guestion and I answer her looked back and was dead. LOL and it took the mob about 30 - 40 sec to kill me being 10 to 12 lvl's lower then me. <br />
<br />
this is probibly more to the point of how bad our Mitigation/AC is for being a Chain class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Faster casting and more potent nukes takes care of us in raids and in single group content.  I wish we never got DOT's, it screwed up a great class.  No DOT's = no effective soloing thus better grouping skills to compensate.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS: IMHO fix the above and the annoying junk like FA duration, pet non-innate duel wield, malos recast time, group haste lower than single, ancient canny never being seen etc. and we are gtg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casting cold nukes showed your newbyness. <br />
<br />
There were week long diatribes on Wisdom gear Vrs hitpoint gear. <br />
<br />
The Cannidance had not been discovered yet. And very very few people used canni because Why hurt yourself that was stupid. <br />
<br />
The only class that could solo a hill giant was a necromancer. This was a proven fact. Right up till I sat with my necromancer buddy next to me and beat one to death useing a gatorsmash maul pet dots and slow at level 34 I belive. (I should have died but I lived through sheer luck)<br />
<br />
<br />
What has screwed up a great class is the marginlazation of shaman abilitys through neglect. Percentage upgrages than help pure classes more, The handing out of Stats on a platter on gear. Slow mitagation. And a ramping up of fight speeds to ludicrous speed simply because the developers have the attention span of  gnat. <br />
