<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have begun the Coldain Shawls quests just to get away from the grind a little and have been spending a lot of time now in Velious ( surprise surprise ). However 95% of the mobs look like humans and since Im hunting here I thought I might as well enjoy the &quot; feel &quot; of the place.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how I get the graphics on ? I have done a complete file check and the problem still persists. No memory problems or graphics card problems.<br />
<br />
Im a complete noooob on computers so anyone who can assist ?</div></div><hr />

You can also delete the zone specific files where you encounter those problems (I had that for a while in Stonebrunt, not having activated &quot;optional zones&quot; in my patcher).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had this problem a while ago myself. Turned out some of the files had installed in a seperate directory named Sony. All i did was copy these and paste them into the everquest directory and the problem was solved.</div></div><hr />
