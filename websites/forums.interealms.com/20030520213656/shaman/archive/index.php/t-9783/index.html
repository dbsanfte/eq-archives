<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone has some ideas on how to get faction hits on every mob.<br />
<br />
Basically last night I was factioning in droga with a warrior friend (who was pulling big trains).<br />
<br />
I noticed that I was missing quite a few factions and tried multiple strategies (healing, buffing, the poison ae's, tigirs) and I was still missing faction hits on 20-40% of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any other ideas apart from me pulling?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love you!!!<br />
<br />
I'd completely forgotten about that spell.. I've probably deleted it from my spell book too, but I can go get another copy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe changes to Infectious Cloud have it still only hit a maximum of 4 mobs even though at one time it was purely radius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was the puller and had a DS on me /shrug<br />
<br />
i got all the faction hits every time.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, I've only READ about this, haven't personally tried it out yet.<br />
Get a Bracer of the Hidden (insta-clicky see invis, must be equipped) and put it on.<br />
<br />
Continually click the OTHER people in your AE group.  Your beneficial buff on them should get you faction hits with every mob they had a hand in killing. :)  Yes, their eyes will be VERY tingly by the end of the night. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">tried using my bracer of the hidden, managed to get a couple of faction hits, but was missing out on others. Not had a chance to try infectious cloud as I was in fear last night with 2 friends - now thats fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Addy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Infectious Cloud is indeed now 4 targets max, been  factioning  in Droga and  Aoeing for it with friends I try buffs and  still miss a lot of the hits =/<br />
When did they change infectious cloud ? It used to hit more than 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i ae faxioned in droga and got every faxion hit all times... I did this by being the puller... easy peasy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The maximum number of hits you can get from casting buffs on other members of your group is also 4 (per member).  Infectious cloud has never hit more than 4 targets to my knowledge, shaman have never received a &quot;point blank ae&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sundrops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why wouldn't Tigir's work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its pretty obvious, YOU pull...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">tigirs only hits 4 mobs max</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always just cast acumen on the puller and the enc, or another fast buff as we're ae'ing.  I'm sure I missed some, but not very many of the faction hits.<br />
<br />
That's about the best you can do if you aren't pulling.</div></div><hr />
