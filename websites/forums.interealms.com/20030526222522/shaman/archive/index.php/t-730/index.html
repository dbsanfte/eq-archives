<br />
/rant on, skip this if you're not in the mood for whining.<br />
<br />
Also, is it just me, or these spells proof that VI hates casters.  The reasoning behind these spells is to balance out casters, to give them something equivalent to the power upgrades melee get with very high end loot.  This is all well and good, but it was stated when these spells were released, that it was not intended for every caster to get them, they're supposed to be super rare and very hard to get.  A reward for &quot;committed&quot; players, if you will.<br />
<br />
Now, perhaps I'm wrong, but don't we already have spells like this?  I mean, there was a thread here not too long ago polling people about spells they lack.  It was really eye-opening to me to see the number of 60 Shaman out there without Malo/Torpor/Bane/Poxx.    And hello, Primal Avatar?!  A NO DROP spell in Sleeper's?  This doesn't qulaify as hard to get, and something most people won't have?!  <br />
<br />
Maybe I've got a chip on my shoulder cause I'm in a smallish guild without the numbers or balance to do Kunark dragons/VP/Juggs etc, but it seems to me, regular casual players are already burdened trying to finish thier spellbook.  Only way I'm going to get the 'normal' 60 spells is to pay LOTS of money or beg the guilds that DO take down the right mobs to take me along (when they don't need another shaman, especially one without Malo/Torpor/etc/etc).<br />
<br />
Adding spells like this makes it seem like all the other spells are a right, something any casual player should be able to attain, if they can reach the level.  This is just simply not the case.  I play this game  every day, for several hours.  I'm almost lvl 60.  Yet it will be some time after I hit 60 before I fill out my 'normal' spells, if ever, and I would not call myself a casual player.  Seems to me, if they're going to make spells that &quot;not every player should have&quot; then they should make the spells that  every player should have more accessible to every player.  The drop rate uppage was helpful, as spells previously unavailable are actually on the market now, but still outrageously expensive and, unless you spend 24/7 farming pp or get a lucky roll on a high value gravy item, still very hard to get.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

Sorry been venting about this for some time.  More power to those who DO have a full spellbook and certainly kudos to those who manage to find one of these gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">primal avatar was just sorta a consolation prize for those able to get into sleepers. every melee in guild proc'ed avatar but i was still needing an emerald? heh.<br />
<br />
oh and primals have to be the biggest loot mistake ever :)<br />
<br />
er, what kinda company do you think would think some of their customers less than others? &quot;well sheesh, those pesky casters, all they do is screw up, lets hate them and give all the cool stuff to melees, maybe they'll quit so we can lose some income!&quot;<br />
<br />
not enough people in guild to do juggs? while i realize my guild is most likely better equipped than yours, a single grp can do juggs are you the only 60 in your guild? :)<br />
<br />
yes, some of the normal spells are sorta a reward getting them, but they are also &quot;base&quot; spells, nothing real fancy, your class just isnt complete without them. <br />
<br />
ancient spells are a good idea, after i've been raiding for 3 years, my equipment might be better than yours but hell, it's basically some more hp/mana/resists. now compare a non&quot;uber&quot; melee to an &quot;uber&quot; one, the difference is amazing, why shouldnt we casters get similar rewards? the whole idea about raiding is to improve your charh(no thats not why alot of us raid, but without this incentive it'd be pointless)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with you blacklace about ancient spells being a reward but the ones given are pretty stupid. Said guild who kills in ST already has primal weapons so why give me another avatar spell? Ancient spells are nothing more than bargaining chip VI used to buy time. No thought was put into them and I know ther are several monks in my guild alone with a 17/20 monk weapon off creator but no one in my guild has one ancient spell. Balance? I think not. You figure 95% of the high end content drops a insane weapon for melees but what about this ancient spell gimme crap? Drop the stupid ass 14/20 +whatever stats Enc dagger off creator and replae it with a spell. Look at the shaman only spear off THO, the 22/23 one, sweet item but its a toy. Replace that to with a spell drop. The ancient spells are supposedly rewards for caster in the high end game but they offer marginal benefits for the risk involved.<br />
Consider this, the best possible 1hder i can think of off the top of my head most melees can get by trade, is 13/20 weapon. Im not sure about for all classes but ill use that as an example for now. Now lets say the average warrior lvl 60 has 1100 ac, 13/20-12/22 weapon combo vs a 1450 ac, 14/19 80 point life tap proc 13/19 150 point rune type proc weapon combo warrior. (just an example calling stats from memory) Obviously the latter melee has far superior weapons and ac and im sure stats and haste as well. Considering weapons = spells then whats defines the caster from casual casters? Dont say gear cause melees also get superior gear in the end game. So, if weapons = spells then wheres the caster equivalent? Nada cause if feral avatar would drop it would pretty much just piss us off since we would rather see the ancient ageo drop. End game is a guild lvl event and feral avatar to a guild that already has primal weapons all around is a waste. Why didnt they just put some effort in and make a whole new series of spell? This is after all, end game right? Now i will say the ancient bane spell is pretty nice but could be better. Why didnt we get an ancient Focus instead. Guilds killing these targets will benefit more from ancient focus than avatar.<br />
Anyways, im sorry for carrying on, but i am not satisfied with this weak attempt at &quot;balance&quot;. I think EQ is so far down the toilet now that there is no way to recover it and VI knows it so they just buy time with half ass content and BS promises. The only thing fun about EQ now is the people i play with , not the game. :(<br />
<br />
Sorry again, i know it was a long winded - whine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i was told that Zenith Sage got ancient scourge on fennin from the Arch Lich but it's JUST what I was told. very possible that it was a misunderstanding as it would probably have been heard from other servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">agreed, the spells arent excactly amazing, but it's a start :)<br />
now they seem to have forgotten about it, /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Galgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sthaz, I nabbed a copy of Ancient: Scourge of Nife in sebilis when it was first dropping. Unfortunately, I was not high enough level to memorize it at the time, and it was promptly removed from my inventory about three weeks later.</div></div><hr />
