<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buurzbuub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all!!!  My friend and I, after exhausting a Mage/Necro combo, have decided to start a new pair.  I recently started a Troll Shaman and she has a lowbie Wizard.  So, there is the new pair:)  As we rarely group, how viable, as a stand alone pair, do you feel this combo will be at the higher (50+) lvls?  Any comments would be appreciated....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On the root and rot it will be counteractive (nukes breaking root and such) HOWEVER on the standard slow/melee/dot/pet routine you should do well if you keep the aggro and they use rain spells *DROOLAGE* on single pulls.<br />
<br />
Being an ex-wizard, I've seen the mad damage output and that was prior to familiars, easily accquired FT 1 items, etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus it beats the HELL out of walking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid would probably be better but Wizards are gods ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not the best combo. The Shaman / Monk paradigm is still the way to go, Shaman / Necro, Shaman / Mage also great.<br />
<br />
Reason we don't blend well with a wizzie is how they fight. Wizzies quad kite for x minutes, then spend y minutes medding. We can't help them with mana regen.<br />
<br />
We can add to their damage with dogdog and dots, nukes, but the second a Shaman pulls one from the QK we're messing up.<br />
<br />
I would think Wizard / Bard. Odd yet potentially effective combo. Snare, rain damage, all the while the Bard is speeding you along, doing HIS damage thing (non-melee) and running a mana song.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bard is an excellent combo for a wiz.  They can do everything :)<br />
<br />
Wiz/druid is also a great quad combo team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Buurzbuub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the good advice!!!  Looks like she is starting a monk, hehehe.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not a lot of synergy (love Dilbert words...) with sham/necro [**EDIT: whoops, meant to say sham/wiz**] <br />
<br />
A manastone might make it worthwhile, if you could get your hands on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wizard shaman is probably the worst combo, but we work well with a lot of classes.</div></div><hr />

Uh, regen them.  Now you're both getting mana back fast.  What am I missing?  Sure, some of your dots won't stack but that just means the necro doesn't have to pump out quite as many dots letting you do one or two.<br />

And I thought Paladin + Anything was the worst combo... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That was a brainfart, meant to say wizard (hence the manastone suggestion) not necro.  Sham/necro rocks mightily.  Arguably the best combo overall (monk probably has the edge still, but it is close 1-60).<br />
