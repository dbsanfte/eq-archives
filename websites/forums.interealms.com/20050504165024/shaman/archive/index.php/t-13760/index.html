<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Screw you guys, I'm going home. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, actually, I am home. But I have finally figured out how to beat the senslessness of EQ. Get rid of it. <br />
<br />
Account gone, EQ uninstalled and getting rid of the CD's. Deleteing all links to EQ-related crap except this one, where the majority of the people have common sense. <br />
<br />
To all them RN buddies: Man...did we like have fun, or WHAT? Later dudes!<br />
<br />
To all the Tards: t(-.-t) <br />
<br />
To all of you here at the crucible: See ya round when I'm bored perhaps. Yer a good crowd of shaman, and I was honored to fight with ya, flame ya, be flamed by ya and share wisdom. <br />
<br />
May your spears be true, your slows sink fast and your hp bar always have just a smigden of red when ye need it. May your lives be druid and bard-free! <br />
<br />
Celebration! Just put coals in the grill for the first time in ages, and I'm about to slap some ribs on the baby! Stop on by, I drink MGD and use JD BBQ Sauce. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Afterthought:<br />
Dear Sony, <br />
<br />
GO NERF YERSELVES!! t(-.-t)<br />
<br />
<br />
Later!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">t(-.-t) &lt;--- love it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) You can't have my stuff. <br />
<br />
2) No more MMORPG's. I have a one-month old daughter now. :) I have already signed up for 2 bowling leagues and got my new library card. <br />
<br />
3) I have been considering it for a long time, but I finally got the stones needed. As for my account, well..let's just say PayPal owns ;)<br />
<br />
4) No, you still can't have it. <br />
<br />
I just sent a letter to sony asking them to perform 2 obscene acts upon themselves, the first proceeding directly from the first. Then I deleted it and copied about a dozen of the most recent LEGITIMATE complaints form this board, including the problems with other classes (especially warriors) that plague us daily. <br />
<br />
Yes, I will continue to haunt this place cuz the people are good and I love you guys (except Redspeed who is of questionable lineage, sexual orientation and practices bad hygiene). <br />
<br />
Ribs are done btw, off with me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been clean of EQ for 3 months ... no other games really hold a candle to it.  I have started exercising, dropped 25 pounds, played golf several times, gotten to know my wife again, and generally wished there was a way to play EQ that didn't suck me in and make me eat my dinner at the computer and waste beautiful Saturday's sitting staring at a screen.<br />
<br />
EQ is too damn good ... RL is better, but EQ (for me) is too good to 'have just one'.<br />
<br />
The fact that I still check this message board 10+ weeks after quitting is a testament to the excellence of the game, and the boredom I feel at work!<br />

As for you Isazo, yer invited. Cmon over and have some leftover ribs and potato salad (ate all the beans).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">GL, bro.  I also think of giving it up from time to time; but, I play about 3 hours each night after wife has gone to bed.  If anything, I play much less if at all on weekends.  So, I'd either be watching TV or a movie, reading, or working at home during my EQ if I didn't play since I can't go to sleep that early.  I guess as long as EQ is just a &quot;pasttime&quot; it shouldn't be a problem.  Anyway, if I didn't play EQ, I'd probably start playing Homm3 online again.  What a great game!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Definatly sell your account or give it to someone who will never give it back. Thats what I did. Its the only way to make sure you never come back. I've been gone for 3 months now on my 3rd trip away. I have no desire to play and even planetside beta was boring. SWG doesn't intrest me, shadowbane was a huge let down. I'm sticking to single player games now, its cheaper and the let down isnt' as bad because you can usually take it back to EB for instore credit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Neverwinter Nights!  We've been EQ free for 2 weeks now (I think?), and it... it... HAS A PAUSE BUTTON!  Lord, I missed that.  Dinner's ready, so instead of slopping it into a couple of bowls and RUSHING back downstairs, we can hit a button and go eat at an actual table!<br />
<br />
Congrats to you.  It's a great game, but it does very very strange things to people.  However, it's easy to quit when you stop playing for a couple of days and realize that now you get as tense thinking about playing as you USED to get when thinking about NOT playing.  ;)</div></div><hr />

lot of things to miss about my fellow shaman friend but his explosive flatulence isn't one of them <br />

DUCK AND COVER ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">UPDATE: Day 2 without EQ.<br />
<br />
I feel great. I have began reading the Foundation series (Asimov) that my father recommended t ome long ago. Good read so far. My daughter at 6 weeks of age still doesn't do anything but eat, sleep, rinse repeat, but she'll be more fun (and headache) soon I suspect ;) Got invited (for the 100th time) to take my 12-sting out to a friend's house (hi Eric!) this weekend, and I am going. <br />
<br />
I miss alot my old RN friends already, despite message boards and e-mail. Corwil was a huge influence in my high-end game, and was personally responsible for obtaining Malo for me back in the day. A huge thanks again buddy! Gabus was a former KoG memeber with me, and he was responsible for dreading &quot;a paladin with a map and a plan&quot;. Gawd I miss ya'll. <br />
<br />
I do NOT miss: <br />
Grinding. <br />
CR. <br />
Bards. <br />
Frogs. <br />
Druids. <br />
GM's (I think they still exist)<br />
Beggars .</div></div><hr />
