<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My post is not the definitive shammy soloing post but nor is it meant to be...just a post to help those who have maybe never soloed and would like to (ie when you can't find a group) or just want some quick xp. Contrary to what anyone says if soloing is done right it is usually the best xp aside from duoing that you can get ingame (no mention of ae here!)...albeit at the cost of turning you into a social hermit and possible boring you to tears ;)   There are times when soloing is viable...you need some quick xp...you don't have time to dedicate to grouping etc<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 1-18<br />
<br />
Basically you are a wanna be tank from levels 1-13, but that’s okay. You have enough tricks to make soloing very viable. You have sow to run away when the going gets tough. You can root mobs and back off to heal or use one of your lower level dots to do some basic root rotting, but more of that later.  Once you hit level 14 things get better. You get Root and Spirit Strike (74dmg DD).  These 2 new spells open up what is known as DD kiting.  <br />
<br />
DD KITING<br />
<br />
Simply involves using Sow to outdistance a mob and then cast Spirit Strike to inflict damage in 75 chunk intervals. You can also root blast. Open the fight with Walking Sleep your 23% - 35% slow.  Either way once you get the mob down to ~ 25% health you tank it to death.<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 19-23 (The Dark Levels)<br />
<br />
These are known as the dark levels for good reason...level 19 spells for the most part suck...sure you get a decent heal (80 health) and 1 mostly lame dot (affliction 126dmg over 2mins) but the others are nothing to write home about. This is the level when most people quit playing their Shaman or turn into group shamans exclusively, always unaware that just over the hill they turn into solo machines. So what is a shaman to do at lvl 19-23 if they do want to solo? Basically repeat the DD kiting method but work in more rooting and add the affliction spell to counter any mob regenerative ability.<br />
<br />
Some zones for great soloing through the dark levels include the following:<br />
<br />
Warslick Woods (Giant Fort)<br />
Lake of Ill Omen<br />
East Karana<br />
Oasis<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 24-33<br />
<br />
Congratulations...you have attained the level that gives you the spells that at later levels do much to define what you can do spellwise/manawise. Two great spells are given to you at this level.<br />
<br />
Regeneration (5hp per tick regeneration)<br />
Canibilize (20-28mana for 50HP)<br />
<br />
You have the ability, which nowhere near as powerful as it will one day be, to convert HP into Mana. You also get your first good DOT (Damage over Time) spell:<br />
<br />
Evenomed Breath (220dmg over 49 seconds)<br />
<br />
These 3 spells give you the ability to Root Rot<br />
<br />
ROOT ROTTING<br />
<br />
Root rotting allows you to kill most mobs that other classes wouldn't dare tackle.  Cast Regenerate on yourself. Pull a mob with Walking Sleep to your fighting spot. Root the mob and then cast Envenomed Breath on it.  Unlike Druid Dots our shammy ones all (exception of epic) have a DD component that has a nasty habit of breaking root.  However the 1 nice thing to make up for this is that ALL SHAMMY DOTS STACK.  Because your mob is slowed you will not take quite as much damage and besides raising defense is needed for later levels. While the mob is rotting you Cannibalize. After level 34 you will Canna Dance (more on that later).  You should be able to get most of the mana back from casting Envenomed Breath without losing too much health. NEVER cannibalize below 3 bubs of health when soloing. You can root/rot the mob to death but I suggest you melee it at 25% health to work on your piercing and more importantly Defense skill.  <br />
<br />
DD Kiting with your new DD spell is also very viable at this level. Either way you are doing more mobs than most fast paced groups with far less downtime.<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 34-38<br />
<br />
This is the level where you get your first Pet.  To most people the first and subsequent shammy pets are wimpy additions to the brawn of tanks mage/necro pets. DO NOT believe this...When used properly shaman pets are your most valuable asset during these critical levels...including the dreaded 35 hell (30 is nothing).  Think of your pet as a permanent DOT to pester mobs and NOT as a tank because it isn't a tank not even close...What you are looking for is a way to maximize the life and return of you pet (cruel eh?).  How to use the 600-800 hp and 10-25 dmg double attacks of this first pet to your advantage...Enter Pet Kiting...<br />
<br />
PET KITING<br />
<br />
You wanna fly through hell 35? You wanna get 39 within a few nights? Then pet kiting is the quickest way.  Basically aggro management is the key to successful pet kiting...If you do more dmg to a mob than your pet then he gets forgotten and you are enemy #1 in the mobs' eyes.   The best zone for Pet Kiting is GD and Kodiaks. You will be killing White and Yellows and getting 1/2 to 1 blue per kill. Blues are for sissys but when whites and yellows aren’t around go for it... ;)  <br />
<br />
USE 3rd Person View. From default view Hit F9 3 times, 2 more brings you back to default. Learn to use this view by rotating mouse and moving while rotating. FPS shooter players will pick up on this quickly.<br />
<br />
Find a nice safe wall (NorthW of the dragon circle is great) and park your pet. ALWAYS have quickness and Sow on your pet as well as your HP buffs.  TURN OFF YOUR PETS TAUNT.../pet taunt off.  Park your pet in the camp spot and go find a Kodiak Bear (wanderers or cave #1-3). Aggro the Kodiak by getting into its face and pulling away from other kodies...Root the Kodiak in place and walk back. Cast Envenomed Breath and Scourge on the Kodiak and wait for root to break. <br />
<br />
You might need to reroot to apply both spells if it breaks after first. This is not much of a problem as any hits you take contribute to your defense skill. As soon as root breaks the Kodiak wants you dead and will stop at nothing to rip your heart from your chest. This is the time to run (particularly if its yellow) back to your camp spot.  Once you get into your pets *master* range it will immediately attack the kodiak and nip at its heals...Keep running and once you are in your safe turf begin to Run large circles. <br />
<br />
Ya you may feel and look silly but when the mob in question is a white/yellow/red hell dawn the bobo clown face paint and wear it proudly.  The Kodiak will continue to follow you while the Dots (at a 33% penalty) and your pet are nibbling away at it.   Once your pet does more than 1/2 dmg to the mob he will stop at begin to attack your pet but because your 2 dots are doing around 500dmg this doesn’t happen until the mob is at around 40% health.  Use yer lvl 24 DD to get back its attention. <br />
<br />
The mob will resume chasing you and dying until it gets to the *flee* stage at which point you attack it. While you are kiting you will notice you often have to stop to let pet and mob get close again...this is just enough time to cannibalize once...when done strategically thoughout the fight you end with only about 1-2 bubs of mana lost at most. Most fights end with you down maybe 1/2 a bub of mana. I suggest every 3 or 4th fight tanking the mob just before *flee* stage to work on your defensive skill.<br />
<br />
Another great ability is:<br />
<br />
CANNA DANCING<br />
<br />
Information is sent to the Everquest servers every 6 seconds from client machines. This includes HP and Mana. If you watch your HP and Mana closely you will notice that they rise in intervals exactly every 6 seconds. It doesn't matter what you do during those 6 seconds...the program only checks on the 6th second to see wether you are sitting/medding or standing. If you are sitting you get mana if you are standing you don't. It is that simple.  To canna dance you sit wait for a tick to occur and then stand up and cast cannibilize before quickly sitting to catch the next tick. This should become a ritual between mobs and greatly decreases your downtime.<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 39-48<br />
<br />
In terms of spells these levels suck...you get some nice ones like:<br />
<br />
Chloroplast<br />
Venom of the Snake<br />
Blizzard Blast<br />
&quot;Tuna&quot;<br />
<br />
And the spell that will define your role from now on as &quot;slower first&quot; &quot;Buff person of ill repute 2nd&quot; <br />
.... Togor's Insects...Your first real good slow spell...<br />
<br />
Soloing..nothing new, Pet Kiting still works great...as does Root/Rotting with the addition of your new DOT Venom of the Snake.  A new option opens up to you at these levels:<br />
<br />
PET TANKING<br />
<br />
Now that you have your first real slow spell you and your pet can choose to &quot;Tank Mobs&quot;. I would use this method split evenly with any of the above as it is the main method of raising your now critical defense skill. Pull a mob with slow. Root the mob. Cast 1-2 Dots. Send in your Pet. Join your pet.  You did cast quicken on your pet and you right? Well you will be amazed at how quickly you and your pet can dispatch a slowed mob albeit with the help of a dot or 2...<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 49<br />
<br />
Why only level 49 for this section? Because your ability to Root/Rot mobs has just increased 10 fold...2 spells:<br />
<br />
Envenomed Bolt (~1200dmg over 49seconds)<br />
Plague (~1200dmg over 1min 49seconds)<br />
<br />
You also get your first &quot;acceptable&quot; pet...he has over 1400hp and can double for 51dmg with a 3rd and 4th attack being bash/kick for 10-30 per tick.  That is respectable dmg when coupled with your dots on a slowed mob. Again your pet IS NOT a tank...he is a mobile dot that can last a long long time for only your initial mana cast if you handle him properly.<br />
<br />
In my opinion root rotting is quicker but as a shaman you need to have defense maxed...I cannot emphasize this enough…DO NOT ROOT/ROT EXCLUSIVELY UNTIL YOUR DEFENSE IS AT 200!!!!<br />
<br />
SHAMMY LVL 51<br />
<br />
1 spell<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects. The *best* slow in the game and THE spell that will define your primary role if you are the only shaman on raids. You now have the ability to turn most mobs into @#%$ cats for the slaughter. Once you hit 60 that slow will max out at 75%. Or put simply the mob will be attacking at 25% of its normal speed.<br />
<br />
In zones like the Great Divide you become a killing entity (warning extremely biased personal viewpoint!) unmatched by any other class. You might not be able to quadkite but double root/rotting becomes viable. Also your downtime is much less than that of a druid/wizzy who has to wait till all their mana is back before resuming quad #2. Becuase of spells like Canna 2/3 you will be up and ready for mob #s 2,3 and 4 before their next hopefully successful quad ;)  <br />
<br />
SHAMMY LEVEL 60 WITH<br />
<br />
This is the level where Shaman have no equal when it comes to soloing. No druid, necro or mage can ever hope to solo the mobs that a fully equipped and battle hardened level 60 shaman can.  Several items and aaxp make soloing at 60 a blast. General rule even without much aaxp is:<br />
<br />
VISIT YOUR LOCAL MAGE FOR FOCUS ITEMS!<br />
<br />
Right off the bat you can cut your Torpor cast time down by a second (doesn’t seem like much but trust me it helps) and up your DDs dmg by several percent.<br />
<br />
Several higher end zones lend themselves to some fun soloing. IMO lvl 60 isn’t just about the aaxp or raids it is about pushing yourself as a class..as far as you can.<br />
<br />
One thing I love about level 60 is setting up little mini solo goals. IE how far down the Hole can I get? Or soloing in areas where people look at you funny like Umbral Plains.<br />
<br />
POTIONS/ALCHEMY<br />
<br />
I have long given up on alchemy as a means to make money. Alchemy Rule #1…<br />
<br />
Forget about making money!<br />
<br />
Alchemy imo is all about extending your own personal abilities. Yes you can make DS potions for raids or if you really feel like it sell your sow potions. However, the person these potions benefit most is yourself. Once you learn to think of alchemy as an extension of your spell book (albeit a costly one!) Think of it..how many of you have paid 30K or more for your spells!? Exactly…so what’s a few kk for some potions?<br />
<br />
It all depends on what you are planning. For solo trips deep into the Hole I recommend the following arsenal:<br />
<br />
-Stinging wort potions (Hot-keyable instant click 300hp loving)<br />
-Undead’s Recourse (Like stinging wort but 150hp insta click)<br />
-Rejuvenation potions (only 2mins or so…but amazing regen that stack with all. Some classes (wink) can get over 100hp per tick with these…more than enough to handle most pesky mobs <br />
-Soluans Vigor (Like lesser rejuvenation)<br />
-Kilva’s Potions (DS potions again very useful for certain scenarios…be prepared!)<br />
<br />
<br />
SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Since Nixx on the Test Server first soloed melee only summoning dragon in WW many other shaman have gone on to do this same feat. Other classes have claimed this but I have yet to see screenshots (other than exploiting bards!)<br />
<br />
The basic rule...if we can root and/or slow it...its dead.<br />
<br />
Nuff said<br />
<br />
That is it for now...updates pending as I think of things I have forgotten...of which I am sure there is lots.  Have any solo tips or adventures of your own? Please post them as I look forward to reading them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">-Just wanted to say thanks Epyx for all the detailed info -Started Shaman as a secondary and got him to 30 now and think the spells are starting to get good -Was looking for a guide that touched on all the issues and here it is. Nice work:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Absolutely fantastic guide.<br />
<br />
I think every shaman should read this post, as it is a great guide to soloing.<br />
<br />
I wish i had read this earlier, would have helped me get through the 'dark levels' faster.  level 20 was hell for me expescially, took along time to get through, as i was hunting in Netherbian, and i was &quot;too low&quot; to get a solid group.<br />
<br />
The places i hunt are kinda screwy, and i often group with people to tackle reds.  at 28 im in OT on the ledge, heh, where most is red, or yellow at the lowest.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i dont believe you can emphasize how much 24 is worth when it comes to soloing.  My friend said to me &quot;it wont be that much better, soloing isnt 'that' easy&quot;.  Well, a few days ago, he(a 30 monk(29 at the time, w/ me 26) w/ no item of equip under 500pp, AND a fungi pulled 2, i took 1, him the other.  I myself am quite twinked, but nowhere near as much as he is(i have 706hp, and 550ac and 158 wis at 27(looking to drop more wis for ac/hp though).  Anyway, wouldnt you know it, similar level mobs, him 29, me 26, and i took out mine before he got his.<br />
<br />
Just a small bit of proof that shamans are the best soloers in the game :)<br />
<br />
anyway, once again thanks Epyx for this wonderfull guide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing is wrong.  With canni dancing, while it MAY seem like the info is sent every 6 seconds, the truth is the amount of mana you gain is directly proportional to how long you sit down, no matter whether you &quot;hit it right&quot; every six seconds.<br />
<br />
Proof of this is found when you try and med, barely sitting down every six seconds to make your bar go up.  When you do this for extended periods of time it gives the illusion that you have a lot of mana.  In fact, in an experiment, I had a FULL BAR OF MANA after medding from OOM only sitting down every 6 seconds for about 0.5 seconds just to get off the mana tick, so the bar would go up.<br />
<br />
TO MY SUPRISE. I cast one heal and MY WHOLE BAR WENT DOWN TO NOTHING.  So it is then I discovered that while you may seem like you are getting the same amount of mana sitting down every 6 seconds, you really are not.  <br />
<br />
What does this mean?<br />
<br />
With canni dancing, don't worry about sitting down and &quot;hitting it right&quot; because you will recover mana equal to the amount of time you actually sit down.  You heard it from me first.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gaga, the instance you are describing where your mana bar was completely used on one spell may have been a fluke.  I regularly canni dance so that Im only sitting for a very short period and never have I experienced what you just described.<br />
<br />
Heck I even med on the run sometimes, just sitting right when the tick is going to go off.  It is quite reliable.<br />
<br />
Im just offering some further personal experience (not refuting what you said) to possibly help clarify the bonuses to canni dancing.<br />
<br />
Great guide though Epyx, you should email it to the administrators of EQShaman.com and CastersRealm.com.  Im sure they would appreciate such a modern and extensive guide.<br />
<br />
My only comment is regarding pet tanking at higher levels (45+ or so, specifically 51+).  At 51, when a Shaman gets Turgors, the pet can easily tank two or three mobs in a row without needing a heal or regen spell.  I would include in the guide a strategy that is based on both the character and the pet tanking.  To look at it another way, why keep the pet at 100% health all the time?  Your health is FAR more valuable than dogdog's health as your health is basically mana.  Try and have the pet tank as much as possible but make sure he stays alive.  This way, it preserves your health so you can use it for mana later.<br />
<br />
Although this process may be difficult for some, all it really requires is a combination of root rotting and pet tanking.  If you have a JBB it is even easier.  Make sure that the pet has taunt on, pull a mob with slow and pet kite it for a few moments while the pet gets aggro.  Then sit and med for a few ticks so the pet has sufficient aggro and lay into the mob with a few dots or start JBB blasting.  If the pet is decent on life and you gain aggro, pet kite the mob for another few moments until the mob turns on the pet again.  If the pet gets to 25% or so life, jump in and tank a mob or two until it is back to nearly 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you tested it?  Try medding like you do from 0 mana, and get to like 60 mana.   Cast a spell, you will lose it all.   The mana gained is only an ILLUSION.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i tested it<br />
<br />
i chain cast some high mana spells, then cannid up to 60m<br />
<br />
i then procceded to cast sow on myself<br />
<br />
bar didnt move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The argument isn't whether canni gives you the mana, its whether the mana you gain from sitting only 0.5 seconds out of 6 gives you mana (The 0.5 seconds where your bar moves *ticks*) THIS MANA you gain is an ILLUSION if you are not sitting the FULL 6 seconds.  An illusion in the sense that you will only gain a mana percent = to the amount of time you were sitting in between ticks.  So if you get 18 mana a tick and you were sitting 3 seconds for a particular tick, you will get 9 mana for that amount of time.  This is what I am saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">maybe your timing is off on your sitting =\<br />
<br />
The only thing i can possibly think of is game coding issues.  If your sitting at the tick you get the full mana.  <br />
However, if the game is coded so that at a tick, the client side outputs onto the bar, yet doesnt correctly verify that data w/ the server, then it might seem like you have gotten the full amount.  However, after casting it might check w/ the server, realizing its calculations are wrong, and making it seem like it didnt work.<br />
<br />
When i stare at the transparent type inventory, almost always this is what happens:<br />
random example: lets say my HP is 50/75.  a tick!, 52/75.  but wait a second, it goes down back to 50/75, and about 2/3 seconds later back to 52/75.<br />
<br />
that happens most, if not all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In regards to pet tanking:  I cast Plague and EvB, then jump in with pet. Typically when EBolt wears off I will root, back off recast it and then jump back in to tank with pet.<br />
<br />
My question is: How much damage can pet do typically do in 1 minute 49 seconds? Assuming the dot's do 2400+- will the pet ever outdamage the dots in the same period? I ask because of the experience 'sharing' issue...I like Jabober..but he never says 'thank you' for the experience..and never levels so he'll hit harder.  If the dots really are outdamaging him..then I don't need to recast EBolt in most cases..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With my Spirit of the Howler lvl 56 pet I have noticed he generally does 700-1k per fight.  Based only on Katta Gaurd testing only.<br />
<br />
I don't think you need to worry about him outdamaging you with those lvl 49 dots..not even close ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pet kinda fades at about 53, i found that fighting wyverns in CS ended with a very dead pet and an almost dead Urdegish<br />
<br />
Excellent guide though, and im REALLY glad SOMEONE included the 33% penalty Dots have when the mob is moving, well done!<br />
<br />
At 52+ i solo in CS with the following<br />
<br />
CS:<br />
<br />
Pull with plague (33% loss of slow DoT is MUCH less then the damage lost by a fast DoT i.e. EB)<br />
Root<br />
EB<br />
Re-root if need be.<br />
Med/Canna<br />
Re-Ebolt<br />
Re-root if necessary<br />
Plague shud fade<br />
Then Ebolt<br />
Then nuke (POISON DD, they are ice mobs therefore very resistant to Blizard Blast)<br />
Poof! Armour gems, spells and canny PP =)<br />
<br />
Pet fighting i seem to find only works in places where mobs dont hit for more than ~110... after that, even with slow, they suffer too harshly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am a level 21 (soon to be 22) shaman and am very appreciative for the soloing guide and advice that has been provided.<br />
<br />
One thought on the &quot;dark levels&quot; though.  Once I hit level 19 and got all of my spells, I went to the Pauldal Caverns.  If you get into a good group of about 4-6 people the experience keeps rolling in.  In about 4 hours of play time I went from level 19 to 21 with no deaths and some pretty decent loot.  I plan on staying there until I hit lvl 24 then may strike out on my own again.  The only warning is that ShadowHaven merchants will not sell to Barbarians....you can buy spells but can't train either.  To buy and sell you have to go to the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is an easy faction quest in SH (can't remember the guy right now) involves running reports between FG/Bazaar and SH...a few times and you will be able to shop in SH. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Epyx, what do you suggest for me to do, soloing in OT...<br />
<br />
levels 30--&gt;33 are quite bad i know, but i CAN solo blues(when i can find them) and whites(but too much downtime).  i havent gotten my 'when to canni' rythem quite down yet though ;(.<br />
<br />
Do you think i should root/rot it, or just nuke kite.  I was thinking i should pull w/ slow, root it then stick EB on till its about half health then jus nuke it, but havent tried that yet :(<br />
<br />
any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just some small input.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you do have JBB, Late 40s, go to LOIO.  No reason you can't cut through Bloodgills like butter.  Just watch for pirannha as they are NOT like the BG's who have like 1400 hp but MUCH tougher.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, vs. Wyverns in CS, at 51 I had no issue pulling with epic, running, siccing pet, slowing and jbbing.  Only mana cost is slow and as long as you are dubious or better, you can get singles all day long, just watch out for Drakes and named Wyverns as these WILL give you a faction hit where the Wyvern's won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I wouldnt suggest bloodgils with a jbb.  I tried that and has such a hard time jbb'ing while in the water.  It might have been just me, but pulling them all the way back to the little ledge thing just didnt seem worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Easy way to not get interrupted:<br />
<br />
Bring pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Root other BG if you have 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sic pet on #1.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry this really isn't a MODERN guide. There are Luclin zones that are way better for XP than some of the zones mentioned here.<br />
<br />
Go to these if you have Luclin:<br />
<br />
16-21 (or higher if you want) P Caverns. (Best XP in the game)<br />
21-25 Netherbian Lair<br />
26-31 Mseru<br />
<br />
These zones are all close to each other. They are also all close to a city so you can shop and bank all you want.<br />
<br />
But if you still don't have Luclin then the other guy's guide is great.<br />
<br />
<br />
If someone knows good Luclin zones from 33 on up then plz post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Excellent guide!

Went from 34-35 in no time flat. I have read other post before were some shamans think our pets are worthless. Those shaman are fools. I have used my pet 90% of the time so far. I used him to hold the grimiling runner so I could nuke the heck out of him (for those that don't know it is almost impossible to get root to stick to the runner).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>raslem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was reading the posts here to find out more about the shaman class and came upon this thread.  First let me say that was a great post to start it off Epyx.  I wish I could read an overview like that on all the classes in EQ.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to comment on the canni-dancing/illusion mana issue.  I don't play a shaman, so I can't say for sure that this will apply to you all.  I play a mage and I thought of the idea of recharging my mana while running from one place to another when I was younger.  So, I'd run for 5 seconds, sit for 1 until the mana bar moved, then get up and run again.  Imagine my surprise when I got into a fight and upon casting my first spell my mana bar dropped to almost empty.<br />
<br />
After reading this thread, I decided to log in and test it again.  This time, without running and just standing still.  So, I burned all my mana, readied True North (a nice, low mana cost spell), and stood for 5 seconds, sat for 1 until it ticked, stood back up again, and so on until I had all my mana back on the mana bar.  Then I casted True North and watched my mana bar go way way down to about half a blue bubble.<br />
<br />
So, why does canni-dancing seem to work?  I don't know for sure since I don't have a shaman to test it with, and it may be that it does work, but my guess is that this happens because you're casting a spell, and casting a spell is what updates the mana bar.  And the spell, Cannibalize, gives back mana, so the mana bar fills up some.  However, if fills up to the correct level now, meaning instead of adding the full amount the spell would give you to the mana bar it gives the amount of Cannibalize less the amount of the illusion mana from the sitting for a second.<br />
<br />
Try running yourself out of mana sometime and then recharging by standing most of the time and just sitting at the tick.  And don't cast any spells in between because that will refresh the mana bar.  At the end, cast a low cost mana spell and see if it takes your mana most of the way down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Regarding regen cap (specifically the potion comment):<br />
<br />
First, I want to chime in and send thanks to Epyx for taking the time to write such a great thing.  Like others, I VERY MUCH wish I'd had this to read long before I hit 57.  ;)<br />
<br />
In any case, I've recently run up against a new concept for me:  the regen cap.  With 3 AA regen, fungi, regrowth, bearform (etc), I noticed an impressive 42hp/tick regen.  Along came a druid to our raid and slapped on SLD (or maybe it was ranger FoN).  STILL, 42hp/tick.<br />
<br />
Then Epyx says:<br />
&quot;-Rejuvenation potions (only 2mins or so…but amazing regen that stack with all. Some classes (wink) can get over 100hp per tick&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY hoping there's some way around that cap (which I must have missed, other folks said they'd read it in a patch message or some such) - but thinkin more likely that this info is from before they changed this.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There is no coded regeneration cap. However some spells just won't stack with regrowth. The druid's PoTG should stack fine however as do a couple of other regen spells.<br />
<br />
The potion regen will stack with regrowth as it operates like a torpor/regen hybrid.<br />
<br />
I get:<br />
<br />
18 natural (iksar/troll regen at 60 sitting)<br />
2 greater bearform<br />
3 aaxp (nerfed...was 6 for troll/iksar)<br />
15 fungi<br />
15 regrowth<br />
<br />
= 53 per tick regen + potion stack<br />
<br />
Note: They did recently change the Fungi staff regrowth to no longer stack and some other spell combinations but the above still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Excellent guide, you should really try to get this displayed more prominently on some of the shammy websites. I started with a monk, changed my mind, went to a shaman and loved it. Then I hit the hell levels and lost interest. After finding this post I'm back practising full time Shamanism. Great advice, not sure about the canni dance routine (never was much cop at dancing anyway) but I've learned a lot from this post that has converted into several levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My main is a Cleric and I do know about trying to catch the tick for the mana.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ok, this guide is great! I'm level 35, and want to know if the kodiaks are hard. Do they agro, are they social? I'm think of going there tonight, but not sure how hard it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Konnen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heh, I find it amusing that many many shaman have used this technique of canni-dancing and reported successful results.  I even do this and there is no doubt in my mind that it works.  I can recover mana much faster than a druid friend.  I'm even battle ready sooner than any of my necro friends.<br />
<br />
I've even used this technique with my cleric, though minus the canni of course. ;)  It works.  I don't know what Gaga and the mage are talking about but I would guess their timing is off.<br />
<br />
Great guide, btw.  I learned many of the techniques in the great school of hard knocks but it's great to see someone document them for the newer shaman.   /salute !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Batalon...<br />
<br />
Kodiaks have a very small aggro range but they are most definately social and pulling or kiting near another one is sure to tick em off.<br />
<br />
However, the beauty in kodiaks is how they are arranged in the caves and the fact that there are several roamers walking about that are easy to pick.<br />
<br />
In the caves most of the kodiaks are standing single and are out of the social aggro range of other kodiaks. There are a couple of exceptions but for the most part they are standing as individuals.<br />
<br />
I see you are level 35 and so should have no trouble pulling yellows and even cons with your 34 woofer. It might take a few to get the hang of it but I am sure once you do xp will fly.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ok, thanks Epyx, i went there last night, and killed a couple. All i could find were blue cons with the occasional yellow(very rare). I only pulled the first three out of each cave, and they were all blue. Are harder ones deeper?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Just want to add a quick comment about levels 19-23 - they're actually not that bad for shaman soloing, provided you keep your ac. My shaman is lvl 20, and a bit twinked, although not excessively (5/55 rings, totemic, etc) with 148 wis right now. He's at 537ac unbuffed, and once I replace his earrings and a runed mithril bracer with orc fang earrings and a rygorr bracer, his ac should hover around 550 unbuffed at lvl 20.<br />
<br />
This kind of ac makes tanking the mobs very viable in the dark levels, and isn't especially difficult to achieve with relatively cheap items.<br />
<br />
This may not be a useful tip for most new people, but those who have twink shammies or the means and inclination to twink one shouldn't get discouraged by those levels.</div></div><hr />

I am a level 21 (soon to be 22) shaman and am very appreciative for the soloing guide and advice that has been provided.<br />
<br />
One thought on the &quot;dark levels&quot; though.  Once I hit level 19 and got all of my spells, I went to the Pauldal Caverns.  If you get into a good group of about 4-6 people the experience keeps rolling in.   <br />
<br />
I usually solo...but when I do group, depending on the size of the pull and other factors, I will often step into the melee, /assist puller, root mob, get real close with mob and tank it. Root will often put you on top of the mobs hate list...if it doesnt adding a dot usually works :)<br />
<br />
Nice way to keep your Offense, Defense and weapon skills up when grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zemkenic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Root will often put you on top of the mobs hate list... <br />
<br />
While root is an aggro producer per se, when a mob is rooted proximity aggro takes precedence.  A warrior can taunt a rooted mob all day, but the closest PC will have the attention of any rooted mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Update to this thread:<br />
<br />
Verant has removed the 33% penalty for damage over time spells when the mob is moving.  You can now effectively cast your dots and run around like a mad dr00d and they will do full damage.</div></div><hr />

SLD doesn't have a regen component, and the icon is different from FoN (which looks like a damage shield icon). You're thinking of Skin like Nature, which does stack quite nicely with all other regen.</div></div><hr />
