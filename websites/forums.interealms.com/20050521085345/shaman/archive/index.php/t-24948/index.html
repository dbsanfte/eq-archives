<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When does slow (xxx Haze) begin to be worth it to cast on mobs?<br />
<br />
I haven’t noticed a marked difference in mob DPS against our tank when using Wailing Haze App2 at level 12 Shaman.<br />
<br />
In fact, I seem to get more mitigation bang for my buck using Weakness App3 at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've heard the second slow get (Keening Haze for Mystics @ 24, Degeneration for Defilers @ 22) is much more effective.<br />

What he said. Also remember, the first slow you get as a Shaman in EQ1(Drowsy?) is pretty much the same way when you get it...doesnt seem worth casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So even at Adept1 it won't be worth casting?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's worth casting, as far as i can tell. But it's not the over-powered one-trick wonder of EQ1. That is wards ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I probably wouldnt bother buying an Adept1 for the first slow unless you have money pouring out of your ears. I would worry about getting Adepts for Spectral Ward, Minor Archhealing, Contagion..maybe Grey Wind first.</div></div><hr />

Wards are frickn sweet. hehe doing the acess quest for one of the tower zones i just gave a tank 3 wards and he trained all the mobs out of the tower so i could finish the quest.<br />
<br />
/hug wards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wards are the shazbot for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slow doesn't mean much because they don't effect the rate at which NPCs cast spells/use combat arts. Since thats the majority of the damage done to you, thats why you don't see as much benefit from slow spells. Stuns are the greater damage prevention, or in long fights, power drains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jumblies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wards are your best friend... <br />
<br />
Ward before pull... then slow/weaken/DoT after tank has agro.   then just ward/heal as necessary...<br />
<br />
I even find myself warding the clerics.... ALOT haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wards are the shazbot for sure.<br />
<br />
Well said. :)<br />
<br />
...and a brawler subclass is your best friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've found that Wailing Haze Apprentice 3 works pretty well for boss mobs. Yes, they still use their skills, but I'm getting hit with 100 damage regular hits when I draw aggro, which means slowing those down helps at least.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for my Conjuror to hit level 26. (AE DoT that prevents NPC's from using spells/skills.. Rar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Slows always matter!  =p  <br />
<br />
But, yeah, the first slow:  Wailing Haze - is a bit weak compared to what comes later on.  Keep in mind, though, that Wailing Haze is a SHAMAN spell line.  It's the slow we share with the Defiler sub-class, and it's a less effective one.  The MYSTIC line slow which starts with Keening Haze is essentially completely different, cause it's inherent to the Mystic sub completely.  The Defilers get their own &quot;slows&quot;, as components of their other spells, like Fulginous Sphere.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps?<br />
<br />
edit:  Just read Tortuk's post, didn't realize I was beating a dead horse. =p  Hopefully the clarification on the sub/adventure class line slow differences helped a bit though.  If you remember the issue that was fixed in one of the early patches with the two spells stacking, that's why.  Anyway. =)</div></div><hr />
