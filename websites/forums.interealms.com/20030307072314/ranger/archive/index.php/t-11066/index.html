<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I had some time to kill before I had to go to class today, but not enough time to get anything done in an exp group...so I thought, &quot;what the hell.  I'm gonna go to Mistmoore and get my self some vampire fangs.&quot;  So off I went.  I zone in and check to see who is in the zone...level 50 ranger(me) and a level 60 assassin.  I got a really bad feeling when I saw the assassin, but I camoed up and headed to the maid's room and low and behold, the assassin was camping her.  I thought to my self, &quot;god damnit.  he doesn't even need the fangs, he is probably gonna go sell them in the bazaar.&quot;  So I sighed and headed to the zone line and sat down.  I /ooced that I hoped he was getting the fangs for a ranger alt and camped.<br />
<br />
Now, I am almost positive he wasn't doing it for an alt, and I'm sure he just wanted to sell them in the bazaar(seen the fangs for 1k there).  So tell me...why do people do this?  I mean, there have got to be better ways for people to make money other than camping items that other classes need for quests like this one...I mean, damn...those fangs take a lot of time  to get and it makes me mad that some other class that really doesn't need them is trying to get them.<br />
<br />
I will also admit that they guy could have been there for legitimate reasons, but still....  I guess I was just pissed that I couldn't get the fangs...plus, I really got my ass kicked in there...pretty pathetic getting my ass handed to me by a bunch of green mobs.  And yes, I realize I could have gone to camp the butler, but I don't know how to get there because I am lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent over 50 hours camping the maid and never got a fang. A guildmate had an extra and gave me that one to end my suffering.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you're correct in your assumption that he was camping it ONLY to sell it...per your statement he never stated that he was farming it to sell. I guess I'm too generous in first impressions. I'd assume that he was helping a ranger friend out with a pain in the ass camp, unless I was specifically told otherwise.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your chance to camp it was botched, though. I know the frustration. Finished the quest when I was level 51, and I never want to go back that zone again. However, I'm very glad I finished it, because I hate how slow Firestrike is and almost always keep CoF up while I'm soloing because of the fast cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That kills me, but, what really bugs me is when you are running through Butcherblock (Because yes I am a cheap jerk and still take the boat.) And you see a level 35+ (insert class here, even seen Rangers doing this one, which killed me inside) camping an Aqua Goblin Camp when lower level Dwarves could use that for their newbie quests AND Xp. I don't care what I am camping unless it is for a quest (like the Vampire Fangs) then there is no absolute way I will camp something that someone else wants for experience. Mind you, there is a difference too. I wouldn't give up, say, Najena because the person decided he only wanted to Camp her and not the other named spawns that con blue. Najena stuck in my mind today because I got my second Traveler's Pack from Rathyl there this morning. <br />
<br />
I would, however, have given up the Aqua Goblin Camp. I think it is rude to say &quot;No, I need the money for a minor upgrade more than you need to be level 13.&quot; Especially if it is a Ranger or Druid. Go Camp Griffons and Fear Kite them, but don't ruin someone else's closer chance to level. And especially not if they need the items for their newbie quests.</div></div><hr />
