<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I actually made this test where I soloed three whites and three blues and oddly enough I got 5% exp from the three whites and 6% exp from the three blues.<br />
<br />
All of them were the Rhinos in OT. What is up with this? I soloed the blues first then the whites.<br />
<br />
Another issue is that I am finding I can gain more EXP soloing then grouping within the same time frame, is this another thing for me to look forward to?<br />
<br />
Any of this happen to you guys?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats about it. Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what to make of getting more xp from blues than whites, it shouldn't happen that way.  It is quite common for shamans to make more xp solo than in groups, until POP came out I was better off solo than grouping 95% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The extra percent comes from rounding.  With each kill you were getting 1% plus a little ... when yuo get enough of those little percents you round up and it looks like you got more exp then you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">interesting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What theknightmax says could be true, if the circumstances happened to be just right.<br />
<br />
For example, and only going by tenths...<br />
<br />
For your blues:<br />
0.9 (shows as 0%) to 6.0 (shows as 6%) is a total change of 5.1% or 1.7% per kill, but shows as 6% xp.<br />
<br />
For your whites:<br />
0.0 (shows as 0%) to 5.9 (shows as 5%) is a total change of 5.9% or just over 1.9% per kill, but shows as 5% xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
More of the same tests, or of larger numbers would show what is actually occurring.<br />
<br />
Let us know if your results still seem odd, please.<br />
<br />
<br />
And like Drinnar says, until PoP it was quite easy for shaman to gain more xp solo than grouped.  Now it's best if you can sweet talk your enchanter friends into duoing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's what happened.<br />
<br />
The 3 whites gave you 5.7% exp.<br />
<br />
The 3 blues gave you 5.4% exp.<br />
<br />
You started at 61.7% exp. The 3 blues bumped you up to 67.1%, which looks like a 6% gain.  Then, the 3 whites bumped you up to 72.5%, which looks like a 5% gain.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical numberse but you get the point.</div></div><hr />

3 of each is simply not enough : )</div></div><hr />
