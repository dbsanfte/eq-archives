<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a little warning, the new SCS AA is not 3/3/3 as mentioned in several threads, it's 3/6/9.  Just in case you wonder were all your saved AA went after klicking yes a couple of times ...<br />
Same might be true for other AAs like FoMM</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is there really to get??<br />
<br />
I mean honestly the aa in this new expansion for shaman are crap.<br />
And yes I was one of the ones who waited to say anything, cause I hadn't seen them for myself and wanted to see if there would be any last minute changes.<br />
<br />
The only reason I will buy the new expansion, is the new spell slow. It's the only ability that imo will help me play the game better.<br />
<br />
All the other aa imo will have a marginal impact.<br />
<br />
I really do think with increased aa cost and marginal use, their just <br />
an aa sponge for people maxxed on aa alrdy. Give yah something to do til next expansion I suppose... woopie!</div></div><hr />

Hehe not all of us want to keep our ability to gain aggro to save the dress wearers.  I'm quite happy to have the lowered aggro on my dots and nukes.<br />
