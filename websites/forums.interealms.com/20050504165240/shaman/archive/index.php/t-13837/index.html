I am confused as to what stone you are talkign about. You were supposed to give him your fur that you looted from black dire.<br />
<br />
Also I HATE ej and TT cause of both kos living and undead so no ONE inviz can work so i rooted anything that aggroed had a nice lineup behind me as i did the turn-in :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're fine, if you already turned in the gem to the spirit after doing Woe/Envy then all you need to do now is go and kill Black Dire and hand in the pelt to that same spirit.  It's been awhile since I did it so check the walkthrough for the exact steps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was able to take down Black Dire with some help last night.  Afterwards I high tailed it to TT to turn it in to the Sentinel Spirit.  I hailed him, gave him the gem and started to converse.  When I got to the statement &quot;How like the wasichu?&quot; he would not respond.  Tried several variations as well.  Finally I just handed him the pelt and got the faction hit and boots (Yeah!).<br />
<br />
I also have all the messages from CoM, so I hailed him again to get the book and asked the spirit &quot;Am I a Heyokah?&quot;.  No response.  Have they changed this portion of epic, or is it broken?  I petitioned, but received no reply.  Anyone else have this problem?  Do I need to restart at Woe/Envy?  Help appreciated, thanks....</div></div><hr />
