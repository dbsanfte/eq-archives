Raid in ssra temple, you'll run into this gem.  Whenever folks ask for 'heal mititgation' here it is, and its not as fun as it sounds.<br />
Hots still land for full, so we rock in ssra. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=5283&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Granted, a lot of stuff is 36 counters so this still won't get it, but damn... if they get an upgraded single target cure, we should also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I notice that the new focus has 2 lines called &quot;Stats cap(85)&quot;. Does this mean that it raises the stats cap by 85 twice (presumably all stat caps). Add this to the STA buffs &quot;stats cap(40)&quot;, and it will presumably allow someone to raise the STA cap by 210, ie with all AA skills you could get a STA up to 565?<br />
<br />
Hmmm....I see that the single target haste has become a 5% damage modifier that lasts an hour, which seems to be the same thing as ancestral strength. I guess they are still fiddling around with what these spells actually do.<br />
<br />
A couple of the most recent changes have also made some of the spells un-dispellable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i dont know where they get there feedback from, but most of this isnt anything i feedback thats for sure. seems they just dont listen to feedback or there are some none shaman playing shaman and trying to kill us. some i can understand i didnt know why talisman of ancestral grace was 1 level above ancestrail grace so moving it was likely,  but the cap on stam really hurts, sure it still helpfull but it was much better at 75. and funnily lions strength in still 67 less mana etc and ours is now 69. sounds very fishy to me.<br />
<br />
so far all they done is move about spells and decrease some, they also remove a whole load of ph spells, but whether that to work on some new spells or just because their schedule is so tight they cant work on them anymore is to be seen.<br />
<br />
over all, it wouldnt take much to make the spell great a 100 more here 200 there, but apartently at the moment with just this small amounts we be over powered.<br />
<br />
as said not impressed with it yet, needs alot more work , probably more than before realise.  my advice, stay in pop and god dont buy this till aleast 2 month and probably more 4 month by which time they have actually beta tested it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 months after the release of Omens they will already be working on a new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Gloriana.  You think after 65 levels, SOE could have come up with a couple new spells....  Or especially since they have changed the pace and style of the game to the detriment of slowing/dotting classes, they would have introduced a new spell line or purpose for us.<br />
<br />
While its the same stuff with a new name, at least it has the modifiers on it.  How all these &quot;5%&quot; dmg increase here, &quot;40 over the stat cap there&quot; is going to parse out only time will tell.  <br />
<br />
I have this sinking suspicion that an enc will still be able to slow pretty much the same, and out dps the entire group with a pet though.<br />
<br />
LIkewise, I have this sinking suspicion that battles will be just as short.<br />
<br />
In addition, I'm getting the feeling that our heals aren't being bumped up in terms of our percentage relationship to druids/clerics, so in terms of raw hp healed, again, we'll be behind.<br />
<br />
I also note that the new cripple looks to be about 2x our current cripple.  Sweet :(  You mean, I can reduce a gods strength by 100 now!!! ****.  I shouldn't be so pessimistic.  Perhaps they are running the numbers and setting the new mobs strength low enough that Crippling Spasm will be worth casting.  Guess we'll find out.</div></div><hr />

true, if poeple actually buy OOW  in any number, tell yer friends dont buy it the less they get the more likely they actaullu try and get it right.<br />

Tell ya what, with the announcement of the new Focus Effect Scale on spells past 65 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=23357), THIS could be the single best thing that could happen to everyone, and is PROBABLY the main reason they did it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, this is like cutting off your nose to spite your face. If your not going to buy OoW, then just quit. Seriouisly, you havent hurt them by not buying OoW and keeping accounts active. <br />
<br />
As Snoww said on another thread, 30 bucks is about as much as you spend on a decent dinner. Not buying OoW is just going to end up leaving you behind in the game. EQ has changed from &quot;Leveling up is playing&quot; to &quot;Get to the highest level, THEN Play&quot;. If you want to reserve judgement on the expasion and buy it on only 1 account, and not the others, thats cool. But at least give it a shot. dont &quot;depend&quot; on everything you read. <br />
<br />
And, please, give them a couple months to make adjustments. Gates was the worst pile of poo every released. But now, its semi-reasonable, even for non-raider types. Adjustments have been made and it has been turned into a &quot;decent&quot; expansion (granted, not up there with Kunark or Velious, but its a sight better than LoY if you were 65 when it came out).</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, nobody would &quot;be behind&quot; simply by not purchasing Omens. Anyone who is, because of someone else, needs to shave the wool from their eyes. Without saying much (NDA), unless you have your $30 out of Gates, don't buy Omens, period. Yes, I know, crazy idea, making your own decisions, but it works!<br />
<br />
The only reason anyone could be &quot;behind&quot; is if everybody does get it, despite the last expansion they screwed up and is fairly useless to the general masses, and how, in my opinion, awful the beta is. So, did you get your $30 out of Gates? If you did, go for Omens, have fun!  If you didn't, don't waste your time/money. Especially since, from what I remember reading (elsewhere), spells are going to be similar to Gates, not PoP (runes + no drop spells = here we go again).<br />
<br />
Just, think about it, first. Read the REAL info given, and not the marketing hype. Marketing people can sell ice to an eskimo and they certainly don't need it... having real info, can help you make informed decisions. Something this world, in general, is lacking anymore (example: warning labels on everything... most shouldn't be needed, common sense should kick in with a &quot;Duh&quot;).<br />
<br />
Give them a few months and let them work out the problems? Did that with Gates, still waiting to be able to actually get some use out of it. Maybe they should take a hint from LoY and give something to everyone, that everyone can use. Task system certainly isn't it, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents... in short, don't be a blind sheep. If you don't want to buy it, get the facts (NOT the marketing hype and don't make your decision because &quot;everybody else is doing it&quot; either, especially if you find no use for it... we had that happen with Gates and look at what happened) and make an informed decision before you plan to throw down $30 for it. If you want to take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach, go for it, that's the best way to do it, provided anybody actually buys it in the first place ;)  Sure, you have some people in the beta saying &quot;It's great!&quot; and you have others saying &quot;It's awful!&quot;... it depends on play style primarily, but like I said, without saying much... if you didn't like or get any use out of Gates, chances are, you won't out of Omens either.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to spend $30 for 5 levels? If so, I have a bridge for sale...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you never set foot in an OoW zone, you will still get the opportunity to knock out 5 more levels, which will give you that much more power in comparison to the mobs you are facing.  I find that regardless of gear a mob 5 levels below me does far less damage than an even con mob.  I find my spells land far more easily on mobs 5 levels below me.<br />

Peeps pay (or used to) big real $$ for ebay characters and items.  People will pay for this expansion I have no doubt.  I still enjoy EQ, I will buy the expansion myself, but my goodness the developers really are lame.  I just wish there were some way to get Sony to slow down a bit and fix content, fix class balance, fix annoying issues (FA duration cough cough), instead of throwing stuff out there and working on new expansions.  Obviously they need to have a small team of developers and programmers devoted to making sure the existing content works correctly and is fair to all of its customers. <br />

<br />
PS: Blazz I think you misunderstood the focus change. Bumping up our spells by 1 level will mean that the existing focus items will be 10% less effective since the baseline is level 65.  Not a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually this is where you are wrong, they make much more clear profit on expansions than they do from your monthly subscriptions. this is why they keep churning them out.  Therefore not buying it does hurt them. <br />

i can tell you now level 70 only help in pop and below, and possible only minor help in elemental and above, you will have no real benefit or extra power as a shaman from level 65 to 70. in gates or oow. there is a benefit but you`ll find a level 65 shaman in god group will be doing pretty much the same healing/ damage as a 70 shaman in group as spells stand at the moment. the u/g dont add enough to make a difference the mobs will still die too fast for you to be able to do much, as such the beneifit of higher levels isnt much.</div></div><hr />

Actually, upon closer examination, it doesn't look like a slow:<br />
<br />
Spell Type: Beneficial<br />
Category: Haste [Single]<br />
Game Description: Grants your target quickened movement, increasing their attack speed for %z.<br />
<br />
I suspect that &quot;Decrease Attack Speed by 50%&quot; is just SOE speak for &quot;Decrease weapon delay by 50%&quot; or some such.<br />
<br />
I assume the logical use for a 3-tick-PBAE-50%-haste-30-second-recast spell would be against heavy dispellers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can definately live with the recast for a group spell. At least I'll only have to have it mem'd one minute ever 10. <br />
<br />
The pbae slow could use either another tic or 100 less mana, but it'll be great for things like ldons and just really lousy pulls. Going to be hell having every shaman mob in the game casting that against the group though. Also the agro on that spell and tirgurs isn't very much because neither of them have any counters. I've never had much trouble shedding tigi's agro, this should have almost exactly the same. Just add a built in -40 mod and it'll be an awesome emergency spell and worth the mana cost.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in it's current form, I suspect this is UNRESISTABLE 50% PBAOE slow since it is a beneficial spell, a la Harmony (note there is no &quot;resist&quot; entry in Lucy). I also suspect it may have no agro for the same reason.<br />

Doubt it, more likely they just took our group haste and made it a slow but forgot to change things like the beneficial tag and the effect name. Wouldn't be the first time they left crap like that out.</div></div><hr />

after feedback constantly about shaman spells and seeing nothing feedback acted on (for instance the 67 pet is STILL the level 61 pet  hits for 60 2k hp etc, dd still underpowered. the new hot is still 200 under what trushar does etc, and that the obvous ones.) and in most cases nerf to any spells that where decent (stam nerf to 40 cap, hp on new focus etc), i almost given up bothering, and resigned myself to the fact that i wont be playing  much longer, eq is not the game i started or played for 5 years anymore. They seem to have become complacent and the current devs become so sure they know better than players that the only way to get any fun back will be to not buy it and look esle where.

dont be fooled by soe smoke screen, they are the only ones who try to say lucy is inaccurrate, the data on lucy is pretty accurate. Yes some things it doesn`t understand so well but for raw numbers its dead on. that is beside the point though, all i say is they are pretty much what they say on lucy. exceptt they now try to disguised spell like the pet so you cant tell its the old one,or how bad it is, without lucy i betting they wouldnt even change any spell till after release because everyone would assume they are capable and would just buy it assume it finished, they are not. Lucy must be their bane, it makes than do work and show how based their real thinking is.  Are you really that gullable tug? look at pop? look at god? look at ldon? the spells there had very little done to them before release and where identical to what lucy said they where. saying it will get changed just because is foolish, how often do they have to keep doing what they do before you see it? Soe already decide what spells should be, they`ll try their up most not to change them because they go their hands full actually trying to get the expansion working correctly first, whcih again they fail to do regularly too, they just dont have the correct time or will it appears to do the work the correct way. i am just glad lucy is there to fill some the blanks , because without it i wouldnt even know what some spells did they have so little effect, and it gives a warning to those that can see clearly how bad this expasion will be. but then again tug, you see no problems so you`ll probably love it, corse you be playing mainly with yourself but again you wont care you 2 box or more!.<br />
<br />
i know none of the feedback i did on spells has had any effect. they havent corrected the ones obivously wrong, but nerfed ones that had only a small benefit. that doesnt sound like good testing to me, it sounds like someone with their own agenda just doing what they want. <br />
<br />
 or there is so little poeple working on it they just havent had time, which again is bad testing /management.</div></div><hr />

Bards can do this once every 3 seconds for 0 mana.<br />

AND they can Fading memories.<br />
AND it has a -30 resist modifier.<br />
The drawback of the bard one? small dot.<br />
* its possible this spell will have less aggro, no counters, but even my bard gets reamed when his AE slow goes off.<br />
<br />
Yes it is a change.  But they have to understand the game which exists today.  There are maybe 5-10 AE battles in the GAME.  And in all of them the shaman is expected to LIVE longer then 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
You are STILL better off casting your 4 target slow and letting bards do the AE stuff.  Because 4 mobs hitting you is managable, 50 is not.  And since shaman have no de-aggro abilities other then death... this ability means SQUAT.<br />
<br />
If that recourse works for this spell, it may be useful.  But as it stands, its crud.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">bara cudar, its obvious that some of the spells are placeholders, others are copies of old spells used as templates and some are partially implemented. They are placed on the test server in that form most likely to help the devs organize the database, there is no reason to believe that those are the forms going live, and in fact they do change from time to time. The real prototype spells under development are allmost certainly on an internal test server where Lucy cannot see them.<br />
<br />
But instead we have people shooting from the hip, threatening to quit, bla bla bla when an obvious placeholder appears on Lucy. Some of the stuff on Lucy will go live, but a lot gets changed and has changed during the beta process. Yet you do nothing to educate people about the role the data on test plays, instead you choose to reinforce their fears and general despondency. True, sometimes mistakes and oversights are made and slip through to the live servers (the Nadox debacle springs to mind), and if they are, then it is time to try to get them corrected. But really, trying to get a placeholder corrected during development seems silly.</div></div><hr />

The damage modifier on the other hand scales across all mobs, irrespective of their AC, and that is why champion in its original form was useful.

They didnt ask for it to be removed, but they questioned its usefullness. And they did ask for a group version of FA. 1 + 1 = 2, community concerns satisfied. Grats! ;).<br />
<br />
Good point on the hissy fit, but in this particular case it is likely that that is the final version of the spell :). Making a single target spell like that into a group spell increases its power, so what they appear to have done is to keep it at the same relative power by balancing the increase from the group thing with a decrease in the stat value and removal of the damage increase. If they were to increase the duration to 30 minutes, another thing the community has asked for, it is likely that the stat values would be decreased even further to compensate for the increase in power from the duration.<br />
<br />
I play my shaman primarily as a buffer rather than as a healer, and from my point of view what I want are short term, situational buffs that are extremely powerful. As soon as you increase the duration, make them more general, make them group, you increase the relative power of the spell, and consequently in order to maintain balance the absolute power of the spell has to be decreased. In the process you end up with something that is insipid and not generally regarded as valuable. Thats a point I've tried to bring across in the past, and this change is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ranger attack buffs are group, have a long duration, and most asuredly don't suck. Making spells less of a hassel isn't a reason to make them gimp too. Making it group isn't increasing the power of the spell, the shaman would keep it up on everyone that needed it anyways. Its just being less of a pita.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Dark, when you are over the soft cap for atk on a particular mob, adding more has minimal effects. I believe there are parses on the ranger boards to that effect, and have been quoted by knowledgeable shaman on this board. When melee hit their max worn atk, most mobs they encounter in the modern game have AC low enough for them to be over the soft cap, consequently atk buffs dont help much.<br />
<br />
There are people who do benefit from those buffs, but they are primarily undeveloped characters and casters. In situations where a group buff might be used it would allmost allways be more efficient to use FA. You could MGB it, but you would only do that on raids, where: (a) most people dont need atk buffs; (b) if they are casters, they should be doing other things, not meleeing; (c) buff slots are at a premium and the slot occupied by FA would be much better used by one of the new &quot;strength&quot; buffs.<br />
<br />
Short version is: you probably are not going to use this new group FA much, if you use it at all.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, as some of us have showed 3 or so months ago, the Damage Modifier was likewise inadequate as it wasn't actually increasing the damage by the 'advertised' 10%, but rather 3-4%, which for a 300 DPS(not including procs that is a pretty optimistic figure for ANY rogue) would have translated to 9-12 DPS. <br />

hardly rework much it was a copy of fa which they add a 10% modifier to and increased stats by 20? thats a tiny amount of work, just changing some data base numbers for the most part. and thats the point! they dont want to do any real work with spells, they dont have the time or ablility now (the talent left mainly or now working on eq2, whats left is the caretakers, no real talent hence the copied paste button gets alot of use) only things they can do need to be quick and simple and &quot;dont overpower&quot; in THEIR opinion only will they do.  But then it`s your opinion too wasnt it? as you think this spell would have been godly? so its more likely your feedback that got this removed, by saying how wonderful it is, so they removed it and as a bone made it group. despite the fact that the rest of the real shaman know the true power of these spells are marginal?  <br />
however group version does remove some of the hassle, though why we have to wait to level 70 when we first got avatar at 60 i not sure, a group version at 65 would be more in line.</div></div><hr />

That was what you thought it would be, not what it actually would be ;). I think for GoD mobs it probably would have been higher than 3-4%.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know how it works, the damage modifier works on a weapons base damage, and not on the damage bonus. So for most weapons a max hit would result in a 8-9% increase in total damage, and for a min hit it would result in a 0% increase in total damage. The effectiveness of the mod would depend on your average hit. As we all know, in modern content mobs tend to have low AC, particularly xp mobs, so you would get decent returns on the buff.<br />
<br />
The beauty of the old form of Champion is that it had both atk and damage modifier components. The damage modifier should have its biggest effect when mob AC is low (ie your average hit is high), while atk should have its biggest impact when mob AC is high (ie your average hit is low). As a result the buff could be expected to give a fairly uniform performance across all mob types except for those at extreme high/low AC values. It was a major advance over FA, which is limited to high AC mobs in terms of usefullness. Its a real shame that they dropped it for the current piece of garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Its a real shame that they dropped it for the current piece of garbage.<br />
The following is mostly said in jest (although my eyes nearly popped out when I saw Tugela call the current incarnation of the spell a piece of garbage).  This is NOT meant as an attack or slam.<br />
Are my eyes decieving me?!  This HAS to be the first time I've seen Tugela say anything negative about anything SoE did for shaman.  There MUST be something HORRIBLY wrong with this version of FA.</div></div><hr />
