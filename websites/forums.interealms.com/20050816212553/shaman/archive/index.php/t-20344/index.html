<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started playing beta and it seems awesome.. i am trying to make a orc warcryer..which seems to me the most like a shaman =)  just wondering if anyone else is going to play especially the pvpers since the game is based around nation/guild/clan pvp.  If you want to check it out its www.lineage.com or l2orphus.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I in beta?  Yes.  Am I playing?  Not much.   Game needs some real changes on the way they do things before I'd be interested.   But the graphics are intense and it runs very well on my system which struggles at times with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wasn't Lineage 1 originally based in S. Korea? Something like 1 million subscribers?<br />

I've seen the advertisements for L2 over on CR.  The Dark Elf female has hooters that would shame a Barb Female. It's a wonder she can swing her sword.</div></div><hr />
