<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Just dinged 57 last night.  And along with everyone else new to a level am wondering where to go next?  I have been mostly soloing PoJ prisoners by zone out.  Solo at 56 I was getting 1% every 2 kills.  Not sure what this will be at 57, because I stopped as soon as I leveled.  I occassionally will duo with someone when they ask because I'm nice, however this now takes me up to 5 kills for the same 1% xp.  Most of the time I'm soloing though or will duo with another 55 shamen.  Is there anywhere at this level with better xp per kill?  Or just contiunue grinding away on prisoners?  Loot isn't the issue, I'm looking for best xp per kill.  Decently equiped, JBB and drogmar, no epic.  Roughly 3.5-3.9k hp buffed, with AC 1064 with virtue.  Thanks for your advise and input.</div></div><hr />

That's terrible, you should have left PoJ at level 52.  Go to any of the other tier 1 planes for better experience.  At 57 you can at least solo yard trash in PoN for 1% per kill.  Relatively low risk.  Takes anywhere from 4-6 minutes to kill a mob (bats, ravens, treants, arachnids) with root-rot, then another 3 minutes to canni back to full.  I typically can get a blue bubble in about 50 minutes.<br />
<br />
It's probably better to get into a hobgoblin group or castle group though.  Or get into a courtyard group in PoD.  You might also be able to solo rats and biles in PoD, but don't try anything else (especially not malarians) without a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
You should also think about getting flagged for PoTactics soon, I hear it's really good xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rats &amp; biles &gt; PoN trash.<br />
<br />
never liked PoN trash ( trees ravens spiders )<br />
<br />
I rather go solo PoD doing biles n goo's  and the odd rat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was in a group in PoN we did the hedge....we had a pally for tank and cleric heals. the pulls were not the fastest of pulls had alot of resist on those banshees. but I was there for almost 3 hours and got like 2 blue bubs of reg exp. it really seemed slow exp to me. i can solo and get atleast a yellow bub in 3 hours if not more. i have had noting but bad exp in PoP zones....<br />
<br />
What am I doin wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I alos did the docks and the same slow exp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd much rather solo 2 mobs per 1% in PoJ every 3 minutes than take 6-8 minutes to root dot a mob for 1%.<br />
<br />
it's funner and less tedious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just went to ME lastnight...was alright killing gorangas at zone line to DSP. Was getting about 1% every 3 mobs. Hunters were the hardest to kill....tons of hp's.</div></div><hr />
