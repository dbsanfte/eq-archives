<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i was bored today and didn't know what to do i grabbed a KEI and zapped to inno swamp to chain cast spells and get skill sup. After nukign myself i realized there are beteter things to do so i wondered inno swamp killed the bard and the erudite nad hihg elf npc which made my baby troll days a nightmare. Moved to oasis owned the spectres and a SG then moved to nro cleaned out a derv camp ---&gt; ec slate and the guy who roams and sells shields i hate him so much trip ended in WC with both guards and the rangers at the ring dead and shadowman camp cleared.<br />

Revenge is so much fun. Go around and kill things that killed you when u were level 10 now own them in the face very very entertaining.<br />
Rememeber evil cackling while killing things is a MUST.<br />

Enjoy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know what you mean, in my noobie days whenever some red con used to waltz in out of the blue and give me a wam bam thank you mam, always vowed to take my revenge upon him when I got uborer :D <br />
<br />
Kinda sad though that most of the time I never kept to my word, always kept repeating to myself at higher levels that I'd get the even higher con mobs some day.<br />
<br />
Still remember the Liche in Everfrost though cause I was camping that bear and all of a sudden my uv wears off and &lt;b&gt;conveniently&lt;/b&gt; Miragul comes prancing along and BOOM. Couldn't even run because I was blind as a bat, and what's worse I was bound in like north karana or something :(<br />
<br />
I did get that bish liche back though and with a nasty vengeance; was me - oracle - and a 56 cleric, way overkill but damn it felt good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My baby Sk got jumped by Tizinia in Lavastorm. Between her stuns, mezzes and charms, she was able to beat him down with the help of a couple of Fire Elementals.<br />
<br />
Ok not a problem. Got him rezzed and camped him out. Lo and behold my 61 Monk is in the same zone.<br />
<br />
Beotch your a55 is mine. Smacked her down like Mike Tyson in his prime and then took revenge on the Kobold Noble. (He of the charming me at 57 with 84 MR). Noble went down, sold ugly stick (can't GIVE that thing away).<br />
<br />
