<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and my friends have been talking about the &quot;old&quot; days, partially spurred on by the classic post here. A few of my friends, me included, are trolls that remember Grobb being the hometown, not some corner in Neriak. Was wondering what would happen if we tried to retake the city by force? I have no idea if we would get killed or if we do kill all the frogs, would they just respawn. Just a thought that went through my head, would like to know what the rest of you think and if anyone has ever tried it before (I'm pretty sure someone has before, i just have never heard about it). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They just respawn.  But I and a large force &quot;camped&quot; the city for quite some time until a GM kicked us out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sounds like fun..  if I were to come back, it doing that would be worth it. Too bad you couldn't take the GM by force too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some players took a GM by force ONCE on RZ during a Christmas event. He was not happy and people got suspended for a week,though it was his fault he didn't have his invul item on while trying to be nice to some savages. Was funny story back in the older RZ days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There really is not any dynamic content outside of The Sleeper that I know of.  You can go into Gukta/Grobb and kill for hours without changing squat.<br />
<br />
Grobb was held on Xegony for ~2 hours through endless waves of GM spawns during the initial &quot;invasion&quot;, but it didn't effect anything.  It would have been much more interesting if SOE had a been a little flexible on where the next animal expansion race ended up and allowed players to have some impact on the game setting.  <br />
<br />
Maybe frogs could have set up some kind of refugee camp in the sonyeQ sewers closer to the Barbies hometown if they failed to take Grobb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have fond memories of Grobb.  As a young Ogre Shaman looking around after doing some Alchemy combinds, I found the SK Guild......ouch!</div></div><hr />
