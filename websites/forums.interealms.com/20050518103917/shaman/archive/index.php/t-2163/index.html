<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
  Could anyone please give me the rundown on this guy? Other than the fact that he's in acrylia and drops a spell I'd like I don't know anything about this. Is it a ring war type of encounter? Doable with one good group (from what I've heard)? How is it triggered? <br />
<br />
.... or just point me somewhere on the web :). <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3 waves of 13 or 14 mobs.  ---plus the room mobs (3 or 4 of them) continue to respawn throughout.<br />
<br />
first 2 waves come about every 45 seconds<br />
3rd waves every 30 seconds<br />
<br />
to trigger put someone in the shackles at the end of the platform overlooking the water, off the high priest room.<br />
<br />
try searching this board for Acrylia AND priest - try safehouse too.<br />
<br />
We tried with a single grp - 60 bard, 60 shaman, 60 monk, 59 warrior, 60 ranger, 59 cleric.  Middle of the road weapons and equipment and we lacked the damage to finish the third wave and had to run for it when the final boss and room mobs respawned with the last 4 or 5 of the wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a lot for the info, looks like I'll bring two groups when we try this. My regular exp group is high 50s so we couldn't handle this ourselves. <br />
<br />
I did a search and found some more info in the safehouse. I'll give this a shot in a week or two.</div></div><hr />
