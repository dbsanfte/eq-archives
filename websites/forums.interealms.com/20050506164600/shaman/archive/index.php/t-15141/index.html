<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a realization the other day that may be somewhat obvious to others, but since I didn't realize it until recently, then I figured others may not have realized it either. So I'm sharing.<br />
<br />
Mages will soon be able to summon a new item with burning affliction.<br />
<br />
They have 5 other summoned focus items right now...<br />
- Ring : Spells casting haste<br />
- Bracer : DD damage increaser<br />
- Mantle : Buff extension<br />
- Neck : Reagent usage reducer<br />
- Earring : Mana Preservation on DDs (15%)<br />
<br />
The realization I had was on the earring. It's not just on DD's, but DOTs as well. This is important to me, since I only have MP3. I don't have MP4 or Affliction Efficiency. So 15% MP on PoP DOTs is pretty nice when soloing. And even better once the new summoned item comes out.<br />
<br />
That is all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm... Is it possible to wear the MP earring while casting, then switch to the BA earring to improve the damage once the spell has landed?<br />
<br />
Kind of a pain, I guess, but heck, I don't want to lose BOTH earrings to summoned focus items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, you can.  The burning affliction focus flickers every tic of the DoT, so you can put a mana pres item on, then switch to the BA earring.  Even if you miss a tic, it's not that bad.<br />
<br />

<br />
The summoned BA item is a Bracer, not an Earring. But, if it was an earring that would work. The BA focus check is done tick-by-tick.</div></div><hr />
