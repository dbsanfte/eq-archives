Goes well with the other thread still insisting despite zero evidence that we want to nerf clerics.<br />
<br />
Sure would be nice if they actually didn't only defeat straw horses, but addressed things we really felt.  Instead they're still trying to drown out any discussion with hysteria about cleric nerfs we never asked for and never believed in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Um... ours just got upgraded?<br />
<br />
The same patch where clerics and druids got a healing upgrade, shaman's heal got nerfed. It was a mistake and now it is getting fixed.<br />
<br />
As to the fast heal, thank goodness! Shaman having a better backup heal is good for us.<br />
<br />
Does it mean they can take a few more groups spots from clerics? Maybe. Overal though the benefit far outweighs this. I already know people who duo monk and shaman bot in BoT for AAs. The shaman who can get the new heal didn't need it to replace us in BoT. They do need it to backup heal for us in GoD.<br />
<br />

And the spots where ya absolutely need a cleric aren't going to be changed by a few upgrades to our heals, so they need to calm down (the paranoid ones) cuz thier little niche isn't gonna be stolen from them by us anytime soon. Its nice to see a few upgrades going in, now if the new spells are easily accessible I'll be really happy.</div></div><hr />

How does one angry bitter person ranting on the cleric rant forums about how shaman whine got looked into while cleric whine hasn't been = all clerics hate shaman?  <br />
You have way poor reading comprehension and are just trying to stir crap up between the two classes.<br />

**As far as I can tell, all the clerics that utilize GoD content regard shaman healing upgrades as a positive change. **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Read the thread, aside from that asinine whiner with the grumpy orange avatar who seems to have it in for any other class that can heal for more than 200 hp at a time, most of the clerics seemed to be reasonably happy, or at least understand the reasons for the healing upgrades.  It's nice to know the devs have finally decided on a standard ratio between the heals of the different priest classes instead of just pulling numbers out of thin air and assuming half measures will stand up to in game testing. <br />

&quot;Nice Lodi shield there Velisaris. Maybe when you've advanced beyond Bastion of Thunder you'll posess a clue about shaman healing and slow mitigation. Until then, keep your insight about elemental/GoD content to yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait! Let me explain this in terms you can understand...<br />
<br />
Would you trust a shaman to heal on Gaukr Sandstorm? No? Well the place these heals come from, TRASH mobs deal TWICE his DPS.<br />
<br />
The shaman direct heal received the same scaling Cleric heals received. Yet our ability to prevent damage takes a direct hit by slow mitigation. We're not asking to be able to do anything even remotely close to main heal in GoD. We're asking for our spot heals to not be pissing in the ocean.<br />
<br />
You realize a monster with 50% slow mitigation (most stuff in PoEarth, almost everything in Tipt) deals two and a half times as much damage as it would be doing if it was fully slowed. Imagine zones where your ability to heal was reduced that you had to spend 2 and a half times as much mana doing it compared to the other two priests? Exactly!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He pwned the **** out of that loudmouth.<br />
<br />
Good show, sir :).<br />
<br />
**EDIT: Holy **** Griz, you deserve an award, this stuff is classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
<br />
I have to explain critical heals to you? 600 mana heal crits, it costs more mana <br />
<br />
I wanna see Amris's magelo. I simply can't believe anyone capable of doing GoD content would actually post something so inaccurate as that.<br />

Clerics should all have about 1,000,000pp by now.  They steal worse than anyone ever.  Those jackasses will run off with 5k worth of loot to justify the dots they used to cast HOV.  They complain about the cost of dots, but have they checked the spell prices for Shaman spells lately?  I would gladly pay 5pp to cast Fo7 if I didn't have to spend 150k to get my 65 spells.  <br />
<br />
Also, those jackwads can sell Virtue for 40pp a pop in POK, not that it is a lot of money, but it can keep them in dots forever.  How many times back in BOT or even LDOn's have you had clerics ML and then do the mystery LD right before time to sell.  I HATE THEM.  Also, they somehow assume they are ML when they join a group.  I have been ML and without asking the Cleric will just start looting.  I HATE THEM.  Stupid people.  I'll keep tihs stuff to pay for dots.  ***, you spent like 20pp on dots and you kept 2k.  How about I say I'll keep the loot to pay for the 40k Q I bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ninja linkdeaders are pretty common in every class.  Unfortunately, shamans have the least chance of getting a fair shot at loot when it's &quot;just loot if you feel like it&quot; or similar set-ups, because a good shaman is often cannibalizing right after the mob dies and just too busy to loot.  At least not at lightning speed.  Hard to loot anything when you have three melees and whoever else all racing over to loot the mob before the corpse has even collapsed onto the floor, and you're doing canni.<br />
<br />
Clerics just keeping all the loot is a fairly common occurrence, though, since they're the most commonly chosen looter, and a lot of them seem to be bums about sharing it equally.  I'd have to say I've seen a ton of warriors do the same by looting every single corpse and then taking off, though.<br />
<br />
Probably monks and shamans have the worst of it though.  Monks are usually out pulling another mob when the first mob dies, and lots of them don't want to carry anything and lose AC as they get over their weight limits.  Shamans, well, if they're not canni'ing, probably your group pulls too slow.</div></div><hr />

The thread has devolved into a personal battlefront for a couple of people on each side.  It's become a pointless discussion, with both sides firmly entrenched in their positions.  Neither side will convince the other.  Look away, there's really nothing there to see.  Your time will be more profitably spent elsewhere.  I'm sorry I wasted mine.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think page 10 is wildly optimistic, I think its more like page 4.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">One thing what that particular topic showed, is that many, if not most clerics, haven't got a damn clue about shamans. Zero, zilch. They live in some dreamworld, where shaman clicky slow items drop like rain, none of the shaman spells is resisted, slow always lands (and slows 99% at that) and our pet deals out 1000 DPS. And that we can solo whole Time, to boot.<br />
<br />
Would someone pinch those clerics, so that they would finally wake up?<br />
<br />
Didn't even bother to post there, too much crap there. Clerics miss the little sad facts of life, where, apparently, clicky-Slow items are out of reach for 98% of EQ shaman community (while cleric clicky is available to 98% of EQ cleric community). They miss the fact that our pet is a joke, and sending the pet 1-on-1 with anything above Velious content means dead pet within seconds, while the target is barely scratched. Oh, they also miss the little fact that starting from Luclin, our main damage line - poison and disease - is almost useless, as in most places, most mobs from that expansion on, are either super resistant, to totally immune to these 2 damage types. Oh, sure, we have our &quot;half-day-long-casting&quot; cold based nuke, during which clerics get off 2 of their nukes, each doing significally more damage. They miss the little fact that shaman is a PRIEST class, who is being outhealed by every hybrid class out there. Shamans were first to get SoW spell, Regen spells, and in the end, are last here, as our SoW is slowest, our regen line is limited to spells only, while 'that other' class - and one hybrid to boot - got better spells AND AA's for regen. Oh, and yeah, they obviously miss a simple fact that our mana regen isn't the best in game for a long time already, not to mention what while everyone else in the game can regen mana AND do anything else, we cannot do ANYTHING while regenning mana with our Canni spells. Sure, when there is a break, we can get mana back fast, however there is more action then breaks and during that time, with the limitations on our mana regen, we lose the utility while they don't, so in the end, our mana regen is not better.<br />
<br />
Speaking of utility, they totally miss the fact that we have none. Our only &quot;utility&quot; as such is slowing, and with the slow mitigation and immunity the damn SOE added to the game, we don't have even that. We're outbuffed by others, most of our buffs are useless (i.e. stats), we have no features to offer to the group, we can't do fast mean damage, pets suck, AA's suck, i.e. we get now the AA's, what could have been given to us years ago, which were given to others years ago, not to mention that most of the latest AA's added are a waste and actual downgrade, even, when compared to our old abilities. But yeah, the clerics still whine, nevermind that there will always be need for clerics, while there already is no such need for shamans as it may have been in the past, because other classes can do what shamans do, and in many cases, can do it better, or almost just like the shaman, just that they also add utility to the group with numerous other spells and skills and abilities. Shaman as such has been a forgotten class since Kunark came out, and I douobt that SOE now suddenly will notice us, and yet clerics say that we're whining. Stupid whiner clerics.</div></div><hr />
