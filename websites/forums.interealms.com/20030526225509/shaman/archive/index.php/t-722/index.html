<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to find the vendor sold sight spells (Flash of Light, Spirit Sight etc.) in Shar Vahl but haven't had any luck yet. Anyone knows where they are sold? ...or at least some place closer than Oasis to buy them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had to send my druid to Oasis and bring vision spells to the moon when my cat was a newbie in December-January of this year.  Have not hear that they added vision spells to the Moon.  Then again, I think Oasis is the ONLY place to get these spells on all of Norath, just like all pet spells in West Karana.  I get the impression that Verant wants to keep it this way.<br />
<br />
I have heard that they have recently added a poison spell vendor in Shar Val so that young cats do not have to make the deadly trip through paludal caverns to get their lv. 5 and 14 poison spells.  Haven't seen anyone confirm where this new vendor is.  New poison vendor certainly not in the Shaman guild in Shar Val, I was there last week checking.<br />

I just started a little cat shaman on Sullon, so am not looking forward to bringing her already into the middle of team evil to buy it... but seems I have to... heh... Only one char allowed there so can't send any other...<br />
<br />
About the poison vendor... there is one on second floor of the alchemist shop next to bank.</div></div><hr />
