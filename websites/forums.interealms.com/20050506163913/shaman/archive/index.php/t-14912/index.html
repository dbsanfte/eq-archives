Pretty definitive, you can check if you want but personally I wouldn't bother :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When Ur on auto atack U dont got the med bonus and I have done test to do be sure bcuz many say the reverse.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have casted some spell a nd at 80% I have stoped to move and be on auto attack. it took me forever to regen mana. when I was FM I recast a couple of spell and at 80% I havent hit au to attack and I hit back the FM a lot faster.<br />
<br />
Try it buy urself and U ll see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no med bonus at all when melleing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, I noticed the same when mounted.<br />
When in combat I was not regaining mana, but when setting back and letting my Dug (Ogre speech) tank I saw my mana bar go up.<br />
<br />
I use the Lizard mount.  I was told that they add about 1 tic extra of mana in addidtion to normal medding as if siting (more with more expensive mounts).  Someone confirm if this is the case.<br />
<br />
All in all, the mount was the best investment I could have spent my money on.  A significant increase is noted in keeping mana.  Plus, you don't have to worry about sit agro.  Swapping spells is easy and quick.  Also, note, you can quickly cast your spells without having to hit the stand button all the time.<br />
<br />
Makes keeping the tanks alive easier on the Shamy.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the lizard mount, get one.<br />
