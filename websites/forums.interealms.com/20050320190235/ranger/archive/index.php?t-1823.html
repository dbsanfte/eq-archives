<br />
 Apparently Michael Williams, a candidate for a Congressional seat, has some interesting ideas of his own: imposing a 1% sci-fi tax on all space/sci-fi related items to fund NASA projects. <br />
<br />
What do guys think about this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a nice idea for another tax system but our current system needs revamped first.</div></div><hr />

He also favors providing money for medical research to perform &quot;pre-birth&quot; adoptions, which &quot;will allow for the safe removal of unborn children from their mothers that does not harm the mothers or the unborn children.&quot; <br />
<br />
I would be willing to pay more taxes to fund NASA, but I don't like the idea of taxing sci-fi and space toys separately. I'm too much of an economist:<br />
<br />
higher taxes=higher price=lower quantity demanded in the market=less incentive for new sci-fi products/TV shows/movies=bad for fans</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, it seems to me NASA could fund themselves if they were a little better about marketing the things that they create, such as plastic and velcro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately NASA can't market anything unless they get shifted off as a company in much the same method the Postal Service did.<br />
<br />
If NASA takes money from the Federal Government they are not allowed to act as a business.<br />
<br />
Also many of the inventions used by NASA and attributed to NASA were in fact created by NASA contractors not NASA themselves.<br />
<br />
Trust me this kind of stuff buzzes around the schools and offices here all the time.  One of the advantages of living less than a mile away from Johnson Spaceflight Center and Ellington field.<br />
<br />
Rocket Scientists are a dime a dozen here :D as is any other type of NASA tech type.</div></div><hr />

NASA already IS a private industry. Always has been. It is FUNDED by taxes due to its government contracts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now LOTS of work done for NASA is done by private companies but they are seperate and are responsible for their own financial stability of which government contracts are a method of making money however in most cases those companies usually have seperate contracts with other buyers (often the military and other tech related companies).</div></div><hr />

Congress further declares that such activities shall be the responsibility of, and shall be <br />

I have friends and relatives who do now or have worked for NASA. They are government employees.</div></div><hr />

Postal Worker = Federal Employee = Civilian = non-military<br />

NASA worker = Federal Employee = Civilian = non-military<br />

GI JOE = Federal Employee = non-civilian = military<br />

<br />
There could be an additional box on your IRS form 1040:<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish $1 of your tax to be contributed to NASA funding?&quot;<br />
<br />
I always enjoy checking the &quot;NO&quot; box when they ask that about contributing to the political campaign fund.  For NASA funding though, I'd even be willing to have them charge me an extra buck on my tax, or withold an additional dollar from my refund.</div></div><hr />
