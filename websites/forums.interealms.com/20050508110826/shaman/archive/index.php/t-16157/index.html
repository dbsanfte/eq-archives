<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;Cockblocking&quot;.<br />
A term im sure most of you are familiar with.<br />
2 ogres doing it at the Bazaar zone in from nexus so I petitioned it.<br />
As i zoned into PoK after gating I recieved a tell from a Guide.<br />
&quot;Well thats certainly 1 way to get a petition answered quickly by including foul and abusive language in it&quot;<br />
I apologised to the guide saying it was not meant to be offensive i just used the common name for what the ogres were doing.She lectured me a bit further and told me not to use that language again when petitioning.<br />
Anyway just wondered if anyone else found it a foul and abusive term if so what should i call it if it happens again.<br />
What really made me smile though was the fact that because id called it cockblocking the guide answered my petition in a matter of maybe 1 min.<br />
Whereas normally we know that we can most times wait hours for a petition to be answered even if it is something more serious than 2 ogres blocking Bazaar zone.<br />

<br />
Aye.. I think you have your terms mixed up. Cockblocking is when someone keeps killing a mob you need to advance. Therefore they are blocking you from advancing in the game. <br />
<br />
 Someone blocking you from running down a tunnel is just standing in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suppose it could also just be called &quot;griefing&quot;.  Some people enjoy making the game un-fun for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Axirux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye.. I think you have your terms mixed up. Cockblocking is when someone keeps killing a mob you need to advance. Therefore they are blocking you from advancing in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm, not really.  I think he has used it correctly.<br />
<br />
The original use for &quot;cockblocking&quot; was to intentionally or unintentionally keep an individual from hooking up/scoring/etc. <br />
<br />
It was used at bars and party scenes - You see a girl at a bar you want to hook up with. Now your friend doesn't have a chance with the girl, but he's locked onto her also and blocks your attempts at making contact. It could be as simple as acting really wierd, so she thinks you are weird also, or pointing out your faults (&quot;Too bad Sam just got out of an abusive 3 year relationship&quot;).<br />
<br />
So yes, I can see how the guide would find it offensive, since the basic meaning, irregardless of how it is used in EQ,  is to keep a guy from getting laid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">next time, JUMP over them...i think any race no matter size can successfully jump over a couple ogres</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, he's using the term incorrectly and in the wrong context.<br />
<br />
In EQ, it's used to refer to a guild blocking your progress by killing a mob that you need to advance further.<br />
<br />
In your explanation, the &quot;keeping the guy from getting laid&quot; is the guild keeping you from killing a mob that is needed to advance.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with physical blocking of an area/zone line/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He is using it correctly, and he got his petition answered in record time.  From now on I will end each of my petitions with the word cockblocking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I heard the origin of the phrase same way as Axirux.<br />
<br />
In EQ it's usually used when a guild attempts to block the progress of another guild by perma killing a mob they have to kill (quite often that mob is Emperor Ssraeshza). In elementals, I hear some guilds do this with Coirnav to prevent competition in Time, though this is not as easy to do now with the respawn change. If Verant had not put such an odd respawn timer on Rallos Zek, I'm sure some guilds would do it with him as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Interesting phrase. Mobblocking might have been a more intuitive phrase, had the game not been played by adolescents who had other things on their mind at the time, and most likely in their hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A guild that keeps killing a flag/key mob in order to keep your guild form advancing (RZTW, Emperor Ssra) is engaging in cockblocking (EQ version).<br />
<br />
Anything that prevents you from getting laid when you probably would have (obnoxious roommate, girl has a fat &amp; ugly friend, etc...) is also cockblocking (RL version).<br />
<br />
2 ogres blocking the entrance to bazaar is just funny :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Umm, yeah, using the term cockblocking in a petition is just asking to get a warning on your account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, I think thats a pretty silly gm. <br />
<br />
Be thankful some Ogre didn't come up and slam your Cockatrice, Overthere. You might have been banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seems like the correct term to me, after all the goal is to deny penetration :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I thought the term for what the ogres were doing was called &quot;zone-plugging&quot;.  I've heard it before somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Think I'll just start putting varried words used to describe cock at the end of all my /petitions and hope for that type of record customer service times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, that is wrong as well, zone plugging is mainly from PVP, when you are being chased by people who are trying to PK you, if you zone and drop your internet mid zone so you go LD you are zone plugging.  Its called plugging because you pull the plug for your internet out of the back of your computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am just happy I know how to get a petition answered quickly now :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHAHA! you and me both :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well &quot;regardless&quot; of how the term is used in EQ (Frankly I'm suprised a guide or 1/2 the people who play EQ have EVER gotten laid), we do all thank you for the down n dirty guide on how to get our petitions answered quicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Highly unlikely that your wording in your petition had anything to do with its response time.  As far as its been explained to me when I asked the last time, when you petition your name is added to a list, and the GM/Guide simply takes the closest one to the top. <br />
<br />
It was prolly just a coincidence. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

You mean there was a chance that the petition queue was almost empty or very close to it? That type of thing only happens in fiction!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">heh i usually get a response to my petitions in like.. less than 20 minutes if a guide is online at the time. If not it is never more than a few it seems.  Guess it depends on your server and their staffing levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">GMs dont exist on ab... or so it seems. General wait time for a GM seems to be 5-10 hours at normal times. 3 hrs on a good day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Burzlaff you and your guild are dicks if you kept that up for any length of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Haagen, I'm inclined to agree. I read his guild's website, apparently they were blocking the ring of stones in PoT and someone petitioned - a GM showed up and AE shrunk them all to tiny midgets.</div></div><hr />
