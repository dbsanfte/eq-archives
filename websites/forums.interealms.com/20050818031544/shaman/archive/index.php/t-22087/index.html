<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just do a search for everquest and find an enchanter site..there are a couple out there..I don't have the web addresses though..sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sonechka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out The Runes.net (http://www.therunes.net/). It's the enchanter site i use most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, the Runes is your one stop shop if you want a good chanter site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've currently got a level 39 enchanter. They can be fun; there's a rush about stopping mobs dead in their tracks!<br />
<br />
I just want to make sure you're aware of one of the class's pitfalls. They die...a LOT. Even moreso when trying to figure out how to try and charm mobs. A little piece of advice I'd give would be to make sure you get your Defense skill up at early levels. The free AC it provides can and does help you later. Admittedly, having high level mobs pounding on you will still kill you, but with a higher defense skill you might survive long enough to get things under control. As such, The Runes also seems to recommend a lot of HP. <br />
<br />
One thing I did when I tried learning to charm is to have a friend's cleric nearby. Not really to powerlevel me but just as a precaution in case I got in over my head. There's nothing like trying to learn in the heat of battle. :) Another tip: if charm soloing, try to root the mob your charmed pet is fighting. That way, if charm breaks, you might have one mob coming after you, not two.<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your enchanter. I have fun with mine, but it takes a back seat to a couple of other classes I play, namely shaman and magician.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Int is your main stat, but you also want to get your hp and cha up as well.  HP for obvious reason, but cha because Cha affects the duration of charm, as well as deciding whether a mob will aggro if you fail to pacify.  Don't worry about charisma til you get around level 60, but always worry about int and HP.  Int is very important, because enchanters have a thin mana pool, probably the thinnest of all the int casters, and NO efficient ability to recover mana outside their rather well known mana buffs (C1/C2/C3, etc).  They have only one other way to regain mana, and those are self-only mana tap spells against enemy casters, which have ridiculously long delays and don't return much mana to you.  Since a chanter going OOM can kill a group quickly, work on getting as deep a mana pool as you can, and also try to get items that recover that mana quickly.<br />
<br />
If you play a chanter, be prepared to die.  Continuously.  Over and over.  Get used to it.  Learn to find it funny, because if you don't like to die, then playing an enchanter is not for you.  Everything an enchanter does draws aggro, just like shamans.  But unlike shamans, enchanters wear silk and have much less hp.  Enchanters have the steeliest nerves in this game, because it takes a great deal of guts to draw aggro on a mob that can kill you in 2 seconds and face it down while trying to mez it.<br />
<br />
Slowing...well, you're already a shaman.  It works the same, just remember that Tash puts on a poison counter and jacks some major aggro.  Learn how to work with this.<br />
<br />
Crowd control is a skill, just like root splitting.  The easiest way to learn how to mez efficiently is go to a place where your group will be killing lots of mobs that add...the bandit camps in Paludal are perfect for this.  A few hours in Paludal mezzing bandit adds, and you just laid the groundwork for your CC skills.  Just don't forget that you CAN root.  A wise enchanter knows when to mez and when to root, because root generally lasts longer than mez.<br />
<br />
Learn how to charm.  A charming enchanter can dish out more dps than any other class in the game in certain zones.  Charming is a skill not in capturing the mob, but in quickly reacting to a charm break and getting your pet back under control.  A loose chanter pet is usually hasted and armed, and can do some major damage...which is the point.  ;)  Basicly when it comes to charming in groups, just keep your PET targeted any time you're not casting on another mob, and stay away from it.  When charm breaks, you have it targeted for an immediate mez or recharm, and you have distance to allow you to cast before it reaches you and kills you.<br />
<br />
On the other tack, learn how to charm solo.  This actually isn't that hard...just keep the mob you're killing rooted at all times, stay at the edge of casting range, and keep your pet targeted when you're not actively rooting the mob you're killing.<br />
<br />
All of these actions share one thing you need to learn to be a good enchanter:<br />
<br />
NEVER PANIC.<br />
<br />
The core skill of an enchanter is all about quick and controlled reaction under pressure.  Fast reflexes and the ability to quickly sort out the greatest threat to address is the skill an enchanter must possess to be truly good.  This seperates the future buff-bot enchanters from the good enchanters.  Enchanters can sometimes seem arrogant or egocentric, and some of them are, to be sure, but that's because playing an enchanter requires a certain amount of self-confidence that can sometimes come across as conceit.<br />
<br />
Playing a shaman can help here, believe me.  What I learned from my shaman main I applied to my enchanter.  The two classes have a great deal of crossover.<br />

Welcome to the ranks of the slower-addicts, those of us who play multiple slowing classes because we're addicted to slow.  I'm one of them, as my sig clearly demonstrates.  ;)</div></div><hr />
