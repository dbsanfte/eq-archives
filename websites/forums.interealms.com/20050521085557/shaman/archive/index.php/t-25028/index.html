<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this guy, Kraylor Nalsiv, outside PoK Library today...<br />
<br />
[Mon Nov 22 17:32:33 2004] You say, 'Hail, Kraylor Nalsiv'<br />
[Mon Nov 22 17:32:33 2004] Kraylor Nalsiv says 'Greetings Samanna!  I've heard tell of powerful items unique to your profession.  If you happen to come across one I would be in your debt if you would let me hold it for but a moment.'<br />
(handed him my Spear of Fate)<br />
[Mon Nov 22 17:32:37 2004] Kraylor Nalsiv says 'I have no need for this item Samanna, you can have it back.'<br />
(Spear of Fate returned to cursor; handed my Crafted Talisman of Fates)<br />
[Mon Nov 22 17:32:45 2004] Kraylor Nalsiv says 'I have heard tales of items such as this, but never thought to see one.  My thanks for showing this to me.  I have heard tell of more powerful items than this though, perhaps you might seek them out for me.<br />
(Crafted Talisman of Fates returned to cursor)<br />
<br />
Then I went to the bank and banked both Epics, and hit the Title interface; both Heyokah and Fateseer were available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've been able to do the titles with the items banked since the titles where added. Personally I've been running around with heyokah as my title with my epic 1.0 in the bank  since i completed the epic a month or 2 ago. Bank is still part of your inventory which is why that works and why you can't loot a lore item when you have one in the bank.<br />
<br />
The problem with titles is not the bank it's your corpse. For what ever reason your corpse isn't considered part of your inventory which is why you can loot a lore item with one on your corpse. Which is also why you loose the titles when you die i'd imagine since you no longer have the item in inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh. Okay. Next time I die, I'll see if they work. I know it was posted that this fix was coming, but I didn't see that it had been implemented yet. I thought that maybe I had finally contributed something original. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sam do you really buff out to over 7k HPs (looking in your sig).  I've got a few more unbuffed hps but I've never seen more than 6600 or so on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you including tribute and LAA, Snap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep!<br />
<br />
Of course, that was with BBB, Conv, and my leadership points. And max Sta. And maybe raid leader points, but no tribute. <br />
<br />
Full screenshot from that raid (Ssra) now at http://samanna.net/1pix/hp_fullss.jpg<br />
<br />
Edit - didn't have Wunshi on at that time, actually - check group chat, green text window.<br />
<br />
Buffs (as best I remember them), BBB, Conviction, F.Seventh, GPE, Lev, T.Boar, SoW, Clairvoyance, Bramblecoat or similar, T.Alacrity, T.Sense, and the Cleric spell haste thingy - BoR maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went to that npc in pok and turned in my Talisman to him, got the text.  When I died later that day I had to reset my Fateseer title again =(, hopefully they will fix this in the patch coming up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tryed it today and gave my epic to Kraylor Nalsiv. Got the same white text as Samanna thought nothing went on. Was killed later on raid .... title gone. Clicked off buffs after it .....less hp. Checked epic ALL augs from it ...GONE.   DO NOT hand in your auged epic to the npc all he does is eat up augs doing nothing. I only hope i get em reimbursed. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AACK!! You're right - my 55 hp aug is gone! <br />
<br />
Bugged and Peitioned.<br />
<br />
That'll teach me to try new things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Currently on test (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=4796) &quot;- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC.&quot; Probably go live next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Currently on test (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testing&amp;message.id=4796) &quot;- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC.&quot; Probably go live next patch.<br />
<br />
So -- <br />
<br />
(1) The point of this NPC is to give you a permanent flag so that when you die you don't lose your title Heyokah or Fateseer.<br />
<br />
(2) In order to do this you must hand in your epic 1.0 or 1.5.<br />
<br />
(3) You will now get a popup dialog box reminding you that the NPC will give you back your epic, but will eat the augment(s).<br />
<br />
(4) You leave PoK and go to Butcherblock, unaugmenting your epic, paying perhaps several thousand plat for the solvents.<br />
<br />
(5) You return to PoK and hand in your epic and get this flag, thus saving you the inconvenience of having to reset your title after you die.<br />
<br />
(6) You return to a LDoN camp and re-augment your epic.<br />
<br />
This seems to me like a very inconvenient way of avoiding inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Would it not have been simpler to do this?<br />
<br />
(1) I tap T to get list of possible titles<br />
<br />
(2) The game checks items and flags that qualify for titles:  it looks at my tradeskills, my level, whether or not I have my epic, and so on.  It puts Heyokah and Fateseer on the list:  and the first time I do that, with epic in inventory, it flags me for that epic -- just the way this turn in NPC is supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Umm.  That's all.  Nothing further is necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't appear to do so as i still loose my titles if i die. I had my augs replaced luckily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Doesn't appear to do so as i still loose my titles if i die. I had my augs replaced luckily.Hmmm, OK.  So if this is the NPC designed to flag you for having epic 1.5, it doesn't yet operate correctly.  <br />
<br />
According to Sam's report, the NPC is coded to receive an epic 1.5 (it took it rather than saying &quot;I have no need for this item&quot; and gave specific text in response, hinting along the lines of &quot;Go get your epic 2.0&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Glad you got your augments back.  Glad you got yours back also, Sam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks, Macnair. I was worried there for a while! My only customer support issue to date was handled in a very timely manner, completely to my satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Hey, Snap, I updated http://samanna.net/general/info.shtml with a comparison of the newer and older HP buffs, take a look. If I have it right, one can get +3001 HP in buffs (+599 more than with pre-Gates buffs), as well as +200 for group and raid leader abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello all,<br />
 <br />
A while back an NPC was added to the Plane of Knowledge.  This NPC Kraylor Nalsiv, expresses an interest in rare items and artifacts. Show him your epic and he will give you a flag that the PC Title system will look at when determining which titles you are allowed to have.<br />
<br />
This will prevent the problem the caused your title to disappear when you die, or have your Epic in the bank etc... <br />
 <br />
<br />
Unfortunately there is a downside to the system currently, you will need to remove all augments from your epics <br />
before you hand them over.<br />
There are plans to change the functionality of that NPC in the near future, but currently we do not have an ETA on when this will be completed.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately there is a downside to the system currently, you will need to remove all augments from your epics before you hand them over.This is so silly.<br />
<br />
Right now when you hit 'T' to get your list of possible titles, the game checks for your epic.  If you have it, it allows you the title.  Why not just have the game give you this title flag right then?  After that when you die and have no inventory, you would still have the flag, so your title stays in place.<br />
<br />
Why all this nonsense about adding an npc to give you a flag, broken at first, then eating augments, then having to run to butcherblock and purchase 2000 plat worth of solvents to deaugment your epic, then back to PoK, then hand in again, then back to an adventurer camp to reaugment epic?<br />
<br />
Is this supposed to be an addition to game play?  Is it more fun?<br />
<br />
To me it just seems like a very awkward way of fixing a problem that could instead be fixed so simply.</div></div><hr />
