<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">my guild is getting ready to do this event and i am trying to find some info on it. the mob isnt listed in the nonpaying portion of alla's and all i get from the discussions there is he has a big disease AE. I searched here and came up with nothing. if anyone who has does this could post some info it would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">by all reports, this was a one time GM event.<br />
or at least everything I have ever read about it indicated that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm with Henora on this one, it was either legends content that accidently got put on the regular servers, or just a 1 off event.  Shame as it looked quite interesting, enough to make it actually worth zoning into the hole that is Sonh =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">is this the ring cycly that spawns Vulak?<br />

The consensus there at least seems to be that this is one of the Haloween GM events.</div></div><hr />

As a lower level lizard I hunted regularly in SoNH....never anyone else there, decent loot (cash, gems, some words), very good exp til about 32.  <br />
<br />
More than once, when I was sitting near the water, I would get a message in white.  I don't recall it exactly, but it was something about a giant reptile rearing out of the water, looking at me, then sinking out of sight.  <br />
<br />
First time I saw it, I near had a stroke and jumped up looking for said reptile  )<br />
<br />
Does it indicate a triggered event or spawn?</div></div><hr />
