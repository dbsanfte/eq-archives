I believe if you were to project this discussion forward 5 years and 65 levels later, then it is possibly identifying where EQ is now.<br />
<br />
This got me to thinking about the solution to Class Balance and indeed whether there is a solution.  <br />
<br />
With most problem solving i try and do, I simplify first.  So the first thing i did was remove the concept of Class.  Sounds weird right, solve class balance by removing class  :rolleyes: , but dont give up on me yet.<br />
<br />
By removing class you basically have a load of races and huge bucket of skills and abilities.  If we divided these skills and abilities into categories, lets say you end up with 30.  (these could be things like melee-sword, melee-club, melee-spear, melee-bow, melee-throw, casting-heal, casting-DOT, casting-DD, pet-create, pet-charm, summon-stuff, casting-stats, casting-buffs, casting-regen, casting-debuff, stealth-attack, stealth-defence, special attack, special defence, utility-offensive, utility-defensive, utility-other etc etc)<br />
<br />
Now that we dont have Classes, but abilities I suggest we replace the idea of Class Balancing with the idea of Ability Balancing.  Ability Balancing would basically be a set of rules that would not allow certain abilities to be selected with other abilities, or for certain races.  This would be wordy to outline here, but it would basically protect from having an ubah casting DD, casting DOT, melee-sword, melee-club, casting-heal god like creature.  You get the idea.<br />
<br />
Throughout the life of a character there are opportunities to select abilities, restricted by the race you are, by your current selections and by your previous selections.  You effectively have the ability to customise your toon.<br />
<br />
There would be a category which was universal, which included a set of base skills that everyone had, such as a basic melee form (bitch slap), a basic heal form (bandaid).<br />
<br />
You could limit the selection so that you could select to train from say 5 of the 30 categories, and specialize in 2.<br />
<br />
So, if i was of say a shaman persuasion I could select...<br />
<br />
Melee-Spear (effectively piercing, but would include 1hp,2hp)<br />
Casting-Debuffs (effectively malos, slow, cripple etc) - specialize<br />
Casting-Buffs (effectively haste, frenzies etc)<br />
Casting-Heal (obvious)<br />
Casting-DOT (obvious)<br />
<br />
as well as having my basic category.<br />
<br />
A warrior type might go with...<br />
<br />
Melee-sword (1hs, 2hs) - specialise<br />
Melee-club (1hb, 2hb)<br />
special attack (berserk, frenzy type stuff)<br />
special defence (riposte, dodge etc)<br />
Utility Offensive (taunt, aggro type stuff) - specialise<br />
<br />
As i go up in level I am offered more skills within each ability which i would train in, with special skills available if I have specialised in that ability.  In the same way there is currently a quest to change your casting specialization, there could be a means working towards changing your ability selection and specialization.  This would allow for your character to adapt over time, or even change completely if you just got bored.<br />
<br />
Titles would be awarded based on level and race rather than level and Class, however for ability specializations acheivements you could receive awards of some sort.<br />
<br />
AA's would be based on your ability category selections.<br />
<br />
Equipment would be based on ability selection and race.<br />
<br />
I know i will most likely get flamed for suggesting this, and obviously it would need a lot more thought, but i really think that conceptually this solves the issue of class balance.  It may also go along way to solving PvP balance.<br />
<br />
Have rambled for long enough, post wasnt gonna be this long  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do not see how that would differ from class balancing, except in name. <br />
<br />
Thats a good point.  I think the significant difference is the flexibility.   With class balancing you have to equate (or balance) a predetermined subset of abilities with all the other predetermined subsets of abilities, and I dont believe it is possible, simply because different people place different values on differnent attributes of their class.<br />
<br />
By allowing people to select the abilities that they most value you effectively remove the need (edited... statement didnt say what i intended it too) to provide balance.  Currently if i want to be a mage, but feel that the subset of mage abilities as defined in EQ leave me lacking for an ability to solo without say, a snare/root ability I have no flexibility (equipment effects aside).  If i had the ability change out other skills for some utility that allowed for snare/root then i feel more balanced.<br />
<br />
I guess another way of looking at it is by saying class balance should not be the enphasis as it is too prescriptive, the emphasis should be on whether the character I play satisfies the way i want to play.<br />
<br />

<br />
Interesting article.  I am at a loss as to whether you are suggesting I am smart for believing a weird idea, or deluded for overlooking the facts prior to believing it.<br />
<br />
Read my post again.  I havent posted any facts, simply offered a conceptual idea up for discussion.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you were suggesting that you were infact the smart one and wanted suppporting facts before you accepted my idea.<br />
<br />
Enlighten me, mysterious wise one  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with class balancing, is too many people have an idea of what this word &quot;balance&quot; means.    And, as one of the SoE guys said... most classes look at only themself... or maybe their closest competitor, and not a bigger picture.   I am not saying NO ONE sees beyond their class... as this isn't true... but many people just look at themself and want more.<br />
<br />
Most people equate balance to desire.   You desire your class to do more dps... to heal better... to do something else...<br />
<br />
My vision of Balance... is two fold.<br />
<br />
First... for every ability... for example... healing, slowing, &quot;dps&quot;... there are alternatives.    If you can't find the &quot;best&quot; healer... you have backups that are &quot;almost&quot; as good.     If you can't find the best dps class... there are backups that are &quot;almost&quot; as good.     They might shine in other areas... a buff... or something.  <br />
<br />
Second... every class would have desirability... in &quot;raid&quot; and &quot;group&quot; situations.    No class should feel like they can't get a group... and no class should feel like dead weight on a raid.<br />
<br />
I don't think EQ is balanced... but I also think a lot of people throw this balance word around when what they really want are &quot;upgrade&quot; no matter what it &quot;balances&quot;<br />
<br />
Balance is possible... you gotta have a firm vision of what you want your game to be like... willing to accept mistakes and suggestions... and change things where needed... and to talk to your player base with a grain of salt... they do play the game, and might just have a clue sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First... for every ability... for example... healing, slowing, &quot;dps&quot;... there are alternatives.

If you can't find the best dps class... there are backups that are &quot;almost&quot; as good.     <br />
Which is exactly what we are debating. In Current content there is no class that heals almost as good as a cleric. There is no class that tanks almost as well as a warrior. There is no class that deals almost as much damage as an enchanter.<br />
<br />

Again - this is exactly what we are complaining about. There is no single group content in GoD where shaman are desirable. On raids you want exactly one shaman, for Focus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as class balance regarding WoW, Blizzard has been making and balancing games for a long time now: diablo1, diablo2, starcraft, warcraft3.  They release balance patches constantly, they use feedback, and balance is important to events they run, like tournaments.  I feel like their balance accomplishments in Starcraft Brood War alone make everything else pale in comparison.  If you see how different the races are in concept and playstyle, you are probably very impressed.  Comparing that to say the pseudo class-balance in daoc makes me laugh.<br />
<br />
Also, I am a shameless Blizzard fanboy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the idea of a classless mmpog is a vaild one and precedes EQ, actually.<br />
<br />
UO for example has no classes, merely skills.  it's an old design question, and some developers and GMs are VERY dedicated to the idea of its superiority.  like those old UNIX guys.  at any one time a quarter or third of the MMPOGs you see under development boast a  &quot;classless system.&quot;  the problem with a skill-based system is that it's MUCH easier to min-max a skill system... ie tank-mages running around with the best possible combination of skills with little variety between classes at all.  the tank-mage syndrome isn't AS enormous an issue in pvp games or in korea where the idea of a level playing field takes precedence but for most US players and designers the idea of 3000 identical guys running around isn't fun<br />
<br />
there's also the fact that skill systems are harder to balance than class systems.  there's a serious danger that you can gimp yourself if left to wide open choices.  CoH (city of heroes) for example took great pride in its open system until its first time mmpog designers threw their hands up in the air at the chaos of it all and scrapped it for a traditional class system<br />
<br />
what makes EQ so hard to balance... aside from the snide comments on sony's crappiness is the fact that from the beginning classes were never meant to be balanced versus each OTHER.  there's 2 layers to in EQ.  GROUPS were balanced versus MOBs.  With MUDflation things are a bit different now but when the Vision lived you had no chance to take a higher con or even mob.  in fact the /con function is tuned to what a group can safely take, not what a single player should be able to kill.  the key roles in any fight... healing, doing damage, slowing, snaring, tanking, nuking were all split up among the class members.  it was revolutionary in a genre where healing was largely done on the fly with potions, where everyone was the ultimate hero and it forced people to group and socialize (it's probably the one design decision that has led to EQ's long long life).<br />
<br />
in fact if you COULD reliably solo an even or higher con it was bordering on exploit.  and those mechanisms. (shaman charm, dots, necro pet etc) were nerfed.  sony NEVER said a particular class would be equivalent to another.  in fact the original class penalties attest to the fact that fundamentally they intended for hybrids to NOT be equivalent to other classes.<br />
<br />
most good designers recognize that classes can never be &quot;equal&quot; and so satisfy themselves with the idea of balanced.  most will say they take a rock-paper-sissors approach.  in EQ it seems that designers have pretty much given up on any rational, fair game design principles and have a sort of round-robin whoever complains gets an upgrade approach without a clear understanding of overall balance.  so while I'd strongly argue against the title in this thread... MMPOG can CERTAINLY achieve class balance... it is impossible in EQ:  class balance is NOT achievable in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also, I am a shameless Blizzard fanboy<br />
<br />
<br />
most gamers will point to starcraft as the ideal in pvp balance... 3 sides with VERY different tactical units balanced with each other.  it's close to a perfectly balanced rts<br />
<br />
but balance in pvp is a different thing from balance in a game.  in a game like EQ you have to balance classes versus each other, players versus mobs, and players versus each other... AT ALL STAGES of a players development.  things could be balanced for 49 levels and one uber item or a unbalanced spell can screw up the entire system.<br />
<br />
i dont know if blizzard has a magic bullet for balance in mmpog... it's just plain hard and it's different from what they've been doing.  the one thing they DO have is the fact that they're a really well-run professional company and a company of GAMERS.  balancing pvp games has made them listen to player feedback (the real experts) and very responsible to exploits and cheesy tactics that players discover.  remember before diablo the idea of a company supporting a game after launch with regular patches was inconceivable... impossible.  designers may not be able to guarantee balance on their own but if they listen to players who understand their game they'll do a fine job with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When Ultima Online came out, I played it until I got int EQ beta.  UO had a pseudo balance to it.  Nearly everyone bacame a &quot;tank-mage&quot; with high skill in the weapon flavor of the month and/or a tradeskill junkie.  So, everyone had the chance to be the same as everyone else, but to me, that's not really balance.  Balance in an rpg game would be each class offering something(s) major that no other class can.  From there, those classes group and work together combating a challenge with their variable abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">we have all sorts of smart people here.  they run numbers, do hypotheticals, parse, compare classes and games, research gear and spells; and some actually come up with inventive solutions.<br />
<br />
the wierdness is in 1)  some of them trust Sony to do the right thing given an infinite amount of time; and 2)  that Sony actually cares.<br />
<br />
that is the wierdness.  Sony only cares about the montly jingle; better if they can stick you for a whole year at a time and then provide crappy service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some really interesting comments.  <br />
<br />
Temuchintehkhan, you really seem to understand the idealogy/mechanics of these MMORGs.  Having not been involved with any other MMORG than EQ I was very interested to hear that UO works in a similar manner to my thoughts.<br />
<br />
I assume that the phenomenon of the Tank-mage was the result of ubahsizing into a very obvious &quot;best of all worlds&quot; situation, which in my mind demonstrates perhaps a weakness in the &quot;ability balancing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe that isnt possible either.<br />
<br />
I am intrigued that EQ worked on the idea of group balancing (if i understood teh comment correctly).  In this case for true balancing you should in theory be able to take any 6 different classes of the same lvl and cater for the same content in the same time for the same amount of xp.  I would hazard that in some corners of EQ this is not the case, particularly with the newer content.<br />
<br />
My post was certainly not suggesting a weakness on blizzards part.  WoW is still in beta and from things i have heard, Blizzard are good at responding to that feedback.  It was perhaps more along the lines that I have high expectations of WoW and to hear that someone thought there were imbalancing issues within beta i thought was a tad troubling.  I have been Sony/EQ conditioned though  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I am not sure what ideology WoW is using, but i am looking forward to giving it a go.<br />
<br />
Sony only cares about the montly jingle; better if they can stick you for a whole year at a time and then provide crappy service. <br />
<br />
That is why I dont think EQII will happen for me.</div></div><hr />
