<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got spammed in email about replies to threads I have posted in.<br />
<br />
The only problem is these emails are from posts that are a few weeks old and I had already gotten notifications of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ya man we all got them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yep, i'm not too sure what the problem was.  <br />
<br />
if i had to guess heh, i would guess it was related to sobig.f and the like.  (like the server had a backlog of mail or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had gotten a few emails addressed to someone else, then I didn't get any email updates for a while, then this morning I got 100 all at once! But it seems to be working fine now.<br />
<br />
By the way though, what is the email address to contact an admin about this sort of thing? I used sunmoon@interealms.com from the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link at the bottom here, and it bounced. Was that part of the problem, and is fixed now?</div></div><hr />
