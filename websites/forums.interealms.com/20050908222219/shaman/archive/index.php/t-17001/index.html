<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually run with a ranger and rogue all of us level 24.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me when the lizardmen in Ferrott are doable?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The lizards are doable in groups from level 20 to 40.  The easiest lizards are near the fallen column bridge.  Invis up and set up camp at the fallen log nearby.  Pull the mobs at the bridge (your ranger can harmony to split) and from the edges of the nearby temple.  When these spawns go light blue, move to the next temple over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did this with my beastlord twink.  There are quite a few single pulls, and you shouldnt really run out if you are soloing and not being PL'd.  They hit for around 60 max (the level 29+ lizards, but most hit under 50).  If your AC is 650 or greater you shouldnt have much trouble with them; this was the magic number for my beastlord between mostly hits for low damage and mostly misses.<br />
<br />
I found the exp per mob to be a bit low though, but its hard to find a spot so close to a POK stone that isnt contested.<br />
<br />
the ONE downside is a good majority of the lizards are priest classes.  This makes for some rather long fights.</div></div><hr />
