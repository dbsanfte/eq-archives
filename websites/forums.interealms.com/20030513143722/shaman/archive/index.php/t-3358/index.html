<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a tip (first one, and maybe others) on raising the faction from dubious on Illia's EQ Beastiary page for True Spirit faction (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=181)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What faction is needed to start the quest? IF the first lesser spirit is charmable, and IF you can start the quest with indifferent faction, you can bring along an enchanter buddy to charm the early spirits to let you do the first steps. Most likely you'll have to repeat the early stages several times to make up for your faction losses, but it's worth a shot. If you can just find one step that gives a positive TrueSpirit faction hit that you can do this way, then it's not unrecoverable. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanted to thank you for the input - think im gonna give charm a shot and it should work - heading to Illias right now.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dubious is where you will start on truespirit before starting epic.<br />
<br />
You sure you are saying the phrase correctly ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">True Spirit faction starts at indifferently. A lesser spirit, Bondl Felligan, a greater spirit, a wandering spirit -- they should all con indifferently initially. You first reach amiably at the step where you hand in the gem to the wandering spirit.<br />
<br />
a wandering spirit regards you indifferently<br />
You say, 'Hail, a wandering spirit'<br />
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly...<br />
   (you give him the gem)<br />
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman!...<br />
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better.<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
a wandering spirit judges you amiably</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was dubious when I started...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is it possible for another class to do the quest, say up to the SoW boots by charming the quest mobs?</div></div><hr />

First instances in my log are from level 24, a lesser spirit regards you indifferently.<br />
Started the epic quest at level 51, still indifferently.<br />
<br />
Is it possible for another class to do the quest, say up to the SoW boots by charming the quest mobs?<br />
<br />
Well, the link I posted above explains that yes, you can, but the rewards are usable only by shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you could also kill the two mobs in Rathe for faction.  I don't think you need to spawn them or anything.  Marr and something or other (been a while).<br />
<br />
Check on www.allakhazam.com and look under faction.  There will be a list of things you can do or kill to raise faction there.<br />

<br />
Nope, there are no faction changes for killing Glaron the Wicked (Envy and Woe) or Tabien the Goodly (Marr's Promise).  I think you increase TrueSpirit faction only by turning in quest items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can raise faction from dubious to amiable by repeating the Test of Wisdom (Glaron and Tabien).  After my Wisp Event this is how I repaired my faction (which was knocked down to dubious).</div></div><hr />
