<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Irvine, Calif. - March 17, 2005 - Blizzard Entertainment® today announced that World of Warcraft®, its massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), has surpassed the 1.5 million subscriber mark*, underscoring the game's continued success around the world. Building on its record-breaking debuts in North America, Korea, and Europe, World of Warcraft has reached global peak concurrency - the number of subscribers playing at the same time in each market - of more than 500,000 players.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of us at Blizzard are extremely gratified and amazed at the international demand for World of Warcraft,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;From region to region, we've seen a phenomenal level of enthusiasm for World of Warcraft, and we're absolutely thrilled people are enjoying the game so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since its debut in North America on November 23, 2004, World of Warcraft has launched to critical and commercial success in Korea and Europe, exploding in popularity across the globe. In the span of a few short months, World of Warcraft has achieved record-breaking milestones, including:<br />
<br />
    * Europe:<br />
<br />
          o Over 290,000 account creations and 180,000 peak concurrency in its first weekend.<br />
<br />
          o Over 500,000 active subscribers, and 230,000 peak concurrency to date. <br />
<br />
    * Korea:<br />
<br />
          o The most successful 100-day launch of any MMORPG in Korean history since its commercial release on January 18, 2005.<br />
<br />
          o World of Warcraft is currently played in 75% of Korean Internet Game Rooms (IGRs), the primary venue for playing games in Korea. IGRs subscribe directly to MMORPGs and then players buy blocks of time from the IGRs for game time. <br />
<br />
    * North America:<br />
<br />
          o Over 200,000 subscribers and 100,000 peak concurrency achieved in the game's first 24 hours.<br />
<br />
          o Current subscriber base of over 800,000 players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol, 1.5mil startups, 800k active after 100 days.  Nearly HALF of their accounts haven't kept paying for three months.  Now there's a success~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wait, it's actually worse than that.  How many of those 800k are still in their month that comes with the box?  That's some pretty serious attrition for the first half year of live play...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brohg, reading comprehension is your friend.  It says 800k NORTH AMERICAN subscriber base, not total.  Try again.  Actually, their drop off rate has been MUCH lower than EQ2, which has stabalized at about 350k users world wide.<br />
<br />
Whether you care for the game or the company or not, this is a pretty significant achievement.  With Taiwan being launched in a few weeks, followed by China, they will hit +2 million subscribers in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thunderwolfjr, didn't you guys get your own forum to post and tell yourselves how leaving eq was ok and that wow was curing cancer? <br />
<br />
Can't you stick to posting in that forum? Or don't they care either?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I see you did post in there already, how nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Posted for those who may be interested.  If you don't care, then I'm sorry you wasted 10 secs reading it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It was 15 seconds if you count my responses.... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">its a popular game. And in the Uk, its now more of a seen thing for a masses to enjoy instead of the hardcore audience. Shame it was plagued with problems with its servers to the point of having to stop selling copies in some places.</div></div><hr />

My apology but you quit EQ so take your damn WoW comments and post them where they should be.</div></div><hr />

Not because I agree with it, and not because I give a rat's arse about WoW, but because the comments of the reviewer seriously made me laugh.  Semi-mainstream media at its best!!<br />
<br />
Edit: especially this gem...&quot;&lt;i&gt;Granted, hard-core role-players—the ones who actually get turned on by inventory management—may get bored quickly.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;</div></div><hr />

*pats you on the head*<br />
<br />
Whatever makes you feel happier. Metric works best, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

&quot;But for those who love video games but have a fear of commitment, the time has finally come: For once, your online life won't kill your real one.&quot;</div></div><hr />

rofl . . . I'll have to show this to my girlfriend. I'm sure she'll stop complaining and say, &quot;Well then, I guess this game really *IS* perfect for you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That's ok. We don't care about EQ2 either.</div></div><hr />
