<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Things have to change in EQ, I think we all accept that.  However, I wonder if many of us are happy about the manner in which SOE go about implementing changes.<br />
<br />
A recent example of this is Monk mitigation.  SOE's method was to think of a number 'X', slap it on test for a short time, and then put it on the production servers.  In a short time, the number of ex-monk fungis hanging up in the bazaar was remarkable.  Eventually SOE decided that 'X' was too great a nerf, but by then it was rather late in the day.<br />
<br />
And now we are seeing the same thing again.  The exp. level nerf is being removed and, at the same time, 'X' exp will be shifted from PoP ZEMs onto group bonuses.  'X' is decided by a meeting, followed by placing on test.<br />
<br />
I think its reasonably obvious that the size of 'X' is dictated by the need to spread the 61+ population out.  Too great an 'X' value and many zones in PoP would be deserted and old-world zones packed out, too small a value and possibly PoP remains packed like a sardine can.  I don't understand how SOE think they can get the correct value of 'X' from dabbling on the test server - the population there does not represent production servers.<br />
<br />
I'd have thought the sensible method would have been:<br />
<br />
1.  Patch with the exp. level nerf removed.  No value of 'X' at all.  See how this affects zone populations.<br />
<br />
2.  Patch with maybe 20% of the supposed final value of 'X' and see how that impacts on zone populations.<br />
<br />
3.  Increment X until zone populations are balanced.<br />
<br />
Do other people think this would be a more sensible method of making transitions in EQ rather than the 'big bang' approach?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would have thought it better to *try* to get it right first time. So, maybe they will, maybe they won't, but continuously adjusting it would be worse in my mind than making one big change and maybe another smaller change later to balance it a bit better.<br />
<br />
Changes due to things like this take time to filter through after all - people are creatures of habit, and the zone occupation patterns will take a while to settle down each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure, that's a good idea.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that each of such single steps would cost the same time for implementing, patching and evaluating as one 'big bang'. During this time the game environment is NOT stable as game parameters may switch back after evaluation.<br />
<br />
Maybe some of the really game changing patches in the past would have been better off to start a bit slower or even in 2 chunks. But after all the year has only 365 days to spent and every 10 percent increase in patch downtime results in a estimated 30 percent increased outcry of the player base  ;) <br />
<br />
As another thought, who decides after let's say 40 percent of a change, that it's 'enough'? Given the fact, that you never will please all players with one change, you must draw a line somewhere and with your approach you would never find out, how the 60, 80 or 100 percent of a change would have worked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, i dunno, i mean no matter how you look at it , tweaking exp for this many people to be happy is a rough task to begin with. I think SoE is doing a ok job actualy, they put it on test then asked everyone to feedback. They didnt put it on test, look at it quiet then drop it on the public to then tweak if needed, which is how it used to be. I think they are taking the best and safest approach. All we have to do to help them is log on test /testbuff 25 or whatever the command is and try it out for ourselves and /feedback it like they ask. I assume its cause other games are coming soon but SoE is trying to listen to us again and trying to gain feedback from us on what they do. If nothing else i applaud the effort.<br />
<br />
Now will it be right and not need any tweaking? Thats another debate all together, we just need to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think it will work, because the player base will decide where the 'best' experience is and everyone will gravitate there.<br />
<br />
For the most graphic example of that, try checking out a zone that gives the same experience in the same level range as Paludial Caverns but isn't Paludial Caverns.  Count the number of people levelling there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For this particular issue... No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A perfect example is oasis of marr.  1.5 years ago it was packed to the hilt with minimum 20 people during off time, and as many as 80 during prime time.  Now when you go back there, there are barely any folks around.  In fact you can actually see sand giants nowdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well i dunno its hard to get it right and decide the best way. I do like knowing more info than they used to give. <br />
   One thing i still worry about with soe is going from nothing major to changing alot of stuff at once. Kinda afraid that this next patch with the possiblity of changing of the flags, exp , dot damage showing , the higher group buffs changing and whatever else that if more than one thing is wrong they will take a long time to get it fixed right. <br />
   For example is the changed group exp is to high and solo exp dropped too low but another problem or two pops up with all the changes will it cause it all to take a long time to get fixed? Granted i dont know how all this works i dont claim to be a programmer or designer just seems sometimes instead of tackling the exp change Than the rest its going to all for better or for worse lumped together in one patch. <br />
    Remember when they made mobs give more exp for being higher lvl but changed the exp from lower mobs at the same time? Than whatever else they changed at the same time. They fixed that pretty quick but that istn the norm. Thats what my rambling just woke up brain is getting at hehe.</div></div><hr />
