<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What an awful spell.  I looked at it on lucy before I got it, and best I could tell, it would work on other groups.  Then I bought it.  Turns out I was wrong, and this spell only hits people in your group.  I am pretty sure MGB won't work but I haven't had a chance to blow a MGB on it yet.<br />
<br />
This really pisses me off.  What good is this spell?  The problem with shrinking a raid is not that you have to shrink so many people, it is that you have to switch around groups.  You can't just do it on your own.  You have to leave your group, raiddisband, have whoever wants to shrink leave their group and raiddisband, invite each other, shrink them, disband, and get back in your old group.  Switching groups is just such a huge pain in the ass.  Why can't they make this spell hit other groups?  Is it really that big a deal if someone gets shrunk without wanting to be?  Just give it a confirmation box or have it only work on people in the same raid as you.  Either of these would be perfect.<br />
<br />
Ugh, sorry for the rant.  The worthlessness of this spell just pisses me off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were to change that rule, group-heals would be TGB/MGB-able. Yes, I know that group Heal-Over-Time spells are usable in such a fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't they give it a confirmation box like wizard mass TL to bind?<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to feedback daily until they make this spell useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People have, several times, and it's come up at probably the last 3 or 4 fan faires.  They just keep saying &quot;it's hard, we'll look into it&quot;.  This is the best they could come up with.  One day it'll probably happen, but I wouldn't hold my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think we are getting to the point that a required piece of equipment for recruits to our guild is owning a shrinking device.  Same goes for guild members.  Group shrink is still very good.  Two casts and everyone in group regardless of race is tiny.  It saves time not having to cast 6-12 shrinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can MGB tiny terror.. It will eat your MGB and do nothing.. I tried  :mad: <br />
Feel free to /feedback /bug it if you think that will ever do something (or if you think they actually read feedback or bugs..)<br />
<br />
Maybe we should just /bug that tiny terror is screwing with doors  :D <br />
Also the door at Plane of fire ZI is bugged and makes people that zone in take a 20k fall.<br />
The door that lead to the justice symbol quest giver in Halas is bugged.<br />
The doors in the rings in PoEarth are bugged.<br />
The doors in plane of fire are giving miniboss new insane cold resist<br />
etc..<br />
<br />
At least they fixed the door that was interfering with Cani5 and hp status refresh.</div></div><hr />

        yes it would be the best solution ,but they are too lasy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just making it possible to cast group only spells on raid members would fix so so many problems, and probably not the hardest fix there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive seen it for sale in the bazaar recently anywhere from 5k-10k.  <br />
<br />
After giving it a little thought, I came to the conclusion its just not worth spending money on, will eventually get it from a turn in or someone will give me a duplicate.  Many in our guild are getting shrinking devices anyway and that has been most helpful.  I agree that the confirmation box would be great and then the spell would be well worth the purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All forms of shrink are very much in need of a consent box or should be castable on ANYONE within your raid.<br />
<br />
Keeping a raid-sized force of 40+ shrunk while moving through ring encounters/boss events is pretty much impossible as it stands.  As soon as Bob the ogre and Suzy the barbarian get ressed in you know they are going to be full size until you go through the group leapfrogging required just to shrink them again.  I do love the shrink devices, but those need to come with several hundred charges because they constantly run out.<br />
<br />
I would pay good money to see the SOE kids run the Bert ring with an entire raid at full size.  Even VT would be good for giggles. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">An alternative to this is do what my guild did, have everyone buy those gnomish shrinking devices and problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I played I used to carry around about 40 shrink potions. It helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Axas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's my idea:<br />
Make tiny terror conjure an item, similar to a mod rod but with only a single charge and keeping it no rent.  This way, you leave it up to the player to shrink or not to shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Conjure item!!!  I vote for this.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">An item would probably be easier to implement than forcing the programming trolls to go through the back-breaking labor required to code in a consent window or make shrink raid useable.  The &quot;new&quot; group shrink could just be a carbon copy of MGB mod rods.<br />
<br />
Damn fine idea!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Make it a summon item and give it to mages ;), we have enough to worry about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I always cast tiny terror when I have asslings in my group.. <br />
The message &quot;You feel as short as a halfling&quot; rules :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warwiz Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Is it really that big of a prob with the shrinks ? I mean you have some shamans who can shrink their groups, u have warriors bards who usually have shrink items, everyone can go buy a shrinking device or shrink potions. Just make it a rule in your guild to have some kind of shrink item along for raids and problem solved. There are other things i would consider more important to complain about :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sure there are more important things to complain about, like the new 1018 bug that wont let you log in for 20 minutes after a LD, but the issues with shrink require such a minor tweak for a definite benefit to game play.  There are no solid reasons why TT/shrink can't be modified to effect people beyond your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just make it a rule in your guild to have some kind of shrink item along for raids and problem solved. <br />
<br />
Come on, does this really work in your guild?  Hell, we had a hard enough time making sure people carried an inside instant cast item!  In fights where it really matters that everyone's shrunk, we STILL get stuck shrinking at least half the guild.  I'm bombarded with tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Warwiz Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Works well enough for us yes. Latest when tanks refuse to tank mobs cause they cant reach em or they loose aggro for not being able to be close enough to them and you wipe on whatever mob due to having folks not shrunk it should become obvious to even the most silly member to have some kind of shrinking device along :)<br />
<br />
Of course there are always a few who are not shrunk, but these are mainly wizards who nuke from afar anyway :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kristis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Or your officers could just buy shrink devices for all your members?<br />
<br />
Hell ou officers went out and brought 8k horses for all casters. Then spent 4million pp on runes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most guilds now can kill AoW. he has sellable loot. <br />
Pretty hard for guilds to be low on cash nowdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The problem lies in your guild management. The guild I am in we get 72 ppl buffed shrinked and ready 20min from raid start. When we zone it's almost seamless the way ppl just shrink themselves and have shaman shrink them.. <br />
<br />
Only complaint I've seen is when one person looses/puts on an illusion and the shaman in that group does not see/notice it in the 10s that it takes for the guy to type /gs reshrink me please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Do you have a shaman in every group for that?<br />
<br />
Group shrink is an improvement on individual shrink, but it's still a pain to switch groups until everyone is shrunk if you're the only shaman there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm reasonably ok with the current group shrink.  While I would be overyjoyed if they gave it a confirmation box, or an icon, and made it MGBable, I will still use it in its current form.  I'd rather cast group shrink twice than individual shrink 12 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No thanks... would rather use MGB for high mana cost group spells.<br />
<br />
I'd be more than happy to jump from group to group instead of wasting MGB on shrink.<br />
<br />
I can understand people wanting to save time on raids but it isn't that time consumimg to group hop while other buffs are being completed, since most of them are group spells anyway, and most likely being MGB'd.<br />
<br />
Several other classes do have items available in other zones that allow them to shrink groups also. Shrink isn't an ability/spell which is exclusive to Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Generally, it would be nice if shrink worked outside groups with a confirmation box - like translocate does now (it was originally group only, then they added the confirmation box, then they removed the group requirement).<br />
<br />
If they did that, we could use normal shrink, group shrink, even MGB shrink on other groups, and that would get my vote. :)</div></div><hr />
