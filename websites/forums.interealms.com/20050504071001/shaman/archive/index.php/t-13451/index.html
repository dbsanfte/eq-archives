<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I get asked all the time to join guilds, but I decline saying I'm not ready.  So why would I join or want to join a guild? TIA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a few reasons:<br />
<br />
-to complete your epic<br />
-to get any other items you may want (almost nothing 'good' as far as equipment goes drops from soloable stuff)<br />
-You're soloing in sebilis crypt and you get killed. How much platinum are you going to have to spend on a corpse summon and cleric rez? (just an example)<br />
-make lots of friends<br />
<br />
If you can't understand why it would be good to be in a family that helps each other and lets everyone achieve their goals you probably are playing the wrong game, because you really can't get very far without a guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*** I play with friends all the time...and group with people all the time. I just am not sure what is the benefit of a guild...or what MY responsibilites would be as part of that guild. And I really don't think I am in the wrong game simply because I have don't know anyone to talk to about being in a guild. That IS why I am on this list to ask questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You join a guild because to associate with people who have become your friends is natural.  You join a guild because they're the only ones who will help you with your long quests, as you help them.  You join a guild because it will take you to places that you never imagined.  You join a guild because they will help you play the game with a level of competence that you never imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Penny and FJ really seem to have a one-sided view of guilds.  You make no mention of the other side of it... how you can ks someone and have it be OK because they don't want to get into an argument with a whole guild... how guilds can be a refuge for dull people who need somewhere to belong...  how even the top guilds with &quot;good&quot; reputations screw each other when competing for contested spawns..  Have you ever seen wild dogs or a pride of big cats eating on the Discovery channel?  Its not really that dissimilar.<br />
<br />
Please, don't take it the wrong way; this is just the worst of what's out there.  I'm simply playing devil's advocate and giving the other side of the coin a fair argument.  There do exist guilds with good and noble member... but even these tend to have a few bad apples, and they're usually allowed to stay around because of the &quot;friendship&quot; you tout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some people join a guild so explore place and fight mobs they would not be able to on thier own<br />
<br />
Some people join a guild to become uber and get lots of loot.<br />
<br />
Some people join a guild because they want to roleplay their characters<br />
<br />
Me, i joined my guild because of all of the above plus because I wanted a sence of belonging and friendship.<br />
<br />
<br />
People join guilds for different reasons.  EQ is a multiplayer game and being in a guild is like being on a sports team.  You support each other on the team and you do whatever you can to help your teammates become better so your team becomes better as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Without a guild, you'll never do NToV.<br />
Without a guild, you'll never see the inside of ST<br />
Without a guild, You'll never do the better parts of Ssra<br />
Without a guild, you'll never see VT<br />
Without a guild, you'll never do a single tier 4 plane<br />
<br />
Guilds take you where you never thought you'd go and push your game to a level that you never thought you'd get to.<br />
<br />
And Schpleef, if your guild does what you say, then you joined the wrong guild.  Mine won't stand for that kind of behavior.  Guilds are always bumping heads because of limited spawns of mobs peeps need.  Good guilds create understanding and cooperation between themselves.  <br />
<br />
Guilds are made of people.  And EVERYONE acts like a jerk, now and then.  Therefore, guilds tend to get painted rather liberally with the actions of their members.  You must see past the outward guild label and judge the person behind the toon.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First you have to ask yourself how far into this game you want to progress.  How nice of gear do you want to have?  Then find out a guild that will put you on track to achieving those goals and find a way to join them.  Or, if you have no lofty ambitions, you don't need a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since all we can do is speak from our own experience, here's mine.<br />
<br />
You join a guild to discover that no matter what zones you can get to, what loot you have available, and what skills you develop -- it doesn't mean a damn if you turn around and realize the people around you just aren't having fun, except for the .0001% of the time they spend looting a nice item.<br />
<br />
Just don't make the mistake of joining a &quot;job&quot; guild where they want to run it like you're getting paid to show up (unless that's what you're after, of course).  It's entirely too easy to fall in with this crowd in pursuit of the &quot;more fun&quot; part of the game.  I have more fun these days playing my level 8 mage on the FV server than my 64 shaman with 70 aa's.  <br />
<br />
Just say no to drama.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">then you joined the wrong guild. Mine won't stand for that kind of behavior<br />
I'm sure your guild has some bad apples responsible for despicable behavior that are allowed to remain guilded because they're friends with some officer or other... its human nature :(  I refuse to join any guild.  Phat lewtz aren't worth giving up my principles for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Guilds are an integral part of the game.<br />
<br />
It's concentrated human interaction, and as Finaljustice says, folks have good days and bad days.  It's important to cut people slack and recognize that.<br />
<br />
It think it's one of the keys behind the game's success really, but as with any human endeavor, they aren't perfect.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I think the concept of guilds is good and everyone should at least try it.  But join with the idea of helping, not getting help.  It will work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're a casual gamer, join a guild to do stuff with your friends and make new friends.  If you're a serious powergamer, join an uberguild to see the endgame and reap the uber rewards of that.  If you're somewhere in between, find a guild that fits your playstyle and see some parts of EQ that you aren't going to see in a pickup group.  If you have a bunch of friends playing already, form your own guild and add the new friends you make as you play.<br />
<br />
There's no one reason to join a guild.  I would advise anyone to turn down any random guildinvites ppl send after a single grouping or even worse those tools that just run around spamming you with guildinvites because you're the right class/level.  Be choosy and find out what the guild goals are and see if they fit with what your goals in EQ are.  Meet and get to know some members of the guild and see if they are the kind of people you want to associate with on a fairly regular basis in EQ.  <br />
<br />
In the end, it should just feel like a place you belong and making the decision to join, ideally, will be an easy one.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't fool anyone for a minute.  Your principles?  You're saying that the rest of us in guilds don't meet the level of your principles?  Riiiiiight  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes that's exactly what I'm saying.  Guilded people get away with doing a lot of bad stuff, trust me.  As an unguilded person with no perceived &quot;power&quot; to back me up, I'm picked as a target quite a bit by these folk.  FJ I'm sure you're not the type, and I'm sure 90% aren't the type... but would you leave your guild because someone in it had a bad day and trained someone they were mad at, and were allowed to stay guilded?  I doubt you would, you'd rationalize that you had no proof, or that he was just having a bad day, or that you don't like him but there's nothing you can do, that he's not worth leaving the guild over, etc...  Bad apples like that stay in guilds because nobody will leave due to them staying and their friend / cousin / uncle / whatever is an officer or esteemed member.  It is absolutely against my principles to have anything to do with such people.  I'm sorry you don't feel the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done all of the above, and I suspect the vast of majority of human beings have.  <br />
<br />
Do you reject your friends who may have done, or will do these things?  <br />
<br />
You have a strangely narrow view of things, which I think must leave you pretty isolated.<br />
<br />
I suspect you've done things that aren't perfect, and undoubtedly you don't wish to be &quot;shunned&quot;.  Or do these rigid principles only apply to EQ?</div></div><hr />

Maybe time to start looking into 1 player rpg's if you think the other 450.000 EQ players are just there to screw you. <br />
Besides how do you know that a_random_groupmember_03 aint a ******** that is doing the very same stuff you dont want to join a guild for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why should you join a guild? The other posters' have pointed out most of the cogent reasons. In the end, only you can answer that question. If you're perfectly happy with your EQ experience, as is, do NOT change anything for now. If your wants change, THEN reevaluate. You may find that a guild will be right for you then as opposed to now. You will need a guild to experience certain aspects of the game (mentioned above). If that's not important to you, then you don't need a guild. If it is, then start shopping around. Start looking at guilds your regular groupmates are in (if applicable). My only piece of advice is, get in a guild with people you want to hunt with. I wouldn't join a guild if I didn't want to interact with my guildees outside of raid environments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bounced around a couple of guilds and was at the point where I refused to join a guild. I soloed for awhile, did some pick up groups  tagged along on some raids with my friends guild. After awhile I got bored, and lonely. I took a chance and joined my current guild after a couple months of hanging out with them and getting to know them. Very glad now that I did. With this guild I have developed friendships and  seen and done things in EQ I never would have been able to do on my own. Been able to upgrade some items and best of all been able to see the guild grow as a whole. I had no desire to join one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds on my server where the majority of the members are concerened about themselves only. I am glad to have ended up finding a growing guild with good principles with good people and be with them as they grew and explored and conquered new areas of the game. If I had stayed on my own I never would have experienced that.<br />
<br />
Have you ever been in a guild? If not I would suggest doing some research on the guilds on your server and finding one that you think might suit you. Look to see what levels they are, what things they are doing, what time zone they play in, what would be expected of you.. and most importantly.. what kind of people are in the guild. Ask to come some of their raids, group with some of them, if you like what you see then see about joining them. Give them a try.. if you don't like it you can always leave the guild and go back to what you were doing on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Depends on what you want out of the game.  <br />
<br />
I will not join a guild because i play with RL friends.  We dont need a guild.  The platinum peice can buy just about anything in EQ if you have enough of it. Yes this includes top end nodrop loot!  :)<br />
<br />
Like finaljustice said, you wont get to see many of the top zones in the game.  Raiding guilds are fun, but with my unique situation i can get all the same things without the time investment hehe.  Except ST, i have to dissagree there FJ, St keys are buyable, or zland is killable with one group of strong players.  You might not be able to see the warders die, but primal is obtainable.  Almost the only thing worth getting from that zone anyways hehe. <br />
<br />
So like i said, just depends on what you want from eq, and how much you want to put into it.  On my previous server I was in a emp/VT guild, and it was alot of fun, i dont regret it.  But all the while i was raiding my RL friends that i play with now where playing together, without a guild, and having fun too.  And getting the same tier loot i was getting in the 2nd guild on the server, i might add :p<br />
<br />
Edit: If we wanted to im sure with the right amount of plat, my group of RL friends could get flagged for any PoP zone.  Guilds are overated imo, but hey we need em to kill ****, so we have someone to buy these things from lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Join a guild if its made up of the people you play with anyway.  Then you will meet more people to group with, and maybe take on things you never would have otherwise.<br />
<br />
Having a channel full of people who say hi when you log in, who want to do things with you -whether it be hanging out and doing a quest, gaining levels and gear, or conquering the plane of time.  Thats what joining a guild is about for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Maybe time to start looking into 1 player rpg's if you think the other 450.000 EQ players are just there to screw you. <br />

Please don't put words in my mouth, I specifically said most people probably aren't like this.  I rarely group, and when I do I'll make it a point to vocalize to the group that I have to leave, or I refuse to join, because a member of Guild_01 is there.  I play a mmorpg for various reasons, and will not stop just because you're an ass to me about it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, this is probably the best reason to FORM a guild.  You got friends that you like playing with?  make up a name and start attracting new friends to your new association.  If you don't LIKE the people in your guild, you're in for a hard time.  Some of the best guilds are guilds of strictly friends....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Judge people by who they are, not by the tag they wear.  I was initially very much a loner in my playing habits in EQ, but eventually the guild bug caught me and I've never looked back.<br />
<br />
My guild gives me friendship, advice, people to talk to and laugh with to cheer me up when real life is being harsh.  We achive things through our teamwork, we help each other to progress and we would all admit that without each other, EQ would be a far less enjoyable game.  I'd rather have all these things than any number of elemental planes loots that I didn't truely earn.<br />
<br />
The very best guild isnt the servers resident uber guild, its the guild with the people you can think of as your friends, it doesnt matter if your raiding Blackburrow or PoTime as long as your having fun doing it.<br />
<br />
THAT is what guilds and in turn EQ itself is about.</div></div><hr />

Ya we have thrown around the idea of starting a guild.  The time investment is a little to much for most of us though hehe :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but we are still able to distinguish between good guys and bad guys.  The difference does exist.<br />
<br />
There's only guild on my server, and in my timezone, of a size that would enable me to do more content than I can do in a group.  But it contains someone that I would be ashamed to associate with.  He's possibly one of the few people in EQ who has managed to become a pariah on servers other than his own.<br />
<br />
So I sympathise with Schpleef.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">But it contains someone that I would be ashamed to associate with. He's possibly one of the few people in EQ who has managed to become a pariah on servers other than his own. <br />
<br />
hmm, I recall you played on SZ? Is it Sam the Man??  :p <br />
<br />
about the guild issues, I would rather trust someone with a guildtag, any guildtag than 1 without a guildtag. There are so many guilds on our server and most of them have some policies of being nice etc. and the ones without guildtag are often the ones who got rejected for several reasons, let it be scams, ks or similar stuff..<br />
<br />
just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm in Schpleef's camp, unpopular though it may be.  After 2 long-term guilds being trashed for me by leadership's refusal to remove these sort of cretins, I was just left with the conclusion that people aren't WILLING to remove someone with a bad attitude if they belong to X class, or are friends with officer_03.  <br />
<br />
These guilds start out with great intentions.  WE won't be like those OTHER guilds who trample on other people.  We'll be the GOOD guys.  But then an exception is made (just this one time) to value the person's class/level/gear/phat-lewt-gaining-potential-usefulness over their complete lack of character or virtue -- and that's it.  The guild no longer stands for anything other than the biggest pile of loot for the most people.<br />
<br />
The majority of people can turn the other way and say &quot;it's not so bad, most of my guildies are good people&quot;.  I dunno, some of us just see things as too black and white.  Maybe it's &quot;better values&quot; or maybe it's simply a pigheaded romanticism (the world CAN be a better place, if people would just stick to their beliefs!) that has no place outside of our imaginations and the stories we've read so often and keep trying to live out in Norrath.<br />
<br />
It's pretty close to reality.  I left my higher-paying cubicle-dwelling big-corporate job to enjoy more self-determination and freedom in my work day.  I suppose it was kind of a no-brainer that guilds would provide little other than disappointment - but it took me over 2 years and 2 guilds to discover it (leaving me so aggrivated I've canceled.  again.  heh).<br />
<br />
Remember - the Mugglewump is just as challenging an encounter to a group of lvl 15's as the Emp in Ssra is to a horde of 60's.  It's about what YOU want out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I joined a guild for friendships.  I&#8217;d met a couple of people whom I enjoyed grouping with and I was eventually invited into their guild.  It was a small guild with more of a family feel and we did very little in the way of raiding.  But it was always fun to log into the game and participate in guild chat even if I wasn&#8217;t grouped with anyone.  EQ can become very lonely if you don&#8217;t have any friends.<br />
<br />
One of the downsides of a guild, at least for me, is the politics that can sometimes arise.  The problem we had in our guild was that some members expected the guild to deal with personal issues that had nothing to do with the guild.  We were, of course, there for support, but when in game romances start to cause problems within the guild something is wrong.  In the end the officers got tired of dealing with it all and there was nobody to take over, so the guild disbanded.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m currently in a larger guild that does a lot of raiding.  There are a lot of nice people in the guild, some of which were from my old guild, but I still don&#8217;t feel at home.  Being a member of this guild could prove very advantageous for me in the form of equipment upgrades, something I rather desperately need, but I think the pace is just too hurried for my taste.  I miss the laid back feel of my old guild.  <br />
<br />
If your happy grouping with friends and don&#8217;t feel a need to change then don&#8217;t worry about joining a guild.  But having spent a good amount of time both in and out of guilds, I find the game more enjoyable within one.  The secret, of course, is finding the guild that&#8217;s right for you.  But once you do it can truly be a game altering experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I get asked all the time to join guilds, but I decline saying I'm not ready.  So why would I join or want to join a guild? TIA!<br />
<br />
I joined my guild because everyone in it is an awesome person, they are all my friends, they have sent me computer hardware in the mail (priority mail yet) when I needed it, we talk on the phone, when someone's in the hospital we send cards and stuff, and  we get together offline every summer at someone's house.  <br />
<br />
The downside is that it is tiny, there is a lot of the game I will never see, and I hardly ever raid at all.  But I don't really care.<br />
<br />
It's all in what you want.  No matter what your goals are, though, I think you are unlikely to achieve them by joining a guild that is randomly inviting people.  <br />
<br />
I think before you can answer the question of why you would want to join a guild, you need to define what you want out of EQ.  Then find a guild that is doing that thing.</div></div><hr />
