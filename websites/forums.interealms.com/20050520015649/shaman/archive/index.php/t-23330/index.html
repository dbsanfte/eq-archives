6-9 months, I mean damn - just release the game already!</div></div><hr />

The World of Warcraft Stress Test signup page is currently only open to FilePlanet subscribers. The signup page for all other users will be available in a few days.&quot;<br />

Hmmm......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll fess up...I paid the $7.90 or whatever for a 1 month subscription to fileplanet to guarantee my spot in the stress test.  While it hasn't gotten rabid here yet, on some forums (including the WoW community), people are really blasting those who would pay for a subscription to get into beta.  The funny thing is, the ones doing the blasting are the ones who are IN beta.<br />
<br />
I've been invited into every crappy little beta in the past 5 years, EXCEPT WoW.  I'm willing to fork over $8 bucks to get in, if even for a brief shining moment.  Hell, I've paid $8 for a bad piece of cheesecake, and the cheesecake lasted alot less than 7 days.</div></div><hr />

Well, it wasn t really bad than. 7 days fun is nothing for really ripe cheesecake ;)<br />
<br />
All I see is the admission to a 7 days stresstest, I doubt there will be alot of quality playtime with 100k+ peeps on 2 servers ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">found on Fileplanet's FAQ regarding the stress test:<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the stress test is over, will I be able to play in the beta?<br />
 <br />
This sign-up is only for the 7-day stress test. The beta test is completely separate and is taking place on different servers from the ones on which the stress test will be conducted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">damn the Beta is going on a long time. Hmm now the question is whether to subscribe to Fileplanet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the most revolutionary feature of WoW - thorough testing.  SOE take note - when WoW starts in on EQs lunch, this will be a primary reason.<br />
<br />
The days of being good sports about crap code are pretty much gone by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not in beta, but I would tend to think there would eventually be a point of diminishing returns on time spent in testing.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't with software developers releasing games that continue needing tweaking -- that's the nature of the software development lifecycle.<br />
<br />
The issue is with consumers who get pissy too easily, like the irate, obnoxious idiots who walk into retail stores with a return because a page was bent in their book or something.  <br />
<br />
***NEWS FLASH*** They could beta World of Warcraft for 10 years, and when they release it it would STILL have gameplay issues, balance issues, glitches, bugs, etc.  I mean, read the god damn beta boards.  Read FOH.  Read any class boards.  NO ONE IS EVER HAPPY.  Jesus H. Christ, finish up the netcode, polish off the graphics, put a bow on it and ship it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with that but Blizzard must know what they are doing to venture such a risk. If the way they have done it proves successful, they could promote a new standard for mmorpgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm impatient about the beta being over as well, but I really think we're going to get a solid, polished game that is actually ready for release.  They aren't just tweaking content, they're actually adding it.  It's called beta because it isn't finished.  They just added the last class last week, its not like they've had it done for months and had everyone testing it.  I think if anything, they've hurt themselves by having too good a beta, leading everyone to think the game is ready.   We're all spoiled into thinking there should be 3 phases of beta, then a 4th open beta, and that this entire process should only take a few months.  In actuality, software design of this magnitude shouldn't work that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well said. yes coding and managing the code dev on a project like a big mmorpg isnt for children.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alot of peeps sign up for beta, not to test, but just to be able to say that they are one of the &quot;first&quot; to play.<br />
<br />
There are lots of applciations out there in the software development world that can simulate stress tests, effect of the number of users logging on, etc (eg Mercury's Loadrunner).  They could do that to stress test the software and hardware, but I think the real objective to open up 100k accounts to the public is simply a marketing/publicity stunt. <br />
<br />
I am skeptical that 100k kids and non-professionals can give objective feedback for stress testing within 7 days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so how much did they pay you to post this on the boards Ceno?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so how much did they pay you to post this on the boards Ceno?<br />
<br />
You honestly think they pay people?  It is not like this is the first time I've posted on these boards.  Just because I dont play EQ anymore doesnt mean I stopped reading the crucible.  Some how I enjoy the complaints, rants, and even the occasional millman post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now now kids.........<br />
<br />
BTW Vals.............how is beta testing under an NDA going? SoE actually caring this time or do they still only have a beta because the software designer handbook tells you to have a beta?<br />
(PS don't answer if you have to break the NDA for it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mulkosaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why I'm over this way.  I'd think they gonna be coming out with it in a few months if there firing up the servers to stress test them.  Last I heard it was being moved up to November 15th from friends I know that watch over that kind of thing.<br />

Hmmmm....so now everyone lives in North America?!?! And whether you can get in for free is difficult to say but probably not very likely.<br />
<br />
Thank god I didnt sign up for Fileplanet membership before they changed it to North America only. Not that i really care too much since a 7 day teaser like that will probably be worse than not having tried it at all hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Blizzard is at least smart enough to listen to their beta players and release when they are sure they can make a big impact. Look at Horizons, sure the game looks okay at start but while I was in the beta i was SCREAMING that they not release it which is pretty much the reason why its worth $5 at EB.<br />
<br />
Kudos to Bliz if they have the gonads to push the release back, they know their stuff and aren't going to put a half assed game out.</div></div><hr />
