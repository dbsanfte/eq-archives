<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seriously, being in Time isn't an accomplishment. There's so many Shamans and other people in Time(or at the very high end of the game for that matter) at this point, who are clueless sheeps. <br />
<br />
EQ isn't what it used to be anymore. I am all for being an elitist(in a game), but there's only a handful of people on this board I'd exchange information or discuss Shaman things with(and not all of those are in a Time guild). <br />
The requirement to have 72 people(and a roster of 150+) and the dumbing down of EQ(hello 30 minute AAs) have totally blurred the lines between the &quot;elite&quot; and the &quot;average joe&quot; or even &quot;newbies&quot;.<br />
<br />
No, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could do it here in the regular forums.  I can't imagine anything you would want to share, but only to certain other shamans.  <br />
<br />
If it's worth posting on a public message board, it's probably worth posting for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Not all guilds have a high roster :P We have about 87 total in the guild, they just all have really high playtimes. <br />
<br />
But I agree, the dumbing down of the game is pretty stupid as is the fact that any stratless guild can zerg all the encounters that I've ever been on. I'm just glad my guild isnt one of them :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I totally agree that there are in fact exceptions to this. Still, I'd assume you rarely can field 72 people on raid days. <br />
If the average member in the average uberguild has an attendance of 50%, they will have big rosters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd have to say those are the wisest words spoken out Giac yet. Just being in POT these days does not entitle you to the elitest list. 30 min aa's and outdoor zones in POP make it damn easy to go from lvl 1 to lvl 65 with 175 AA's in 6 months and jump into a POT enabled guild. I know I did just that with my shaman. But a board solely for shamans to discuss POT tactics..best reserved for your own guilds boards imo. Figure it out on your own with your team and leave some of the mystic to PO for others to discover.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Time isn't the hardest raid in everquest at the moment.  I don't think its a good measurement of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
The way this board and community has developed over the years, having a seperate &quot;Raid&quot; board could be useful for everyone on, but I doubt it would be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if there was a separate elitistforum I wouldnt post strats there either. That is something for every guild to learn themselves. And I wouldnt want any non-time shaman miss the info that get posted here either. And as Ciele said, Time is far from the hardest place to raid either. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one will probably never be Time enabled, but I still like to hear what others have to say about their strats, encounters, etc.  I guess I'm living vicariously through them.  I've always known this board to be an open forum with many people who love their class, and are willing to share their information to help their fellow brothers and sisters.  It would be a sad day indeed if this were to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tend to agree with the other posters.  We don't need another forum.  Speaking from way back when, I can say that the questions or posts of the elder shaman were usually eye-openers in terms of questions on resists, etc.  They made me think a lot more about game mechanics.  I see no reason to move that away from non-time enabled folks.<br />
<br />
BTW, nor is that a slam against the non-time enabled.  I've seen some questions from shaman at ALL levels that really showed a thorough understanding of game mechanics.  It's just I think those situations (and posts) are more likely to occur at the higher end of the game.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I see the point of it.  There are some encounters in Time that can be pretty intense, and it isn't always obvious what a shaman's role should be.  I've worked out a pretty good niche for myself, and I do a great job of keeping my group alive.  I would like to hear what other shamans do, and I wouldn't mind giving some advice to shamans that are doing their first runs through time.  It would also be nice to be able to talk about time loot and what people would suggest as upgrades from standard EP gear (there is a LOT of loot in time and many options for quite a few slots).  It would be nice to have a seperate forum set aside for this that is not cluttered with people ranting and screaming about GoD.  Also, I wouldn't feel good about describing in detail how to do time encounters to someone who hasn't beaten it yet themselves.  I know this is pretty much irrelevant since there are probably about 200 guilds in time, but it is just a matter of principal :)<br />
<br />
Another thing:  Despite what people say about people who raid time being mindless zerglings with no individual skill, people in time guilds are, on average, much more knowledgeable and experienced than people whose daily routine consists of BoT and easy LDoNs.  All guilds have their idiots and time guilds are no exception, but for the most part this is true.  A lot of the time, threads get cluttered with posts from people who either A) have no clue what they are talking about or B) are at a stage of the game that I have not been at for over a year and we have nothing to offer each other.  A seperate forum would cut down on that a lot.<br />
<br />
In practice, though, I don't really think it would get much use.  There isn't really that much to talk about.  I'm really neither for nor against it.  It wouldn't hurt anyone but it wouldn't do that much good either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry, we're not going to have a special, Time-Only section for the Crucible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, I agree, a potime only section would be pretty silly since everything is so straight-forward. I could understand the need for a potime level ldon raid forum though, but I don't think anyone would share any information about them yet, myself included.<br />
<br />
Getting to and clearing PoTime is pretty easy now, although saying that most potime guilds have bloated rosters is a broad generalization. PoTime is easily clearable with 50-55 so most guilds are trying to downsize their roster for GoD which will most likely be targeted at 54 players.<br />
<br />
We have exactly 54 active members atm, and we clear PoTime just fine, so requiring a 150+ roster for potime is incorrect :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You weren't clearing PoTime with 54 people when you first entered it and before LDoN. How many of your 54 active people bot clerics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">why would elitists need to discuss anything? they know everything already and they are not going to share anything with lesser elitists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sorry, we're not going to have a special, Time-Only section for the Crucible :)<br />
<br />
I don't have any particular opinion on setting up a separate Time-enabled area; there seem to be good arguments on both sides.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I would like to say that this is an example of one of the things that makes this board work: dedicated and decisive management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As a time enabled shaman myself i dont see the point.  If that kind of chat is really that important make a chat channel or something in game for it.  I dont see why if you wanted to discuss time shaman strategies and the like you couldnt just post a thread on it and im sure plenty of time enabled shamans would discuss on it.  Unless the point is to prevent non time shamans from reading it.  And then why would you want to?<br />
<br />
Besides I can only imagine the outcry of elistism by a certain number of people who constantly complain about it.  Judging from the number of whine threads from people who want access to zones they cant, dont want to or are too lazy to earn it, I could see these forums filled with nothing but complaints and whines for months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Would that be like a Country Club ?<br />
<br />
Why not make a Time Enabled Shaman's forum here and make it pay only. <br />
<br />
<br />
Call it Shaman's Crucible LEGENDS :p<br />
<br />

Ok bad old bitter shammy, back to lurking for me :)</div></div><hr />
