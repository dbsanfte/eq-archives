<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skarred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a 58 lizzy, not epicified but have 2khp unbuffed 940ac and about 230 wis and in dire need of a new solo spot.  I spent 55-57 at nadox elementals, great exp for the amount of effort/mana it takes. Just toss a slow and melee them to death.  They max from 111-135 (named). They have half the hp of anything else in the zone, and give the best exp.  But at 58 that spot has dried up.  ME isnt that great, the exp is poor and the loot even worse, I cant do FG till i hit 60 and have torpor. Katta is worse then ME.  I got about .2% a kill, and that was at 55, so i can only imagine how poor it is at 58.  PoP solo isn't worth it, due to the high hp mobs, and the fact that solo exp was nerfed.  i have both HS and seb keys but neither spot floats my boat.  Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rbronso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure it helps but here after 20 levels or so of just grouping with Guildees(Im in a very small close knit guild) I had many of the same problems you did although at 56 not 58.  I finally broke down and did a few pick-up groups in the planes.  Tier 2 obviously has much better xp 1% every 2 kills or so and 2% AAXP every kill. Have done the pick-up group about 5-6 times to get through level 58 and half way through 59 now. Some were excellent and I tried to stay in them as long as possible, had a few that were not so good. My advice is to look for people who are lfg in larger more respectable guilds or people that you have played with before.  Know it is probablly not the &quot;sweet spot&quot; you were looking for but it took me forever to motivate myself to do pick-up groups again. Hope it helps, know its not much, but it took prodding from friends who outl leveled me to get back into the swing of pick-up groups. I really enjoyed CoD and Plane of Torment, although both are bring youre own group.  Invis past the ravens and if you have high chanter or fd puller can do Plane of Torment bridges(or ramps) are a lot of fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Groups in Droga and Veksar can yield excellent exp.  I dinged 58 last night and this morning picked up a yellow there fairly quickly.  Mobs we were fighting conned even to me at times, so it made for good fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skarred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the reason im looking for a new solo spot is to get some exp/cash while im lfg.  I tend to play very early or very late so its hard finding groups.  That way I can get some exp while im waiting to get picked up for a PoP group.</div></div><hr />
