<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">which would help the video slugishness more?<br />
upgrading cpu from  amd thunderbird 800 to 1900 or somthing<br />
or upgrading ati radeo 32 ddr to umm gforce MX 440 64 meg?<br />
<br />
i think the 512 meg ram is enough.<br />
i'm just trying to figure out if the video lag is from the chip or the vid card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cheaper to upgrade video card, but if you the cash i would definately do the CPU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was actually moderately displeased with my MX440 until about a week ago when I got fed up and cranked the Core clock from 270 to 300 and the Ram from 400 to 460.  I can outbench a Ti200 now and it has been VERY stable (note:  I don't recommend anyone else try this).  Oddly enough, this dual proc board has had some quirks to it and overclocking my video seems to have smoothed them out :P<br />
<br />
How much are you looking at spending?  To go from an 800 to a 1900 is likely going to mean a new motherboard, and possibly new ram as well.</div></div><hr />
