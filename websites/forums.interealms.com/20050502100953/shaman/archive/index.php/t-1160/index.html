<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am using a psc right now.  Someone will trade me their JB BP for my PSC &amp; 10k.  Does this sound like a good deal?  PSC is worth about 20k on my server, so it would be like getting a jb bp for 30k...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's a great deal. JB BP is better than PSC. Even at 60 you can use JB BP for soloing. The extra AC is nice from Bramblecoat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would take that deal... I know someone who bought a JB BP for 40k just for the looks, he only wears it to weddings and such.  I wish I had that much plat to blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go with the JB BP as well. It's still valued a bit more than a PSC on my server but not by much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok did it!  Thanks for the advice.  BTW, is 655 ac unbuffed decent for troll shammy at lvl 22?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 22 you shoulda gone for an ikky regen bp or something. a lvl 22 with jbbp is a crime =P<br />
<br />
Smylee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">at low levels it's ALL about fungi for the regen. fungi &gt; vindi bp for anything below lvl 50 imo. don't know the fungi situation on your server but try your best to get a fungi instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylemall Inthensom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take the deal....good deal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't know about that... I would say Fungi &gt; Vindi at that level, but I might still go with the JBBP at that level because of the DS.  I know it isn't much but the DS is nice to use... Oh wait a sec.  I bet that doesn't proc until 45 just like all of the other JB stuff.  Nevermind.  If you are going to be levelling quickly, stick with the BP because it will shortly be a very good piece of equipment.  If it is going to take you a year to get to 50+, I would trade the JB BP for something else.<br />
<br />
About the AC.  That is pretty nice for a lvl 22 Shaman.  I know lvl 50+ who have that (but they went the Wis route).  With that AC, I bet you can out meat shield most of the warriors that you are grouped with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BTW, is 655 ac unbuffed decent for troll shammy at lvl 22?<br />
<br />
Why would you come here to brag about that?  You are not a newbie if can afford PSC + 10k at lvl 22.  You KNOW what good AC is at what lvl.  My Ogre Shammy at 47 has 721 unbuffed with normal equip.  You have INSANE AC for your level.  You know it.  The reasons I stated have led me to believe this was no sincere attempt to get the approval of his fellow shaman, but simply a shallow attempt at praise, or trolling for a jealous reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I don't. Not for a priest.  My first toon was a cleric, but it has been ages since I was lvl 20something with him and I honestly don't remember what is good for that lvl range.  I apologize if I came off like I was bragging, it really was not my intent.  All of my other toons have been melee so I didn't know if my ac was adequate for my lvl as a priest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I repeat.  If you have PSC  + 10K to drop on a BP at lvl 22, and you don't know that 655 AC unbuffed is INSANE, then you are either an idiot, or you ebayed all your ****.  I don't mean to be harsh, but there is NO possibility in my eyes that you can afford that kinda AC equip and NOT know what good AC is, completely regardless of the class you used to twink the shaman with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, this is going nowhere.  If you want to resort to name calling or ebay accusations there is not much more I can say.  I am used to seeing 1k'ish ac on all my toons.  A lot of my slots are filled with blue diamond resist or wis gear.  I asked the question, not to brag, but to decide if I needed to start subbing out +mana +wis gear for +ac gear even though I am lower level.  I've heard before that trolls naturally have higher AC, so with those factors, it was a legit question.  If I were here to brag, you would see a magelo profile and I know droppable gear is nothing to brag about considering anyone 50+ in a decent guild is going to have velious quest armor twice as good as what I have.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks for answering my question that I do have good ac for my lvl even though there was a nice flame on it.  With a few kleenexes, I might just get over it ;)  Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;but to decide if I needed to start subbing out +mana +wis gear for +ac gear even though I am lower level&quot;<br />
<br />
Just level that is priority 1 for shaman... With what you have stated you proly have equipment that you could level to 60 no problem in...  and it did sound like bragging to me I just didnt respond to that.... it is a result of this inflectionless medium we have here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">and it did sound like bragging to me I just didnt respond to that.... it is a result of this inflectionless medium we have here. <br />
<br />
Ok, I see how it does look like bragging.  Again, I apologize if that is how it came across.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for people who level through the 50s with average/not-so-good gear.</div></div><hr />

If only that were true... /sigh ;)</div></div><hr />
