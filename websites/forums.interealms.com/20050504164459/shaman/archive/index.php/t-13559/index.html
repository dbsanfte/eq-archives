<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Airtreader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that they are 'fixing' one of the 1018 problems (caused by the way by VI choosing that method of preventing a dupe bug instead of fixing their spagetti code), and the lose all buffs (and DoT's) on zoning with low HP (also not a 'bug' in that this way, again at the time VI's choice to answer complaints that when you hit a zone, you do not actually leave the zone right away so the MOB's beat on you when you have no control, and killed you) features did they insert a new one?<br />
<br />
For the first time, and it has happened repetedly this morning, while 'camping the log-in screen' EQ closes after a few tries. It opens right back up if I want, but will close again after trying. Since they refuse to deal with their log-in server, is this a new (at least for me) 'feature' to pretend they are doing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's just there to stop people like you and me from spamming their server with login requests and slowing down the process even more :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Airtreader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn it camping the log-in does not unbalance the game! This is just another slap in the face to shaman's! Camping there has been in the game for 4 years (seriously LOL) and to change it now is unfair! Quit nerfing shamans!<br />
<br />
enough exclamation points? hehe :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is not new, I have seen this happen before. One of the problems with the log in server always being congested after a patch is people will sit there and spam the login server trying to get in. I use to be one of those people, now I just try once or twice, leave it and come back 20-30 minutes later and try again, rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />

Well, that is a good reason for them to upgrade the log-in server, or to give better messages. They KNOW a pant-load of players will try to log in at the same time. no mystery at all, yet they refuse to deal with it except by passive-aggresive punishment. Or if the message was more specific, like saying the servers are still down instead of 1001 or login congested (which really means nothing at all if the servers are down, they are down) it would be more friendly.<br />
<br />
Anyway up now, so NM LOL</div></div><hr />
