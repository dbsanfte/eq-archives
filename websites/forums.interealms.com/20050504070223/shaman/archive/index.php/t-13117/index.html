<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any need to buy Form of the Bear/Great Bear with the advent of Mounts? I already have a mount, and the regen I'd get from that, in both mana and hps, seems to be greater. (As comedic as it would be to see a shrunk bear riding a giant black lizard....)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still usually fire up bearform for indoor zones where I can't use a horse.  Plus I can hit the wis cap with it on for tradeskilling if I don't want to go find a KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there any need to buy Form of the Bear/Great Bear with the advent of Mounts?Can't summon horses inside, therefore no mana regen for j00!  Mainly used FotGB in Kael, for the measly 10 WIS.</div></div><hr />
