<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The target this week is Dalnir. We will form up at the OT/WW zone on the WW side at 6:45 or be at Dalnir at 7 PM CST. (Calon is currently camped at the entrance to Dalnir).<br />
<br />
If you have never been to this zone, please check the info under the Dalnir 8/28 post for info. <br />
<br />
Casters, please be prepared to cast lev as we might go visit the second level depending on party mix. <br />
<br />
It is my intent to make this event more of a &quot;KoE and friends&quot; visiting Dalnir rather than a large raid.. Much of the space in Dalnir is not that big to support multiple groups in the same place, but rather would work better if the groups were in somewhat close proximity and could rely on each other for support.  Post below on your thoughts and I can make adjustments if necessary.. :)<br />
<br />
We had a blast here on this last Tuesday and this is a great zone to work on tactics and get into some wild fights. The occasional good loot does not hurt either.. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A good night in Dalnir's. <br />
<br />
A sap and a stave dropped along with some other goodies. Cash was good at the end of the night. :)<br />
<br />
We had 2 groups split up and go pull in different places on the first floor for good xp for both. Both had a monk, a chanter, and a cleric, so it worked out well. <br />
<br />
Next Tuesday, we will be hitting Dalnir's again (several logged at the entrance) and the objective is to hit the second floor and get into it with the Kly. For monks, this represents an opportunity at the monk baton and also for melee, a shot at the practice sword. The mobs are a bit tougher on the second floor, but the xp is great. <br />
<br />
See you then..</div></div><hr />
