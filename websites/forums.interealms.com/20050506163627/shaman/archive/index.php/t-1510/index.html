<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Noticed a bevy of threads on the safehouse about some changes that weren't noted in the patch.<br />
<br />
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10997.topic<br />
Brell Rogues apparently are KoS and being attacked by mobs in the hole that weren't previously...  Perhaps they're expecting that people will suddenly flood the hole for xp with mez changes and thus we won't need those mules for CR. :\<br />
<br />

HS key frog doesn't seem to be in the same place and there's a lvl 55 sperm there which nobody seems to know what it's for yet...<br />

Several high end drops upgraded and some new ones as well.<br />
<br />
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10993.topic<br />
Sleeper and Warders were up with the patch, but GMs killed upon discovery.  Also of note, everything sees invis in ST apparently.<br />
<br />
No longer possible to stack regrowth from Fungi staff and regrowth as well.  Staff now overwrites BOTH sow and regrowth.<br />
<br />
So, anything else of note that hasn't been found yet? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sow is nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can you explain to us how SOW is nerfed?  I just woke up and am heading out the door to watch Spider Man so I have not been in game yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Long standing joke Mangler.... :p<br />
<br />
Sow, Jboots, and Fungi tunics somehow managed to evade nerfage once again.  However, the fungi staff/regrowth stacking sploits have been finally nerfed it would seem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gah!!  Was just starting to get the hang of my new fungi toy :/<br />
<br />
I KNOW they nerfed my sow too...have no been able to find my pig anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Boy am I glad I never paid for a fungi staff now. Will anyone use it now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fungi staff just lost 90% of it's value.. and no shaman or druid will use it now, maybe beastlords will for a while.. funny thing is I was offering to buy it yesterday and there were no takers hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rage line will not stack with HoS ...<br />
<br />
I hate those black spermy things ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They did slow down SoW.<br />
<br />
Instead of 38.7 seconds to cross EC it took 38.8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Open your eyes people!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Figures....<br />
<br />
Three days before my Hole raid for Shaman Epic (High Scale Kirn) they make Brell rogues KOS.  So much for doing CR's.  /rude VI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another undocumented Change falls under the mass of items that have been altered and upgraded.   Lots of items accross all classes have been altered.  <br />
<br />
For instance... I carry a Wintercall Spear (Drops off the Thought Horror Overfiend in The Deep)<br />
<br />
it's a 22/23 Spear.. Shaman Only  (I believe it's +10 Str/Sta/Wis/CR/MR and +50 Mana/HP)<br />
<br />
On top of that, the original Wintercall procced Winterstorm (180 DD Cold based Nuke)<br />
<br />
Last night, I logged in to find that the spear now is right clickable with a 6.5 Casting Time... Effectively, it's a JBB now...  I actually believe this IMPROVES the effectiveness of the weapon against Higher end Mobs as you can simply stand back and Nuke like crazy with it now.<br />
<br />
I was exceptionally happy about this as I've never onwed a JBB so this feature was totally new to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Prystin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't worry too much about doing CR's in the hole.  Seems that they only made the long trip up to Kirn that much easier for one group to do.</div></div><hr />

I'd better still be able to run across the Grey without wasting a fish scale on EB! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Won't sneak/hide still get your level 1 CR mule past all the baddies in the Hole?  The major advantage (I thought) was being able to death gate past the dropoff.  Definitely gotta have sow handy now though.  I bet it would take 30mins to sneak all the way down to Yael or the tower without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yah, you can still do CR's with it. I think it was just made so that you can't get a dueled corpse and drag it down to a brell cleric to circumvent the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chkorsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">not shaman related :p<br />
<br />
Disease Cloud got hit by the &quot;fix&quot; (nerf) bat.<br />
<br />
since disease counters do not generate agro (almost) anymore this spell is practically worthless now. Thanks Verant. Got any bright ideas what a Shadow Knight is supposed to bring to the game if you're starting to nerf THEIR trademark?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Avengerix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Winterstorm nerf is gay as hell. noone would use 180dd in 6.8 sec. if u get this spear u should have JBB as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">disease cloud was causing an unsreasonable amount of hate tho.<br />
same with all our dots(except epic) anyone tested the aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tried today sneak/hide with my rogue lvl1 (Brell),no prob from the Zone IN to the Tower.<br />
Then i tried my cleric (Brell) from the DA point to the Tower (Itu),no prob too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">May be they used the Kael rule.<br />
<br />
You're not KoS<br />
but dragging KoS corpse make you KoS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If the SK disease DoT now has almost no aggro, what does that mean for all the disease DoTs that a Shaman has?  hmmmm</div></div><hr />

Also of note, everything sees invis in ST apparently.<br />
<br />
Things in ST used to see invis before waking the sleeper as well, I'd bet things seeing invis again was part of whatever accidentally brought the warders back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lcea the bard in katta was stealth buffed as well.She now hits for a reported 825 her lvl was lowered form 63plus to 60 but her charm will now last 2 mins which will be tons o fun when it happens to be your MT that get charmed and goes hog wild on the clerics.<br />
