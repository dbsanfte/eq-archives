<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, Enokk. 6.5 second cast time on this is a ****ing joke if I may add. I noticed this nerf way too late, because I wasn't using SC 3 all that often, but it definitely deserves making a huge stink about it. I can't ****ing understand SoE.<br />
<br />
Since the cast time nerf applies to SC and ASC, it is worth losing the 5 pets for the 3 new ones imo. the difference between SC3 and ASC2 is noticable. I'd say ASC 2 gives a 50% dps upgrade without counting procs(I seem to average 3 procs).<br />
<br />
Edit: Changed ASC 3 to ASC 2(typo)</div></div><hr />

Why anyone felt the need to give us an AA that turns a minor DPS spell useful for offtanking and positioning into a a-little-more-then-minor DPS spell that is no longer useful for positioning and a lot worse at offtanking still baffles me. What was wrong with just making the same 5 puppies hitting harder, or have more HPs or proc something? Or with giving us both versions of spirit call on separate hotkeys. But no, we get another situational upgrade, just like Balance of the Nihil, except this one does not allow you to go back as needed. Just great.<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Sorry, I needed that. Feeling a little better now, though I am still mystified by that particular decision. There must have been a ton of people hating the push on the dogs. I blame 2boxers for this new AA.</div></div><hr />

They do indeed have around 2000 HPs, the same as the normal pets. <br />
<br />
Originally they were badly broken, but they've applied several fixes:<br />
<br />
* HPs have been fixed<br />
* They now bash/kick like normal pets (max of 37)<br />
* They attack faster (originally they'd just stand there for a second after each attack round, now they're continually in their attack animation)<br />
* The proc rate's been upped (used to be from 2 to 5 procs per use, now it's from 4 to 7 - this is over a few dozen uses both pre and post fix).<br />
* They enrage now, just as with normal pets.<br />
<br />
The only bug with them is that they'll sometimes cast &quot;Unsummon self&quot; and poof before the minute's up, if you don't keep them busy that is  ;)</div></div><hr />
