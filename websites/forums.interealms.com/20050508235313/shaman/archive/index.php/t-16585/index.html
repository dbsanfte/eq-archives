<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kind of a nice feature on Test atm<br />
<br />
Pet control box now has a slot that shows the pets current buffs in small icon form.<br />
<br />
EDIT: fixed title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the idea. But Id be happy to just have a pet health button on the control window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think this is kinda nice. I usually keep FA up on doggie just to time everyone else's, but sometimes I miss the wears off message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pet health button on the pet box would be awesome, as would a suspend minion button on there, even a pet hold one (keep it greyed out till u get the AA).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are a lot of simple UI mods that include pet health as a simple bar.<br />
<br />
The only mod I use replaces the player info screen with a slightly bigger one that has:<br />
Your health, with numeric %<br />
subbar: pet health<br />
Your stamina (sub: 5ths)<br />
Your mana, with numeric % (sub: 5ths)<br />
Your XP progression with numeric % (sub: 5ths)<br />
Your AAXP progression with numeric % (sub: 5ths)<br />
Your HP/maxHP<br />
Your AC<br />
Your ATK<br />
Casting countdown bar<br />
<br />
My wife resisted trying it for weeks, but after 2 days she loves it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still miss not having Pet inspect ability. Kinda like player ability to inspect, so I can see what the pet equips...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rorgg, I think they meant a '/pet report health' button.  The default UI has the health of the pet displayed as a gauge I believe.  The /pet report health allows you to see what buffs are on your pet and what negative effects, also.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'd love to be able to inspect NPCs or pets to see what they have equipped hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Making a hotkey for pet health isn't that difficult.   Seeing the icons is just as good.  Maybe they're working on group buffs landing on pets.  (Wishful thinking never hurt anyone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/pet report health allows you to see what buffs are on your pet and what negative effects, also.<br />
<br />
Well, I'll be.  Must have been added in my hiatus, and with the new UI I never even bothered using the command again.  I'll check that out, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The /pet report health works out ok, but you cant use it from a hotkey if your casting (which is annoying).  <br />
<br />
Besides, you don't always remember to do it.  I like the idea of having a visual indicator of what buffs my pet has.  I *especially* will like it with my enchanter, since its important to me to know if my pet is no longer snared, no longer malosinia'd, etc.<br />
<br />
More to the point, its important to know if he's no longer charmed.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet you didnt know if you Make your hot key in the Hot Button section of your Actions Menu that you can click that hot button while casting.  I regually do this as I ussually remeber to check it after I begin to cast a long casting spell.  Is bit slower as you have to move your cursor over there and click it instead of just tapping your hot key.  But you get 10 more buttons you can click &amp; Hundred if you include the ten pages of them.  I personally only have one set of ten buttons I us regularly.  These are all mostly buttons I would want to click while casting but can not activate while casting from the Regular hot button menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can simplifly this down to just /pet health. Much easier to type while you are casting and hotkey access is short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The pet buff box only displays 5 buff icons.  Makes it a bit annoying when you have more than 5 buffs on the pet, but still is a wonderfull addition to the pet window.  <br />
<br />
Im hoping that one goes live.  I do NOT like the fact that windows were changed NOT to close when the player hits the ESC.  Loot boxes, maps, and inventory windows now have to be closed maually.<br />
<br />
Also, the loot boxes from mobs now have a &quot;Link all&quot; button that links all the loot on the mob into the default chat channel that your main window is set to.  I like it; it will save our raid ML'er a little time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hrm, I like that link all idea.  HATE the escape news :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not being able to close temporary windows with escape? BOOOOO take whoever thought of that behind the shed and beat him to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jrizh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pretty sure the escape key thing is a bug.  Also, the pet window will show more than 5 buffs (up to 30), you just need to resize it.</div></div><hr />
