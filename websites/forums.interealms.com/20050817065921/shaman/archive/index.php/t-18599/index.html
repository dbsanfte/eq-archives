<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think at least 30% of the deaths I have encountered has been from invis dropping when going somewhere for a raid or a grouping...  <br />
<br />
I am beginning to wonder if it would be worth trying to organize something so we could get a better invis at least somewhere in the 60s....<br />
<br />
I mean I would even pay AAs to get a semi-reliable invis...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Example -- HoH trials -- Invis dropped THREE TIMES before I made it to the room we were going to.... If this were rare I wouldnt be upset -- but it is the normal experience...  It just drops way too much at the worst times and doesnt even always blink...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">most other classes have nice aa invis, and if i'm right they have set duration.. i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice to have?  Ya.<br />
Worth bitching about?  Naw.<br />
I just assume that invis is going to drop for me at the worst time wherever I travel.<br />
So, when it does drop, I'll be ready for it.<br />
If I get to my destination without it dropping, all the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Invisibility drops with alarming regularity at the worst times. To minimize the risk, I keep a couple of the insta-cast cloudy potions with me, going so far as to bag my SoW boots and leave one potion in that slot to be ready to use if needed. Costs 10P5G with 100+ cha...well worth saving a CR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I mean I would even pay AAs to get a semi-reliable invis...<br />
<br />
With SCRM and coldain shawl, my invis is pretty reliable.  Usually it either starts to fade right away, or lasts the full duration.  It isn't very often that I cast invis and then have it fade 30 seconds later.  The best thing to do is just assume that your invis is going to fade soon, and pay attention to your spell box so that you notice the second invis starts to fade.  You've got about 10 seconds to move to a safe corner and recast it.<br />
<br />
I'd definately like a better invis, but with spell extension AA's and a little attention, you're usually ok.  I can't remember the last time I died due to invis fading and it wasn't because I didn't notice in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I utterly hate invis. It's retarded. Not because I ever die when it drops, but because it's one of those things that just makes the game completely annoying when you cast it and it immediately starts to fade....3 or 4 damn times in a row. It wouldnt affect the game one bit if they would just give every class which can cast invis (or invis to undead) an improved version of the stupid spell. Except it might make things a little less annoying for a lot of us.</div></div><hr />

Swamp vine is an LDoN forage and rare drop. Burdock root is sold in Shar Vahl and Gukta. Mystic ash is sold by the usual old world vendors. Empty vials are sold by a number of vendors.&quot;<br />

I must be lucky I guess..I don't think I have ever died on any of my characters because invis dropped.<br />
<br />
Generally I can find a safe spot to reinvis after it starts blinking....or worst case i stop and fight something or have to train it out.</div></div><hr />

Its not just that we were overlooked for an Improved Invis, but also for any kind of agro reduction spells, or upgrades past Kunark.  We are a great class, but the little things that SOE seems to not care that they get right really bother me (ultravision as your boot effect replacement BAH!!)

<br />
Many threads have been started on our invis, andthe fact that we do deserve an improved version of our teen level spell. Why not they give us 20 versions of all the other spells, why not give us a new invis?<br />
<br />
You can post a rebuttal but 80% of all shaman complain about this, and no matter how &quot;prepared you think you are, it will continue to kill you unless you are constant groupers or the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Cant count the times Ive died due to this subject, if you havent then you obviously dont get around much.<br />
Going to have to disagree here, I get around plenty and have never had a problem with it.  As Etric mentioned above, I have a Ring of Stealthy Travel (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5733), and although the two second cast time is nice, it's not short enough to work the way a CoS or ranger/druid AA invis does - reinvis on the fly without aggro - and so wouldn't alleviate the problem some seem to have.  Although I agree we haven't seen much in the way of upgrades while other classes have, and I too feel the sting of being slapped in the face by the beastlord class' phenomenal, varied, and vastly overpowered abilities, I don't think this relatively minor thing is something worth voicing a complaint over.  If you've been in the situation often enough where you can't find a safe spot to re-invis within 10 seconds or so of getting the 'appearing' message, get some instaclick potions as someone mentioned, get or make the invis potions which seem to be fixed-duration, or get a gnomish vanishing device, which I believe may be fixed duration.  There are just so many things worth complaining about, and this really isn't one of them IMO.<br />
<br />
Edit: phase spider blood, while lore, is a fairly common drop in DN off zonein spiders (easy root/dot kill, under a minute per) which has one charge each of fixed length invis.  Just one more option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Uhm, if you are raiding high profile targets and are 65 then you really shouldn't care if you die.  Just get your rez and deal with it.  Once you hit 65 all you will be doing anyway is getting AA exp and if you don't have a huge buffer into 65 or have it maxed(like you should) then you really have nobody to blame but yourself if you delevel.<br />
There are FAR more important things Shamans need fixing and Invis isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />

Well...judging by your level I am going to assume I've gotten around a bit more than you have...then again that might be why I don't have problems with it - experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't die much to invis dropping anymore, but I do get into some unneccessary fights because of it.  It's to the point now that if i'm raiding and we need to invis to somewhere I'll grab an invis from whoever else in my group can cast it.  Doesn't really matter what class either, as they're all superior to shaman invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've had divination maxed for a long time; there is no difference in how long invis lasts that I've seen.

I don't believe that for a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Our level 29 invis is completely random meaning that it can drop at any time from the moment it is cast.  It is NOT inherently inferior to any other targetable invis spell including camo and sup camo (even the group version).  It's also the same spell wizards, enchanters and magicians recieve at level 8 prior to the 10 minute set duration invis they get in the 50s.  The necromancer level 8 Gather Shadows is also random duration with Skin like Shadow being a 20+ minute set invis (with an annoying zoom feature) at level 56.  It used to be nightime cast only until Luclin was released with it's lack of day/night cycles which warranted the change to the spell.  They also have a set duration ITU upgrade as well as a 7 second refresh insta-click ITU trainable in the Class AA set while wizzies and enchanters have random duration ITU.<br />
<br />
The only other classes that never recieve a set duration invis (that have invis as a castable spell) are druid, ranger and beastlord (afaik) though both druids and rangers can dump AA points into an instant click invis hotkey with a 7 second refresh timer.  <br />
<br />
Personally I'd rather have something along those lines rather than a set duration invis.  My necro has a pre-nerf Circlet of Shadow + Innate ITU and combined with FD and root, it's about the next best thing to being a rogue, maybe even better in some situations.<br />
<br />
With that said, I do agree there are more important issues to be focused on then our invis spell.  Carrying a couple instant invis potions will remedy just about any emergency invis situation, even if it is a pain in the rear to maintain stock and space for them.<br />

<br />
No one said scrm shawl.. just divination.. also you're not extending the max time it lasts, but you are effecting the chance for it to drop sooner.. and it can be a random drop of invis with your divination as a factor in it. &lt;- very easy to program and logical..<br />
<br />
I am 100% sure I used to die ALL the time old droga everywhere.. even high 60s (maybe 65) my invis would drop like crazy.. sometimes I would cast it 3x in a row for it to stick.. but with max divination I noticed a significant improvemnt in the length of it not dropping.. <br />
<br />
anyway even if it is a placebo this is a game so the guy will be happy either way =]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you find it much of a bother use cloudy potions, as people have stated above~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having SCRM and a 15% buff extended duration item doesnt seem to help very much, I guess if the random duration of 1 second + 1 second still isnt very helpful ;).<br />
<br />
I had the exact same thing happen as someone else in this thread had, just going to a trial room in HoH, my invis dropped 3 times along the way, thats unacceptable at 65 imo and I dont want to be bothered with carrying something else to fix the issue, I already carry enough other junk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, if you want to bring AA into it, Rangers receive Innate Cammo which is better than any improved invis spell... it's instant cast, no spell gem, fast refresh.  Kind of like having infinite Cloudy Potions. :p<br />
<br />
edit: I said this in the last invis thread, but I see no relation between Divination skill and invis reliability.  With maxed Divination and EE3 I still have invis dropping early, sometimes seconds after casting.</div></div><hr />

It sucks when it drops, sometimes 3 times in a row, but when I travel I keep root, gate and invis memmed.  With some creative running (cutting corners, jumping obsticles, climbing walls as I run ... ) I usually get away.  It's an inconvieience, but no biggie.<br />
<br />
I doubt it makes any difference, but I do have maxed Div and SCRM.</div></div><hr />

Invis has a duration - 20min. It can randomly drop at any point however. So SCRM and the Shawl do affect invis - they can make the max duration last longer. If you have invis on long enough with out it dropping, it will actually flash and fade just like a normal buff.<br />
<br />
The chance for invis to randomly drop is directly tied to your divination skill. I highly recommend taking the time to max divination and this becomes much less of an issue. Since shaman have a hard time with divination, I usually use my mage to invis my shaman (its the same spell, but the mage has max divination). Invis dropping is rarely a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got bored last night and managed to scoop up a stack of swamp vines in the bazaar. My alchemy skill is 185 and I have a GM alchemists bag. Out of the 20 combines I failed 3 times and with the cost of the components the potions cost and average of 48pp for me to make. The finished product read invisibility &quot;up to&quot; 10 minutes and with a 4 second cast time. <br />
The only thing these potions are good for is saving inventory space. It's not worth the time and plat to make them IMO.</div></div><hr />
