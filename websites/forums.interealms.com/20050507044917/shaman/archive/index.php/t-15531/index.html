I have a feeling these will be our spells in LDoN, We have been asking for a better group sow. So they give us a group sow that's slower &amp; lower level than our originial one. Have to say tho that the dots are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also Bard songs increasing DoT damage 15% apparently went live today.  Already posted in Spells forum. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gah. :)<br />
<br />
Oh well, over to the spells forum I go<br />
<br />
(out of interest, this was only posted 7 minutes after yours, and it took more than that to search out all the links from Lucy)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You missed the important point: Slower, lower level, and CASTABLE INDOORS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sow indoors is retarded, great bigger trains from deeper in the dungeon.. the whole point IMO was that you can't run cause you'll get mauled, so you're careful and you stand and fight it the best you can.. (that was the problem with KC it's outdoors).. bah! Now I guess shaman can mgb 3 things =]<br />
<br />
Is it true that if lucy reports 5 ticks then it's really 6 ticks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Isn't the new indoor sow the same speed as RS3?  Don't see how that'll contribute much to the quantity of trains.  Just kinda nice to be able to allow your rs-challenged friends to be able to keep up.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the duration of dots seems to be one tick longer than what Lucy reports.<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, maybe a few more trains for the 34-50 crowd...  Can't say I'd mind the spell being higher lvl.  ;)</div></div><hr />
