<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mebosh Uhed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, congratulations on maxing defense. I don't know how many times I've chatted with various shaman on my server only to find out they still don't have their defense maxed even at 50th or 55th level. Great work.<br />
<br />
Now on to your question.<br />
<br />
The reasion your piercing skill is lower than Offense would be because Shaman use different math to figure out max Piercing, One Hand Blunt or Two Hand Blunt than other classes.<br />
<br />
Most skills for most classes use the math:<br />
<br />
(level x 5) + 5<br />
<br />
So at 41 your max cap for most of your skills will be 210.<br />
<br />
However, Piercing, One Hand Blund and Two Hand Blunt, for a Shaman, use the following formula to figure out their cap:<br />
<br />
(level x 4) + 4<br />
<br />
Thus creating a max cap at level 41 of 168 in all three skills.<br />
<br />
As for the how long till you begin kicking yourself before training in another weapon? Hehe. I've never picked up anything but a piercer and most likely will not untill I am a jaded 60th level who is looking for new and interesting ways to make the game 'fun'. (Tho I am looking at that OT port hammer and starting to drool a tiny bit...) :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 50, my Offense, Defense, and Piercing were all capped at 200.  All our weapon skills cap at 200 and can be maxed out at level 50 although some may not be.  If your isn't at level 50, you just haven't been using said weapon enough in melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up, and thanks for making a new post. I am not able to see the replys on my post.<br />
<br />
Btw, would anyone answer my bloodgills question with a new post? Basically, make a post with a mini guide to bloodgills and what lvl to start at.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mebosh Uhed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Straif,<br />
I'm willing to bet that it is your Offense that is at 171. Both Offense and Defense use the math (level x 5) to determine your per level cap. (Note that they do not get the +5 that most other skills get. They're wierd like that. :D )<br />
<br />
To my knowledge only the specific weapon skills use the (level x 4) + 4 math.<br />
<br />
I'd not heard that @ 50th level your skill cap jumps to your max, but there are many things I've not heard. We all learn new things. :D<br />
<br />
Most of the Math Formule I am using are posted on eq.castersrealm.com in the Skills section.<br />
