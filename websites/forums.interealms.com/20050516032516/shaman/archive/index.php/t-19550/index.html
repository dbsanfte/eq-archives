<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I went ahead and typed together some of my findings and some stuff other people found.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is all written from a perspective that is 'high end' today, but even casual gamers will be at the same point in an expansion or two.<br />
Also my data on pets is sketchy at best. If anyone has parses or other hard data contrary to my findings please post or link it.<br />
<br />
Pet Damage<br />
Our pet is a lot lower level then the Necromancer, magician and Beastlord pets. This is as it should be. However when the level difference between the pet and the MOBs we fight passes a certain level the damage output goes down more then the damage output of a Necromancer, Magician or Beastlord pet.<br />
At the same time these MOBs hit for more and more damage, to the point of being able to kill our pet in a single attack round, meaning the pet is no longer free damage and does not act as a speed bump via enrage either.<br />
The addition of these two problems leads to shaman pets being used less and less in higher level zones. GoD will bring us AA skills to improve our pets but they will not matter unless it is actually able to hit.<br />
<br />
DoT spells<br />
Shaman DoT efficiency has been marginally improved since Kunark in comparison to our then-closest competition, Necromancers. At the same time resist adjustments on other classes' DoTs have been lowered - no shaman DoT has this.<br />
Shaman poison (and the Bane line) DoT spells also produce outrageous aggro, making it difficult to cast them early without taking aggro. The disease DoT line on the other hand takes too long to run through to be of use in experience groups and does too few damage per tick to use up a valuable debuff slot on raids.<br />
Every other DoT class now has at least one low-resist fast-acting high damage DoT spell while shaman can choose between high aggro or low damage DoTs while still being burdened with mana inefficiency and high resists. GoD will bring us yet another disease DoT that might get some use while soloing. It is utterly useless both in groups and while raiding.<br />
<br />
Nukes<br />
Shaman nukes have gotten the least improvements of all classes' nuke lines. They cast the slowest, do the least damage per second and are the most mana inefficient of all casters. We are close to being outnuked by hybrids in long fights - in short fights this is already the case. Our rain spells are resisted just as much as all rain spells and are just as expensive, slow and inefficient as our other nukes. GoD brings us no nuke upgrades while every other caster class gets slight DPS upgrades to their main nuke line.<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
There are two perspectives for buffs, grouping and raiding, and there is two main functions that shaman buffs fulfill, HP buffs and buffs that make melee do more damage.<br />
In groups shaman are tied with rangers for the lowest amount of HPs we bring to a group. Stat buffs have gotten all useless with PoP, even in Luclin they were marginal. We can add about the same DPS to melees as an enchanter can, but at the price of a spell gem and at least ten times the mana.<br />
On raids Focus is a respectable buff and it is the only buff we add to a raid. Bih'li is a tiny amount of damage and barely worth the slot it takes up. Ferine Avatar can realistically be kept up on 4 melees while enchanters, rangers and bards have no problem buffing entire raids. Ferocity suffers from similar problems as Avatar but is clearly a better buff.<br />
Overall shaman buffs are overvalued by far - once stats are capped of all the classes that can buff HPs or melee damage we bring the least amount to a group. On raids shaman 'buffing' is reduced to MGBing Focus and casting Avatar on a couple of melees.<br />
GoD brings no new shaman buffs while giving other classes improvements to their buff lines.<br />
<br />
Heals<br />
The shaman incomplete heal is so bad I will refrain from discussing it here. That leaves us with Tnarg's and Quiescence. Quiescence, while mana efficient, has so low an impact it simply cannot be used for healing anymore. It can be used to patch up the odd nuke or riposte. If a cleric is in the group it gets even worse as it will probably get overwritten.Tnarg's Mending is a decent heal but it too does not keep up with the damage MOBs do today. Chaincasting Tnarg's may keep someone up long enough for a real heal to land or a tank to successfully taunt though.<br />
The comparison to other classes is sad. We are being outhealed by paladins and unlike Druids, Clerics and Beastlords we do not have any sort of MGBable heal.GoD will bring no remedy for shaman while giving more and bigger heals to other classes.<br />
<br />
Slow<br />
Shaman are using the slow they have been using in Kunark. Presumably slow was deemed too good already and not in need of further improvements. Other classes however have gotten better slows, to the point where shaman no longer clearly are the best slowers.<br />
Slow mitigation, apart from being implemented in a way that erodes the tiny advantage of the shaman's slow, devalues the shaman heals even further as they were balanced around being used in conjunction with a 75% slow. Even the lowest form of slow mitigation will cause the shaman to spend double the mana(and time) for heals.<br />
The situational slow we will get in GoD will not remedy this situation. At best it will be useful for MOBs that already die so fast that the extra slow of Turgur's does not make much of a difference. However these are the same MOBs where the use of slow is already questionable.<br />
<br />
Casting Time<br />
All of our damaging spells have high cast time. What for other classes is at worst a tick lost for medding is a lost cannibalize for a shaman. This artificially inflates the already higher cost of our spells even further.<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration<br />
Mana regeneration for all other classes has increased by a much higher percentage then shaman mana regenration has. Coupled with the increased mana pools this means that on many raids and even in a lot of grouping situations many casters find it hard to run out of mana, thus negating the once greatest strength of the shaman.<br />
The new GoD cannibalize is a step in the right direction, mainly by decreasing the time spent to generate mana and giving us time to actually spend it.<br />
<br />
Fight Time<br />
Fight time has decreased significantly. This by itself devalues slow, as it will mitigate a lower total percentage of the MOBs damage due to the time spent debuffing. It also means that disease DoTs are completely useless, even <br />
poison DoTs will often not run fully and in some cases makes it hard to land more more then a single nuke where other classes can fit two.<br />
<br />
Pieceing it all together<br />
The pet and buffing issues largely stands on it own and merely slightly worsens the shamans' situation. The other problems however affect and amplify each other. The nature of our active mana regeneration means that to compete with other classes we need to be able to spend time cannibalizing the mana we overpayed for our inefficient spells. Our higher cast times mean we have less time to do that and the generally increased mana regeneration means that we have to cast more spells to match what everyone else is doing, thus giving us even less time to cannibalize.<br />
When healing we have to make up for slow mitigation in addition to that and on top of that the shorter fight times mean that slow is less effective in the first place.<br />
The shaman's strength is in slow and steady fights and these fights have gotten rarer and rarer. Other classes seem to have been balanced to being close to match us in those long fights and as a results far outstrip us in all other situations.<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
The problems shaman are facing are hard to articulate and hard to even see from the outside because they are largely made up of small issues that tie into another. They do exist however and they will become larger and larger if itemisation and spell improvements continue as before.<br />
GoD does not seem to bring any improvements to the situation and so far we have not heard of any SOE representative. We can only continue to post, feedback, mail and email and hope we are heard. I truely hope that we will get more then half of a bone thrown our way some time soon and if we get that bone only that people will continue to complain. <br />
Shaman would have needed larger improvements then other classes in PoP and LDoN and instead we got less, just as we did in the last expansions and that is on top of not getting any new abilities and other classes infringing on our core abilities. Shaman are due some attention and I hope we get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The horse isn't dead because every one of those problems still exists.  And it won't BE dead until they are either fixed, or addressed by an SOE developer telling us why they wont be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FinlokVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would add a new problem called &quot;resist modifiers&quot; for our offensive spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well put together post.  I particularily like the point about cast times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our pet dps is like 14 - 20 dps, I melee for more..<br />
<br />
Pet aas will boost it like 5 dps doesn't matter, no one will buy them but retards, unless one of the new pet AAs lets my pet zonewide CH all PCs and lets him crap Furor's every 15 seconds to help do dps I'm never summoning pet ever again.</div></div><hr />
