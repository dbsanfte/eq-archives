<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, before you ask, I read the thread.  run 3, metab 3 at 60, level to 65, canni 5.<br />
<br />
So far so good.<br />
<br />
RC1, because people always get maloed.<br />
<br />
SCR 1, because casting focus less = win.<br />
<br />
VP 1, because I root split in LDoNs a lot and everyone here raves about it.<br />
<br />
I prefer to get 1 level of useful stuff then build up the stuff that I tend to use a lot.<br />
<br />
I don't solo.  My shaman has been recently converted from bot to main because (1) I have access to a 65 druid on a third account and a plate tank is easier to find than a cleric and (2) someone with the exact same play time/interest as I do has a 65 warrior main and hates casting.<br />
<br />
I usually LDoN, one a night, normal group is ranger/war/shm (me)/druid and 2 others, generally all 65.  I'll manage 2-3 a day on weekends.<br />
<br />
Guild does some simple raiding on weekend, 3 groups max, only other active shaman main is levelling a cleric for CH chain and their shaman is 58.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
What AA do I take next?  What am I going to get the best return on based on what I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you LDoN a lot, I highly suggest finishing off and getting VP3. It's a huge difference from VP1 and will really help you with those bad pulls. <br />
<br />
In fact, with VP3 (And Tigirs) I enjoy multi pulls rather than singles. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finish SCR up to SCRM.<br />
<br />
This will make you regain about as much HP after Quiescence (1800) as Canni5 takes off (1924).<br />
<br />
It will also make all your buffs last longer, which means less rebuffing tedium.<br />
<br />
I never did the first level of everything and I don't recommend it unless it's a new hotkey ability like RC1 or VP1, the passive ones are generally too small to notice, though many people recommend HG1 for the (very) occasional crit heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All suggestions assume that you get cann5 first.<br />
<br />
I highly recomment SCR3 and then SCRM.  That's 21 AAs but the payoff is the 6 tick torpor/Q and best of all, even your stat buffs will last an entire LDoN advent, maybe even two if you're really fast so you don't have to rebuff mid-advent.  If you're stuck healing, this will make Q much more effective.<br />
<br />
HG3/AHG3 is a good route if you're playing healer most of the time.  I find my heals crit often and the difference a crit makes can save you a second cast.  Again, if you're slowing and healing, you'll want to find all the mana savings you can.<br />
<br />
If you're not playing healer as much, go for ND3.  The extra HPs are very helpfull.<br />
<br />
I'm working through CA3/LR5 (I currently have LR1), and I've already seen the difference this skill makes, especially outside of PoP.  If you're slowing, healing, doting and rooting, you'll be building up all sorts of aggro and LR5 will help you survive it while spending minimal mana to save your own bacon.<br />
<br />
I don't know how effective SCM3, HA3/AHA3 and CS3/ID5 are yet, but I've flagged these as secondary goals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">VP3 is all that and more - get it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In fact, with VP3 (And Tigirs) I enjoy multi pulls rather than singles. lol.<br />
<br />
that what I enjoy about ldon most as well, provided its big pulls without a enchanter or bard. Good fun.</div></div><hr />
