<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted earlier on how I came very close to soloing the Fabled Baron in Sebilis and I speculated that the Fabled Duke would be of similar difficulty. Well, suffice to say it took six hours, but I'm now the proud owner of this:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82715<br />
<br />
The good news is that it's soloable by guildless, pre-VT folks although it's not an easy fight by any means! So, here's a quick rundown of what to do if you want one:<br />
<br />
Prerequisites:<br />
<br />
* VP 3 (lesser levels may work, but not checked)<br />
* Spirit Call AA (any level)<br />
* Spirit of the Leopard / Panther<br />
* Spiritual Channeling<br />
* Ancestral Aid is useful, but not necessary<br />
<br />
And now the walkthrough:<br />
<br />
* Head over to Old Sebilis and the bridge near the zoneout. Clear the trash beetles and frogs down to the pyramid.<br />
* Retrace your steps and head into the Disco. Your goal is to grab the ilis wizard on the podium, but don't hurt him. Head back to the pyramid door (with the wizard thumping you) and once you're there, DoT him. Move as close to the door as you can, spin round and VP the wizard through the door - he'll summon you through.<br />
* Clear down into the crypt (beware that a Fabled Caretaker can spawn down there - with luck there'll just be a ghoul frog that you can leave alone).<br />
* The first tricky part is the two cleric golem mobs - I VP'd one in a corner then meleed the other, with Leopard on both the pet and myself. They go down quickly and if you've got a stun proccing weapon or the Slam skill all the better.<br />
* There are four rooms off the Crypt, each with a named or placeholder skeleton. The nameds run, the Fableds and the placeholders don't (so if you're daring you can invis past the clerics and fight the mobs in their rooms).<br />
* The room you're after is labelled A on the EQAtlas map:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/sebilis1map.html<br />
<br />
* If the fabled mob is up, he'll rush you as soon as you step in the room. I always made sure I had Q, Focus, haste and Leopard on the wolf and Q on myself before going in, otherwise it would be messy. There are three possibilities:<br />
<br />
* Skeletal duke (common) - light blue at 70, hits in the 130s or so, summons, easy kill.<br />
* Arch Duke Latol (rare) - the normal Duke, hits in the 170s, easy kill, drops Ykesha club, snare whip or JBB.<br />
* The Fabled Arch Duke Latol (rare) - the Fabled mob. Triples for 827, mitigates slow to &quot;mostly&quot;, enrages and summons.<br />
<br />
Once you've got the Fabled Duke, the main thing is to get him slowed - Nihil landed first time, as did Turgur's when I tried. Then, while Q is still on you and the wolf, release the wolf pack and cast Leopard on them, pausing to heal the pet if needed (and reslowing with Turgur's would be a good idea too).<br />
My priority was to stay the hell away from Latol, leaving the wolf to tank. There's a strange feature of EQ in that healing pets is zero aggro, so just pop SC, keep Leopard and Q on the wolf as best you can and heal away.<br />
<br />
You'll need to keep an eye on Latol as he enrages at 10% - that'll be fatal to your wolf and it's how I wiped the first time to the Fabled Baron. The best strategy on enrage is to move up and tank the mob yourself, chain healing yourself while the wolf procs away from behind. With luck, 4 or 5 minutes after you started you'll have a shiny new Fabled JBB to play with!<br />
<br />
If you're feeling adventurous the Fabled Baron drops a Fabled Tash stick and the Fabled Harbinger drops Fabled knuckledusters (MNK/BST only). I've not seen a Fabled Hierophant yet, but I can guess what he'd drop! Strategy for the others is the same as for the Duke. Respawn is 30 minutes, FWIW.<br />
<br />
(As an addendum, an alternative strategy would have been to chain heal myself and tank - however, I tend to get stunned a lot and there are some snare/boil blood type spells cast as well. Without leopard it would be much harder as the pet wouldn't hold aggro at all.)<br />

OT... my guild did Fabled VS last night in KC, which was a really fun fight.  We had 40 some people, Time/qvic geared and it was a good challenge.  MT was 15k or so, and he said VS was hitting for 5k+ with a 3k lifetap.  Was quite a long fight.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately you have to pick the lock from both sides. I p/l'ed a rogue to use as a second pet, and the little red-haired, one-eyed rascal is a lot of fun to have along, especially when his serrated bone dirk procs engulfing darkness at the right time. :D<br />
<br />
The only drawbacks are that he smells like meat and he's always putting his hands on you.....leave your valuables at home.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, it's thanks to posts on the Crucible that I found out about the summoning trick! The golem on the top has two forms, placeholder (which doesn't summon) and a larger named one that does summon. Sadly the large one no longer fits through the door - if you try and VP him, he'll just bump against the door. That's why I mentioned the run to the ilis wizard, as that's the nearest other summoning mob I could think of (and the ilis is a PH for another Fabled which drops an FT3 robe FWIW).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be pretty easy. Leopard makes this a pretty easy fight. Granted I was two boxing when doing it but for the most part I just tap tanked and let pets with Leopard beat on them. The Hiero on the other hand is a lot worse and does almost double the damage.</div></div><hr />

Going to try and get me a fabled jbb tonight.  I run a Sham/Cleric/Bst and took out a close to the same fight it seems fabled in kc last night.  The only problem is trying to get the cleric through the door.  After summoning the shaman through and the bst.  The only way i can think of summoning the cleric is trying to nuke it down and hope it doesnt die before it summons me.  Or camp the bst and log the rogue in and hope i can get the rogue down there in one piece at 53 to unlock the door for her.</div></div><hr />

Rogue has sneak/hide why would that be a problem heh? I use a naked 55 rogue to pick the lock all the time. Then I kill my cleric and res his corpse in.<br />
<br />
As to the hiero he drops a nice fabled hierophants cloak (was good for my necro not my shaman with tha tattered). The cloak is on the necros magelo right now.<br />
<br />
IF you want to take out the hiero you'll need all 3 if yuo just want the jbb the beast and shaman can do it no problem.</div></div><hr />

Bring him down to the door root him anywhere and stand by the door.  Now take your gear off if you got heavy resists or just wait, he'll hopefully fear you through.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">*cry* I was in crypt for 13 hours yesterday...not ONE Fabled Heiro or Fabled Duke spawn.  We got several KDs and I dunno how many fabled Tash sticks (we equipped every alt/bot everyone had in the group, plus all the pets were dual weilding them).  Also watch out for the Fabled Crypt Caretaker...he roams through and can pop up on you unexpectedly at anytime.<br />
<br />
Nice guide though, Retron :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I was there yesterday for 10+ hours.  Every other fabled in crypt popped twice.. Latol only once.  I was in a full gruop for a while with a 14K pally. the fabled seemed trivial. <br />
Once the rest of the gruop left I decided to stay and try to get a cloak for myself. and maybe another JBB notice they are NOT lore.<br />
<br />
So the heirophant Grekal popps!  Me and dogdog had 18 minutes left on conviction.  he was a red con.. but I was delusional at this point having been there all day. dog dog didnt last one round and I got sumoned before I could land my 2nd attempt of slow. 2 rounds later I was back in PoK.  <br />
<br />
I am only lvl 66 and dont have a lot of the prerequisites listed (leopard, SC, AAid) but I figured what the heck! <br />
<br />
There is another way into crypt btw. But there needs to be a rez class on other side.  I zoned into seb and did a camp check. crypt was being camped. I sent a tell asking if there was a cleric in the gruop. I get a yep.  So I went down to the locked door and cannied till I died.. consent the tank.. he was able to drag me through the door with /corpse command. then I got rezzed and it was gravy.<br />
<br />
We killed Emp chottal too. it was kinda wild. the pally cast locate undead (or whatever) I assisted, sent Qed pet, (it went right through the locked door) then spammed back off it brang all his cronies we killed them.. then did same for emp.  it dropped a pretty darn nice 2 hander &quot;Fabled rod of lamentation&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just wish I wouldnt have messed with the heirophant and stayed with Latol because finding a necro to get body stunk. (dont own DoN yet)<br />
Anyway ty for posting this.. I would have never known about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So.<br />
I get fun out of trying things. what is worst that happened? I paid a necro to grab my body.  What was best that could happen? I would have gotten a cloak.<br />
It is a game. Yes some take it to an extreme.  But I would have not slept so easy that night had I not given it a go.  <br />
SO brohg.. go ahead and take delight in others failers. I would rather look at it a different way.</div></div><hr />
