<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I like the idea of instance zones, I don't like the current structure. I thought of a few things that might make them more desirable.<br />
<br />
1. Fix targeting in Sro. :)<br />
2. Remove minimum group level requirements, allow a 1 man to 6 man team<br />
3. Give us a button that lets us summon our corpse out of the zone, this way if anyone dies they don't have to wait untill mission is over to get a rez or worse if the mission is a complete failure you don't have to wait for the mission to end plus the 30 minutes.<br />
4. I'm not quite sure about this one, but maybe put a banker at wayfair camps for the poor melee's, we can gate somewere else but the melee's are stuck there a bit more then we are.<br />
5. Last but not least. Instead of medium and hard pick by difficulty number system 1-5. Three would be the current medium and 5 would be the current hard, 1 would be easy, particularly for solo and duo's removing many of the mobs  so pacifying mobs wouldn't be necessary and only need a minimum croud control is needed, possibly mobs that hit a bit softer(20-30%) and are less resistant to spells, a 2 would have the amount of mobs that a lvl 1 difficulty would have but the mobs would be as difficult as lvl 3 mobs, and 4  would be mobs that hit about 30-40% softer then hard mobs. Ranking would certainly be to scale 1 and 2 would not be very rewarding but at least an option for those nights when no one is around to group with, 4 would be a half way point in points between medium and hard.<br />
<br />
Just a thought..... don't shoot me down too hard. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah.  Quickest way to/from bank for any faction is currently Everfrost&gt;PoK.  Still a bit of a run, but only one zone to get through.  I wouldn't mind having the E Commons camp beefed up a little more.  A banker with Rushka, Buboe, and the other merchants is a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great list, just add the ability to pick adventure type and it would fix a lot of issues.</div></div><hr />

Magus &gt; Nedaria &gt; Abysmal Sea is closest to a bank, but yeah, a banker in ldon camp, or a magus to pok would be good</div></div><hr />

You have got to be kidding, this game has already been made way too easy as it is with travelling.  Oh boo hoo, poor melee's are stuck a zone or two away from a bank.  Hell, the PoK book is only a few min run from Butcher or Everfrost camps.  Heaven forbid someone actually take 5 mins to run anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya, it doesnt take long to get to abysmal from any of the wayfarer camps.</div></div><hr />

a banker at bb adventure might be good those top range aug removal thing can cost 4k with is quite a weight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note, do the boats even bother to make an appearance for formality's sake nowadays?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't seen or heard the boats in months now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I saw one of the boats in OOT a few weeks ago..windancer I think?  I just sat there, on the horizon, looking kinda sad.  I never minded riding the boats (though not being able to fish from them sucked) but I sure did hate waiting on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would like to see old zones like Permafrost and Sebilis made instanced apart from their normal state.<br />
<br />
Imagine you could do some easy quest to get a one use &quot;instance key&quot; for say Permafrost wich would give an LDON style adventure or raid in the orginal Permafrost zone with up to date mobs and loot tables.<br />
<br />
And at the same time good old permafrost is available as usual for those without the key.<br />
<br />
This would make new players a reason to explore the old high end places and give old players a reason to actually revisit their old hunting grounds...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As if there is any value to running through old world zones. Why would anyone in there right mind mandate travel time in many of these zones? If you want to &quot;immerse&quot; yourself and not utilize easier travel than that is your right, but you have no right to mandate that a significant percentage of everyone's play time should be spend uselessly running from point A to point B through areas that everything cons green in. I personally would rather be killing mobs or hell sitting in PoK building my alcohol tolerance rather than hitting autorun and taking a mandatory bio/refrig. break.<br />
<br />
BTW to fit your immersion policy, do you really think that a society with magic would not make traveling as easy as possible? Our society tries and we dont have magic (although I wish O'Hare has some stupid magic).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is value in exploring. In learning the maps. What they really need to do is add value to the old zones much like Vigdis said. (Fantastic idea by the way.)<br />
<br />
Do a quest to activate a key that changes the storylines of zones. For the keyholder...  Think for a minute what they could do. Or with a flag. You do it. And Boom. Things change and alternite spawn sets show up. <br />
<br />
The world could change by charecters actions yet Stay static for the next group of adventureres. <br />
<br />
It really is an amazing Idea. Take sleepers tomb. You are there when the sleeper is awakened. You get a flag So that the Tomb is defiled now.. And in certain zones things now change. But to others that have not done this the sleeper is still asleep. And the world is fine. <br />
<br />
Man. I sure wish they could do something like that. But I am sure they would screw it up and add timesinks and some stupid 4 minute wait before zoning into the Tomb B instance. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was never really bothered by the run from EC to FP to PoK. Especially now that they lowered the coin in the dungeons. Stuff just isnt that heavy now, cause you get less of it. <br />
<br />
I REALLY like the idea of instanced old world dungeons. We all have full detailed maps of places like Guk in our heads, would be nice to actually be able to use that info once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">time should really be instanced .. especially when oow raises the level cap and suddenly encounters become easier and time access becomes more widespread</div></div><hr />

Of course they would - everyone who HAD magical abilities anyway - just like in EQ. ;)<br />
<br />
For the record, I'm all for some travel time being required in the absence or teleportation magic. I think the game has been sped up too much as it is. The sad thing is that mudflation has all but mandated a faster progression rate, hence the travel options we all use today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until the handle the issue of mob respawns in instanced encounters, instancing time wont work.  With the Exploration model, you would incur lockouts so you couldnt do phase 2/3/4 one night and 5/quarm another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What, you can't run into North Freeport? Meh. We don't need bankers at Wayfarer Camps, people just need to be less lazy.<br />
<br />
I'd like the ability to select LDON adventure types, as someone mentioned above, and YES I want the ability to solo in a dungeon if I choose to. Having a 3-person limit is just annoying.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Since there are no roamers in Time they could simply leave an instance open once it has been activated. It would have to be done a little differently from regular instances of course. I've been giving this thought lately and IMO what might work would be to redo time as follows:<br />
<br />
1) have a lockout time after each phase as you do in an IK trial. So, if you complete phase 1, the lockout time becomes 12 hours. If you complete phase 2, it becomes 36 hours. If you complete phase 3, it becomes 3 days. 4 days for phase 4, 5 days for phase 5 and 6 days for phase 6.<br />
<br />
2) If you do not complete the phase before the timer is up you are booted out of the instance and get to retry when your lockout timer is up. This would allow guilds working on earlier phases for the first time to retry on a more frequent basis while still maintaining the flow of items into the game at roughly the same rate.<br />
<br />
3) If you want to put the timer on hold your raid leader could hail a NPC in timeA, which would suspend the instance. If you did this it would start a 1 hour timer that would prevent re-initialization of the instance.<br />
<br />
I think that if they did something like this they could fully instance time without adversely affecting the current flow of items into the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already been handled. They supposedly patch this live the last patch with it implimented in GoD's top end instanced raiding zone, Tacvi. Would have to go dig up the patch msg again to get the exact description but basically sounded like they could now track the respawn of mobs in instanced zones just like they would normal mobs and what ever mobs that should have respawned would be the only ones up when you got the expedition and there was never a lock out timer. When I read the description it was exactly what they would need for instancing time. Unfortunately they still haven't done that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My biggest beef with instanced zones is lengthy artificial &quot;lockout&quot; timers.  <br />
<br />
The lockout on Barxt for instance, is ridiculous.  A 3 day instead of a 5 day lockout would make far more sense and a reduction on Ikkinz raids would even be nice.  <br />
<br />
It isn't like you are going to be exploiting Uqua for loot even if it was on a 1 day timer.  A full run through will give up ~6 loots, whereas Time, with it's similar lockout/respawn, gives up ~40.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has already been handled with Tacvi, the lock out is on the mobs themselves not the zone anymore.  They just need to get off their asses and change the other GoD instanced zones and Time to be the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you saying that being forced to run through two zones with mobs 60 levels beneath you to get to a bank makes the game harder?<br />
<br />
You may be confusing &quot;hard&quot; with &quot;inconvenient&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't have any problem with making the game more convenient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you are looking for convenience, why not just be able to open a window and bank right from your character?  What about just being able to be ported right to any spot in a zone, right past any mobs that might give you a hard time?  Better yet, why not go to a magical zone that can zip you off to almost anywhere in the world??........oh wait a minute...<br />
<br />
Just compare banking today with banking at release using the proverbial &quot;troll stuck in Everfrost with mammoth tusks&quot; model:<br />
<br />
1.  At release you would have had to run EF&gt;Blackburrow&gt;QH&gt;WK&gt;NK&gt;SK&gt;LR&gt;RM&gt;Feerrott&gt;Oggok to sell and then drop off your plat in the bank.<br />
<br />
2.  Today you have to find the PoK stone which is marked on your map. :p</div></div><hr />
