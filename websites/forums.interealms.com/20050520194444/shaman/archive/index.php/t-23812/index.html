<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can see me hitting 65 reasonably soon. I have yet to get any level 65+ spells though. Would it be better to stay at 65 and work on AA until I start getting spells? Or work up on experience to 70 before getting AA? Someone suggested put 30% into experience and 70%AA until I start getting some spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Decide which is better for you and go 100% for it. getting 66 from 65 takes a VERY short time. But it also means you get a lot LESS AA per mob on the same mobs. <br />
<br />
Look at your goals. If your guild and goals are mostly luclin / starting a little into PoP. Then stay 65 and grind AA, AA are fun :) And you can get decent xp anywhere. But if your guild is hitting oow / god or upper pop then you need 70 for any advantages you can muster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like Khozik said, it really depends on your goals.  If you just want to become more powerful, do AAs up to CannV (you will need the mana) then never touch AA exp again until you hit 70.  In terms of raw power, levels &gt; all, especially considering how common spell drops are in OoW(they are at least as easy to obtain as ethereals (not spectrals or runes) were in PoP).  This will not only will you give you more hp/man/ac/etc., but you will also cause your spells to be resisted less.  Plus, being higher level will make it easier to get in to groups, and whether your soloing or grouping you are going to be doing it in tougher zones, which means better loot drops, which means better equipment for you, leading to even more power.<br />
<br />
However, there is something to be said for stopping at 65 (or even 60 for that matter) and just doing AAs.  For one, there is a lot of content out there for that level range, and thanks to OoW it will be a lot emptier than it used to be.  Also, AAs come pretty quickly, anywhere from 40 minutes to 4 hours, depending on what you are doing, which is a heck of a lot faster than you will gain levels from 66 on.  I'm only 66 so far (which reminds me I need to change my sig), but I've got friends who are 69, and having seen how long it took them to get there I can assure you that the path to 70 is very much a painfully long exp grind.  These people have been exping every available second since OoW came out, with the best equipment, in groups with other people with the best equipment, in the best exp zones in the game, and they still aren't 70 yet.  From what I've heard, the people that are 70 already either had some major PLing going on, or they just didn't sleep or leave their house for a few days.  So while getting level 70 may give you a significantly greater power increase than getting AAs, it will also take a lot longer to see an increase in power than it will with AAs.<br />
<br />
Ultimately though you should consider the people you play with.  If you are in a guild, obviously you need to consider your guildmates: if most are still in their 50s getting 70 is a bad idea, but if they are all racing to 70 you probably don't want to be left behind.  If you're not in a guild, but have friends you regularly exp with, same deal.  And if you are almost 65 and yet don't know anyone on your server all that well, figure out what kind of people you like to group with (where are you on the casual&lt;--&gt;uber spectrum) and decide based on that.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />

Well this isn't quite true.  As long as you are fighting mobs within 3 levels or so of your level it doesn't matter.  If by leveling you get out of that range then you take a experience hit.<br />
<br />
eg: LDON hard you will take a hit, vxed + you will not (or very small).</div></div><hr />
