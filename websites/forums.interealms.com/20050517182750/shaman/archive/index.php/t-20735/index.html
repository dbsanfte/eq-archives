<br />
One thing ya gotta say bout the devs, they do have a sense of humor.<br />
<br />
Deliriously Nimble anyone?<br />
<br />
But hey! It's not a Repetitive useless clicky.<br />
<br />
I may have missed this being posted/mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It matches the riotous health on the bp. I would say in my buffing history, I cast nimble a hell of a lot more than invigorate anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gloriana <br />
STAT BUFFS = WORTHLESS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not in the velious era they weren't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just copy'd/pasted what she has with her name, sorry, just being a smartass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would have loved having nimble on the boots back when I was wearing them. I used to use the sta click on the bp all the time. I NEVER used the invigorate on the boots.<br />
<br />
It's really only been since PoP that people started hitting the stat cap and rendering all stat buffs worthless. I bet the folks who are winning Velious boots right now still buff agi in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, the end of velious is when I started running into tanks who were max'd stats.  Luclin made it a larger issue, PoP made it very noticable, and LDoN let the casual gamer max their stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You had to be pretty well geared to max stats in Velious, but Luclin was different. Lotta bosses there drop nice stuff, and VT gear is just sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even when everyone was not at Stat caps our statistics buffs were next to useless.  Hours of parses were necessary to detect ANY increase in damage from STR and even then the increase was within the margin of error.<br />
<br />
I'll have to agree with Gloriana.  <br />
STAT BUFFS = WORTHLESS</div></div><hr />
