<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dryrott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well made afew from each zone but earth plane ... and wanted to know if others had ****ty luck on combine rate like me ... alot of people dont know how hard it is to get all the parts to make bow just to fail 3 times out of 4 ... i get all the great buffs i need and have my trusty grandmasters fletching knife too ... just some time failing alot on them pushes a fletcher to the breaking point :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe there was a post on this already. 50% Failure rate. In addition, buffs don't help your success rate, only skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like bad luck mostly. 3 of 4 failure rate isnt a very high sample pool.  You could easily go the other way on it and have 3 of 4 successes.  Anything with a trivial over 250 isnt going to be easy to make and will probably take a farm to make them consistently.</div></div><hr />

2 notes:  Max skill is 255.  so if you are 243 + Gm knife or 250+ GM knife you will have the same chance of success.  the second note is dex, int and wis only effect skill ups, not successes.  if you want skill ups get dex or wis as high as possible (it will take the highest one and use that)<br />
<br />
and 50% is just like the advanced cultural stuff in smithing and tailoring and fletching.  It's supposed to be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KaabaCloudberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Max skill is actually 252.  The last bits are used for other stuff like always succeeds etc.  240 + geerlock will give you the max skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They took away the fletching AA skill; chanter get jewlery why cant we have fletching back  FEW AA worth losing hrs of farming im sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamotracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You 100% positive it's 252?  The max skill attainable is 250, and modified skill to my best knowledge is 255.  I don't see why they would need to put the always succeeds flag at the end, it could easily be 0, or a different variable.  Also the estimated trivial for the BFT is guessed at about 270-275, it would seem that items have their own variables for trivials not restricted by 255. Anyhow gonna go see if I can get any more info from EQ traders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">About the 255 or 252 thing.  There will always be an arguement (I believe one dev said 255 and another 252 so seems like Sony's not even sure) about this.  However, basing the idea on potential flags, such as an always succeed flag, holds no water IMO, simply because if you look at success rates, and compare them at various skill levels and trivial levels, it becomes apparent that there are items that triv well over 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Last 2 bits are No-fail combine and no skill raise , so the max effective is 252, since you lose 3 to the 0 and 2 bits, respectively.</div></div><hr />
