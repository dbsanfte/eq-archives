Please stop the madness.<br />
<br />
If you think about posting a poll, hit yourself in the head with a ball peen hammer - after you do that, knock yourself out Scooter, they can't be any more brain damaged than the recent ones posted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think we need a poll to decide that type of thing Bubba.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Please BQ, just one more poll.  I swear I will vote on it ...<br />
<br />
Leave the spell alone.   <br />
<br />
No other options.<br />
<br />
No dissent posts allowed.  No empirical, theoretical, emotional anythings.  <br />
<br />
No more giving me headaches trying to follow the math.  At least on this poll.  I realize they are needed, are important and I appreciate the time and work it takes to do one of these calculations/parses.<br />
<br />
I would vote, and then I would add a small post saying I raid 5 nights a week in some form.  <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or do most shaman level 69+ raid at least 4 - 5 nights a week?  601 shaman serverwide, all level 69 or above, all with 6350 hps plus unbuffed.  I would say these guys are raiding a good portion of the time.  And panther is level 69 yes?<br />
<br />
I have no idea how leopard would fit into this equation, but it is level 61. Is it trivializing content at that level? Been to BoT lately?  Does it flipping matter when most of these shaman are working to level 70?  <br />
<br />
When the new expansion comes out in August, will this spell really be that powerful (after the pet nerf that is) ?  <br />

Stop touching my SoPanther. It's inappropriate, and it is a very, very bad touch. Michael Jackson gets a lawsuit for touching like that, Sony just gets yelled at.</div></div><hr />
