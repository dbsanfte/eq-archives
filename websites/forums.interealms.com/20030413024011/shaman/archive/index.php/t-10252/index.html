<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>A Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shaman's Crucible, this is my first post ever here, although I have been lurking around the boards for some time now. I need a bit of information regarding the obtaining the Child's Tear from PoF. I have done all of my epic up to this part. Now, my guild is rather small (usually less than 20 people on at any time) but I feel I can also get together some non-guild friends to help me with this. If I got a group together to go to Fear, it would probably look something like this:<br />
<br />
-60 Cleric<br />
-54 Cleric<br />
-61 Paladin<br />
-55 Warrior<br />
-59 Warrior<br />
-56 Shaman (Me)<br />
-55 Shaman<br />
-61 Enchanter<br />
-61 Shadowknight<br />
-62 Ranger<br />
-59 Ranger<br />
-56 Ranger<br />
-52 Bard<br />
-51 Cleric<br />
-53 Rogue<br />
- And I could most likely get others to join from my friend's guild's as well.<br />
<br />
I need an evaluation of this group. Is it too small? No way in hell could we get the Tear? One of the Cleric's seems to think so, said she went on an open raid to PoF and wiped with 5 groups... I wouldn't know how difficult it is because I haven't been to PoF yet. If this group isn't sufficient, what exactly would I need to make it so?<br />
<br />
One other thing I would like or a point in the right direction to find this, is information about how to break into fear, and how to make my way to the Golem mini-bosses. What should I watch out for in fear that would cause problems? I also heard that one has a larger agro radius in PoF the lower in level that they are, would having 51's and 52's with us pose any serious problems?<br />
<br />
 I need as much advice / input that I can get on this, Thanks You.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's a question of gear and AAs.  If your guild is in thurgadin quest or better stuff I'd say you can probably do it.  I would go for Terror (I think this is the one with the AE) with those numbers and levels, I think Dread's deathtouch would be too much.  however, the more people you can recruit (especially 58+) the better.  IIRC only dread and terror spawn the child.  <br />
<br />
On break, I would have only people 55+ zone in, invis'd, turn left (to face west) and run to the wall.  Kill anything and everything that comes at ya.  Once camp is secure bring the rest in.  <br />
<br />
http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/fearplane5.jpg is the best fear map I can find for this purpose, but I'm fairly sure they have the terror and fright temples backwards.  south of the amy temple and east of the fetid fiend house, there is a green lightsource in this map, it's actually an hourglass, but from the angle of this pic, it just kinda looks like a light.  I would clear to here and then pull Terror to this spot.  the Tentacle Terrors that guard this area use an AE dispel, and you will all most likely lose all of your buffs very quickly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Terror has a 400cold based AE that dispels one buff every time he uses it.  I believe it is resistable, Dread and Fright will randomly deathtouch your pullers, expect them to die a few times for no apparent reason.  (looking at your list again I highly recommend making a monk friend that can pull for you)  I pulled terror for a warrior trying to get an epic bit last month, and he warps back to his spawn once you run far enough away from him, so he is splittable without a monk, it's just an exploit.  We did him pretty easily with 2 groups, but we were mostly 60+ with some AAs.<br />
<br />
if you can think of anything else you need info about, please ask here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>A Spiritweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply Drinnar. I feel that the people I can get together have decent enough gear...but many don't have much AAXP work done with the exception of the 61 enchanter.<br />
<br />
You say to &quot;Kill anything and everything that comes at ya&quot; Once the break-in group zones in invised and heads to the west wall. Forgive my ignorance but mobs at the zone in don't see invis? Also once they hit the west wall, I was just wondering what you meant by &quot;everything that comes at ya&quot; Do they pull things to that spot to clear, or when they take off invis are they going to get agro from many mobs?<br />
<br />
 I think I can find a monk to split up the spawns at the temple, however, If for some reason I cannot, would the 61 shadowknight with feign death be able to split the spawns?<br />
<br />
 Again any feedback or advice is great appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If none of you have any idea what you are doing in fear, then it might be iffy.  The best way to get it IMO would be to tag along with a different raid.  If you and your friends wish to go to fear anyway, then you can apply what you pick up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some mobs do see through invis, some dont.  It depends on how lucky you are.  Alot of raids will send in a few feigners to scout for the raid.  Even doing this you arent guaranteed a clean break.<br />
<br />
Also, the little scarelings (or was it the turmoil toads?) can be a serious pain in the butt while you are trying to break.  They will phase the people they are attacking around the zone (not huge distances, always within sight), but this leads to more aggro from mobs farther out.<br />
<br />
Hrm, Iirc, the scarelings phase, and the toads fear?  or do i have that backwards?<br />
<br />
Hrm, we dont usually have a problem with any of the 3 demis, but the ae always cause a little more grief.  Alot of the people that attend the fear raid are lower level though, and take the ae hard.<br />
<br />
The demis are very, very magic resistant.  They hit strong, but not that bad.  Worst is the death touch which cycles every 20 or 30 seconds.  If  you can put out enough damage to take them down before to many people get death touched, you shouldnt have a problem.  Looking at the people you listed, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get some wizzies and druids - can AE break fear if you have a caster group.  Level 60's can break fear the easiest as there agro range is the least.  Get some peeps that have done Fear before to break it if possible.  <br />
<br />
The scarlings will warp you.  When it happens - STOP, STAND, DIE - if after about 30 seconds you don't have aggro THEN AND ONLY THEN do you head back to the fighting.  Trains are the quickest and fastest way to die in PoF and if you didn't read what I just posted then make some friends with Fear vets so they will come in and CR you and you'll need it.<br />
<br />
Some mobs will see through invis.  The usual problem is on the break where you have a wonderer at the portal that see's invis and then brings his buddies.  If you have a FDer go in and scout then the break team comes in they have 2 choices 1) Stand and Die, 2) /q - come back and see if they have aggro.  If the demi's are up and someone has aggro that has chained to them you will know it.  20k hp is the gift that lets you know right now your loved.  (Say my name Bitch!   Dread says FARRDAAR!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
I personaly think Fear is a lot of fun.  Many of my friends think I'm nuts ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hate that fricking zone.  With a passion.  Haven't been there in 2 yrs or so and don't plan on going back.  Had my epic once, don't need it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ticktockman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd recommend a 2nd enchanter, 55+, to help with the break.  3 enchanters will make it a cinch.  <br />
<br />
Zone in, turn left, move to west wall by the crooked tree.  If you get aggro from a see invis mob, bring it.  They'll be coming anyway. However, if you get feared, stand and die.  You don't want to bring anything to west wall that didn't come from the portal area or points in between.<br />
<br />
Highest level enchanter faces the portal and mezzes mobs coming from that direction.  2nd highest level ench covers north.  3rd ench/bard/necro covers south.   Main tank calls targets and everyone assists.  <br />
<br />
Best bet with the above group makeup is to head north and go for Terror.  We use a ranger to pull Fear; I find they get DT'd far less than monks do.  Of course, they also bring more mobs in at once, so you must be prepared to deal with a train.  Group a CotH mage with your monk and he may live longer.<br />
<br />
Buff cold resists for Terror.  He's not hard, but have the ench ready to charm/mez his 2 amy knight buddies.  If you can get some wizards to come you might give Dread and Fright a try; you need decent damage for them or the DT will do you in.  Chances are good that the iksar child will spawn.  <br />
<br />
Make sure any friends you invite can pay attention and listen to orders.  Pick up Fear raids are recipes for disaster.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
