<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was reading the priests covenant and i read how all the clerics put canny down as an excuse for our lack of healing and whatnot ( i know this has been brought up ALOT but eh..) and i was thinking to myself canny 5 is awsome and i can keep my mana up, BUT it does 1924 dmg and that may not be to much just sitting around.  but i'm not exactly gonna do that in some higher PoP zones and GoD when i'm getting aggro from my dots. just seems to me that in all the posts i read everyone is using it against us but seem to forget that it cant be cast in all situations and has its limitations especially with the dot aggro as it stands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you will see that you can cast canni 5 even in bad situations ;)<br />
<br />
I did it while tanking a mini in BoT ( I was the main tank :p and needed the extra mana to keep me alive and finish the beez in lightning. Was really short, but a lot of fun to do :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tindaorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i know you can cast when needed , but like i said its not always the smartest thing to do..all i'm pointing out is that people use use canny as a reason to hold shamans down dont seem to notice we actually get hurt from it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thing that got a laugh out of me was someone who said:<br />

&quot;high end shaman have nearly twice the mana regen with little effort compared to the other priests - and more like 3-4 times the mana regen if they apply themselves to it.'<br />
<br />
I want some of what he is smoking.<br />
<br />
We are already balanced AROUND this with the horrible cost of our spells.  Cani just makes it so we come out even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excusing our craptastic healing with that we have Can is retarded. Bottom line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Canni5 is nice.<br />
<br />
Canni4 is a LIABILITY, not a benefit of the class. I have absolutely zero time available to use this except during downtime. People who don't play a shaman simply can't understand this. I'll be so glad when the new canni comes out, cause I should be able to find time to squeeze that in. Currently, sacrificing 5 and a half seconds for 82 mana is something I just can't afford.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But, but with Canni we can med back from OOM to FM faster than anyone else. Oh wait, that doesn't help **** - as we have to wait for cleric/druid after a wipe anyway  :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
Sure Canni is still a nice ability, but it was already balanced for slow content. With faster and faster content and less time to use canni (except canni 5) effectively, canni becomes more of a burden than an advantage.<br />
<br />
One of the several basic trends with actual content, some developers seem to be completely blind for. Thanks for Ancient Canni btw /sarcasm off.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Griz, wont let me bump you again, but this statement is PURE &quot;Hammer, meet Nail, Nail, this is Hammer&quot;. I am considering just nuking Canni 4 from my spell lists, thats how useless I feel its getting. I mean, at its &quot;time&quot; in the progression, its very nice, but at this point, I am over 7200 hps and 6500 mana. I do not think I could kill myself with Canni 4 if I chain casted it for an hour straight.  <br />
<br />
I hope the OoW Canni is readily available. Heck at this point, it almsot should be as beefy as Canni 5, honeslty. Canni 5 needs to be upward adjusted as well (can you say OoW AA anyone?). These spells need to be more reflective of the curent state of the game. But, I guess thats our WHOLE problem in a nutshell, isnt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">can4 should be bumped to like 1k hp for 425 mana or whatever the % normally is and change can5 to the suggestion i saw a few weeks ago to 70% max hp to XX mana again keeping with the normal ratio that i cant think of right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they gave us canni 4 as a hotkeyed ability like canni 5, but made it insta cast with a 10 sec refresh or something, it would be a hell of a lot more useful than it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grizlor, I get the impression that this is precisely the direction SOE is going with the higher level Cannis. For example, Pained Memory ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5403&amp;source=Live') (SHM 68) gives 360 mana for 668 hps but has a recast time of 18 secs. Definitely a move in the right direction in my opnion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The new canni is less efficient than canni4/5, but I welcome it with open arms for its convenience. I find it funny that necros go into a frenzy whenever someone starts a rumor that lich isnt subject to the 2/3 PVP reduction on test, but we're all &quot;oh, this is less efficient and I LIKE it!&quot; :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If they gave us canni 4 as a hotkeyed ability like canni 5, but made it insta cast with a 10 sec refresh or something, it would be a hell of a lot more useful than it is now.<br />
Well, the ONLY reason this is true is because it would free up a spell gem for 99.9% of the level 65 shaman playing this game. Spell slots are worth FAR FAR more than a stupid 100 mana for 150 hp exchnge (not a number guy, could care less what it actually is)<br />
<br />
Again, its my hope that SOE recognizes the uselessness of Canni 4, and makes the &quot;newer&quot; cannis, i.e. the Gates one and the OoW one fairly available to those who are &quot;qualified&quot; to get them, and by that I mean that a lvl 62 shaman with less than &quot;Bazaar Best&quot; gear wouldnt be able to be effective in that area. However, the &quot;average&quot; lvl 65 Shaman with medium Bazaar (i.e. not FULL Ornate and Aged Mystic boots etc, but getting there) with a couple dpzen AAs can gather a solid group and have a chance to score. <br />
<br />
This, in a nutshell, is one of the BIGGEST shortcomings of the current EQ. There are different levels of &quot;what I WANT, not what I NEED&quot; in this game now, and the difference between them is HUGE. Cutting edge shaman need a 2K heal. Pre-EP can certainly get by with 1600. Top-top end Shaman need a fast slow with a -65 modifier (JUST so its &quot;enough&quot; for desireabillity at that level) but your Typical BoT-PoE shaman really doesnt. <br />
<br />
So, once again, I will jump on my &quot;Using AA as a Form of Balance&quot; bandwagon. Lets create a new Canni, a new Heal, a new fast nuke, a better resist debuff tied to slow, new buffs that matter, reduced aggro, etc etc etc (did I forget anything?), but . . .<br />
<br />
. . . BUT lets tie them to AA!! Not to spells that drop in zones only 10% of the EQ population will see in the next 6 months. Not in gear that you cannot obtain unless you are in a &quot;Top 5&quot; raiding guild, but . . .<br />
<br />
. . . BUT Lets tie these abilities to AA. Something ANYONE can get with some dedicated time. Want a better heal? 30 AA please. Better Nuke? Thats a different 30. Canni 5 upgrade? Cool, hows 10-20-30 grab you. You got the HPs now, spend the points, PUT IN THE TIME!<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, I know all the anti-arguements. Heres a couple examples, and my responses, before you start in on me ok?:<br />
<br />
Heres the most common I see from Raiders:<br />
&quot;Raiders dont get as much pure-XP time as non-raiders&quot;<br />
Tough. Raiders have access to MUCH better loot. Raiders can make up HUGE variances in this type of ability with a couple K extra HPs and Mana, not to mention incredible foci that just arent available to the common man. If the Raid level player has the time to dedicate to this type of AA ability list IN ADDITION to his raid responsibilities, then why SHOULDNT he be &quot;that much&quot; better than other members of his class? Lets keep ONE THING in persepective here. Time spent in EQ is what translates into advancement, no matter what level you wish to play. If you do not want to raid, you have to spend time camping pp loot, wearable items, LDoN, etc etc. If you want Raid loot, well most guilds dont just hand that stuff out. You gotta put your hours in raiding. <br />
<br />
Next arguement:<br />
&quot;The rich get richer&quot;<br />
They should. Thats the game. Time spent is one thing, time spent productively is another. I can sit in the Bazaar on my character and make about 1K an hour on average, just selling stuff I tend to loot/win like LDoN drops, research materials, tradeskill materials, etc. However, I am hardly advancing my character that way. Pumping my time into AA is another story though. Heck, combining the 2 is even better. Skipp the greenies for TS and cash loot drops, and focus on areas where you can get reasonabl XP towards UPGRADES and reasopnable loot/pp towards UPGRADES. What is LDoN again? Oh yeah, a DKP system for EVERYONE. <br />
<br />
Remember this as well. The average Non-raider probably has a larger percentage of his online time available for &quot;straight XP&quot; compared to the average &quot;Raider&quot;. Wouldnt this balance things out somewhat?<br />
<br />
What else we got. Oh yeah, heres an oldie but a goodie:<br />
&quot;Advancement should not be tied to AA abilities&quot;<br />
Wake up. It already is. Period. Lets just take it one step further at this point. Lets STOP using GEAR as the ONLY ladder to a &quot;comptitivly advanced&quot; character, and use something that SOE actually WANTS to see, &quot;Time In Game&quot; as a form of advancement. No keys, no flags. Linear progression based on dedicated time spent. <br />
<br />
Let me ask you this. If they said RIGHT NOW you could get Balance of Nihil for 30 aa, would you save the points for it? I bet the answer varies. The variance is between those who will &quot;probably have a shot&quot; based on their current station in the game, and those who &quot;probably would have to wait a WHILE&quot; based on the same thing. Herin lies the problem. If something like this were available to EVERYONE (albeit taking time to achieve) then isnt that better than the common &quot;I cant get that focus, that 200 hp/mana, that spell&quot; thing we see every  day? And isnt it better for the Raid level guys who alraeady have access to &quot;upper level&quot; stuff to have to establish NEW goals they would BE FORCED to committ time too in order to advance, instead of &quot;show up, bid, loot your Chronoburn Focus, thx&quot;? <br />
<br />
Hammer away. I am firmly committeded to this. I think its the BEST possible solution considering the current state of the game. Is this the direction I would choose if the game was new? Probably not, at least not to this degree. But RIGHT NOW, after 5 years of insane mudflation and a MASSIVE seperation of the player base that is hurting the game overall, I think its the most viable answer.</div></div><hr />

Not by much. Canni IV at level 60 is 82 mana for 148 hit points which is about a 55.4% ratio. Compared to Pained Memory (360 mana for 668 hps), which is 53.8%, it means you lose about 10 mana all up. I agree with you when I say it certainly doesn't bother me.<br />
<br />
Edit: Cannibalization ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2749&amp;source=Live') (1066 mana for 1924 hit points) has the same ratio as Canni IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">how about progression tied AAs? you can gain abilities by beating content? /duck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd have no issues with that 8). BTW I gain so much AA exp on daily qvic raids. thats kind of content related AA's. *wink*<br />
&lt;3 griz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really like the idea of a % based Canni.  For instance, Take 90% of what ever HP you have left and give you 50% of those HP's as mana.  I would pay 20 AA's for that.  What would you guys be willing to give for an AA like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think a much better argument would be that no matter how much mana we get, we don't have the right spells available to spend it on.  Doesn't matter how much mana you have, if you chain cast Velium Strike, your DPS is still going to be sub par at best.<br />
<br />
Canni V is an absolute good.  If I was another class, I'd be jealous too.  But Clerics can't have Canni, because they have CH, and that'd be imbalancing, since they could keep people alive indefinitely!  Sony isn't worried about an endless Tnarg's chain from a infinite mana Shaman, because that won't keep anybody alive in later end zones.<br />
<br />
So yes, we have canni, whoop de friggin doo, doesn't make me any better of a healer, nuker, etc.  Also, let's not forget that a lot of our spells have slightly higher mana costs to compensate for our ability to canni, something that boggles my mind personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe I'm just numb at this point but canni4 doesn't bother me.  Granted I hardly ever press it anymore...</div></div><hr />
