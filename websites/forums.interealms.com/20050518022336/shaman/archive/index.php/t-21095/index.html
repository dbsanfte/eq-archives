<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The day a casual player will see this will be the day i have a tea party with santa at the easter rabbit's place, far as i care it can be a 100% slow that deals 30,000 Ddamage on cast for 1mana, im prolly never gonna see it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say it is all moot, since most of upper GoD content is flagged slow immune or heavily mitigates, no?  Finally got an upgraded slow, so the devs will have more to back up their claim, &quot;but shaman have slow!&quot;  THe other issue is the resist adj is still low.<br />
<br />
I think this change will hurt more than help, and much like the heal over time upgrade, they probably gave it to shaman because it doesn't really do anything to game balance at all.<br />
<br />
The silver lining?  At least now balance of the nihli isn't a situational &quot;upgrade.&quot;  Once you get it, there really won't be a reason to use turgurs that I can see (except when you have 2 slows up to slow multiples or for long duration fights).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I completely enjoy having 2 slows up for when we are pulling in massive amount of mobs (did a normal LDoN where I decided to see if the prone body was a pet, hit it and spawned out 3 mobs as the puller arrived with 3 on him, slowed everything in camp before the enchie got off a 3rd mez).<br />
<br />
  But yeah, if it becomes 75% I don't think it is highly likely I bother having Turgur up anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very nice. The spell went from being situationally equivalent to an upgrade.  No reason to use turgurs once you have this thing other than long fights.  Bravo, now just make Avatar a group buff and ill be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">very nice upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks to me like you could just slap a turgurs on afterward if you want the longer lasting slow.  I'm not at all sure if i would take turgurs out in an enormous amount of the content I find myself doing.  <br />
<br />
Actually, it looks like if I even get this spell, it might mean often losing a spell slot, since slow will take two slots instead of one.  Not complaining, though.  <br />
<br />
Just means I'll have to choose very carefully as i move from what is usually two free slots to one free slot.  Avatar might find itself an even more resented spell than before.  Wouldn't want to have zero slots for DPS in the content I usually find myself in.  And often I can put out a lot more DPS with rains than I can by passing out a couple of avatars.<br />
<br />
Now maybe if they made avatar mem faster and a group spell...so I could just un-mem it quickly like other spells and swap something in its place...</div></div><hr />

I really hope to see this go live.  It would certainly be what we've been asking for as far as updates to Nih'li.  What I've been asking for, at least.  A better resist adjust and a 75% slow...with the same short cast time?  Where do I sign?<br />
<br />
Now...if I can just get my hands on it somehow...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Very nice. I would still want the full Turgur's duration but that version of Balance of the Nihil is good enough that I won't be loosing any sleep over it. :) <br />
<br />
I do hope the development team is working on more changes. A decent slow will not help us with our main problem of contributing on short-lived slow-mitigating MOBs.<br />
<br />
Still, one issue to scratch from my list. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well nice to see this spell changed to what it should have been in the first place.<br />
Not gunna sing hallelujah until these real issues are addressed:<br />
<br />
-The ability to function as a secondary healer<br />
<br />
-The impact of shorter fights on DoTs spells and Slow<br />
<br />
-The increased number of slow mitigating NPCs in some areas of Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good point, Griz...  Just feels like a horribly long time to be looking at a greyed out button when you want to slow something else. ;)<br />
<br />
I still don't get why people say casual gamers can't get this spell.  I'm pretty darn casual, and I have it.  Have I died a fair bit in the sewers?  You betcha.  It was worth it (and challenging and fun), though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As positive as this is, simply because it is not a negative change, I still feel the resist mod on Nihil is lacking. <br />
I know that 80% of the level 65 Shamans are missing this spell, so I will not assume the majority understands my issues, but I'd rather have a -75 MR, 50% Slow than a -40, 75%.<br />
<br />
I am not bitching, I am not asking for a 75% Slow WITH a -75 check. -40 just isn't enough, 75% or not and I'd be willing to give up a few % for a better resist check.<br />
<br />
In case somebody pops into this thread saying that I am never happy(You know who you are), I can just reply that if you do a search, you will see that I have been asking for this since the very first day of the GoD beta. When they changed the spell from 55% to 60%, I was asking for a downgrade in effectiveness in trade of a better resist check.<br />
<br />
Still, a good change, let's hope more are coming.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Vxed is where the spells are... throw together your basic charm group... <br />
<br />
Yourself (huzzah for Malosinia)<br />
warrior<br />
druid/cleric<br />
paladin (if you use a druid to heal instead of a cleric, the stuns are money) or Ranger (snare yay)<br />
Enchanter<br />
Miscellaneous slot. I like Bard or Paladin if you don't alredy have either.<br />
<br />
*** Important*** Buy mage kits, and keep FA on the pet. usually it can pull in excess of 2k damage per second with this configuration.<br />
If you're really looking to spend some time there, invest in a pair of Adamantite Band (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=10151)s and some Rusty Spiked Shoulderpads (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=2310) to give to the pet to further reduce its Magic Resistance. You can always kill the pet later and get them back ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
I also want to point out that druids CAN charm in this zone, but finding a level 60 hynid for them to use can be tough. Druids have an animal only tash which is quality. if you're short on an enchanter a druid might work instead for the charmpet, but it will be harder to control it.<br />
<br />
Umbiki and Chavoor are 2 named that spawn relatively close to the zonein. if you go right at the first fork, you hit a left hand corner. keep going and there is a right turn, umbiki pops right around there. A little further along there is an alcove off to the side, that is where chavoor pops. With a charm group you can easily keep both PHs down, plus it's close enough that you can clear back to zone and run twinks in to get rotting loot.<br />
<br />
Umbiki hits for uh... 1700 to 1800ish, and chavoor is in the same neighborhood I'm pretty sure you can stun both of them, which is why a paladin is quality. with the pet doing 2kdps, the named won't live more than 20 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
I got my copy of Balance off of Umbiki. Another shaman in my guild got Daluda off Chavoor.</div></div><hr />

Give it up and be happy for once, this is a good thing. Bitch about something else now is all.<br />
<br />
BTW, this spell can easily be gotten with any decent sub elemental group. This doesnt drop in a level of GoD where you need 2 clerics and a defensive warrior. If you dont have this spell, its simply cause your not trying hard enough to get it.<br />

You know this has to be the topper whine. As this thread started the questions/comments mentioned having to keep both loaded. Nih for the first slow and backed up by Turgur's for longer duration. It has degraded into the standard whines about difficulty to get, rarity of drops, yada, yada.<br />
<br />
Those I can deal with ... but for a Time equipped shaman to complain that their gear is obsoleted because a spell was changed that benefits the entire class is just too friggen much. Folks need to get a grip. Your Time gear is not obsoleted - just changed. First, if you are in situation where you are not having problems landing Turgur's ... keep using what you have. If you are in a situation where Nih resist checks helps you land that first slow faster, use it and follow up with Turgur's for the longer duration. If you are like most of us and also do those LDoN's or PoP/GoD content where slows are mitigated to hell and back, use either - or don't, since mobs drop so fast casting slow is something we do to feel useful.<br />
<br />
Yes, the spell is a pain to get. But it is normal EQ pain. Lots of killing on the off chance the spell will drop. It is not like we haven't been doing that for the last 5 years anyway.<br />
<br />
The spell was improved to make it an actual upgrade to Turgur's. See the countless threads where this is the &quot;big biotch&quot; about slow ... our class defining spell was level 51 from the Kunark era. This is an improvement. Yes ... given the state of the game ... too little, too late is easy to argue ... but, jeeze, folks, that argument is about other, much more significant problems than &quot;hard to get this spell&quot; or it &quot;obsoletes my Time gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wonder where anyone not playing a shaman can pop off and laugh at our whining? Take a look at our whining at times.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have this spell. Took me about a month of off/on farming sewers with a single group. Couple nights a week we farmed. Group is not Ele or Time or even Ornate geared. During this time 2 spells dropped ... shaman that is ... others dropped as well and all in our normal group finally got their first tier GoD spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">This upgrade would be nice, but I almost hope we don't get it.  The problem is that it does not address any of the issues that shamans face in GoD.  According to Rytan on the EQLive message boards (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=development&amp;message.id=345#M345), shamans face three main problems in GoD:<br />
<br />
-The ability to function as a secondary healer<br />
<br />
-The impact of shorter fights on DoTs spells and Slow<br />
<br />
-The increased number of slow mitigating NPCs in some areas of Gates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which of these problems is this upgrade meant to address?  It certaintly doesn't affect our ability as a secondary healer, and we have shown that slow percentage differences of 5-15% matter very little in slow mitigating content.  I can only assume that this is meant to allow us to slow earlier in the fight, but what it fails to address is the fact that if we slow on incoming or immediately after the mob enters the camp, we will get aggro and get killed.<br />
<br />
As much as I believe this upgrade is a good (and probably necessary) one, I'd absolutely hate to see another situation where devs believe that they have &quot;solved&quot; our problems like they did with the healing upgrades we got.  This change is nothing more than a distraction from the major problems that shamans have in GoD, and they have yet to come close to addressing the root causes of our problems.</div></div><hr />

You answered your own question, budro ;)<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a nice spell. It's like it SHOULD HAVE BEEN in the first place. It's not an upgrade, it's a bug fix, is how I see it.<br />
<br />

I dont need or want to do it all, i just want a niche and to be honest, moding our buffs with strike through or maybe cleave or something to that extent would be a better route. Also modding our debuffs a lil better, like a upgrade to cripple maybe, with some proc supressing agent. Dont know if this can be coded in, but i know it would be cool =)<br />

That would be me Giac, I'm sure, and yes, you are never happy ;)<br />
<br />
However in this case I agree with you. I've allways seen the spell as more for situational use when you need to get something slowed quickly and dependably. For that sort of application the resist check and fast casting time are more important than the other parameters. It's still a situational spell in the new form of course, the recast time and duration see to that. The increase in the magnitude of the slow is nice, but like you I'd have rather have seen an improvement in the resist check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that has always pissed me off about it, was when I'm in a group and a beast will overwrite it. It's embarrassing to be the &quot;best slowing class in game&quot; and having your Level 65 spell overwritten. So this change, if it goes to Live, just makes this spell the way it should have been in the first place. I always have 2 slows up for LDoN anyways (multipulls) but I RARELY have to recast on this one even with the duration of Nihil...fights are fast and furious and now with the cycle function, slowing an entire room in Tak is fun, efficient, and hopefully soon - minus the added aggrevation of being overwritten.<br />
<br />
Sure, we'd all like it to be higher -resist, but I'd rather the change they are doing, then more -resist. Even in Hard LDoNs and GoD, I rarely get a resist and that folks is what makes me happy.<br />
<br />
SOE...take this to Live...and give more of a thought to making the duration longer. How about 2.5 mins?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I /agree, Mixel. Apologies on that. After reading all the above before you posted I jumped the gun and critiqued your comment out of context. In context, your comment didn't need my attack. <br />
<br />
My reaction (over reaction?) stems from the fact it bothers me folks are down on this as an improvement. It is - it is an improvement to our slow line. It doesn't fix us and it doesn't address GoD problems in the least ... but it does help in other areas. To put it simply, for what it has been changed to, this is now a viable spell.<br />
<br />
As for bst slow overwriting ... this is kinda mixed blessing/curse. If it is flagged to not be overwritten by lower level or other class spells then those encounters folks are using Nih to pre-slow and following up with Turgur's for the longer duration fights will get bit in the butt when Turgur's won't land because Nih is still active. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nihil http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Test<br />

They are both 6 second recast so unless you had a second slow memed with turgurs things shouldn't change.<br />
<br />
As far as it hurting TA, yeah it does some but I'd still love to get a TA and still probably would never replace it. Clicky has no recast time and unless they extend the duration on nihil your still going to situationally want to overwrite it with turgurs for the duration. Clicky makes the perfect option for something situationally used like turgurs would be.<br />
<br />
I will agree that some change needs to be made in spells. They either need to be made tradable or increase the drop rate. For something that is a completely random drop for any of the classes, including melees, it's drop rate is far to low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, TA will still be useful on multiple slows because a 3sec cast unaffected by a recast on the second incomming mob after the first is slowed with Nihil just makes us a faster, more well rounded slower.<br />
<br />
And to anyone who would say it isn't hard to get, please realize that item rarity can differ from server to server and to the best of my knowledge, it is not a common spell on Bertoxx at this time. I just got mine off of Umbiki after many flagging and farming sessions and no other shaman in my guild has it yet(/comfort Otani). I'll start asking around who has this spell from the other higher end guilds on Bertoxx but since only one other shaman in my guild has Daluda's, I can not help but to be thinking it is a bit more than just, 'going out and getting it.' No offense to any that have posted to the contrary.<br />

(we aren't casual gamers, so that arguement wouldn't apply either. Quarm/Ikkinz farming atm with 3 of the top 5 shaman on Bertoxx sorted by hp's on EQrankings.com.)<br />

-75mr 50% slow should be preferable to -40mr 75% slow.<br />
<br />
I thought the whole point of the spell is being able to land it fast, without having to prep with malos. Quickly bring down mob dps to manageable levels, and then apply turgurs if it is still worth it.<br />
<br />
Given how fast the fights are over in GoD, I'd think it better to land an early slow for medium % than a late slow for high %.<br />
<br />
Like has already been mentioned, this is probably the best way to upgrade us while not really changing our impact on the game, and it still allows SOE to say 'look we gave you an upgrade, now quiet down'.</div></div><hr />

This in itself is a bit ironic, but the big irony is that Verant still withhold class defining abilites from the general player and reserve them for the hardcore player by their timesinks, in this case the drop rate.<br />

If you talking single group content (or anything a single cleric can heal on) here neither will be worth it. Even if you completely ignore aggro it will only barely be worth casting the spell.<br />
<br />
Very rough numbers:<br />
(assuming a 20 second fight, 600 DPS)<br />
<br />
malos+turgur's lands after say 9 seconds, gets mitigated down to 50ish %. Damage prevented: 3300, call it 3K with resists. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 2800ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 5800ish.<br />
<br />
malos on incoming+turgur's lands after 5 seconds to avoid aggro, gets mitigated down to 50ish %. Damage prevented: 4500, say 4K with resists. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 2800ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 5800ish.<br />
<br />
malos+turgur's clickie: lands after 7 seconds, gets mitigated down to 50ish %. Damage prevented: 3900, a little less with resists. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 1700ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 3500ish.<br />
<br />
malos on incoming+turgur's clickie: lands after 3 seconds, gets mitigated down to 50ish %. Damage prevented: 5Kish. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 1700ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 3500ish.<br />
<br />
50% neg 75 slow: casting it so it lands after 5 seconds to avoid aggro, mitigated down to 33%, damage prevented: 3K, assuming no resists. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 1300ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 2700ish.<br />
<br />
50% neg 75 slow: casting it so it lands after 2 seconds, mitigated down to 33%, damage prevented: 3.6K, assuming no resists. Damage healable with Daluda's for the same mana: 1300ish. Damage healable by a cleric for 3/4 of the mana: 2700ish.<br />
<br />
Conclusions:<br />
Neither spell is better then using TA+malos. A 50% slow that gets mitigated is only useful because it costs less mana - the prevented damage is just as unimpressive as malos+turgur's. A second cleric is still preferable seeing as the prevented damage is pretty similar just assuming the cleric blindly CHs and the shaman finds time to cannibalize.<br />
<br />
If slow is to be useful in GoD we either need a neg 60 resist adjustment 75% slow with a 1 second cast and low aggro (say, no counters at all). Or fights need to last longer.<br />
<br />
I would prefer the second option myself.</div></div><hr />

I think the only REAL whine that TA shaman can have is that they lose that spell-slot they gained when they got clicky slow. BoN was situational in its current form, especially if you have clicky. But now, it seems to be a perma-mem, like Turgurs was. <br />
<br />
/Shrug, honestly, I dont even think the Time shaman will whine about it. Its an upgrade, and its proof that the devs are at LEAST looking at us. The fact that this fix does nothing to address the 3 issues Ryl pointed out is actually a positve thing.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I do not totally agree with you Murtak. Sometimes you do not have the time to malos and click your TA, a mob in camp may rape all healer / casters before you could land slow, not really usefull. You see this situation regulary, not only in high end game.<br />
<br />
Afaik, Malos + tash + TA = ****ty in Uqua as well. Mobs are ****ing resistant making TA a secondary slow if Nihil fails. Malos + Nihil in some situation is the best combo by far, and sometimes Nihil alone is far better that than TA wich is slooooooooooow to cast AND land (3sec is slow, not counting the number of resist on it, not counting the aggro you generate on retries, not counting the heal you might have done instead of casting smelly turgur). In single roup Ikkinz trials, it s the same, when adds, you DO NOT have the time to malos or click your TA, especially if a Yellow Kyv pop. Everyone must be aware, quick and none dies.<br />
<br />
Even with 60%, Nihil is my 1st slow in Uqua, in case of adds (any zone), on any slowable bosses if the warrior doesnt disc furious. Making the slow 75% is nice, but wont change my style of play at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">All a 75% Nihil does is totally replace Turgurs in GoD type encounters, with a -40mr check.

<br />

<br />
The problem with Nihil atm is that the range of mobs it makes a difference on is as good as non existant in GoD. If Nihil lands, Turgur's would have landed with a probability of 99% as well. If Turgur's was resisted, you would have probably been resisted with Nihil as well. -40 is not enough.<br />
I remember how there used to be mobs that wouldn't slow in 10 casts and required Malo back in Kunark, Velious. This isn't the case with Nihil. If you land Nihil, the next cast of Turgur's usually sticks as well. If not, the second will.<br />
They need to make it so that Nihil is resisted less than Malos+Turgur's and I don't think -55 or -60 will do that just basing my experience on how Nihil works, so I am asking for a -75 at least.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, Slow is a minor function currently and it wouldn't be overpowering if it had a -1000 resist check a la ToT, but in order to give Shamans an edge I don't think giving Shamans a -75 Slow while not giving other slowers a resist adjust would be a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Some very good points here.  That being said, I too would like to see them change the resists.  After all, the purpose of this seems to be to do away with malos to start, right?  However, malos = -55, and the check on this spell is -40.  -15 MR is nothing to sneeze at when doing a resist check.<br />
<br />
Of course, the whole point is still a bit moot since we need a malos to land most of our damage spells (DoTs certainly, and I get a lot of partial resists on VS without malos).  I hope SoE doesn't forget about that.<br />

Which is why I listed a range of possibilities. Pick the one that applies to you. And yes, a 55% neg 75 Nihil would probably still make it into my spell lineup - I just would not cast it regularly.<br />
<br />
Afaik, Malos + tash + TA = ****ty in Uqua as well. Mobs are ****ing resistant making TA a secondary slow if Nihil fails. Malos + Nihil in some situation is the best combo by far, and sometimes Nihil alone is far better that than TA wich is slooooooooooow to cast AND land (3sec is slow, not counting the number of resist on it, not counting the aggro you generate on retries, not counting the heal you might have done instead of casting smelly turgur).

I sort of agree in Uqua. Yes, things are pretty resistant. On the other hand you want every bit of slowage you can get. I have not really had any trouble with resists in Ikkinz. Either bard debuffing or enchanter tash works fine for me landing Turgur's with minimal resists. In fact I feel pretty useful in there until we hit the bosses.<br />
<br />
All a 75% Nihil does is totally replace Turgurs in GoD type encounters, with a -40mr check. Which, and correct me if I am wrong here, is somewhat insufficient unless you apply malos first. Which in turn negates the whole point of Nihils as a fast casting high reliability (low resist) spell.<br />
If it is nsufficient or not is a big &quot;depends&quot;. It certainly lands more often then Turgur's - if it lands often enough to not Malos depends a lot on the zone and on other debuffers. I certainly would not mind making the resist modifier 55 to match Malos.<br />
<br />
With higher resist mod but lower slow % the Nihil spell and Turgurs would complement each other nicely and let the shaman choose which setup is best for the current content.<br />
Making it another situational spell and letting us choose in which way to be inferior to a second or third cleric. Don't get me wrong, I do not think the current version of Nihil will suddenly make us balanced. I just think it is the better overall spell (compared to a hypothetical -75, 55% slow).<br />
<br />
We either need an insane slow with no noticeable aggro or the encounters need to change to be more useful then a second cleric. If the encounters do change a lesser slow will be worse then the one on test at the moment. If they do not the point is moot - even an unresistable slow will need to cast pretty much instantly and generate no aggro to make us more valuable then a second cleric (or druid or enchanter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Farming the Fly isnt really all that hard and there are lots of good writeups on it.  In 2 farming sessions of 3-4 hours each, I saw 2 BoNs drop (I do feel lucky knowing he can drop lots of different spells, saw at least 2 of the cleric ones drop in this time as well).  The fly can even pop as the closest mob to the zone in or as a hall wanderer that you can pull without killing another mob.  We dont have many in guild that want to go to GoD either as we just reached the Elemental Planes, but a handful is all you need.<br />
<br />
Personally, in its current form, I like BoN a lot, for most of what I do, it completely took the place of Malos in my spell lineup.  Granted I didnt use Malos that much, but I constantly use BoN.  The super fast cast time on BoN is fantastic.  The change to the slow is great, but like others, and Ive commented on it in past threads as well, I would like slightly higher than -40 magic resist.  Ive used it in Hard LDoNs a few missions, easy LDoN, some GoD content (Ferubi and surrounding zones) and a raid in Elemental PoA.<br />
<br />
Having two great slows up is great, essentially negating any recast time issues.  The difference in having a resist on BoN and having backup Turgurs to cast immediately is great when mobs can trash you quickly.  Its also great in that it more frequently slows the first time, before a lot of debuffs are on the mob.  Its great on multiple mob pulls (I probably wont mem Tigirs anymore either).<br />
<br />
I feel like its made a huge impact on the way I play the game as well as my life expectancy in many instances and I would call it a must have spell for most shamans, it will make your life easier.  I feel much more comfortable slowing a lot earlier than I used to.  As many others have already stated, I also agree it doesnt go far in improving what we need, but it is still a really nice spell.</div></div><hr />

Two, it does nothing to solve the issues raised by shaman in terms of usefulness for short duration fights.<br />

The tough mobs in Discord are going to be mostly immune to slow. Groups are balanced around taking out the tough targets, not the yard trash. Thus, while nice, this upgrade does little to improve the shaman in short duration, slow immune environments. Either the mob dps output has to be decreased, or shaman fast healing should be increased more so that a shaman could serve as a backup healer.</div></div><hr />

Just voicing my joy at the change to this spell.  Of course I'll have yet to get the spell ... but it'll happen; /does happy dance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Why am I joking? Do the other slowers, slows not mitigate as well? I guess only shaman slow mitigates eh?<br />
<br />
All I was saying is our slow will land more frequently now. I feel this slow will help us do our job better.<br />
<br />
As far as better heals I was a shaman in kunark when our best heal was superior healing. I didnt care back then and I dont care now about having uber heals. Just want things back the way they were before.<br />
<br />
DPS I would rather do in the background like a chanter. I want to be a living breathing augment.<br />

edit changed greater to sup, hehe been along time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Slow will not land any better than it did before this change and many of us that have this spell think it's not making enough of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Look I wasnt trying to get into a flame war with anyone. <br />
<br />
These boards have sure changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I don't think people disagreeing with you necessarily constitutes a flame war...  Merely differing opinions.  I don't think it's unreasonable to say that this slow makes us the 'king' again, but the real question is does that matter?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I'd agree with those that say they'd prefer it be a lower % slow with a higher resist mod.  The main way this is useful is if you can land it in the first few seconds of a fight.  One bounce, and you're back to pretty much no contribution for that fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I wasn't flaming you, Zodiax. If you took it that way, I apologize. It wasn't even aimed at you, personally. <br />
I just keep reading it a lot on these boards and I am trying to tell those that want a group FA that group FA does not have any impact beyond a certain point and that there are a ton of new things we need more than a placebo group buff.<br />
<br />
I am not even saying that this is true for everyone. Group Fa would be a very nice DPS increase for a raid doing Luclin up to early PoP, it's just not where we have the biggest issues and need immediate fixes.<br />
<br />
Sorry again, if you took it the wrong way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">We've always been the best slower.  Problem is it doesn't mean much of anything anymore in the new content and likely content to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">oh its np. Im just at the point where I am scared to say anything here. Besides asking for advice etc. <br />
<br />
This is still one of the best class forums and community out there though. No offence taken. I just stated an opinion I wasnt saying we dont need help etc blah blah blah. <br />
<br />
I dont get involved in politics in game and I prefer to not get involved in topics that could lead to flaming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I would like to see the resist modifier bumped to 50, which puts it between Malo and Malos. 40 is a bit low. But I am not complaining, I will mem this spell and replace Turgers with it full time without question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">*hugs* Dekurgen, a voice of reason :D<br />
<br />
This is a great change.  yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">I don't understand how people can be gullible enough to believe that changing Nihil to the status quo slow percentage that's been in place for the last 4(ish?) years is in any way shape or form an &quot;upgrade&quot;.<br />
<br />
What are the odds that GoD mobs/encounters (that may or may not even be fully designed and are undeniably still subject to being tweaked) will simply have thier SVM bumped up 40 or more to offset the - resist check on Nihil?<br />
<br />
This change only marginally helps shaman inadequacy vs. GoD mobs, and only if thier SVM isn't raised to negate the -40 on Nihil.  The good news is that we'll be able to pwn old world mobs that much easier now!1!!<br />
<br />
This looks a lot like the same thing that happened when they (eventually) added Daluda's Mending and shaman were (finally) put back in line as 47% of a cleric.  How many people fell for that, and thought that was an upgrade?<br />
<br />
Not me, not for a second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I dont see those replys as flames either.<br />
People are probably more confrontational on these boards now because over time SOE have been serving us turds for upgrades in more ways than Bubba can serve shrimp.<br />
The problem is that SOE seem to equate &quot;making a  spell more useful&quot; with &quot;fixing the shaman as a whole&quot;. <br />
<br />
With GoD, Shaman are a Clydesdale running in the Kentucky Derby, and Fat Bastid is our jockey.We could carry him further than other horses, but the race is already over.<br />
<br />
When we ask for this major problem to be looked at, they make a few minor changes, fool a few of us and the majority of other classes into thinking they have answered our prayers, and then ask with Dickensian affront &quot;What, you want more???&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I tested BoT in uqua last night. Using BoT at start resulted in 3 death, 4 slows and about 10-12 resists. Way better worked starting with malos, click TA. if turgur is resisted cast BoT and click TA. BTW turgurs was resisted about 1 out of 5 clicks after malos and only died when raid wiped. In my yes BoT is not a pre-slow. It's if_ta_turgurs_was_resisted-slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">The problem with Nihil atm is that the range of mobs it makes a difference on is as good as non existant in GoD. If Nihil lands, Turgur's would have landed with a probability of 99% as well. If Turgur's was resisted, you would have probably been resisted with Nihil as well. -40 is not enough.<br />
<br />
This is my experience with Nihil in GoD too - Malos + Turgur's has a much better chance of sticking than Nihil by itself. It seemed that -40 wasn't enough, Nihil bounced a fair bit, but -55 was fine for Turgur's. If you have to do Malos first, you remove the advantage of Nihil being that much faster.<br />
<br />
However, I think making it even -55 resist adjust and 75% slow won't happen. It'd be fine for normal mobs in GoD, and LDoN hard, that would be just what we want, but it would also have a knock-on effect on other areas of the game.<br />
<br />
I know some people think, &quot;so what if old content is more easily slowable&quot;, but not everyone is on the bleeding edge of the game, in fact, most aren't.<br />
<br />
The problem is, if they give us something that makes a difference in GoD, it makes other stuff that much easier too.<br />
<br />
At any rate, it doesn't help with boss mobs in GoD - the majority of these are slow immune anyway. The other day we had a trial group going, Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, Monk, Wizard, and were waiting around for another Cleric to log on because a Shaman isn't good enough a backup healer to do it. (Before you say anything, one of the group tried it with a cleric+shaman the night before, with a tank who had more HP).<br />
<br />
My role on those mobs is either backup healer or DPS and I lack significantly in both areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Lemonade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Best thing I can tell ya for an easy way to get this spell, is make friends with people that farm sewers/vxed, I have some friends that farm the crap out of sewers for spells.  I happen to be on when Nihil dropped so they let me loot it.  Ever since then I have farmed sewers/vxed/tipt farming anything and everything that drops from there that is useful for anyone of us.  So best can say is when yer on get into a sewer group where they are doing sewers for spells/xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surely you mean Balance of the Nihil, not Breath of Trushar. <br />
<br />
It's not &quot;Nih'li&quot; either ffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I have BoNihil and the spell rocks.  The fast cast and resist mod have made Turgurs almost completely unnecessary in exp groups and raid trash.  The only time I used Turgurs was on named MOBs or if the chanter had a stack mezzed.<br />
<br />
Now, with the increased slow percentage, every shaman in the guild that doesn't have this spell will find themselves relegated to rebuff bots while I slow everything.  Prior to this they were still overslowing mine just so we could have the best of both worlds - fast slows followed up by maximum effectiveness slows.  With the percentages being the same, there will no longer be need for this.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy about the change.  The increased mana cost is negligible to me... with the mana regen buffs, gear, and AA, I have a damn hard time burning out my mana now - I doubt a 33% increase will make a hill-o'-beans of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">From the point of view of someone who hasn't done much GoD, this spell is going to be worth it to me and to my guild for the pre-Elemental content.  We farm Emp Ssra as often as we can get to him and this spell would make a huge difference in that engagement.  In VT, in tier 3, in LDoN groups, etc, this spell is going to be another game changer, imo, and I eagerly look forward to getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">You can't land Nihil on Emp. If SKs can't land Touch of Innoruuk (-500) then you're not landing Nihil on him.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have slowed Tunare with Nihil though :) took like 25 casts, makes her utterly gimp.</div></div><hr />

Emp is disease slow only.  He's very, very resistant to magic.  Cloud of Grummus makes him trivial anyway.  Not as trivial as Seru, but more so than before.  The other things in the room with him make the event a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Think Malo. Think Torpor. Now go get it.<br />
And how long did it take us to get that changed?</div></div><hr />
