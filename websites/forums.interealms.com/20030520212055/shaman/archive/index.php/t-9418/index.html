<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 34 yesterday... and tried out my pet briefly.  Just wondering what buffs should I give my pet?  Last night I was casting quickness and regen on it.  I was soloing - pulling the MoB with slow, letting the pet tank while I DoTed the MoB, then stepping in and tanking.<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gukaistar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only buff i ever give to my pet is haste and sow.  Their natural regen is usually enough to keep them alive. With the mob slowed and your pet sowed you should have no problem rooting the mob and calling the pet off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">give your pet sharp things that cut and chop. Haste pet, slow mob, dot, dot, canni, repeat.<br />
<br />
foo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just kragg and celerity dogdog and only regen it if in dire need. Whatever you do don't waste precious mana on stat buffs on your pet;  sta, agi, etc won't make a difference on Vibtik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually cast HoS and celerity, will add regen if pet is just gonna tank and mob respawns fast, like ice giants 6 minutes. <br />
<br />
On the other hand if i have multi giants, i will regen otherwise he usually regens back fast enough on his own. If i get a lot of adds or pet seems to take a lot of damage i may cast regen too.<br />
<br />
Edit: i have a amulet of insite as well EE3 makes it nice for the pets spells to last longer before fading, hos lasts forever and regen drops just a little before the haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's what I do:<br />
<br />
Soloing: Spirit Quickening, Celerity, Regrowth and a couple of nice pointy daggers<br />
<br />
<br />
Grouped: (assuming I even bring Wondermutt out of the doghouse) Spirit Quickening, Celerity<br />
<br />
<br />
I've tried hp buffing, ac buffing, etc and found that it just doesn't make that much of a difference for my pup.  Honestly, if the mob is slowed you'll have plenty of time to heal your pet.<br />
<br />
I've also found that in groups the pet really doesn't do enough damage to make him worth pulling up.  When soloing, its just pull with slow, sick the dog, dot, and watch the show.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People, please look at the original post.   Level 34, he just got his first pet.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Tnarg for extra hit points, haste him and possibly regen if he's going to be taking his share of the hits.<br />
<br />
Hey, while you're at it, could you please help us out?   Turn on other's hits and watch your dog attack something.   Then give him some junk weapon like a FS Dagger, you should see some bites and some pierces.  If I'm not mistaken, giving him a weapon will make him use his weapon skill instead of his H2H skill and should make him hit more often (our pets are warriors).  I don't believe he can dual wield yet, please let us know if you find out differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I gave health, haste, str.  AC if he was doing more tanking than I wanted him to, regen if he couldn't keep up between critters.<br />
<br />
/pet sit is great for pumping up their downtime regen, just need to remember to /pet guard here or /pet follow, or Goner will be sitting all by his lonesome, and possibly out of command range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Harnessing of Spirit and Alacrity for mine.  Spirit of Wolf if Im touring an outdoor zone and want him to follow (tho I usually just park him and use Summon Companion).  Chloroplast if Im killing too fast for his innate regen to keep up.  Oh yea, and 2x weapons of course.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I gave my pet the hp buff (whatever it's called at that level), regen and haste. The hp buff was a nice buffer in case you get adds that pound on Goner before you can get a heal on him or get the mob's attention.</div></div><hr />
