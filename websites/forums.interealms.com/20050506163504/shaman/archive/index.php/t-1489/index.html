<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please help.<br />
I am 60, here is my profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66077<br />
I dont have SOL yet, basically I have run out of money and wont be upgrading till POP comes out.<br />
My problem is this, I am becoming quite bored.<br />
I have the 7th Coldian ring so am waiting for Gloradin=Boring<br />
I am 75% of the way thru the Sanctum Guardians Ring quest, have to push Smithing from 120 to 200=Boring<br />
I am trying to find Malo, camping Seb Protector, Jumpy, the emp, Trak=Boring<br />
I have all my SS armour except BP, raiding HoT=Boring<br />
PL'ing alts=Boring<br />
No SOL= No Alt advancement=Boring<br />
I am Dragon/Dwarf faction KOS to Giants<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind I dont have SOL and do still enjoy the game when I am 'doing' something, and knowing what equip I have, do you have any recommendations of quests etc that will keep me sane? for another couple of months?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You sound like you need a break if all those things are boring, I can't think of any quests that wouldnt involve more timesinks/ camping. <br />
<br />
How about helping a friend or guildmate level up instead or put an unusual/small group together and go have fun in a dungeon where you might all end up dying horribly. Organise a treasure hunt or PvP tournament. <br />
<br />
Or start dropping hints to family and friends about what gift would make you soooo happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is why I haven't ever felt the need to 'race' to the end game (not saying you did).  <br />
<br />
Several posts here lately about being bored at the high levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Build up your cabilis faction and do the cudgel quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Barbarians can't get passed indifferent faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Need to worship CT methinks to even have a shot at the cudgel.  Even cudgel = boring at some points...just got done with 41 hours of kamping krusaders in Kurns for the immaculate 4/20 3rd cudgel :p<br />
<br />
For AA alone I would just suck it up and buy SoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Create a new character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i take enjoyment from helping others, especially those in my guild.  i group with my friends, and thats what brings me joy in this game.  <br />
<br />
if you're bored with all those things, perhaps its time to take a break and reevaluate why you play this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Play another game<br />
<br />
EQ has nothing in the end game to keep players interested...</div></div><hr />
