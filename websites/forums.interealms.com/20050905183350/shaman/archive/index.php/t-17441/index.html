<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering if any of you can provide some hints or suggestions.  My zoning time has slowed tremendously a few months back. Until now I have lived with it but now I want to get at the root of it and correct it.  Are there any things I can look for in my eqclient.ini that I can adjust that may have an impact?  I have the zone textures loaded on my PC now (for the zones I have already visited). Obviously the first time I visit a particular zone it is a slower load but I am still getting long zone times on subsequent visits as well.<br />
<br />
When I am running somwehere with a bunch of ggroupmates and we hit the zone at the same time, by the time I am in the zone, they are already running way ahead so by comparison, I am zoning much slower than they are.<br />
<br />
I have a DSL connection and an Athlon XP2200 with 1GB RAM, running Win XP and have a 64MB NVIDIA GeForce 3 Ti500 graphics card.<br />
<br />
The thing to keep in mind is that with this very same setup (PC) I was once getting good zoning times.  So I don't think it is the hardware, just perhaps a setting with them or the .ini settings within EQ.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zoning times on a fast connection seem to have a lot to do with hard drive speed.  If you can afford it, get a sata card and a 10,000 rpm drive with nothing but operating system and EQ on it.  <br />
Otherwise you're stuck with regular defrags and the usual optimizations like fixing virtual memory size.</div></div><hr />
