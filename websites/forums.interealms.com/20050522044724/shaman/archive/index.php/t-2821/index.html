<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrahmaDaShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a pretty decent computer , at least i thought.<br />
Athlon 1800+ XP<br />
512 DDR ram<br />
EPoX 8KHA+ mobo etc etc<br />
<br />
It runs fine, but I noticed I cant run two eqw windows! It seems like my computer puts too many resources into the first window and everything else i try to do is very slow. When I start the second window it just freezes. I hear the music when I try to log into the server. then it just freezes. What all do I need ot turn off in game to allow me to use two windows? :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I tried using eqw, I could not get it to run full screen. <br />
<br />
Is there some trick?</div></div><hr />

ME/98 don't share resources evenly between the two apps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use 16bit color, I can use EQw on my PoS celeron 663.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Video card?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My video card is a GF2 MX400 64MB.  I tried changing the reso, but I don't think I tried 16-bit color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehe, I can't even play mp3s at the same time anymore... every time I move in EQ, the mp3's skip, and it's really really annoying to have your music constantly skipping.<br />
<br />
I'll try the nosound.txt thing though.<br />
<br />
Not that I use EQw :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe you have to put the nosound.txt file in at least one instance.  i.e. if you want to run two instances of eqw/EQ on one computer, you should have two separate directories with full install of EQ and EQW.  Put nosound.txt in at least one of these eq directories.  I didn't think EQW worked at all with 32 bit color enabled, but I could be wrong there.  Regardless, I'd drop down to 16 bit though.<br />
<br />
Check the hackersquest forum for eqw and there are directions on how to get it to work there, but I think I've covered the basics at least. ;)</div></div><hr />
