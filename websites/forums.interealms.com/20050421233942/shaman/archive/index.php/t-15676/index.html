<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MoMoNeY8720</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just got out of PoD ...exp is getting kinda slow in a group there...wanted to try to solo some. my items arent to great. any suggestion would be great</div></div><hr />

Using disease dots<br />
-Dulak-<br />
I don't really like this place, but Dandolak's seems to be pretty popular, or you could go deeper into the luggald tunnels<br />
-Nadox-<br />
Either the elementals at the entrance or crawl up to the right before lava bridge and use the safe spot on the rocks to the right, or the left corner closest to the lava.  You won't be able to single pull the trolls at the campfire so leave them alone<br />
-Katta-<br />
Either the Twilight entrance guards or the bank courtyard<br />
-Echo Caverns-<br />
Archers, I've never done these but supposedly good<br />
-Nurga/Droga-<br />
I've never done these solo but I imagine there is a good place to pull to<br />
<br />
I would think the best idea would be to get a gate idol, so you can stay bound near your solo spot.  And instead of grouping in the planes, try putting a group together for Droga or Veksar, see how far you can get.  Maybe do the Shop in Veksar or the King room in Droga.  The exp is slightly slower, but the loot is a million times greater that tier 1.  If you're getting close to 60 I imagine you're starting to get calls to head up to Plane of Valor and whatnot, which is percent per kill (regular) type stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Several good spot in nadox but it is slowing already for me at 57; still, a steady flow of mobs and good plat and an occassional named . . . tho that wirey veteran made me gate this past weekend.<br />
<br />
Deep Nurga isn't bad but bring your resist gear.  Lot's of casters.  I will try droga solo at 58 once I have Can4 and the 2k CH.<br />
<br />
If you don' mind long pulls, the area in skyfire where the old wurms and elder wyverns really isn't that bad . . . isn't that good either, but . . .<br />
<br />
Saw a shaman soloing in CharB the other night. /shrug<br />
<br />
Veksar gobies are probably pretty decent.  Anything else in that zone seems to have super high poison and disease resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Prisoners in PoJ are also good, theres a shm piercer that drops down in those cells.  Sebilis - Kael - many many places =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">katta is a damn good place assuming you can single pull nathan's guards(I think 56 but might be 58 can't remember)  Only faction you lose is with Nathan and you get plus hits to other katta and seru factions.  The wolves are the same level, but the guards vary.  Also nice because you can use a horse there and sell whenever you want(assuming you have non kos faction :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EaalSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im currently 58, but half a blue from 59. My equipment isn't spectacular but I have decent equipment. Id love to solo in ChardokB but I don't know an effective way to do it. Does anyone have any strategies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">eh, trying solo in charb might not be too good of an idea till 60 or so. stuff down there has pretty nice exp, respawn is nuts, and some stuff down there is yellow to 58 still... wanderers love to add if you dont pull far enough back. i guess itd be possible with c3 and good gear (jbb would probly make this much easier, but im iksar so no good for me). just buff dogdog as much as you can and good luck tryin it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">katta-dandolak...all pretty much the same experience for me at 56.  loot just sucks more in katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Katta Bank courtyard : right number of mobs to pull, single pulls.Loot not big but enough to pay your regular extra buffs (loot weapons and go sell with your spiritstone when it's time for a new Kei)<br />
Turning Light blue at 60.<br />
<br />
And if you're the 'anti-social soloer'-type: Killing humans is sw33t!  :D <br />
<br />
Easy, safe and decent solo xp: all good to go straight to 60.Staying there more than two levels is boring though  :o</div></div><hr />
