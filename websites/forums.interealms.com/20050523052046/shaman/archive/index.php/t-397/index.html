Very VERY impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What more can you say about an item you will likely never see :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After a while where FoH seemed like they were getting caught up to by other guilds they have certainly claimed that number 1 spot by a clear margin with this kill. My hat's off to them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep. Quite an accomplishment. Call FoH elite snobs and a bunch of arses as some do, but they sure know how to rock the house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I'm sure that it was no easy fight I don't nessicarily think this shows anything in relatoin between FoH and other high end guilds in thier ability to kill difficult mobs. They are just the only ones who have put in enough time to get keys and maybe the only ones who currently know how to make the serubane weapons.<br />
<br />
Being the only ones to have spent lots of time getting keys and making weapons doesn't prove how good a guild is or isn't just how stubborn =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sloberly good. :p<br />
<br />
I think i jizzed looking at it....;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Natysha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh.. Lord Seru is MORE than just farming the keys and weapons.   They had a 30 minute fight with that bastard.  I count that a hell of an accomplishment.  Just wish these bane weapons weren't so fricking annoying.  Least we can get exp doing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;They are just the only ones who have put in enough time to get keys and maybe the only ones who currently know how to make the serubane weapons&quot;<br />
<br />
If this doesnt pretty much sum up the ONLY way to excell in EQ I dont know what does. Highend EQ is timesink after timesink ...<br />
<br />
I think FoH are the uberest guild I have ever read about in EQ. Tigole/Legacy of Steel is much more entertaining though - I recommend visiting their website for a story about Tigole's dog!</div></div><hr />
