In say an hours time, is the aaxp points they gain the same?  It’s been posted here that the level 60 will get twice as many aaxp points in that hour compared to the 65 peep.  Others have said they progress at the same rate.  Anyone know for sure which is true?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have heard that the amount of exp for 1 aa is the same as 60 or 65. But, if the 65 and 60 were in the same group, the 60 would ding aa faster. Reason is that per kill the 60 would recieve more exp because of the relative level difference between the mob and the level 60.<br />
<br />
Kinda confusing, but here is an example.<br />
<br />
Level 60 + 65 grouped together. They kill a level 65 mob. The level 60 would receive MORE exp than the level 65 would. Now, because they both have the same AA requirement, over a number of kills the level 60 would ding aa first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on mechanics.<br />
<br />
If you recieve the same exp bonus for 1-8 (or however many levels there are between 65 even and 65 bottom blue) then you'd level aaxp at the same pace since the numerical value remains the same.<br />
<br />
If there is a variance in bonus/penalty to the blue catergory, then you'd have to reexamine it and then yes, there would be a difference.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the PoP bonus is hysterical because NO ONE hunts in old world anymore and it's a damn shame that entire expansions are wasted over that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">65 &amp; 60 is a 10% difference...maybe 11-12%. When I compared my aa exp rate to the level 60's aa exp rate, he would ding an AA while I was at 90%. Sucks. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd read a lot about PoP exp rates, but didn't hunt there until a couple days ago.  We had a group of 5: 61 warrior, 60 Druid, 54 Cleric, and my 48 Shaman and 56 Ranger.<br />
<br />
My shaman was doing pretty well, got about a yellow in around an hour.  However, my ranger was getting an AAXP percent on every other kill.  These were not high level mobs either, PoJ basement mobs that were all blue at 56, and yellow/red to my 48.<br />
<br />
This kind of bothers me, it seems like there is going to be a huge gap in ability with people who have more time to play, have a better guild, etc.  They always had an advantage, and they should, but I could see people getting a couple AA a day simply grinding basic mobs.<br />
<br />
Glad I made my shaman... nobody invited my ranger to PoP groups until he hit 48 and could slow those nasty mobs.  If you want the shammy, gotta take the ranger.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This just doesn't make any sense. I've read official postings about how in any grouping the higher level characters would get the greater share of the exp from each kill simply because higher level = great contribution to the group effort. <br />
<br />
Switching it the other way has got to be a bug. So stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soloing golems in PoV at 62 used to give me 9% AA per kill.<br />
<br />
Soloing golems in PoV at 65 gives me 7% AA per kill.<br />
<br />
With PoP you get considerably more exp from killing a mob within 5 levels of your level on top of the usual red&gt;yellow&gt;white&gt;blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some changes were made to exp allocation over the past few months (some even older than that) that explain what you are seeing.<br />
<br />
1. experience from a kill is divided equaly among all party members in range. It is no-longer weighted based on level.<br />
<br />
2. a bonus is given to the exp based on the number of party members (this was done to encourage full groups over soloing/small groups).<br />
<br />
3. bonus exp is given to classes with exp penalties (this is how they took out the class based exp penalties -not by changing the exp table, but by addind a multiplier)<br />
<br />
4. if the mob's level is close to (or equal/higher) your level you get an additional bonus multiplier (10%).  This level range is LESS than the dk blue range -so, mobs that are on the high end of dk blue give you more exp than ones on the low end of dk blue.<br />
<br />
5. post 60 the dk blue level range was reduced.  At 60 the dk blue range was about 15 levels.  At 65 it is 10 levels, with the exp bonus (change 4) ending at about 8 levels.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot one of em :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Golems are about 61? 62?  definitely &gt; 60.  So a lvl 65 is not really missing out on much - maybe 10-20% over a lvl 60.<br />
<br />
*but* a group of lvl 65s should be able to take 120%+ of the mobs a lvl 60 group could.<br />
<br />
unless you dinged 65 so you could land slows and don't have any spectrals/runes ... then you might be asking if you'd be getting aas faster at 63. (probably, you would, assuming you could get in the same groups - slow resists are almost never seen in valor at 63 if you have malo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You forgot the bonus for killing something within 5 levels lower of you.  <br />
<br />
But yah, it's mostly exp bonuses that make exp go better for lower level peeps.  A lvl 60 killing lvl 62-63 golems in PoV is getting about 5 exp bonuses, which is 1 more bonus (10%)  more than the lvl 65 in the same zone in the same group killing the same mobs.  Thus, the lvl 60 can gain AAxp 10% faster than the lvl 65 since AAxp is set on a fixed amount of exp across all classes and levels and races.  <br />
<br />
Also don't forget, some mobs give more exp than others.  By that i mean the BASE number of exp which is used.  Man there's a lot of math here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The big difference is that a group of level 65s will be killing way faster than a group of 60s in PoV. The 65s will make AA faster. The 60s will have trouble holding down a camp properly. <br />
<br />
On average, the level 60 who waltzes into PoV with a LFG tag on will also have a harder time getting into a group, ESPECIALLY if there are higher level toons of the same class also LFG. This translates into higher downtime between xp binges for the level 60 toon, and this also needs to be factored into the equation.<br />
<br />
It has been a VERY long time since I had a level 60 in my groups in PoV. Level 60 encs can't mez for crap. Level 60 tanks take too much damage and have trouble holding aggro against a level 65 rogue. Level 60 shaman get too many resists and generally have too few HP. They also lack Tnarg's and they shortchange group members 140 hp because they don't have Focus of Soul. Level 60 wizards are resisted too much. Level 60 clerics run out of mana too fast and lack Virtue and Supernal Elixir. And so on and so on. Forget about it. I'd rather go with a group of 5 until another level 65 shows up. Level 60s are a liability and tend to sit at the zone lines longer in LFG mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a lvl65 shaman doesn't make group kill faster than lvl60 shaman, as long as you have slow/torpor/malo and know what you doing, you can do as good as lvl65 shaman except they get little better buff, people invite shaman because you are shaman have PoV flag, not because you are higher level; shaman is best class that can easy get group at pov regardless of level.<br />
<br />
I remember when I was lvl62 and get about 1 AA per hour top for clear inner cave with a good group, now I earn 1 AA every 2 hours at top for good group(pulling frogok from outside too); that is about 2x slower, it is not way only 10% difference<br />
<br />
the difference between lvl60 and lvl62 is close or same as lvl62 and lvl65; since after lvl60, the mob's con is huge change compare to pre 60; if AA rate is 1.5x slower from 60 to 62, then it will about 3x slower from 60 to 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They also lack Tnarg's and they shortchange group members 140 hp because they don't have Focus of Soul.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, I dont owe you anything. I'll give ya harnessing of spirit and you'll be happy about it. Or maybe I'll let that giant eat your ass first before I magically land that slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;Level 60 shaman get too many resists and generally have too few HP. They also lack Tnarg's and they shortchange group members 140 hp because they don't have Focus of Soul&quot;<br />
<br />
This could be very misleading to any younger shaman out there yet to venture into PoV. I gained my flag at 58 and got groups no problem at all. True I did not advertise my lvl, but once in group I never had a group member complain, &quot;eeew why have I got so few hp ??&quot;. Nor did I find it hard to slow the mobs at all. I simply led with Malosini, allowing the tank to gain aggro and making it easier to slow, then landed slow with little problem at all. I even had group members saying they had seen lvl 65 shaman not slow as well. Whats more there is no guarentee you will have Focus of Soul at 65, I have yet to get it at 63, and that and replenishment are the only ones I do not have. I dont even have Malo, Torpor, or Can5 and I do fine thank you very much.<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough to get flagged as low a lvl as I did you will be fine. Gear does not make a shaman Uber, it's the way he/she plays :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In PoV pickup groups I tend to make an aaxp every 2 hours on average. In guild/friend 'regular hunting circle' groups I make an aa in 80-90mins on average. By Average I mean including deaths, screw ups, overpulls, people leaving/afk and crap.<br />
<br />
This is because in guild/friend groups we know each others playstyle/limits a lot more, and will generally take much higher risks and fight through rough situations a pick up group would be more likely bail in ;) You can play a lot harder when everyone knows the rules.<br />
<br />
Saying that, I do get some amazing pick-up groups (another plus of playing a shaman heh), but these are the exception as opposed to the rule.<br />
<br />
Fast aaxp has more to do with playstyle and risk-taking in my opinion. A 65 shaman can generally operate a far higher level of risk than a 60 shaman, purely on resists alone, especially when killing mobs in the 61-65 range.<br />
<br />
A shaman with Tnargs to patch with is much more valuable than one spamming chloroblast. I have had so so many situations were no Tnargs would have meant a group wipe. full stop.<br />
<br />
A shaman with SLTW and 3+ melees/no ench does a LOT more group DPS than a celerity shaman with 3+ melee's/no ench.<br />
<br />
Yes shaman can probably do better at 60 in Tier2 than most other classes, especially with core aa/spells like Malo/Torpor/canni5; as most groups want a slower. if you slow the mobs, you must be an uber shaman! You have filled your role!<br />
<br />
I personally will only take a PoV pickup as a last resort when looking for xp, as it is usually the worst xp/hour rate I get ;) <br />
<br />
Most of my AA come from hunting for SP's with friends mostly in the 64-65 range, in 'train/idiot proof' areas; for me personally there is little to no benefit to staying at 60 for fast aaxp, when being 65 makes myself, my friends that I group with and my guild that bit stronger ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a lvl65 shaman doesn't make group kill faster than lvl60 shaman<br />
<br />
Well gee. I'll just tell my groupmates that they won't be receiving SLTW and Ferine Avatar anymore! It doesn't make the group kill faster! I'll just start casting torpor on the rogue who takes a little damage instead of Q. So what if it slows and snares him! We're not killing faster!<br />
<br />
Some of you really underappreciate what a level 65 shaman can do for a group versus a level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here is the plan for UBER UBER alt-exp. Get flagged for Valor, then DELEVEL to 46!<br />
<br />
You can still get in the zone, and THINK how fast the alt-exp will fly!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It took me a while to get flagged for PoV/S and in that time I spent a lot of time in PoN duoing with my druid friends.  I first went there at 55.  I was going 100 percent aa for a while and was getting 1 aa  every 100 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Eventually my druid friend had to move across to the other side of the water so I went with him, still level 55 35aa.  We basically killed nettlings forever.  This was back before they dropped parchments.  So here I started getting aa every 50 minutes.  <br />
<br />
I eventually decided to level up some.  Made it to 59 in a matter of days.  Stopped at 59 a while to get the canV and a few others.  Since I didn't have torpor or malo yet anyways, I wasn't in a big  hurry to get 60.  I could still get 1aa every 50 mins killing nettlings.  I even tried my hand at soloing them, and it was doable and I would get 5percent aa per kill.  Granted I couldn't kill them fast enough to keep up with druid duo exp, but it did give me a nice baseline.<br />
<br />
When I finally leveled 60 the exp still stayed the same.  (I believe the nettlings are level 55)  Once I hit 61 the aa exp per kill dropped from 5percent to 2-3 percent.  In other words, I would have to kill almost 2 times as many nettlings to get 1 aa at 61, than at 60.<br />
<br />
To me this is all the evidence I need.  The bonus for  killing a mob that is 55 is huge when you are =&lt;60 and nonexistant for &gt;60.  <br />
<br />
So what, you say.  So you have to kill higher level mobs is all.  That is fine for those of us that are flagged for the higher tiers and rather unfortunate for those that aren't.<br />
<br />
gah that is enough</div></div><hr />

Hi nice to meet you.  I do not believe I ever stated my expectations of the zone or the exp.  I never did any exp in the Dreadlands or the Overthere so I am not sure what you mean by that.  I do not need anymore ethereal parchments and I have already farmed 200 hobgoblin meats.  I am no longer stuck in PoN, and no longer level 61.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My guild requires us to level to 65 ASAP.  There are a few people who've been away a long time and thus aren't 65 yet, but they are the very small minority.  <br />
<br />
That said, it's for a good reason.  Lvl 65 makes raids go much easier in every way.  Now that I'm doing VT, I sure don't want to try it at 60.  There would need to be entirely too many tactics used heh, and people tend to rush through the debuffing process.  It's been murder trying to get the enchanters to tash the mobs, even tho I'll still get resisted like mad on some stuff after Malo.  Dunna understand their reluctance to tash when the mob is being offtanked anyway.  <br />
<br />
PoP encounters that flag you for the more advanced planes almost require the vast majority of your guild to be 65.  Yea verily, lvl 65 makes everything much easier.  Take Sebilis for instance.  We did a short Trak run with a couple groups the other day.  I pulled juggs just for fun.  It was amusing to toy with them since all my spells landed first shot.  VP one to pull, 3 more come, root one, slow one of the other two still running, drag to camp, slow other, go back and slow rooted mobs . . . I tell yah . . . it's just fun to control situations like that and resists make that level of control impossible.  Then resisting all Trak's **** was kinda kewl.  Coulda fought him for hours like that.  But of course us being 65 meant that even with only two groups and no manaburn, the fight was over in under 30 seconds.  <br />
<br />
Yah 65 is helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I two box alot in PoV. It does not appear to matter too much what I kill.

<br />
I could level my shaman, but there is just no reason I can see at the moment since I need the AA points for him more than I need levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hello,<br />
<br />
I believe the decision is kind of relative whether to get 65 or stay in the 60-62 range.  For me I choose to stay 61 for a while leveling my 2nd box Paladin up from mid 50s.   Getting 40 AA pts in the process has greatly increased my effectivness.  There is a very noticable decrease in xp as your con against mob changes and after the 5 lvl of mob thing post 60 is huge.  My main point is compare the alternatives.  For those who may have not looked at it in this manner.   If you had Can 5 and many of the Core Shaman AA abilities before PoP came out Lvling to 65 makes much more sense.  However if you turned 60 a few weeks before PoP came out  or afterwords which person would you want in your grp.<br />
<br />
65 shaman with 6 aa pts- ie 1200 hp 6 sec cast torpors, no Can 5 ability, fewer resists, most if not all 61-62 spells<br />
<br />
61-62 shaman with 55 aa pts  Can 5, 1800 hp 4 sec torpors, Tnargs, some resists, all 61-62 spells, new pet, Sprit Call<br />
<br />
60 shaman with 75 aa pts  Can 5, 2100 hp 3 sec torpors, more resists, longer buffs, SCM, ND type aa abilities<br />
<br />
To me for my gaming experience I chose lvl 61 to this point mainly due to the fact I was lvling up my Paladin and my friends monk to 60 and gaining better abilities in the places THEY could hunt.   Now that they have gotten 60 passing the trials for them has happened and we will probably go up to 65.  My guild has several 65 MGB shaman already so getting there hasn't been as important to me to this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, as far as I can remember, at level 65 I get about 5-6% from the golems(lvl 62) in valor. At 64 its something like 6-7%, so more like 15% more exp at 64. If you fight level 59 or lower mobs at lvl 65 you get FAR less exp(about half).<br />
<br />
If I were not in a high level raid guild and had Valor as my primary exp zone I would definitely stay level 64, atleast without 65 spells...<br />
<br />
If you are level 65, most gamite frogs(except the 'kings' on top of the rocks), all tree frogs and all larvaes, except the named larvae will give 'minuscle' exp.<br />
