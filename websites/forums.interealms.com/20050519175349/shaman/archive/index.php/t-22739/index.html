<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PRO-ROCK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This one seems like a pretty good way to satisfy both shaman and warriors in some areas. Upgrading a spell line with with 20-30 more str and dex for tanks who've had those stats maxed for many levels isn't helping anyone but lower lvl tanks and casters who want a str/dex boost. And seeing how alot of our spells are designed to help tanks through buffs/debuffs it would seem only natural that adding endurance regen to a somewhat broken line of spells would help both of us without being overpowering. <br />
<br />
FYI<br />
http://rpgexpert.com/2695.html#Warrior<br />
&quot;10. Endurance Regen: We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items. Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit. Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Might not be as high on the want list like bigger heals and whatnot but it would add functionality to Fo7 line again.<br />
<br />
What does everyone else think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This would be unbalancing because people could jump more often with this, giving shamans an unfair advantage when running away over other classes.<br />

If they do introduce endurance buffs, then yes, we should probably get them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am unsure why we want endurance regen.  As far as I understand it, the restrictions for melee disclipline are the timers, not endurance regen.  Guess it could change in OOW though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, endurance regen is kind of an issue, actually, at least ofr my 58 monk.<br />
<br />
If you're chaining together a lot of disciplines, like for my monk a lot of times I'll hit Stonestance (basically /disc defensive), Inner Flame (chance to do 2x melee dmg), then Thunderous Kick (chance to do double damage on kicks).  There are times when I can't hit thunderous kick because Stonestance and Inner Flame uses all my endurance.<br />
<br />
Melee discs have an upkeep.  The cooler, higher-end discs have a higher  upkeep.  Inner Flame I think is 64, so 64 endurance a tick for a 2-tick disc.<br />
<br />
It's not a huge issue, really, given the timer length, but occasionally I'll look at my yellow bar and note that it's empty and I can't hit any more discs.<br />
<br />
Also endurance isn't tied to jumping anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My warrior is pretty far from uber, but she does indeed run out of endurance on occasion.  More often than my shaman runs out of mana anyway. ;)  Some mobs proc an endurance draining effect, too, and it would definitely be nice to have something to possibly counter that.<br />
<br />
It's mostly on fights that are pretty long, though, and those are a dying breed.  Because we don't really have many people with bane, things like Emp and Seru can take us 20+ minutes to kill, and if I open with furious, use defensive when it's up, and incite to help keep aggro, I'm out well before the fight is over.<br />
<br />
I think I'm getting better at pacing myself though, and maybe that's part of it...  With the melee hat on, I wasn't used to managing any resource like that.<br />
<br />
Still, if it could be added to an existing buff, I'd be all for it.  A brand new buff would be less useful, due to the scarcity of buff slots.</div></div><hr />

Screw endurance regen, give us what the heck we've asked for and quit telling us it's being looked into.  I don't expect EVERYTHING that we've asked for, but healing is seriously FUBAR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The warriors asked for END regen on their list, not us...  Think of it what you will, but I don't think it's fair to say screw them, what about our needs? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Simple fix un-nerf acumen.  It use to have stamina regeneration, was removed when we moved to endurance.  Simple fix make it endurance regen and /gasp remove yet another stealth nerf to shaman....  Which mean low odds of it happening.</div></div><hr />

The day after I hit the proper level and scribed it came the stupid nerf.  <br />
I never even got to cast it for it's real purpose and I only use acumen of Da'Khura for group see invins.<br />
Please un-nerf my acumen and give it endurance regen.</div></div><hr />

Warriors do, if they are actively tanking in a fast pulling situation. I doubt anyone else does though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ya, I can feel their pain, doing GoD sewers with the warrior, had to stop every hour for 15 minutes to get enough endurance to use disc defensive/evasive for unslowables and hard hitters (Prolly affects lower end wars like mine more than the big ones, but I can see it as an issue for them)<br />
<br />
 Changing acumen and zing spells to help effect endurance regen would be the best idea as far as I am concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey, they can do something useful when the casters have down time, between mobs.  If they want to ENDDI (TM) [the new official term for HP for END], during the fight, that's their perogative.  They need something to do, instead of wandering off and bring back adds/aggro from other mobs during down time, instead of checking their (new feature) buff timers and telling us to &quot;focus needs refresh... 30mins left on it&quot;...<br />
<br />
Come to think about it, it's not such a bad idea.   I only pity the bards, have to twist songs while hitting that ENDDI button...<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Did a tipt with a warrior like a month and a half ago, fast pulling group (we had no charmpet either) and the warrior had like 20% endurance by the time we got to the boss, so we took a bit of a break for him to juice up for furious/defensive/incites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I vote for un-nerfing acumen.<br />
<br />
I vote for deleting Acumen from the game and giving pure melees a faster standing endurance regeneration rate.  Giving us a spell to cast on warriors only is stupid.  No other class runs out of endurance and a well-equipped warrior doesn't run out of endurance anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Not true.  Monks and rogues going all-out will run out of endurance before their offensive disciplines would otherwise end.  Some extremely well-equipped warriors still run out of endurance, if they're extremely active.  Doing the standard evasive/defensive discs and provoking doesn't tax them as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You guys do realize that un-nerfing Acumen also gives yet another boost to beastlords?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Actually, I think there's a pretty easy way to solve the problem without resorting to an entirely new spell line or acumen.  You stick it on Acumen, it's a waste of a buff slot.  You stick it on Focus, you're going to hear no end of hell with people constantly begging you for it.  And once they have it, they won't need you.<br />
<br />
So just add 10 endurance regen/tick to Ferine Avatar.  In this way, we take the shortcoming of the spell, the duration, and make it a positive byforcing melees to either group us or bot us if they want the endurance regen.  In the meantime, we don't hand out yet another shaman ability to other classes and we maintain some semblance of melee buffers extraordinare.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help the sub 60 group, but what on earth would a sub 60 warrior need it for anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Also, some of the later encounters have a pretty significant endurance drain--when endurance hits 0, no more discs.  So, endurance drain kicks in, suddenly your warrior has no defensive, and heal mana goes through the roof!<br />
<br />
So yes, there is a need!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tehp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The thing that I couldn't understand is that when the Endurance crap came out and would be your yellow bar that they  didn't just make it so that Acumen still regenned that yellow bar as Endurance regen now instead of Stamina regen.  Stamina = Endurance right?  Just give us the damn Endurance Regen on Acumen now as it used to be Stamina Regen and also make the SK Torrent of Fatigue Recourse (Group Tap) Endurance regen as well because it used to also regen stamina for as long as you had the buff icon.  Or would this cause a class balance issue again?  If so, then who the fvck passes out the damn Endurance regen buffs?  Un-nerf our ****e!</div></div><hr />

Well it could be tied to Primal Essence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1819&amp;source=Live) at level 52 and then to Avatar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1598&amp;source=Live) / Primal Avatar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1377&amp;source=Live) at level 60.  This would understandably add to the mana required to cast them but I would also sugest that they add a fixed amount of Endurance to the pool and endurance regeneration value, scaled with the level of spell and that there should be group versions of them as well.  After the recient retuning of the Regeneration line, I would asume that regeneration would not be a part of the spell effects.<br />
<br />
Maybe even add it to Carnage (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2158&amp;source=Live) which is the clicky effect useable at level 45, from the Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5149), the Shaman 1HB Quest is found here (http://www.championsofcabilis.com/home.html).  <br />
<br />
Fix Acumen and the Invigor line. Stop trying to make this more complicated than it has to be.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  Shaman are the logical choice for endurance regenerative spells.  Make them Shaman only imo, and the spells above will ensure this without adding too many new spells.  The Acumen / Invigor line will not add the class reliance that Shaman need in the higher levels as slow becomes less of a requirement. This will give us something useful to add for the melee that require less statistic buffs.<br />
<br />
Do people actually run out of endurance?<br />
<br />
Heck yes.  Do casters need Clairity?   ;)   When I play my Rogue I have to carefully conserve with the heavy cost of the Sneak Attack line and the 5 minute refresh discs, I am often low or out of endurance and sacrifice DPS clearing to have peak DPS during the Named battles.  My bud has to conserve using his monk discs for DPS when chain pulling for singles using his funky monky phantom pulling disc or he needs to 'med up' as well.  <br />
<br />
I am eagerly awaiting this type of 'melee clairity' for both my Shaman and Rogue.</div></div><hr />

No reason to be selfish. The logical choice is to fix what is broken, not change it into something to improve only our class and not the entire game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">How about just mashing together acumen and FoS/7 and slapping on some END regen to it as well. Two seriously underpowered spells just becoma somewhat wanted. Would work with group acumen and group FoS/7 as well.</div></div><hr />
