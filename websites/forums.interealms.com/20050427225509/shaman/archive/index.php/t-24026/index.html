<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, you can always choose not to visit those sites :)  However, I do know what you are talking about.  As of yet, I haven't really ran into anything that nobody else hasn't done before (but then again, i'm not an extreme MMORPG player, I never will - even barring those sites)<br />
<br />
This is one of the big things I liked about EverQuest, at it's release, and Ultima Online - back before spoiler sites were EVERYWHERE, and people had to actually explore an area and see the sights for themselves. :)<br />
<br />
And I dont know how accurate Alla's is (i honestly have never gone there for WoW) but for every other game, they seem to be so inaccurate that you can't really say THEY are spoiling content :D   <br />
<br />
But yeah, you're pretty much right (especially as far as Thottbot goes), and if it's the kind of thing that bothers you, you have to make a conscious effort to avoid it like I have (I've only been there a couple times to check out character profiles).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slythor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont use them to cheak per say.<br />
<br />
I like to find things that Intrest me , that I will do later in lvls. Or if i get stuck some where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, while I may eventually use spoiler sites for WoW I have no intentions of it for at least the first several months (like I did in EQ). <br />
<br />
I WANT to explore. I learned a lesson about spoiler sites with EQ and don't want to ruin my enjoyment of WoW the way I did here. Even if/when I do decide to check out thottbot (or any other WoW site) I won't use them to the extent I used EQ fan sites.<br />
<br />
As long as there is some sort of &quot;Dev Digest&quot; post on their official forums (a la City of Heroes), that's all I'll need to keep up on what's important to me (and one of the reasons I'm currently enjoying CoH again...avoid &quot;general&quot; type official forums like the PLAGUE!). :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ditto that.<br />
<br />
Alla's and the like are where you go after you've exhausted your fun with the game.  Then you can use the spoiler sites to visit all the stuff that you didn't find the first time 'round.<br />
<br />
A lot of people play these games to try to be the first to get the best in the shortest amount of time.  When I realized how little fun I was having doing that, I stopped.<br />
<br />
In theory, the player won't need to use those sites for WoW like we had to for EQ.  I never really had the patience for EQ quests because you didn't know if the reward would be any good, and you generally had no idea where to find the thing you were looking for.  With a couple of exceptions, my time in the beta showed me that they'd pretty much fixed both problems in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, quests almost always give a good explanation of where to go to find a quest target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I explored the first time around, but for my second and now third chararcter I use thottbot a lot (the single best spoiler site for WoW)<br />
<br />
I would even say that it is something you must use if you want to plan in advance what tradeskill you want</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Knowing about a location isn't anything like visiting that location for the first time.  I am still filled with wonder when I enter a new zone or dungeon for the first time in WoW regardless of whether or not I thottbotted it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would even say that it is something you must use if you want to plan in advance what tradeskill you want<br />
<br />
I suppose they changed things a great deal, then?  I'd gotten over 100 in cooking, skinning, and leatherworking during the stress test, and had never used a spoiler site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea im not touching anything but the offical WoW forums till the games released. It holds me in the dark, which i dont like, but i know itll pay off with my facination with the game when its released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what Stygiana means is that its not always obvious which tradeskills does what. And since you can now only have 2 tradeskills it can be valuable to know in advance what kind of things a tradeskill makes and what ingredients it needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I suppose that is correct on some levels.  Seeing a list of tradeskill-makable goods would definently give someone a better idea of what to pick, since being limited to two professions..<br />
<br />
However, from what i've noticed, EVERY tradeskill has value to almost anyone who takes it.  Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Engineering (especially engineering, I hear)...<br />
<br />
So if you dont want to read the site, and just take what *feels* right for your class, you'll do great. :)    Some people say there are high-level content issues with some skills (like leatherworking) but I dont know anything about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">About how much is undiscovered geographically its probably not much.<br />
<br />
But even Blizzard has a very cool way of letting you get sneakpeaks at things way out of your league early on. Some of the early gryphon rides (and I bet similar rides in Horde territory) takes you through zones that are far above your current level. But it gives you a tremendeous sense of immersivness that you know that just over that range of mountains is a zone full of nasty dragons and stuff. You might know where the zone is and more or less how it looks but since you are also able to con some of the mobs while passing by you also know it will take a while before you can go there. Brilliant way to &quot;hook&quot; players.<br />
<br />
With that in mind I dont think it matters too much how much is already &quot;spoiled&quot;. And since some of the tradeskills require you to first find the recipies that also puts a brake on how &quot;spoiled&quot; they can get.<br />
<br />
As long as it doesnt turn out like EQ where 1-50 is meaningless (or at the very best rather boring by todays standards) I am confident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think most of the geographical areas have been discovered.  But I am sure they will release another dungeon or 2 when it goes live.  And raid content isn't in yet, I don't believe.  I've not had much time to sit down and check everything out cause EQ is taking up all my time.<br />
<br />
I do know with the last patch they added raid groups, but I'm not really sure how useful those are except in PvP wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think they're holding back some stuff for release but I'm also sure that stuff will be cataloged and dished up via fan/data sites shortly after it's found.<br />
<br />
I'd agree that you don't have to visit the &quot;spoiler&quot; sites unless you want to.<br />
<br />
Also, in general, WoW presents information very well in the game so in most cases you don't need to look stuff up online to do well.<br />
<br />
The thing that bothers me is that since a lot of drops are involved in tradeskills (as in EQ) and they aren't flagged in any way (ie, no mention of it being a tradeskill material in the item description), that you could easily vendor sell something extremely valuable in terms of selling to another player OR using yourself for crafting.<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to use thottbot just to avoid throwing away valuable tradeskill drops - many of which are fairly rare and not that farmable.  In WoW vendors don't resell the junk you sell to them - they have sorta fixed inventories - so it's not like EQ where you can sometimes find valuable stuff that someone accidentally/unknowngly sold to an NPC.  That also means you can't buy it back yourself after you discover that you just sold something worth 5 gold for 3 coppers.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my main goal with WoW is going to be to have fun and I'd rather not have to surf a site on my other PC - so I probably won't bother with thottbot or anything else.  Usually once I've got to the point of reducing a game to stats, numbers, and cataloged info the game is starting to be less enjoyable in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Right. I've played it for the last couple of days now (16 Shaman on the Euro Beta PvE server)<br />
<br />
As I thought everyone and his mother is quoting the spoiler sites pretty much non stop, they all know exactly what to go for and where it is.<br />
<br />
There's no mystery at all when everyone is doing this, its rubbish. I feel like I'm playing a 2 year old game already.<br />
<br />
It's also ridiculously easy<br />
<br />
Back to EQ2 for me.</div></div><hr />

That also means you can't buy it back yourself after you discover that you just sold something worth 5 gold for 3 coppers.Actually, I believe I read something somewhere that stated you'd be able to reacquire items (buy back for the same price you sold) for a certain period of time (a few minutes) after selling to a vendor. Not sure if this will make release, or if it was just a stopgap during beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I definately did that last night, I sold my main weapon by accident (go go sleepy playing) , it gave me the option to re-buy my item for exactly the same price I'd mistakenly just sold it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm finding it's impossible to be in a group or in chat channels and not have people constantly babble on with spoilers mentioning exact stats / locations etc all taken from Thottbot. It's an absolute travesty that information so detailed exists already and certainly is impacting my experience in game for the worse :( You cant ignore it and just discover things.<br />
<br />
I just cant believe that every single detail is there in raw info , maps , quests, locations everything, you may as well not play the game and just read through everything by level.<br />
<br />
Finally, Minotaurs with GUNS !! pfft Tauren hunters are just wrong. bleugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Excuse The Noob Question But Whats Thottbot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">www.thottbot.com<br />
<br />
Lists just about everything you could want (or not ;p)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just phenomenally cool.  I KNOW I just did something stupid when I sell good gear to the vendor, no reason for the game to rub it in my face.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've followed the game quit a lot and for some time and it's not very hard to avoid spoilers.  I have used Thottbot for help on tradeskills occasionally.  I've only seen content up to lvl 20 in game and have plenty that will still be new and fresh for me when it goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont think any of the Dark Portal content is in beta, which probably is raid content as Nuttasaurus said, &quot;They are not releasing 90-95% of Raid content until the game goes live, it is being tested internally and is not available to Beta testers.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The hunger for cheats and walk-throughs is not unique to WoW. You can be sure there's people in the EQ2 beta carefully building up cheat lists which will be on websites the second the NDA vanishes.</div></div><hr />
