<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Gang,<br />
<br />
Used to play a Shaman on RN, played from 99 until about mid 2004.<br />
<br />
Level 70, fully time geared with some odd OOW stuff.<br />
<br />
Thinking about maybe comming back and playing a litte but there seems to have been a fair few changes, is their a convienient list somewhere or could someone maybe list out some changes.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
Nuggs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the meaningful input, perhaps if I said I quit approx. 7  months ago you would either provide some useful information or go play on your own thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">everyone is cancelling their accounts.<br />
<br />
we have better heals, dots, nukes, pets, AA's...everything is better but it's not good enough for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
if you enjoyed the shaman in 2004, you'll love it in 2005!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What spangaloid doesn't bother to mention is that everyone else is doing it even better.  Rytan is happily nerfing the crap out of the class, and cheerleaders and fanbois like Spangaloid are trying to tell us that everything is just fine.<br />
<br />
Basically, things are still getting worse.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and just about everyone fails to mention the handful of improvements being made to teh shaman class.<br />
<br />
the lowered resists on rain spells, the lowered agro on dots, the lowered resists on VP, etc...<br />
<br />
i'm not a fanboi, i'm not a cheerleader, i'm someone that enjoys playing the game of EQ as a shaman. i get out of this game what i put into it and if all i did was bitch about everything i'd probably be unhappy and quit too, but that's not the case for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nerfing the crap out of the class? He is correcting an issue that needed correcting. I dont see him reducing our heals spells or lowering our dot damage, or indeed making us into a leather class.<br />
<br />
Shamans are better than they were 2004. Im having hella fun.</div></div><hr />

Says who, besides him...and you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I enjoyed playing the shaman class a looong time before this whole leopard thing came about :).. It being nerfed is not going to stop me from playing.. I love the shaman class and will continue to play eq and enjoy it.  Not whine about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guys I dont want to distract you from your handbags at 5 paces but could we get back to the changes .......<br />
<br />
i.e. what is leopard and why are we upset they have nerfed it ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Read one of the 50 threads on the topic if you REALLY want to know...<br />
<br />
Also, when did OOW get released anyway?  I thought it was late 2004 if I remember correctly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the biggest change is we have a spell that we can cast every 2.25 seconds that increases the collective group DPS and not generate any ammount of agro to the casting shaman.<br />
<br />
that is leopard and panther. panther is the better of the 2 in terms of DPS, presently.<br />
<br />
i guess i should tell you what it does, instead of looking up the info on any number of threads and/or websites...<br />
<br />
you cast it on someone and it allows that person to proc anywhere from 550 to 1237, depending on AA's, for up to 1:30 minutes.<br />
<br />
the base proc of panther is 550 and the base duration is 1:00, presently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Accurate info, I gotta say...<br />
<br />
SPang must be getting paid by somebody.</div></div><hr />

You are a Fanboi, many think the sky is falling but you think SOEs s**t dont stink. It great you love the game but that does not mean we are not getting screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">we didn't have &quot;the spell&quot; for how many years?<br />
<br />
how are we getting screwed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EDIT: Nevermind all that pesky typing, I'll take my toys and go play on my own thread. /agree</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I believe it was a little more than five years that we did not have the spell spangaloid, during that time i was having a blast without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow, I love how much &quot;meaningful input&quot; this thread had yeilded the little feller who can't be civil while asking for, essentially, handouts.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Makes ya wonder if maybe being polite really would yield results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thank you for your meaningful input caanus although I fail to note a single act of impolitness on my part except perhaps if you are referring to me asking for meaningful input rather than inconsequential comments.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I would hardly call posting on a shaman forumn a short message asking for a brief update of changes to the shaman class over the last several months a &quot;handout&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the time it took you to make your brief comment you could perhaps have actually provided something useful......<br />
<br />
In anyevent, I wish you good luck and enjoyment in playing the game.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the information.<br />

If you are level 70 with all spells up through OOW, then there have been no meaningful changes.</div></div><hr />
