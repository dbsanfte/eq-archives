<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pullers who use cheap-ass arrows! Summoned arrows generate almost no damn agro. If I malo on inc before it gets to the group, I usually have the mob come beat on me a second. If the puller is using a decent crafted arrow, then that never seems to happen.<br />
<br />
Understandable tho, they are kinda expensive (especially after 5-6 stacks of them)<br />
<br />
Argh! Lol.<br />
<br />

Obviously the solution is to pull. I generally do these days unless I am somewhere that requires lull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be very surprised if the arrow type affected aggro any more than it would receive from doing more damage... and even then, archery is known for being super-low aggro due to it being non-melee damage.<br />
<br />
I can never get an arrow to pull aggro off a caster if they have cast something on the mob and I have not, maybe if I had a nice large hit or crit.  Also, in order to use archery, you need to be a certain distance away, and we all know proximity aggro is the best on a pull... so if you are closer than the archer, you have no chance.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if your puller isn't able to use some sort of taunting spell on the pull, i wouldn't suggest casting anything on inc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL!<br />
Dude, dmg matters not unless of course it's enuf dmg to put the mob into summon mode as seen above, hehe.  <br />
<br />
I think it's more a matter of if they hit the mob with the arrow.  Any hit at all will compensate for Malo aggro if you are standing behind the tank.  Get him to stand out in front of the pull path.  So many warriors just huddle behind the group, it's really pathetic.  <br />
<br />
So I think the factor you gotta watch is whether the tank has practiced archery at all.  if not, forget it.</div></div><hr />
