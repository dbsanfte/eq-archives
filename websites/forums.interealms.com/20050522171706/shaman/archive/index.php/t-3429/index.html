<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently out leveled my first character in EQ.  I played a druid to level 46 before I discovered that it wasn't the class for me.  Prior to that I tried a ranger who I took to level 16 and was not at all interested in.  But now I have a character that - when I get home from work or on a Saturday morning look forward to logging in as.<br />
<br />
I guess as a side note - I am also curious what you like as an alt, why you like that alt, and is this alt going to supercede your Shaman.  <br />
<br />
Thanks much<br />
<br />
Hmm I screwed up my poll (sorry first time doing it and meant to ask for option 4 &quot;Hate my shammy and am now a _____________&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I played my monk to 56 and then decided I wanted a partner so I made a shm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My shaman is tied for 2nd with my cleric.<br />
<br />
My first character was a wood elf bard (created after I did a little research and discovered that bards got a corpse locate song at level four! Boy, I hated trying to find my corpse under Kelethin).<br />
<br />
Everquest was a birthday gift from my boyfriend and at the time we only had one computer.  I played my little bard til 21 and he played an erudite enchanter to level 12 or so.  At that point, we realized the potential future addiction and bought a second account.  John really liked his enchanter and I was getting tired of the bard (kept getting lost, really wanted gate) so I started over on the second account.<br />
<br />
On Thanksgiving Day, 1999 I started a barb shaman and a high elf cleric on the same day.  I played the barb shaman and the high elf cleric to level 21 and then chose the barb shaman as my new main.  With my bard, I liked the healing and buffing aspect, but hated the group limitation of bard party buffs/heals.  Druids were too common, so cleric and shaman seemed the only logical choices.<br />
<br />
I finally settled on the shaman because I loved the utility stuff and clerics were just too one dimensional for me.  <br />
<br />
The wood elf bard remains half a blue from 22.  In a fit of mid 57 boredom, I played my cleric from 21 to 29, but aside from that, the shaman has been my only played character.  I &quot;twink&quot; only to dress characters, I never have wanted to seriously play any other class.<br />
<br />
Love the shaman class!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I played a Troll SK in beta and it was alot of fun.  I liked the roleplaying aspect of it and being a hybrid (I love spellcasters).  The SK was fun but when release came out I didnt feel like starting one because of the faction problems and such.  So I started a human monk at initial release as that has always been a favorite character to play also. I got him to 17 or so when my play time was cut down from the rising addiction of my then girlfiend.  Her druid at the clashing time was higher than my monk so I got a new account.  <br />
<br />
I didnt want to start over again so I started a Shaman as I heard they were king kiters ;) (was pre dot nerf) and good overall characters.  I was very close to being a troll but my girlfriend wanted a barb... I agreed as I didnt really want to deal with faction and such.  Besides they looked best in the old world plate.  So Hrothy was born.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would like to take this moment to personally thank the Aviak Chicks of butcherblock for kicking the living **** out of my ranger.<br />
<br />
The next character I rolled was a shaman.  Never looked back.<br />
<br />
Started a 2nd account rogue that is now 59, she is there to help me AAXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seem to have come full circle.  My very first character was a barbarian shaman.  When my friend and I started EQ very near its inception we had absolutely no one to show us the ropes.  I started a shammy and my friend started a druid.  We leveled up to 15 which took us a month because we thought we had to melee the mobs down with our splintered clubs as the mobs always seemed to interrupt our spells.  Have you ever seen a druid or naked shammy tank?  I'm sure it was the sheer number of corpses that we produced that caused many of the crashes early on in EQ.  About this time I became frustrated with my shaman and started a necro.  Since then I've played every other class to 30 or higher except for a cleric.  I decided to give my shammy another try since he didn't get a fair shot the first time.  He's now level 45 and by far my favorite class in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Blah. I misvoted as &quot;1&quot;-- the shaman was the first character I rolled.<br />
<br />
My friends had been playing for a month or two when I finally gave in and joined in, too. The person I'd looked over the shoulder of most was a barbarian warrior; I fell in love with the steppes.<br />
<br />
So, when I started, I was obviously going to choose a barbarian. And, one of my favorite comic books was a story about a Siberian shaman, written in the style of a tough-guy detective novel. It was called &quot;Muktuk Wolfsbreath: Hard-Boiled Shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest is history.<br />
<br />
I also really enjoyed playing a barbarian rogue, but I've lost interest since I stopped being one of the only three or four barbarian rogues I'd ever seen -- now everyone and their kinsman is barbarian.<br />
<br />
My vacation character is a wizard (now 52), because as a wizard I have a single specialty instead of diversity, and I can't buff anyone =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I started as a human ranger,  played for 2 months casual, dying over and over just sucking total ass. i saw a big barbarian run by at lightning speed and asked him what class he was and his answer was &quot;shaman&quot; <br />
<br />
I started asking  questions and that day july 6 99 chukzombi was created. i killed south qeynos guards with bernardo  (ranger) and sold the kite shields for 13pp and made about 100pp. with that i bought a full suit of black iron armor + black iron medallion and did the trumpy irontoe quest for a bloodforge hammer.  Retired the ranger. been powering ever since.<br />

327 days played since !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also started out as a human SK.  My friends had been trying to get me to play for a while and I finally gave in.  Got twinked by them in a set of flayed skin armour (they thought it was funny an SK wearing pink :p).  Another mate started playing at around the same time and started a necro.  <br />
<br />
When we got to the low 20's we decided to start a couple of chars that we could duo when both of us were on.  I had seen a troll in WC once and thought he looked awesome and loved the itchy butt animations (made me laugh), so I asked him if we could start Trolls.  Once we had decided what race to play the class list wasnt too difficult to narrow down.  Neither of us wanted to play an SK as was too close to what we had done before, so we chose as different classes as we could to our other chars.  He grabbed the warrior and I grabbed the shaman.<br />
<br />
Dont think either of us have looked back really.  I only ever really play my shaman, he plays his warrior or, when I am not on, his dr00d (nice to have someone else level a porter you can use :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My first character was an iksar warrior.  My friend had just started one up, and told me that if I was going to play I should start and level up with him and we could be twins.  One day, I was wandering around LOIO and I finally dinged level 23.  Then, I got killed by something and lost my level.  I didn't feel like running all the way back out there so I decided to do it another day.  My friend said &quot;don't worry, you have like a month real life time to go get your corpse.  just get it whenever.&quot;  A week and a half later, i went to go get my corpse and it wasn't there.  My shaman was born.  I picked shammy b/c my friend said &quot;I saw this level 60 shammy duelling.  no one could beat him.  all he did was buff his pet and no one could hurt either of them b/c they are so good at buffs.&quot;  I don't listen to this friend's advice any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In mid-2000, My 1st character was a human monk.  I leveled him to lv. 9.  At level 6, I tried to run him to Misty Thicket because I read somewhere it was a great zone for lv. 5-12.  I took him thru Kithicor at night time, I died 3 times and never did recover my corpse with my hard won equipment :).  <br />
<br />
About one month after the monk, I started my 2nd character, a halfling druid.  Really enjoyed those ports and the abilitiy to solo when not grouped with my guild mates.  Never did quad kite.  Took him to lv. 42 before I realized I wanted to melee some, was tired of running from mobs, rooting, rotting only. Hated being made of &quot;paper&quot; .  My 1st guild had recently broken up and I needed a change.<br />
<br />
Sooo, spring 2001, I created a Dark Elf Shadow Knight.  I really enjoyed being evil, hunting FP guards, etc.   Enjoyed getting some spells yet being a decent melee type.  At lv. 30, felt god-like with invis, engulfing darkness, fear, lifetap, and a pair of Jboots.  I could solo and group nicely.  Took the SK to 42 and was in a rut for hunting places and groups.  Was in a evil only role playing guild I was not happy with (too small and hardly anyone my level).  <br />
<br />
Luclin had just come out.....<br />
<br />
Soooo, created my 4th character, Vah Shir Shaman in January 2002.  I LOVE MY SHAMAN.  What a great class!   I love amazing guildmates and folks in pick-up groups with the wonderful things we can do.  Slow, Haste, Melee, DoT, Canni, Buff, Debuff!!!  My kitty shaman is now lv. 52 and remains my Main Character.  I split my time soloing and grouping (mostly with guilmates).<br />
<br />
I did create a 5th character, a halfling ranger, about 2 months ago.  I leveled him to 20 in 2 weeks, alterniating between him and my shaman.  The ranger is fun, but will never replace my shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My first was a human ranger that made it all the way to lvl 12 before stalling out in Blackburrow.  Got a cleric to lvl 10 but found that boring.  I found that without SOW I died frequently in WK and got lost (and killed) frequently in Everfrost.  Started my shammy because my RL wife and friend were starting and needed a healer type.  Quickly passed the lvl 10 cleric and lvl 12 ranger and never looked back.<br />
<br />
Now I've started another cleric, on a second account, and I'm actually enjoying him a lot more than I did the first time around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1st character was a human pally.. ugh.. hehe boy am I glad Kunark came out lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not counting a false start as a lvl 5 ranger, Snapdragn has been my only character.  Don't have any alts, although I've tried a couple up to around 10 - 14th lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I started the game with a Shaman but that was a Barbarian. I'm happy I tried an Iksar version, the race suited me much better.<br />
<br />
As much as I loved playing my Shaman, however, when I decided to switch servers the prospect of playing the same class again from 1 - 50+ wasn't all that appealing. I had always wanted to try a Rogue and, from my own experience, there never was one around when you needed them so I gave it a shot. I'm having just as much fun now as I did when I first started EQ. <br />
<br />
The Shaman class will always be one of my favorites and someday I might transfer my old one over but, for now, I'm playing a Rogue and enjoying every minute of it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't remember how many characters I started, maybe 2 or 3, but the shaman was one of them.  I played them each to about level 3 or 4 and stuck with the shaman because there were so many things in Everfrost to kill.  It wasn't until I was in my 30s that I started making alts, primarily to hold stuff that I couldn't sell to players and didn't want to sell to vendors (wow, those split paw gloves would be handy for a Druid...) and I would occassionally level them up to 10-ish but never played them seriously.<br />
<br />
I now have a lvl 52 cleric that is played between 4 people (we take turns playing her on raids &amp; take her in some dungeons for the exp) as well as a 29 wizzy (wanted to port my ass around.  Quit leveling him when I could bind at the firepots) and a 18 monk that was started to hold equipment (Hrm, FBSS.  I'll put it on the monk until I find a buyer) but I also play when I don't want to be bothered (because few people know that toon is me)<br />
<br />
Taladaen - shaman<br />
Yiliena - cleric<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My first character was a human SK, I got killed by Chanda Miller several times in Qeynos Hills. I finally deleted that toon for a Mage..I went human again. Got him to lvl 7 and lost his corpse in Blackburrow. Deleted that guy. Then I tried a Dark Elf Rogue but melee with no magic didn't seem all that appealing to me. Deleted her at 13.<br />
I then made a Iksar Necromancer, got him up to 18 and got tired of getting pummeled when my pet died. So I made a Iksar SK and got him up to 24 before making a Troll Shaman. Got him up to 19 before I decided to go back to my SK. Played him as my main until 43 and decided to retire him. Made an Iksar Shaman seeing as how I knew Kunark pretty well at this point and I haven't looked back. Storm is up to 42 now, I'm taking him all the way !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I wanted to play a melee character who could cast a few spells so my first character was a paladin.  When he got to the high teens I could see he was going nowhere.<br />
<br />
Then I read a post by Abashi saying that all classes had been reviewed and that they were all satisfactorily balanced: no siginificant changes would be made.<br />
<br />
So I started again.  Later of course big changes were made but its was too late for my paladin he was long dead.  I'm happy now with my shammie.  I can stand next to things and pretend to melee them, and I don't expect anything better from Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My first char about a week after it went live was a High-Elf Paladin, about a week after that(lvl 9) I made a high-elf mage.  played him till about lvl 16.  Then made My Shaman.  Played him till 45 without any interruptions.  When I hit 45, I got a little burnt, so I started up a Necro.  Ran him to 52 and missed my Shaman.  Went back to Lum got him to 52, then got married.  Now I dont really get to play anymore.  Have been slowly selling off all my gear.  Gonna twink up a Monk, just to play when I have an hour or so to BS with friends.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I read the book that comes with the game and decided there <br />
were a few &quot;must have&quot; abilitys. <br />
<br />
1) Summon my own food and water so I didn't have to worry <br />
about going back to town (was worried about starving to death).<br />
<br />
2) Gate <br />
<br />
3) SoW<br />
<br />
There were only two choices for me - Shaman or Druid. Druid's<br />
can port, but the friend of mine that got me into it was a Dark<br />
Elf SK. He wanted to start an all evil guild, so my Ogre Shaman<br />
was born. <br />
<br />
Played my Shaman to about 56 before I made a Druid twink. She<br />
stalled at level 25 several months ago. Started a wizzard too, <br />
that one stalled at level 6 or so. I *really* like the ports (never <br />
liked traveling by foot more then a couple of zones) but neither <br />
of them is half as much fun as my Ogre Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I said 3, but I guess it depends on your definition. I played at least 3 other characters, but none of them for very long or past 15th level.<br />
<br />
I tried wood elf ranger as my very first character (on Innoruuk), but I couldnt stand Greater Faydark. <br />
<br />
Then I tried human druid, and played that character up to 15th level, until I had to switch servers because Innoruuk was so unstable back then. <br />
<br />
I made a barbarian warrior on E'ci and played him to 8th level, then rerolled him as a shaman (Rathelon) and that was that.<br />
<br />
I've played other characters since (tons of them, actually), but only my shaman and my ranger have stuck around. The ranger was created back in Feb 2000 after I got a runed oak bow and a thunderhoof quiver off the centaurs in South Karana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I wish I could say that Bgum was my first character but he is around my 5th.  I started as a Wood Elf Ranger, all I ever played in D&amp;D so why not stick with what you have.  Later in a boring time with the guild I was in, I started a Dark Elf Necro to solo and play something totally different.  Got him to 23 and got bored.  Switched guilds and played my Ranger.  This is just before Kunark and PoF and PoH were the big things.  The guild I was in had 9 planes capable Rangers, 2 warriors and 1 rogue.  So I started a rogue and hated it.  Thus Barboki was born.  <br />
<br />
I made a Wizard twink since I knew our guild needed one but had 3 join shortly after so I then made Bgum.  I have totally enjoyed playing a shaman.  Both in groups and soloing and is a great break from my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I started in beta 4 as a Mage. I had read about the pets and wanted one badly. Having a portable Tank seemed like a nice thing.<br />
<br />
I carried Zorsha over And restarted on Tarew marr on the day of release.  Got to level 12 When I had enough of the jerks on Tarew marr.<br />
<br />
The day after E marr opened I moved and restarted Zorsha yet again. I was suffering under CNCS quite badly. (Constant New Charecter Syndrome) <br />
<br />
I made up Feather My human thief.<br />
<br />
Snoww My Barbarian shaman<br />
<br />
Fredrik My halfling leather foot Ranger  (okay he was a warrior)<br />
<br />
Pana My Barbarian enchantress (Cursed into the body of an erudite)<br />
<br />
And a few others that have been deleted.<br />
<br />
I got Zorsha to 20th realised that I was going nowhere. And started playing Snoww and Feather some.  I got Feather to 19th and in a fit of disgust at how broken Thieves were back then Quit playing her. (Before even minimum backstabs were implimented and Sneak hide togther for invis.<br />
<br />
I played Snoww some but 16th level about killed me with how weak the shaman were.  So I started playing Zorsha, Pana and Snoww in circles. <br />
<br />
A friend told me that I was getting nowhere. (and he was right) I was around level 20 with all of them and he and all my other friends were in thier 35 range so I made a choice. <br />
<br />
I chose Snoww. I played her as a tank however. Back then the bleeding edge were Maybe 40ish in level and Shaman were wearing All the wisdom gear they could muster.  I had 2 of the absolutly UBER 4 ac 45 hp rings and was being laughed at on a regular basis. (This was before Vox ever died on any server I belive)<br />
<br />
Over time I leveled up to 34ish  (PET!!!) and the Cramming was starting in Lower guk and Sol B. And I was not able to get groups nearly as often because people wanted a healer. Not a 111 wisdom Psudo tank shaman and Kunark was almost here.<br />
<br />
I had heard good things about the changes that were made to thieves, and the upcoming changes to thieves again in Kunark. So I dusted off Feather and started playing her again some I got her to maybe 24ish when Kunark came out. <br />
<br />
When Kunark came out I Explored with Snoww and ran into the grouping wall at level 44. People demaqnded I sit on my ass and heal only. No tanking. No pulling. No fun.<br />
<br />
I rebelled. I moved what I could to Feather and dropped off the face of the world for a week or two. I soloed with Feather a great deal. And Grouped up when I could and Blew through the levels to 60. I enjoyed almost all of Kunark at the levels that were intended for it. Droga at level 30ish. Nurga at 35ish (Dying a ton) Kaesora at 30 to 44ish. Karnors at 40 to 55ish. <br />
<br />
At 60 Feather had the chance to go into ToV with Da'kor / Magister a couple times but my connection couldnt handle it. And I enjoyed a group much much more than a raid. and most of my normal friends were around 52ish. So I retired Feather and broke out my old buddy Snoww.<br />
<br />
Now a change had come over Shaman.  AC gear and  HP gear were the norm, People needed shaman for thier slows with the beastys in Velious. People no longer shunned me when I took a few hits. I was able to play how I originally intended. A tank shaman. (It helped that two of my friends were a cleric and a Enchanter) <br />
<br />
I have gotten Snoww to 60 and 26 AA points now. I am meeleing when I want to. Casting when I want to. Pulling with the skills learned through years of play time.  (I would Kill for the cat shamans sneak skill, Sneakpulling rocks.)  I still tend to rotate to the rear from a year of a thief mentality but what the hell. <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. Born in the fire of Battle, raised to heal from the front of a line. To call down the spirits of decay and venom, to destroy the foes of Justice. To distract an enemy with a hoard of insects stinging at thier face. To wield a spear born of fate in one hand and a sheild made of the bones of a long dead foe. To lead a wolf made only of spirit  to gnaw at the heels of my quarry.<br />
<br />
I am a shaman. Spirit Caller. Ghost walker. The hammer of Justice in a cold dark night. <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. Healer, or bringer, of poisen and blight.<br />
<br />
I am a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bahdluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I chose 3 but only because that was the largest number.  <br />
<br />
I have played almost every class to level 10 and many to 20.  Currently I have a 43 SK and my shaman, who passed my SK  two days ago, 44.  When I started I really didn't know what class to play so I tried them all and decided I liked the SK.<br />
<br />
Then my fiancee and I made a guild and after hearing &quot;we need a healer&quot; so many times I finally got tired of it and made a shaman since I didn't want to be a cleric or druid very much.  Turned out that the shaman was really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shammies always interested me, but the fact that they're sometimes relied on to heal held me away for a good three years (I hate healing roles, and will avoid being the only healer in a group if I can).<br />

My Shammy is actually my 4th or 5th character; I've got a 60 Mage, 59 Warrior, and 56 Monk in line ahead of him; and a Bard and Wizzie who were both created prior to him, but aren't 55+ yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I started this game very randomly.  Kunark had just come out, and my brother had randomly won a copy of original everquest by entering some drawing at a store.  His computer could not handle EQ and so he gave it to me.<br />
<br />
I had no idea what I was in for, never having played a RPG or an online game like this.  Hell, I did not even read the fantasy genre or anything like that at the time.<br />
<br />
So I loaded up the game.<br />
Choose a random server - hello The Nameless.<br />
created a character that had &quot;low difficulty&quot;<br />
<br />
that happened to be a half elf warrior in Qeynos.<br />
I was always encumbered because elfs are weaklings and bronze armor is heavy.  After playing the warrior up to about level 25 or so, I started my first shaman.  I was tired of being slow, shaman got SoW.  I was tired of being unable to solo, I heard casters can solo well.  I was tired of being unable to save my group, I wanted to heal (might have been able to do better if i had ever put a point in taunt... oops).  I was tired of being encumbered so I heard shaman could buff str and stuff.<br />
<br />
I choose barbarian because I did not want to be evil and because I knew the Qeynos area.  Played my shaman to 14 or so then decided to switch servers.<br />
<br />
I started out fresh on Terris Thule just after it was split off.  I started an erudite necro and hated Tox.  I got to level 14 and lost everything in a server crash.  I went LD and came back and all my stuff was gone.  The server message of the day said it was a server wide issue and all you had to do was petition and say you needed a restore and then your things would be returned to you.<br />
<br />
I petitioned and heard nothing for hours.  So I went to blackburrow and was fighting again when a nice guy came by and gave me 100pp and a thurmaturgist robe.  I was floored.  I ran back to qeynos and bought the spells i was missing in the sewers.  <br />
<br />
Then I got a message I had been disconnected.   Log back in and the GM had done a rollback on my char without talking to me and I lost all the spells, money and items I had just got.  Plus like 6 hours of exp.<br />
<br />
The GMs were unsympathetic.  They said I asked for my items to be restored and I should have known what would happen.  (That my char would be reset to a previous save)  I was pissed and did not play for like 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
Then I logged in and started Henora.<br />
twinked her out with a savants cap, blackened iron medallion, 2 backpacks and like 10 pp.<br />
<br />
My necro remains level 14 and is my mule in the EC tunnel.<br />
I haven't logged into my chars on the Nameless since the day I left.  <br />
<br />
The only time my faith in this class was shaken was when I was level 30.  I couldn't ever find a group, I couldn't find anything to solo.  I died like 15 times without rezzes.   I started my rogue.  Twinked to the best of my abilities  and played her to like level 20.  My rogue remains my only serious and highest level twink at level 29.  I take her out to solo from time to time...sometimes its fun to be an indestructable megatwink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I tried a few classes but they never got above 10th level. I stayed with a bard until 18th but hated the fact that I couldn't just run by and help people. That's when I started a barbarian shaman and never looked back. Falora is my main and the only one that I've stuck with. My only other character that I play much of is a twinked monk that I play when I can't find something to do with Falora or I just want to be the one that does the hitting.<br />
<br />
But the shaman is pretty much what I want to be.<br />
<br />
Falora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My friend who got me hooked on EQ told me to make a dwarf pally so that was my first char.  15 levels later I got shaman envy and abandoned my little guy to make a shiny new shammie!  <br />
<br />
60 levels later I came back and leveled the pally to 33 where he sits . . . unused.  <br />
<br />
I have a lvl 52 monk I leveled up myself without PLs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I started with a Dwarven Paladin.  Learned to melee, learned to cast, learned to map attack the hell away from &quot;a&quot; as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Left him at level 9.<br />
<br />
Next up was a High Elven Wizard.  Learned to die.<br />
<br />
Started Shandy, built her as a tank (points into dex/agi, wis, cha) that could cast.  <br />
<br />
Now finding out that Gnecromancers can be almost as much fun, but not planning on putting Shandy aside any time soon.  I have 5.9 levels to go... and a bajillion AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Beta 4 I played a barb rogue.<br />
<br />
When EQ went live my first char was Naag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well... I had shaman then warrior then rogue then shaman then necro then warrior then ench then wiz then shaman then necro to 53... then I got banned for swearing :(  and came back.. got my shammy to 59.. can't believe I ever played another class<br />
<br />
I had a druid and an SK and a ranger too<br />
<br />
And about 5 monks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Raikor is my 1st PC and play him abt 99% of the time. Shaman just seems to fit for me. Am trying a warrior out, but it's just not the same...I'm sure most of you know what i mean :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1st char was a barbie warrior. I felt like such a rube. I'd be down in the maze killin skellies, then get jumped by a vengeful and try to run away and get lost. Finally discovered the secret of PRINTING OUT MAPS and got to where I found a world beyond the icy maze.<br />
<br />
Eventually got up to where I could kill the skellies so I felt like I could take on anything. Went with a buddy to Blackburrow, found this hut, and dropped to the lower pits of doggie hell. We tried to find our way out and got slottered. Sat at our bind points and whined to the guy who got us into this game.<br />
<br />
He brings over his ogre shammy, pulls our dead butts out of BB, and lights our screens up with those glorious buffs. I decided I wanted to make myself run fast like that, but I had enuff of the not-so-great white north. So I reincarnated in the swamp and the rest is hitory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Oh lord.  I started as a meat shield on Mith Marr.  Barbarian warrior that I got up to 30.  I was so proud of my complete set of bronze armor.  I lived in CT as well.  I think I quit playing at 30.  He might still be there!  I stopped playing for like 9 months.<br />
<br />
Chutoi was my 2nd character, and came out almost immediately after kunark was released.  So much nicer than a meat shield . . . !<br />
<br />
Go shaman!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've started a number of different races &amp; classes &amp; didn't like most of them &amp; they were deleted. I did create an Iksar Shammy &amp; loved her! Also have a human monk. a Dark Elf Necro, &amp; a Vah Shir bard as well as some lower level toons that mostly mule. <br />
I like my shammy so much, I started up a Vah Shir Shammy on another server. :) <br />
I enjoy feeling useful &amp; in the higher end game, shamans are very useful! Wouldn't trade my shammy in for anything! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Mums, my pretty troll shaman, was my first real char (not counting trials below level 4). My boyfriend had started a troll sk and one day in the swamp he met a shaman who wanted to group with him. The next day he was lyrical over the SoW and the buffs and all he had gotten from the shaman, and since I liked to play abjurer from before (text MUDs only) I said OK to try it out.<br />
<br />
At level 9 when I got SoW I realized this was the best choice and stuck with Mums for 60 levels and some AAexp before I got time over to even think of making a twink. <br />
<br />
Now I have 2 twinks closing in on 50, a ranger and a shaman. I know it must sound crazy but shaman is the funniest I've managed to play here on EQ so when we tried out PvP a shaman was the only char I didn't re-roll after few days :p <br />
Didn't go troll the second time around tho' - have to have some change in life ;)</div></div><hr />
