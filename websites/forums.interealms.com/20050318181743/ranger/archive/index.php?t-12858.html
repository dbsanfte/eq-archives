But I am sad that Rangers didn't get some more resist spells.A endure magic sure would have been nice,Druids get it.I don't think it would be overpowering.<br />
<br />
 I feel the same about endure disease and endure poison.We already have cure poison and cure disease so I think the lower level resist spells would at least be in line.<br />
<br />
 I would give up the flameing/burning arrow spells easily for the trade.<br />
<br />
 The group I was in the other night were actually surprised that Rangers didn't get those endure spells-especially endure disease and poison. It may not be a big issue for a full balanced group  but would certainly help the soloers and small groups grinding exp.imo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it funny that someone 50+ would &quot;trade&quot; their lower level spells for something like resist buffs.<br />
<br />
Issue being that the arrow spells were put in to allow lower level Rangers to do damage via mana with more reliability, our old DD spells pre 50+ were a joke...Careless Lightning and its 99 damage in I believe it was close to 3 seconds. Yay...30 dps...with the weapons which nowadays are standard at level 39 (Ive yet to see anything worse than a Yak or Velium Brood Axe) our low level DD spells were useless.<br />
<br />
Thats like a level 65 Ranger saying that he would gladly give up SoW because he already has SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcdew</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see your point.I remember useing my Tolan Arms with stinging swarm to pull in DL.They actually have a decent  <br />
range on them and wasn't as restrictive as my bow.<br />
 <br />
 To retouch my points,I would have liked to get some different endure buffs.&lt;scratch the giveing up arrow spells, or any spells for that matter&gt;<br />
 <br />
 I can see were lower level Rangers needed better DD's.But the recast times and cast times are too similar to really make that much of a difference.In fact,they actually even out as Arrow spells take longer to recycle than Careless lightning.  If I remember CL takes .75 more cast time but recast is instant and does 21 less damage.<br />
<br />
 I do see that with the arrows spells it gives a Ranger more of a variety between a magic based DD or fire based one at those levels and even beyond.<br />
<br />
Now as whether you would use them or not in a small group,maybe it is just the way you play,but fighting in ME or Wakening Lands it sure would have helped me.Example: Ice Forged Shackles Quest/Holgresh. I am not saying it can't be done without as I did them solo at 49 but I was just saying.<br />
<br />
Besides, a few extra endure buffs wouldn't help anyway,right?</div></div><hr />

Basically Uber Wish List.  He's actually equipped more mortally if you click on the links and read his short term goals and stuff.</div></div><hr />
