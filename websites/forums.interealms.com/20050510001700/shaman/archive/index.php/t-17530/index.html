<br />
October 31, 2003 The Heart of Norrath (http://www.theheartofnorrath.com) will be sponsoring a Serverwide Chat Night &amp; a Cazic Thule Halfling Run. <br />
<br />
The Halfling Run Details:<br />
1. No Twinking<br />
2. You must be level 1<br />
3. The only gear you can have is that which drops of a mob that your level 1 halfling has killed (themselves with no assistance) or that which is given to you upon character creation by your guildmaster. <br />
4. No Buffs unless you’re level 1 halfling can cast them on themselves. <br />
5. No Ports<br />
6. No Portal Devices<br />
<br />
The rout is as follows: (on the Cazic Thule Server) From Kith to WC to EC to Freeport to Freeport Arena for Ale, Cake and level 1 Halfling PVP!<br />
<br />
Meet in Kith at the Rivervale entrance no later then 7pm EST the Run takes place at 7:10pm EST and (officially) ends at 8pm EST. <br />
<br />
Join the Serverwide Chat Channel (serverwide.thon:halloween) for chitchat and fun during the run!<br />
<br />
Cake and Ale will be provided for this event!<br />
Drunken Dules are at hand! (binds will be offered by Camibella so you don’t have to run all the way back if you die)<br />
My level 1 Halfling (for contact information) is Thontincami<br />
<br />
Serverwide Chat Night:<br />
/join serverwide.thon:halloween on October 31st at 8pm EST – 9:30pm EST for chit chat and a meet and greet of all THoN members and friends! The channel will be up all day, but the meet and greet is scheduled during the times listed above. We hope to see you all in the channel! =) I’m sure it will be full of lil halflings from 7pm on =)<br />
<br />
Most of all, Whatever you do! Have a safe and happy Halloween!</div></div><hr />
