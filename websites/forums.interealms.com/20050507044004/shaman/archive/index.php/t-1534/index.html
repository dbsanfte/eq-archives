** Cleanup Patch **<br />
<br />
We're sorry to have to patch again so soon, but there are some issues that we felt should be taken care of right away.<br />
<br />
- Fixed NPC's multi spawning in Grimling Forest<br />
- Fixed a spawning issue related to the Coldain 10th Ring War<br />
- Fixed assorted issues with several other zones<br />
- Fixed a bug that made archery work like Innoruuk's own machine gun<br />
- Fixed the Petrifier Cockatrice name truncation in Dreadlands<br />
- Fixed Innoruuk's Chosen name truncation in the Plane of Hate<br />
- Fixed a memory leak in the animation player<br />
- Tavee's shoulders effect has been changed to specifically exclude affecting the duration of the Donal's Chestplate timer effect<br />
- Naki's rings now report the altered casting time properly<br />
- Most NPCs in the world will now return items that they don't care about. Summoned pets can still be handed anything you like<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing GMs to be incomprehensible to players if they did not share a common language on Firiona Vie<br />
- Fixed a bug that was preventing players from being able to turn off /roleplay on Firiona Vie <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing bard song modifiers (such as Instrument/Singing Mastery and Puretone) to break if the combined bonuses went too high<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing some quests to think they required a higher faction than they actually did<br />
- A quest for a new high level Druid spell is now live (requires Luclin)<br />
- Addressed a balance issue with high end Magician and Necromancer pets by improving them. (Half of this change went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.)<br />
- Improved many rewards in an overall rebalancing effort of many Luclin encounters. (This went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.)<br />
- Made stacking changes to allow more spells to stack with Dance of the Blades.<br />
<br />
- The EverQuest Team<br />

** News arrives from Freeport **<br />
<br />
The streets of Freeport have been overtaken by greed and turmoil. The conflict between the Dismal Rage and the law-abiding citizens of Freeport has reached a boiling point. New heroes have been called on to aid both sides in the constant power struggle of this city. Numerous guildmasters have advanced the training that is given to all those brave enough to rise from Freeport, either for good or for evil. The Commonlands have also started to see strange new individuals and even stranger creatures. There is also word that the Deathfist Orcs have begun to stockpile supplies for an unknown reason. Citizens knowing the nature of the Deathfist Orcs are preparing themselves for anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Late arriving news from Ak'Anon **<br />
<br />
It has not been long since two wayward gnomes returned to their home city of Ak'Anon, one empowered with gifts of a Paladin of Brell and the other wielding the dark knowledge of a Shadowknight of Bertoxxulous. Already pupils have flocked to the chapel of the Deep Muses and the mines of the Dark Reflection to learn the secrets and skills these opposing masters possess. Led by their new champions of Brell, the Deep Muses, Gem Cutters, and Eldritch Collective have begun a campaign to exterminate the Dark Reflection from the mines of Ak'Anon and their cherished homeland, the Steamfont Mountains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go read the quest forum, there have been three posts in the last day of people that had their ghiosk books eaten, only to have the GM's tell them it was a faction issue.  I hope this patch fixes that and that these people get their books back (and that when I go to turn in my books later when I get home from finals that they don't get eaten :D)<br />
<br />
edit:  and also that guy that got his 7th shawl eaten (ouch)</div></div><hr />

aye, i remember getting a good laugh out of the first 800 or so petrifier cock's i killed - then.... the novelty wore off :(</div></div><hr />

It sure is good to see that the PET CLASSES are getting a boost. Yep, I approve of these positive changes for the PET CLASSES. I do not mind that our level 55 pet was not improved, since we are not members of a PET CLASS. Not in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Good for necros and mages, they needed the boost. Bunch of things added. If you take this patch in consideration with yesterday it's only marginal nerfage =P</div></div><hr />

Actually, last night they were showing up just as &quot;A pet&quot; (I've slain a pet !!) - that's probably what they're fixing.</div></div><hr />

Have you noticed that if you say to your group: &quot;A Petrifier Cockatrice incoming&quot; then group members with the swear word filter turned on see &quot;A Petrifier hgnhdjwlbe incoming&quot;? :)</div></div><hr />

P.S. Down with the Freeport Militia!</div></div><hr />

&lt;sigh&gt; wonder when they will get around to Oggok.  That place is the ghetto.  The only reason I like going to Grobb is so I can feel good about Oggok.</div></div><hr />

You mean we have pets?  You must be mistaken.  Just ask VI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can only repeat what Abashi stated oh so long ago when asked why our pet is so weak: &quot;its not a pet, its a 'companion'&quot;.<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time trying to make my doggie sit up and do tricks, I tried conversing with it.  I told it to either draw or whistle Dixie.  None of these worked: it appears that to Verant a 'companion' is nothing more than a weak pet.<br />
<br />
And so, I can only repeat (again) what Abashi stated: &quot;its not a pet, its a weak pet&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personally I work better without a pet around, so I could care less about what they don't do to shaman pets.  I cant stand keeping an eye on the little sl00t.  Kinda ironic because on my beastlord I always have the warder up ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spitulski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Talendor in 30 seconds? <br />
<br />
That's 32k in 30 seconds, divide by 2 = one ranger doing 16k in 30 seconds which is almost 534dps. <br />
<br />
Machine gun indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The archery issue was that bows had a zero delay as long as you were significantly above or below your target, and no range so you could hit a mob from across the zone.<br />
<br />
Lots ranger dings yesterday as we could take down virtually any mob without even aggroing it due to distance. Only problem was getting enough arrows.  There were archery DPS logs of well over 100.<br />
<br />
Was fiun while it lasted, but we all knew it wouldn't last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">with AM3 and endless quiver, a ranger could rack up HUGE dmg totals with no delay on the range attack.  When they said 30 second killing of talendor, id imagine they meant exactly that.<br />
im very surprised they didnt drop the servers as soon as they were aware of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">These are not my logs. Names changed to protect ... them. It was all 1 ranger btw.<br />

F^*% OFF you ar not depeendant on your pet, so DROP IT NOW<br />
<br />
Do you have your pet up all the time? do you rely on your pet to NOT FREAKING DIE? <br />

<br />
a mage without his pet = dead, worthless mage.<br />
<br />
the mage class is very powerful if they use their pets right, but completely gimp if they don't.  they needed an upgrade.<br />
<br />
the shaman class is very powerful regardles of whether or not they use their pet.  its just a minor augmentation.<br />
<br />
necros are inbetween.  they aren't 100% reliant on their pet, since they have roots and snares to keep the mob from owning them, but its still a very important part of their class.</div></div><hr />
