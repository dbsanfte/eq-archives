<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Brenlo talks to the monks (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Monks&amp;message.id=539&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=1) <br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't see a problem with that. The Monks were hit hard with the mitigation nerf, and in my opinion need more help than the mages who are getting upgrades left right and center.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I still think we have issues that need sorting out at the top end, but I don't begrudge the monks getting some attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont have a problem with them getting some attention either, but why single them out? Do other class groups on the SOE pages have a similar thread started by Brenlo? If not then he needs to fix that and start them. There are several classes outside the Trinity that need some review, especially in GoD content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still don't see what the big deal is? He specifically asked for a list of what they considered was broken, and not for ideas on how to fix them, or for class envy posts.<br />
<br />
In the past the devs have only really focused on one class at a time and they have decided that it's the monks turn? They probably think that we've had our &quot;fix&quot; with the new heal and the upgrade to quiescence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monks are due for a fix.  SoE has no idea what to do with shamans so expect that fix to take longer anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah those PDB cant even solo, they are in worse shape than us and they stick up for us pretty often.<br />
<br />
Have to say I personally support any help sent the Monks' way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree.  Monks need it bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not just that the SoE has no idea what to do with the shamans, though. It's also that SoE has no idea there is a need of something to be done with the shamans in the first place.<br />
<br />
Nice turn for the Monks though. Good for them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First I sincerely hope the monks get the mitigation nerf reversed and some much needed attention from the devs. Looked through this thread and was just amazed at the last two comments by Brenlo:<br />
<br />
Taken from page 1 and page 8 from the Monks thread on EQ class forums (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Monks&amp;message.id=539&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=1) <br />
<br />
Actually the fact that not all classes can solo is not indicative of imbalance.  Class balance is perhaps not the correct term to use as it implies that all classes will be equal.  I think that all classes being equal would be boring.  What class balance should mean is that each class has a viable role.  <br />

It should be about making all classes equally fun.<br />

Very true Xaynn, Although each class should be fun for different reasons and to different play styles as well. Some folks like being in the thick of things as a warrior while others prefer to stand back and deal damage from afar.  Each class should be distinct and enjoyable.  That is the challenge the development team faces.   <br />
<br />
I have forwarded this thread along to some of the devs and they have been following it.  If they give me any feedback I will post it.  I will also encourage some of them to post as well.  <br />

Now wouldnt it be nice if they actually implemented this across the board and made it viable to all classes within the game. Honestly not trying to steal the thunder from them actually talking to the monks but it would be nice to hear what viable role each class is supposed to offer in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry, maybe I didn't give enough info with that opening post.<br />
<br />
Yes I agree that monks deserve the attention, for the reasons you stated, etc. I am happy they are finally getting looked at, more power to them.<br />
<br />
I just think that it's weird that they get a topic started by brenlo asking what they think, when we can't even get anyone to say anything at all to us. I agree they deserve the attention, but...we need some sort of acknowledgement too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I Totally Agree with everything said, and to be honest I think we should help out the monks for the time being, they have it worse off than us in general.  However I dont agree with saying we need attention - No we already got our attention, but nothing was done.  I'm not complaining im just saying SoE really has to begin to take the outcrys of the classes a little more seriously and get on it fast.<br />
<br />
Sure I'm sure they are trying, but with GoD many new classes are mad and they really should begin to create some ideas.  Personally I think if Brenlo made a thread somewhere along the lines of a poll or something for what each class that feels shafted wants, so we know the progress of whats going on instead of getting small messages keeping it very low, hell I dont think we were informed much about Daluda's Mending.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I dont think we will get much more changes since we already got what we wanted, whatever though, its their game, its their choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SOE was never in need to listen to their customers,sad but true.<br />
Now that a big storm is comming up i.e A Blizzard =) they &quot;try &quot;to be customer friendly.<br />
To late sorry.<br />
Btw if you still hope they WILL FIX anything ( doesnt matter which class ) you should REALLY wake up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So a post Brenlo put up almost 2 weeks ago, is what?<br />
<br />
He's responded to posts in the shaman area before and after that one. He's posted in all the other boards as well.<br />
<br />
If you read towards the end of that post series, you'll find alot of folks questioning the purpose of it. Many folks feel like it's an attempt to appease and quiet up the &quot;vocal upstarts&quot; with a pat on the head and &quot;we'll look into it&quot; type reaction, then hope to sweep it under the rug and move on.<br />
<br />
Honestly not sure where I'd like to be. Ignored or patted on the head condesendingly. I do know, if I'm expected to thump my leg like a good little puppy, I'll bit him in the ankle.<br />

<br />
In effect isn't this what happened when they came and graced us with their presence on several threads? A few posts and people come out of the woodwork claiming a need for patience and to quit &quot;whining&quot; about our lack of a role.<br />
I understand they need to communicate with all the classes and that everyone feels their class is in dire straits compared to all the other classes. Yet, I ask exactly how long does it take to make a daily hell weekly post simply stating what they are looking into and the progress of that research? SOE has now created all these new boards on the EQLive page including a development board would it be to tasking and such a burden to keep a running thread about class balance?<br />
The greatest downfall to a relationship is a lack of communication and that is exactly what is happening here. Simply communicate with your customers and you might be amazed to what extent they will go to accomodate your development and research for the betterment of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently shaman's role is in long drawn out fights in older content zones (assuming this is what you wanted to know).  Which means that shaman are obsolete in new content, but are just fine in old content.  At least this is my understanding from information posted from the latest fan faire.<br />
<br />
I don't know why anyone would be upset about monks getting upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Brenlo made a post asking for what monks thought was broken.  He could have read several of the many well thought out posts Monks have already made, or the monk petition.  Instead he asks for problems, oh but not fixes. /boggle <br />
<br />
Most people see this as either a &quot;pat on the head&quot; placate move or a fishing expedition to get content for the next expansion.  Either way, nothing for anyone to be excited about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Good for monks. IMO, they're truely the only class that's worse off than Shaman. As a matter of fact, I don't think I've grouped with a monk since the day they made PoV 55+ available. Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yikes, hehe, this turned into a bigger thing than I meant it to. I didn't intend for it to become a big discussion and stuff. Just wanted to point out that he starts a thread there, and the only post we get says that dogdog won't get duel wield. Not a big deal, just felt like saying something. Sorry if people took it more seriously than I meant it.<br />
<br />
Ok, I just read the thread about one of the shaman posts getting attention now, so this makes this thread obsolete.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally I think brenlo is a clueless idiot that just tells people what they want to hear so they will shut up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Honestly, as it's been said already here, monks have been in need of some serious help for a while.  I'm personally quite glad to see them getting a little needed TLC.  Hopefully they'll bring something to groups again, and be as valued as they once were.  At least, I know that's what I want, assuming they get around to working on us, too.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />
