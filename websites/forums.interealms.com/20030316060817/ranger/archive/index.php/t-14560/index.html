i just started playing everquest not too long ago, due to my boyfriend getting me into the roleplaying world again. i started a warrior at first because i liked the idea of pure fighting (though now i realize that i should have started a monk if that's what i wanted). i didn't like that, got that character to level 3 or 4, and started a druid. the whole soloing bit really didn't appeal to me much, so i started a mix between the two, a ranger. i absolutely LOOOVE my ranger. it's only level 25, but that's only because i don't play too often. if i did, i swear i'd be level 60 by now. i've started numerous other characters out of boredom, and got them all to about level 8, then quit them. in my opinion, rangers are the most fun class to play. <br />
so i hate it when people make fun of rangers or don't have use for them in groups. i KNOW that there are more of you out there that play rangers as your mains that feel the same way i do. i take everything personally, which is a flaw in my personality, but when people make fun of my char it really does hurt my feelings. as geeky as that sounds, it's true and i'm sure all of you have had that uncomfortable twang in your chest when someone picks fun at your class, your character, or even worse, you.<br />

Corenia shouts, &quot;First of all, rangers have track filters! Druids can't beat that with their fancy ports. We explore more. we range! Why? Because we're rangers. And we look cool.

<br />
That's your first mistake. You may not know it yet, but Lake of Ill Omen is the cesspool of EQ. While some people there can be ok, it's mostly filled with morons, children, and noobs who think their idiotic behavior is cool. Pick up your bags and find a new hunting spot if the language is not to your liking, because I assure you other places can be a lot better. Welcome to the Glade, too. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much so your feeling as they really hurt your ego or your pride.  Which ever comes first.  You'd be in shambles and tears if you had your feelings hurt, really.<br />
<br />
It can't be helped.  No matter how much you fight it and show people how great you are, there will always be ignorance.  Such bliss.  But you cackle with glee every time you prove someone wrong and show how better you are than they thought and gaggled about.<br />
<br />
I'm a kick ass damage dealer.  Used to think I would be able to match plate tanks in tanking abilities one day, but I've set that aside, seeing the latest zones.  Tanking stuff in the high end PoP zone stuff just scares me like a panzy, so I leave it to the regular tanks and tank only when I need to keep things going.</div></div><hr />

First off I love my Ranger, something I never thought I'd say....<br />
Also he is my main. Now to the meat of it, there is not one class in this game that gets picked on more than us.... I hate that but, it's the fact. Plus, you get sooooo many twink rangers out there, they have no clue how to play the game as a ranger because they are so twinked they might as well be a warrior. Heh, this doesn't last...Once you hit you 40's and 50's all that twinkness goes away for the most part. BUT, once you reach 50, the rangers life of hell begins... LFG is your new last name. My suggestion to you if you haven't already done so is to find a big ass guild that accepts lowbies... look at thier webpage.. and try em out... Guilds can be a big help... or not...The Rangers life is not easy... I'm still waiting for uberness at 56....<br />

You know that rangers rock, you have fun playing a ranger, thats the important thing. :)<br />
Heck most of the lowbies continue on ranger bashing because they dont know better. <br />
Fact is, rangers rock, if well played. Ok like any other class, but rangers are a tad harder to play than most imho. <br />
About oocin and such, well depends how testily and wittily you can respond, but usually ignore morons is easier. :)<br />
And there are better zones for xp, in the old world, or in kunark or in velious or even luclin. :) At 25, try to camp a bit deep in Mistmoore for example. Risky at first but LOTS of fun to be had.<br />

Or Dawnshroud, though that's prolly better for the 30+ crowd.<br />
<br />
I started playing around 9 months ago now, and after hearing a dozen or so complaints about LOIO, I avoided the place very carefully. Of course, I ran into the distilled LOIO'ers in DL in the end, when I thought 'Dreadlands' was a place filled with unspeakable horrors.<br />
<br />
Turns out my opinion was correct, even though it was a different sort of horror :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/bonk, welcome to the glade.  I hunted in Loio once, couldn't stand all the jerks there.  I will tell you one thing, in the high end your friends will tease you about dieing fast and stuff.   But when it comes down to it, they are just joking and know you will beat them in a duel.  Actually learning how to play a ranger and being good at it will get you many groups.  At first it will be tough, because they may not know you yet.  Once they see you save the chanter or cleric, or pull singles where no others could, they will be asking for you all the time.  Trust me,  it is a hard start we have, and ranger is one of the harder classes to play.  But played right we are the most fun and sought after class.  Do try to stay out of Loio, it will only bring you grief.  *Remembers feeling like choking a few jerks there*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went to LOIO and hated it for the crowds. They all hated me too, but, I never got so many group offers. It went something like this.<br />
<br />
Cool_Warrior01 shouts, &quot;Warrior LFG!&quot;<br />
He gets group.<br />
I shout &quot;30 Ranger lfg&quot;<br />
Everyone else randomly bashing rangers.<br />
<br />
A few solo fear kite kills later.<br />
<br />
Cool_Warrior01 shouts &quot;Is there anything left to kill?&quot;<br />
I shout &quot;Get track and find out. I can track about half the zone.&quot;<br />
I get flooded with group offers. I turn all down, stating, as they <br />
said before &quot;Rangers are useless and I can solo here anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
People start bashing Rangers again.<br />
Few more kills later, everyone not having static spawn camps goes &quot;Is there anything left?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shout &quot;Yeah, I'm killing blue cons left and right. Too bad Rangers are useless for groups huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Whole zone shuts up.<br />
<br />
Did that for a few levels, left, went back to Unrest. If you think LOIO is fun, go to Warsliks, only thing not there are the people and Sarnak fort. Kromdul instead. Heh.<br />
<br />
Warsliks is the spot where the intelligent Kunark goers at that level hunt. Less annoying people, and more free spawns.<br />

Who said flaws were a bad thing?<br />
<br />
Anyway, LoIO is full of the less than intelligent players, as well as my favored solo'ing grounds (22-30) for priest hybrids. Best bets are to keep shout and OOC filters off, unless you are LFG (but why would you wanna go and do something like that? :) )<br />
<br />
Here is an experience I ahd in LoIO a long time back...<br />
&lt; Bad Ranger &gt; Can some one PL me two gold bars so I can be lvl 22?<br />
&lt; randomplayer1 &gt;Gold bars? You mean yellow?<br />
&lt; randomplayer2 &gt;Mine look gold<br />
&lt; randomplayer3 &gt;Mine are orange<br />
...useless banter on what the color of the xp bar is...<br />
&lt; Me &gt;Of all this talk about color, the fact of the matter is that there is a Ranger who cant get xp for theirself. How sad?<br />
&lt; randomplayer4 &gt;Ouch<br />
<br />
The truth is Rangers have a bad rep, but with the people who post here, it shouldnt last much longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Corenia, the people who make comments about rangers sucking are just people who don't know much about the class.<br />
<br />
Up till the 30's and such, rangers can tank pretty much as well as any class out there.  In fact, many mid 20's groups will take rangers over warriors simply to have a tank with utilities.<br />
<br />
As you start getting into your 40's and 50's, you can't tank as well as SK's, Paladins, or Warriors, but you will outdamage them for the most part.  Offensive nukes, better atk rating, and duel wielding will usually make it so you have a higher DPS than either of these 3.  Unless they have some really sweet weapon, but that's not really a fair comparison.<br />
<br />
When you get into your late 50's and 60's, and you get some AA's, you will never look back.  A ranger with EQ and AM aa's will outdamage a warrior, paladin, or SK easier than you can say &quot;Rangers Own You&quot;.  And a ranger will pretty much always outdamage an SK, Paladin, warrior, melee wise, as long as you have somewhat equivalent weapons.<br />
<br />
Rangers are NOT tanks.  Comparing our tanking ability to a Warrior, Paladin, or SK, you might as well compare a rogue, or a bard.  Rangers are really secondary damage dealers.  We &quot;can&quot; tank if needed, but if you let us do our thing, we dish out lots of damage, have some nice utilities like snare, root for ghetto crowd Control, easy aggro management *gaining or losing it*<br />
<br />
A good ranger can probably save a group in trouble better than any other melee class out there.  We have our place, unfortantely some people just haven't learned what it really is and make stupid comments like, Rangers Suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The reason I propagate anti-ranger propaganda is because 2/3 of the people who piss me off are rangers. ^_^  Most rangers start out being conned dubious from me and have to work up from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, for every good, psychotic Ranger out there we have 4 Twink ones going &quot;I have snare! That's all I need!&quot; And then you get screwed up. A good Ranger can, and will, save his group faster than most other melee classes usually. A Bad Ranger will get them killed faster than you can shout &quot;Ranjah Down!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Rangers are NOT tanks.  Comparing our tanking ability to a Warrior, Paladin, or SK, you might as well compare a rogue, or a bard.<br />
<br />
Don't write bards off so quickly :)<br />
<br />
My bard often has more AC than the pickup group tanks I group with and almost always has more AC than the rangers I group with.  Like rangers, bards have come a long ways since the old days.  When you see that 60AC bp drop, it used to be a given that bards couldn't wear it. Now we often can.  Pair that higher AC with better songs, and better weapons and double attack through AA, and we're not the same as our old days at all.</div></div><hr />

sadly they will never stop knocking rangers, whether seriously or in jest.<br />
To some extent you just have to roll with it. And to some extent we ARE a gimped class - though at your level you can tank about as well as a warrior assuming equivalent gear (probably better if you consider aggro control).<br />
<br />
Something to think on - there's a guy in our guild who has a 50+ toon of nearly every class out there. Cleric, Rogue, Shaman, Monk, Chanter, some others I don't know about.  Ranger was about the last class he tried - and he reckons it is more fun than any of the others.<br />
<br />
You will need to play your class as skilfully as you can, to make up for various prejudices.  I know that once I get into a group - those people are always happy to group with me again.<br />
<br />
Recent situation in DL. (Bit low for me now - but only place we could get a quickie group). Me and girlfriend's warrior join group, with Cleric, Chanter, Monk.<br />
Monk is pulling, girlfriend is tanking, regular stuff, ok group.<br />
Cleric: falling asleep, sorry, gotta go.<br />
Monk: we need a healer<br />
Me: Nah - me and chanter can fear kite em.<br />
Monk: not safe to fear kite here<br />
Me: sure it is<br />
Chanter: lets try<br />
(btw I know the pathing for most of the pull spots - having duoed with a chanter many times in DL).<br />
Start pulling nearby mobs with snare - chanter takes a couple of pulls to get into the rhythm, waiting for snare to stick and mob to reach the sweet spot before fearing. We are now taking no damage with constant pulling and killing, no down time.<br />
Me: getting hard to find -  pulls will be longer. Ok if I pull multiples?<br />
Chanter: sure - got mezz ready<br />
Now I start pulling twos and 3s, all coming in snared - chanter mezing them all and fearing one by one.<br />
<br />
unknown_rogue_01: ooc Rogue lfg<br />
unknown_cleric_001: ooc Cleric lfg<br />
Monk: a Cleric!<br />
Me: grab the rogue<br />
Chanter: ok<br />
We grab the rogue.<br />
Mobs are now dropping 50% faster.<br />
I am pulling 3s and 4s, still taking no damage, still no downtime.<br />
I think after about 30 kills the chanter called LOM - that was just from mezzes, fear and haste.<br />
Eventually ran out of time.<br />
Me: sorry guys, thanks for group, gotta go<br />
Chanter: NOO<br />
Monk: NOO<br />
Rogue: NOOO<br />
<br />
You can bet your bootie noone in that group thought that rangers sucked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">It's all about utility baby. There is so much we can do that people forget about.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are mobs in the planes etc that send me screaming like a 4 year old girl if I have to tank them (if the cleric isn't wonderful about heals, even still). But we have a LOT to offer. <br />
<br />
Our track is wonderful, we were in PoF tonight and I got asked my numerous raid members numerous times what was up and how close it was on tracking.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many times I have saved a chanter/nuke caster by grabbing aggro and kiting the mob away and snaring/rooting.<br />
<br />
I got the &quot;honor&quot; of harmony splitting those guard (whatever they are called I forget) mobs near the hedge in PoN, allowing us to take them one by one when 2 would have killed us, heck even the 2 harm touches would have made it hard for a monk to pull more effectively.<br />
<br />
Everyone forgets when people need enduring breath that I can cast it.<br />
<br />
Same thing with levitate, and even invis. I had a cleric the other day dumbfounded that I could do this (not sure why).<br />
<br />
Damage shield, cure poison/cure disease, minor heals, attack buffs.<br />
<br />
Stack Cloroplast and Force of Nature for some decent regen.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough of that...my point is people really do forget how much different stuff we can do. We don't take the place of a lot of classes that can do certain things better than we can, but we get to do so many things, that when people say &quot;I sure wish we had xxxxxxxx class to do yyyyyyyyy&quot; often times I can say &quot;I can handle that&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This was a simply gorgeous example, so I have to share it. It goes with Jalim.<br />
<br />
We're in Eastern Wastes, Me, 48 Cleric, 45 (46 after) Pally, and 45 SK. We were doing the Ry'Gorr fort. SK Pulling, Pally Tanking, me snaring, and all that good stuff. We pull all the surrounding spawns easy, no problems at all, kill it all relatively quickly, and SK goes to pull Mystics, starts getting thrashed. Barely FDs in time, all three go back in Unison.<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;Can't pull those, too many casters all at once.&quot; We're screwed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pally: &quot;Dang, and I was hoping for the deeper spawns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric: &quot;That sucks, Med break?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;I can split the pulls.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;Rangers can't pull. They don't have FD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Bet me and lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;Deal. 100PP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;No problem. I don't split the pull, I'll die inside fort, you guys rez and I'll bring the 100PP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Go up, cast Harmony of Nature, pull closest Mystic, he comes alone.<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;What the hell? You know some pathing Trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Nope. We get a really cool outdoor lull that's rarely resisted in two parts now called Harmony.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;*******, why didn't you say that before? I wouldn't have bet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;And miss the chance to see that look on your face? Never. Keep the plat.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;Would you have brought the 100PP if you would have died?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Yep. Have it in the bank.&quot;<br />
<br />
SK: &quot;Take it. I got owned.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I joined up, with a druid, beastlord, and necro.<br />
<br />
Seems like the outcasts flock togethor, eh?  Now we were all decently equipped, but we tore through spiders like there was no tomorrow, with me tanking, beastlord and myself slowing, druid healing and assisting w/ pulls, and necro group LTapping MindRacking.  We added in a second necro a little later, and we were all constantly at full mana w/ the mindwrack recourse.<br />
<br />
In this case, the outcasts got the revenge :) Struck me solidly then and there that playerskill/coordination/teamwork can outmatch raw power and I'll never quite go back to my stereotypical views of the 'out-classes' again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Awenae Sylvarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I completely agree with many of the sentiments posted in this thread. I get frustrated at times with the crap I take, but that will never change the fact that this is the most interesting class to play. I've tried others, and kept coming back to my Ranger. Regardless of what people may think/say, Rangers have their place, and I believe one of our strengths is our flexibility. I myself have played the tank, the puller, the damage dealer, and the group buffer with ease.<br />
<br />
So, I tend to ignore those comments in /ooc, because I have confidence in myself, and don't need to prove myself to any of those idiots spouting in /ooc. They are usually just trying to get some kind of attention in any case, and I'll be damned if I'm the one to give it to 'em ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Catwalkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Want to hear another funny one?  I was grouped with a 60 druid and a 60 beastlord at UP zone.  After several pulls where the druid got beat on and was oom much of the time, I finally convinced him to let me pull and snare the mobs.  <br />
<br />
And we're doing great.  Druid isn't getting beat on, beastlord isn't getting beat on, pet is tearing up the mobs, the only person the druid has to heal is me.  He has more mana and we can pull more often.  I've got Call of Fire on, it and Earthcaller are proccing like mad...<br />
<br />
Druid says, wow, you sure can keep aggro well, and you don't even have taunt!<br />

Some idiot: /ooc why would ne1one want a ranger?<br />

At the point something truly, utterly amazing happened. An AM3/EQ Ranger was heading off to KC to check if VSR was up, he had just done a server transfer and was redoing his epic. <br />
60 Ranger: /ooc Yeah really. I mean, I'm a level 60 ranger and all I do is out damage rogues, monks, and MB wizards on raids, increase an entire raids melee DPS by 5-6% just from my buffs, and clerics BEG to group with me because A) They like XP and B) I've never once had a cleric who was grouped with me die. <br />
<br />
Me: /tell 60 ranger You are my hero.<br />
<br />
Some idiot: /ooc Yeah right. But I could beat you in a duel. <br />
<br />
(Is it turns out he was an uber twinked level 52 warrior, even to the point where someone had MQed a Silver Bracelet of Speed with him, other gear was equivelent or better)<br />
<br />

<br />
Ten seconds later.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think it takes a certain mentality to really WANT to be a Ranger. A person who Craves tracking something down and shooting it full of arrows while running circles around it. A person who says to hell with buying food....eating grubs is cool. <br />
<br />
A person who doesn't care about ohh-ahh flash, but can go anywhere and do anything to stop the flow of a groups blood. Heal in a pinch, cast in a pinch, buff on the fly and take some hits to keep weaker folk alive.<br />
<br />
Lets be honest amongst our selves. Not only couldn't most players do so, they cannot CONCIEVE of doing so. So follow the Ranger path. Be quiet, be strong, be there for the little people of Norrath who have no fricking clue. And say &quot;your welcome... anytime&quot;, to the ones that do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Mandaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Hello all ! first post for me so I will try to make it short :)<br />
<br />
I started playing this game in 2000 with a necro, then made some months after a druid.. both chars are now over 55. <br />
<br />
I tried all the classes except the ranger because I thought that rangers suck..  (I know its lame :( ).. although I never offensed a player by telling them they sucked or such jerk attitude<br />
<br />
Then some days ago, I started a ranger cause I wanted to escape the xp grinding with my main (druid).<br />
<br />
How could I explain how amazed I have been ? The rangers are probably the best class in the game in my opinion... I instantly deleted my 40 chanter, 39 SK and 37 rogue, only keeping necro and druid and my baby ranger... havent touched my main in one week now, except for porting guildies.<br />
<br />
I really wish I had tried this class before, and really want to kick my ass for being a moron for so long :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">/bonk!  <br />
<br />
Welcome to the Glade.  Welcome to your awakened senses as well.  ;)<br />
<br />
Rangers are just too fun to stop playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Chardaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">DOnt get upset or worry about it.  We will always get bashed, but mostly by the lower level ignorant people.<br />
<br />
Some things to remember about us that, once in your 50s+, many others know.  Snare, Harmony, pure ATK buffs, DPS and agro management.  Jalim and Eolair made many great examples.<br />
<br />
I have been on many raids to many places.  Besides the main tanks, there is always a need for DPS.  And when DPS is needed, a Ranger is always thought of first.  Because part of this too is agro management.  Jolt, CInder Jolt, Jolting Blades.  We can do awesome damage on a mob and never get hit by it.  Proper use of these spells is really appreciated by the tank (not pulling agro off him) and the cleric (no need for heals).  In addition to reducing agro, we are also the best for gaining and keeping when needed (pulling that add off the cleric).<br />
<br />
Those who bash us below lvl50 just dont know a ranger.  Those who bash us over level 50 know what we can do but are afraid to now publically admit they were wrong.<br />
<br />
Things funny for me:  being in a zone(low level like SK, NK, etc), someone asks if random_mob_01 is on track.  Druid_01 says no and person asking say &quot;ok&quot; and just accepts that.  Shows how little people low level know about all the classes.<br />
<br />
That and the morons who think a Pathfinder is a druid and constantly ask me for a port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Bellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">While my ranger is no longer my main, that shouldn't say anything about how I feel about rangers, I just found I was a cleric at heart, not a ranger. <br />

I love rangers.  When I was on the level grind with my to get to raiding level to help my guild, I did the DL thing.  I'd have arguments with my groupmates about which to invite... rangers or druids.  <br />
<br />
Some of the things I got:<br />
But we have a monk to pull!<br />
Druids can SoW!<br />
We have a tank.<br />
<br />
*sigh*  Serves me right going to DL.  <br />
<br />
But as a 56 cleric, my fav group makeup is still one I got by the luck of the draw in DL.  Cleric, Ranger, Ranger, Ranger, Warrior, Chanter.  That was my favorite group.  /em sighs.  We need more rangers in my guild, I miss grouping with em.</div></div><hr />
