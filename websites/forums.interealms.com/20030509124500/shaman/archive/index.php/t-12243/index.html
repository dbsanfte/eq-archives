<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, presumably that's about EQOA, not EQ, so it doesn't really apply to he priest balancing that most people here would care about...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Druids also seem a little weak compared to some of the other priest classes. Bards seem a little more powerful than some others. &quot;<br />
<br />
there are bards in EQOA ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sup kara BTW ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to the EQOA website there are bards...  I can only assume they aren't lying about it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">right on , i thought SoE said no more bards , im suprised they made it into EQOA is all. Im going to miss them in eq2, granted i would never play one as a main , but as a alt to pop one once in a while they sure were fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bards in EQOA were weak at the start... they may have balanced them in release but in the beta thier songs took up POW some took up alot of POW and had a longer duration so in effect it was just like a spell with AE.</div></div><hr />
