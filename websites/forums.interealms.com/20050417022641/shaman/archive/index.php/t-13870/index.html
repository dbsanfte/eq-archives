<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 45 atm.  Almost lvl 46.  I'm kinda getting tired of DL.  Looking for another place to go.  Heard good things about gnomes in echo.  Also heard that nobles in HHK can be done from 45-55, any advice on those guys would be great.  You can take a look at my equip in my sig, any advice on where to go is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
EDIT: well, I just hit 47, I was in CC for a bit, killing terrors and geos.  both were nice exp and nice money.  Like I said though, any advice would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did CoM, nice EXP and ok cash, nothing great but it pays for KEI and i always just enjoyed the peace fo that zone. I just donged 47 and some of the courtyard mobs are light blue, not all , the temple would be still good im sure, then there are goos and the second courtyard and then the gezebos in the back, all still dark blue to a 59 enchanter that i was with the other night.</div></div><hr />
