<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hadorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm 36% into 59 and need a new place to solo. I've worn out my welcome in chardok (everything is turning Light Blue). I want to find something that is as easy as chardok but not as crowded as VL! <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HS and Droga would be decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, Droga is Niiiiiiice.<br />
<br />
If you're in a guild grab yourself a good tank (lvl 65 is good) a good healer and a full group 59-65 and go deep into Droga.  We get probably 0.75% per kill.  We went from 43% into 58 to 10% into 59 in two sessions.  Mobs should be white/yellow and red to you :)<br />
<br />
I think you can solo the entrance area, just invis past the first two mobs and fight in the tunnel.  We're going to duo there (monk/shammie) at the end of the first tunnel pulling from the first big room.<br />
<br />
We're working on Howling stone key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>murjden_sof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would really recommend that you get into some LDoNs as soon as you can.  I did this several times during 59 with higher level folks, and 59 just zoomed past.  It's really worth doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tehp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do the Crystalline Globe quest in PoV.  I did it at 59, boxing my SK and got mad EXP from the Gamite Frogs and the Skellies that drop pieces of the globe.  The planarian larvae for the heart.  Doin groups in the golem areas will get you spider hearts and FC or BC camps for the Razorfiend heart.  You will be 60 by the time you complete this quest or damn close.  Plus you will also be able to open the door to Aerin Dar's Lair.  Quest listed below on the link.<br />
<br />
Key to Aerin`Dar's Lair (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2481)<br />
<br />
Have fun and get 60 soon.</div></div><hr />
