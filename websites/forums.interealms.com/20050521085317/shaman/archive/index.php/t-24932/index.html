<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, its an age-old argument, but I am still undecided. Especially given that our new canni gives us consistent faster hp -&gt; mana conversion.<br />
<br />
So, the question is, assuming that you have not capped regen nor FT, which do you prefer.<br />
<br />
Also, how many Regen = 1FT? <br />
<br />
I use a value of somewhere around 2.0 - 2.5regen = 1 FT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I honestly don't consider either, just consider both icing on the cake. If i had my choice between the same item, with the same stats, &amp; same focus... I'd go for FT unless it was maxxed. Lol.. when are we treated to those decisions? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spare Augment slots - FT and regen are available in a variety of flavours. I am deciding whether to just get a cheap and easy RegenII for 220 LDoN points, or RegenIII for 760 points or just a FTI for 340 points....too many decisions.<br />
<br />
I know that most people go for max FT rather than max Regen, but I go for max Regen for the same reason that hp &gt; mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would take FT, our canni is activated, meaning you can't cast anything else while doing it.<br />
and ....<br />
<br />
ft is now capped at 20 with aa's.<br />
<br />
and regen caps at 50 or so ? and 50 hitpoints a tick won't help you much with the new canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Till i hit 60 and got Torpor and now Q (lucky gits who get Stoicism at 44 now) i would have always said Regen owns over FT.<br />
Now Canni then Q so regen doesnt make a lot of diff.<br />
Now id say its FT all the way.<br />
An extra 50 or whatever regen may save your ass on a rare occasion but FT is always there.<br />
Plus me being lazy probably means i dont have to click Canni IV quite as often :)<br />
<br />

I have around 40 worn regen, and get 100ish with Perseverance on. 100 per tick. It sure is nice to have half the damage I incur from casting pained memory be taken care of automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I decided to try to turn my racial penalty into an asset and went after some regen. I turned on the tribute regen, I picked up some regen items, and with the new regen spell on I regen over 120 a tic standing. I gotta admit, its nice. I dont even bother healing myself from canni 5 anymore.<br />
<br />
I maxed FT first though. I am lucky enough to be in a decent guild, where you will end up with a ton of FT over the course of normal upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Age old?<br />
When was FT intorduced as a concept in eq?<br />
<br />
I am so picky....<br />
<br />
For me maxing FT than loading up on regen. Only MC3 (cause its required for canni) than worn FT to cap. The same can pretty much be said for regen. Upping worn regen is great, IMO there are so many better uses for aas than aa regen and secondary FT that I would only get it once I maxed pretty much everything else including trade skill masteries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO there are so many better uses for aas than aa regen and secondary FT that I would only get it once I maxed pretty much everything else including trade skill masteries.<br />
I agree here, pretty much (except with the tradeskill part unless your a tradeskiller, of course) but I havent put a single AA point into Regen since the original 3 I used to get my 6 first levels, and I wish I had those back (I have since put 3 into Innate Metab anyway). The regen AA are all FAR too expensive IMHO for the reward. Nice thing about OoW though, there are some decent items out there with nice regen on them. Check my Magelo for examples, especially my Shield, Neck, and Belt. Those are all EP level gears that arent hard to get. Neck and Belt were off Epic mobs in chests, and Shield is off SH in WOS (1-groupable, but 2 is safer). Despite being in a Time-Farming guild, these were respectable upgrades for me. The neck is a FAR better choice than the stupid Torque in T1, and the Shaman waste options are slim, the few Cord of Potentials my guild has gotten have gone fairly high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With lots of regen I die less. <br />
<br />
With Ft 14. I get back 140 mana a minute. <br />
<br />
FT is nice but not a game changer It just greases the wheels some. Same thing with High regen. It is a good grease.<br />

A bit more on it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think they are equally imortant honestly.  If you have FT capped its more mana per tick you don't have to canni in emergency situations where you're LoM.  If you have high regen, canni doesn't hurt so much in a low health and LoM situation.<br />
<br />
As for which to get first?  Now days it seems a lot more items (at least high end game) have BOTH on them so you dont have to worry about sacrificing one for the other.  If you're not where thats common, I would say FT first then regen...just my personal preferance (FT is way easier to cap than regen...makes it easier to do it sooner and work on regen the rest of the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Regen &gt; FT for Shaman in most cases.<br />
<br />
You just have to try to balance them according to your own play style. I was at the lower end of the FT scale for quite a while (until recently) and did/do just fine.<br />
<br />
I'll work on capping FT after I complete some other AA that I consider to be more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In my case, I am not anywhere near either cap, and probably will not be for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
I understand that 1 mana regen is better than 1 hp regen, but would you, for example (and assuming neither is capped) take 1 mana regen over 3 hp regen?<br />
<br />
The point is that mana and hp are completely interchangeable, via healing and canni. 1 mana heals about 2.5hp and 1hp gives about 0.5 mana (approximatlely). But shaman tend to concentrate on maximising their hp pool, and then use whatever mana pool this gives them (and please understand, I agree with the principle). So, it would seem to me to be a logical extension of the hp &gt; mana philosophy to try to maximisze ones hp regen and then use whatever mana regen that gives you.<br />
<br />
Specifically, in my case, I am thinking that I will take the regenII over the FT1 aug that I am considering (or I will possibly even be patient and save for the regenIII aug instead of either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the moral of the story is to not spend adventure pts on either of these types of augs if you can avoid it.  OoW and GoD has made it much easier to fill up both regens with augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The old worn regen cap was 35.  Anyone know what the new cap is?<br />
<br />
PS  I'm at the ft 15 cap and have no plans for buying the OoW AAs to get to 20 ft any time soon.  That extra 5 ft just isn't worth a whole lot to me and certainly not 25 AAs.  The regen from worn items and Sense is really nice with Pained Memories and Canni 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehe this old argument again?<br />
<br />
You of all people should know i prefer FT Weyalan :)<br />
<br />
Peace friend :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hej Vigdis,<br />
<br />
You still lurking around the Crucible? Are you playing WoW or EQ2 these days, or have you gone and got yourself addicted to RL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lorgdas is playing EQ2 now together with Mantos and some other AD zekkies, but im trying not to fall into that trap.<br />
<br />
Been thinking about WoW quite heavily now, much beacues of Blizzards un-sonyness... :p<br />
<br />
Besides, my carpal isnt getting any better either so... we'll just have to see where i land :)</div></div><hr />
