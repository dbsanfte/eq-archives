<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a friend that plays a necro...<br />
I was looking at his aa points the other day and saw the following...<br />
<br />
Run3-3pts<br />
SCMastery1-2pts<br />
Spell Casting Fury3-12pts<br />
Innate Invis-3pts<br />
Dcharm-9pts<br />
Mend Companion-5pts<br />
Life Burn-9pts<br />
Dead Mez-3pts<br />
<br />
Ok he had 46 points spent....and none available left to spend.<br />
Anyone see a problem with that?<br />
Where is the 6 points he needs in General for Archtype abilities?<br />
And no, not in a heartbeat do I think he has an exploit in any way.<br />
So is it a bug?<br />
How did he get Archtype abilities without spending 6 in general?<br />
I showed him today why that normally is impossible and he did not realize you needed 6 in general for Arch. And 12 in Arch for Class.<br />
<br />
So any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He put three points into run and three into regen, then did arch and class skills.<br />
<br />
Then Sony refunded him his regen points.  Not sure exactly when this happened, or if it happened to everyone, but I noticed myself that I had lost my innate regen and gotten the AA points back from it.<br />
<br />
That's my guess anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So he used the 3 he got back for arch type or class?<br />
Still did not think that was possible becuase after the reset you still had to have 6 in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You definitely must have 6 in &quot;general&quot; -- there is no avoiding it.  I have no idea why he does not, in fact, have 6 in general.  Very strange.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Sony refunded the points for regen you could put them into Class but not into Arch ability.  I went awhile working on class AAs until I needed an Arch and had to put points back into Base.  It was possible for people to do this IF they were already into Class AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At one point I had only 10 aa <br />
<br />
run 3<br />
reg 3<br />
MC 1<br />
<br />
and 2 in the bank.<br />
<br />
I quite my shaman for a long time and then the game for a while.  When I firt loged back in I had<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
QB  1<br />
<br />
and no points in the bank.  After about a about a week of playing I got 5 points back in the bank so I never lost any points but my skills did shift.  During the time my account was not used... PoP came out and I think SOE may have done some adjustments to the AA point data base code without changing any of the inactive accounts.  At some point the problem fixed itself, perhaps during a server maintainace, except I am skill stuck with 2 points in CF1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Corrode</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just curious why they refunded/reset the regen AA points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Because of the natural dbling of regen that Iksars and trolls got, they didnt mean for them to get twice the regen for the same amount of points spent, so they refunded the points and nerfed it to 1 point of regen for 1 point spent for all classes, then everyone turned around and put them back into regen... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah when they refunded the points you could respend them in class or PoP aa's later on with out having to go back and spend points in the general again. My roommate went for quite a while on his warrior with just run 3 in general till he needed to go back and do a class aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So, can your necro friend spend AA points in any archtype abilities? I bet he can't until he puts 3 more AA points in general abilities.<br />
<br />
Iksar/troll racial regen isn't doubled, it's just higher. I think the original 2 hp/tick AA regen for iksar/troll was intended, but they changed their minds and made it 1 hp/tick like all the other races. Later they refunded those 3 AA points to everyone, which you could choose to reinvest in regen or somewhere else.<br />

<br />
- Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities<br />

** Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement ** <br />
<br />
Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. <br />
<br />
Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check your AA window immediately! If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA points before The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! The return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st. <br />
<br />
We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following abilities: <br />
<br />
Innate Regeneration <br />
Manaburn <br />
Mental Clarity <br />
Quick Summoning<br />
<br />
Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose. None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only Manaburn is changing. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will not function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental Clarity 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yah, the bug is that it only checks the AA tier below..<br />
<br />
So Archetypes checks to make sure you have 6AA in General.<br />
Class checks to make sure you have 12AA in Archetype. <br />
<br />
So if you had run3, regen3, and 12aa in arche you could spend your 3aa towards class. That was the bug, when you go back to doing archetypes you'll have to buy 3 more AA in General to get up to 6 again tho.</div></div><hr />
