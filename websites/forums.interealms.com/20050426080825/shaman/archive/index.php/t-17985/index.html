<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a chance to check out pof last night. About 2% aa per kill, 1% with a partner. Its a fun and spooky zone. Thought i'd share my findings to the crucible.  Things I would suggest:<br />
<br />
note: this guide assumes you are going into fear after someone has raided the zone and not completely cleared the plane. On our server the zone isnt normally completely cleared, but you need permission of the guild that had rights to the zone that went before you previously.<br />
<br />
1- Get a primer from the raid that went before you and know what they killed, and what path they took through the zone. Make sure there are no minis up.<br />
<br />
2. Most raids aim for minis/ct in the zone and rare nameds for epic drops. The path that they take is normally zone in from feerot, going west to the wall, then south to the southwestern corner and then east along the south wall. From the center of the south wall head north and work your way slowly. If you have places where you cant see around corners or the terrain make sure you aggro pull. For example you are checking out a temple (fright/dread/terror) walk around the base sitting occasionally so as to pull any stuff that was left up solo.<br />
<br />
3. Some mobs have high magic resistance, malo/s and sini/a is recommened.  A few mobs are unslowable/rootable. Its helpful to have a beast listing nearby.<br />
<br />
4. Add a tracker for added safety if desired.<br />
<br />
5. Keep gate up or clickable.<br />
<br />
Everything I could find  up is soloable at 61. Included a scareling, fetid fiend, the tempest reaver, and a Amygdalan Knight. Added a 65 Ranger it became too easy, but was still fun and very nostalgic.<br />
<br />
Hope its useful-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kittybuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally Can solo break Fear it isnt that hard especially once u have lvl 65 spells and CAnn 5 and other Archtype AA. I use BoS and Bane and the mobs each have around 7k hps or so ... they take a Few to go down and some of them Run which can Cause adds unless u have a Snare stick/amulet /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had a tough time breaking in, it's not that the mobs are that difficult but I always end up with a giant crowd of like 10 of them.  This is on the west wall, is the south wall or southwest corner a better option?  I like the zone and the (usual) isolation to be found here, but without having it pre-broken I'm having a hell of a time with it =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bump<br />
Considering trying to solo break Fear soon (mixture of boredom and insanity I think) - any other info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've done it duo a few times, never quite got around to doing it solo. Here's what I'd do:<br />
<br />
1) Get a kei and pot9 or virtue (unless you have uber gear anyway, but I've only got FT1 and 2k6 hp unbuffed)<br />
<br />
2) Get a few sets of pet toys from a mage, BA IV item and spell haste ring.<br />
<br />
(If you think those first 2 steps make it not count as soloing then skip em by all means)<br />
<br />
3) Buff up, quiessence, invis, zone in<br />
<br />
4) Run towards W wall, checking for aggro. If you aggro more than 3-4 mobs, just gate out and go back to 3).<br />
<br />
5) Once at W wall, drop invis, root park any mobs that aggro, summon and equip pet, haste + focus it.<br />
<br />
6) Start off killing mobs which see invis (never remember which those are but certainly the gorillas do), next targets would be scarelings coz of the shadow step, and then the toads for the fear but you should resist that anyway.<br />
<br />
If at any stage you start getting overwhelmed by the number of adds, try to kill off what you are fighting but above all start gating out early as interrupts can kill you.<br />
<br />
If you're good at alchemy, take some potions. DS and Calimony can be very useful here, I'm sure there are some others tool.<br />
<br />
Don't move too far south at the start, the amygdalen warriors can be a bit tougher than most mobs to slow. <br />
<br />
Don't be tempted to start pulling until you've been at the W wall spot for a good 15 minutes, mobs roam around on long paths so its best to get em all killed first before you even think about pulling.<br />
<br />
Be wary if any golems are up as they'll DT you from afar if you ever get chained aggro. Don't pull any mobs from near the golems unless you are 100% sure you won't get chain aggro.<br />
<br />
My spell line-up when zoning in is:<br />
Pet<br />
BoS<br />
Slow<br />
Invis<br />
Gate<br />
Quiessence<br />
Tnarg's<br />
Canni IV<br />
<br />
Note I have clicky root so no need to mem root for me. Once pet is summoned and buffed, I swap in BoNife (I don't have bane) and Velium Strike for pet and invis. I find malo(s) is not required for anything other than to slow amy warriors and if you don't wander south on the break you won't get any of those.<br />
<br />
Key aim on the break in is to at least kill one mob each time I zone in. The best I've done is to gate out only once, I always end up with about 6 mobs at some stage and at that point I chicken out and gate, come back and start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kittybuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo breaking Fear isnt that crazy, the mobs can only hit for like 170 tops and if u Slow them, Hell torpor will Mitigate just about 7 of them. The otherday i was involved in a Fear Break with about 13 adds. Was the Worest i have ever seen... that lived lol.. 2 different trains Came together lol. and Most of the time if ur 65 and invis u can zone in aggro free.</div></div><hr />
