<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a 65 shamy on the luclin server and have been playing since before the expansions (as a shaman mostly) (exact dates are fuzzy because I re-rolled my characters on Karana a lot the first year or so, then reroled on luclin when I felt over crowded). <br />
<br />
This is my introduction / whatever thread, please say ello if you stop by and especialy if you remember my bloodstained tunic, gatorscale legging (leather mini-skirt) wearin arse from way back then.<br />
<br />
I used to browse here looking for tips and ideas and such not but never felt the need to register or post.<br />
<br />
Lately I have been here due to general disapointment in the treatment of the Shaman class by the &quot;spell guy&quot; and content designers. Before they allowed people past tier 1 pop based on level I was stuck in tier one.. Passing a trial of execution (a speed killing trial that most groups want an enchanter for to begin with....) Well anyways my slow spells ( i mean casting time) were near useless.. and even being above the level most people where when they completed it, I was not enough DPS to get through at a lvl apropriate time. I can only shudder at the the thought of what GOD must be like for us.<br />
<br />
My memory is fuzzy.. but was there a time when only shaman had slow or malo lines? or was that when i was a little guy and just didn't read about spells of other classes past my level? Regardless I feel my skills were very farmed out to the beastlord and other classes (I PL'ed myself a beast as a partner in crime.. and OMG they are too much /nerf /nerf)<br />
<br />
Our nerfing through omission was rediculous. Even if Torpor was overpowering healing wise.. it was damn near imposible for most shaman to obtain and had penalties. I agree that the 75% slow was a bit much.. and it never realy was too much of an issue untill POP when they gave mobs so much DPS that you had to have a slower.. Of course then they farmed out the ability even more to the point where Shaman Slow vs any other slow is no big freaking deal at all.<br />
<br />
enough complaining and whining for now, I just had to toss in my vote of support for the changes you are trying to get made here. <br />
<br />
I wish Sudedor/Banditman the best of luck as represenative.. and I hope no one has realy chewed you alive for delivering bad news yet.<br />
Let Kytherea know that I'm passing out glasses of milk to all shaman next month if Im not happy lol :) (in reference to signature of sony rep on eq boards)<br />
