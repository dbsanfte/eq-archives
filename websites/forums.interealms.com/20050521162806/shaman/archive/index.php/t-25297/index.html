<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got level 1 recently and in BoT have not had it land once, even on a disease debuffed mob.... its only been about 12 casts so far, but this is extremely annoying. I've read posts, but I just want to confirm. The resist rate does not change with the level, correct?<br />
<br />
<br />
Bought level 1, and since I cant use it for emergency rooting, its kinda a tough sell to get the other levels like I was planning on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sayoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while since I was in BoT, but as I recall some of the wings are completely immune to disease.<br />
<br />
Play around with VP in more places before judging it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">South (earth wing?) mobs are immune to disease spells such as VP and disease slow.<br />
<br />
I had the same thing when I got VP - never landed there ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of BoT is fairly resistant to disease, IIRC. Try using it in Tactics, or Storms, or Valor, on non-summoning mobs. I think you will find its a fantastic AA. For the record, it REALLY gets awesome at lvl 3, when the root portion lasts 5 seconds longer than the refresh time. Button lights up, you know hes coming, re-bounce him. Works incredibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have VP3 here.  Its always been a disappointment to me.  I dont use it much as its a 50/50 roll at best to get it to land.  And having to debuff disease makes the AA that much more frustrating.  I like my click root legs when I have to chain root a mob in RS or MPG.<br />
<br />
VP3 need to be easier to land without debuff and dont allow it to be over written by someone elses root.  Nothing sucks more then to get VP to finally land in a pinch only to have someone over write it with a 1 min root. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">See, this is why i posted here. We were in the south wing, and I wasnt completely aware of their dis resists since Im often doing a lot of healing and the fights are short, thus not using my disease dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
good to know , iwill try it elsewhere</div></div><hr />

I used to feel this way as well, but with the release of OoW, my AA favorites order has changed (note this applies to active, clickable AA abilities):<br />
<br />
1. Cannibilization - No comment needed.<br />
2. Ancestral Aid - This AA is goddly. Rogues have commented on the overcap being noticably more max hits (one guild member sends me /tells on raids to pop it on him all the time, NOT for the heal!)<br />
3. Spiritual Channeling - Theres a thread about it somewhere, but suffice it to say this AA turns us into casting machines. Be it heals, nukes (I like to rain, heal heal, rain, especially in PG trials), just pop off an HoT and cast away. <br />
4. Call of the Wild - Talk about a total group saver, not to mention a handy tool to use when your headed somewhere and you see a corpse or you see someone appear. <br />
5. VP - Still awesome, soloing or in groups (nothing better than bouncing that add off the cleric). Wonderful for pulling too, Decay - VP, and kill the one that comes to the group.<br />
Honorable mention - Rad/Rep Cure, Spirit Call, etc. Nice, useful, handy, but not as overall incredibly awesome as those 5. <br />
<br />
Was in a PG trial the other day, the cleric didnt know not to sit when the 2nd wave came and he got squished. Between Ancestral Aid, Epic clicky, Call of Wild on cleric (then he divine rezzed himself), Channeling, Canni, etc, we managed to squeak out that wave, and by the time the next wave came the cleric was rezzed, buffed, and ready to rock. Thats one of the things I love about being a shaman. When the shizz hits the fan, and its total chaos, when the smoke finally clears, I am almost always still standing there, still have a ton of mana, and everyone else in the group is thinking &quot;How the heck did we pull that off&quot; and I just smile.</div></div><hr />

great story!  btw, i sometimes smile when the clerics die...by sometimes i mean always *snicker*<br />
<br />
VP is indeed one of our powerhouse AAs.  their is a problem with it not haveing a neg resist mod on it (i beleave there are several threads discusing that topic,) but i tend to find that if i don't get a resist with it i have enough time to malos the add and get my magic based root on.  however, it does fully suck when it is resisted because you wasted valuable cast time on a nonslowed add (usually.)  kind of like rolling the dice, but i wouldn't give the AA back for anything less than snare!<br />
<br />
once you start fighting mobs with average disease resists you will see the reward for buying the AA.</div></div><hr />

That is why you cast VP in between spell gems refreshing :D no time lost that way.</div></div><hr />

if only it could always be that way :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
VP never, ever breaks with melee-only soldiers at tables in Plane of Fire, for example, or with golems in PoValor, provided they are Malos'd first.  It usually holds pretty well in LDONs if you DR debuff, but who has time to DR debuff every mob in LDONs...  GoD and WoW mobs are iffy, you kind of have to learn where you can use it and where you can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FYI, The Malo's line of spells is irrelivant to VP's success in landing.<br />
I find myself using VP for its directional knockback effect while in exp group way more then CC.  Its fun at parties too.</div></div><hr />

Surely you're not including Malicious Decay, are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">(Regarding the Malos line)Surely you're not including Malicious Decay, are you?<br />
The Malos line, that is all spells that share the same characteristics except for numerals and resist checks are Malo, Malosi, Malosinia, Malos, Malosini, Mala and so on.<br />
<br />
Malicious Decay is from an entirely different spell line. It debuffs only disease, which is the one resist that the Malos line does not debuff.<br />
<br />
So Malos will indeed not help to land VP at all. Malicious Decay (and other disease debuffs) will. That is also pretty much the only reason I have seen exping shaman memorize the spell.<br />
<br />
/teacher voice off<br />
<br />
Damn that even looks boring. Wow. I never knew I could talk like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I misspoke, I meant Malicious Decay and not Malos.  Sorry.  Yes, I know that Malos doesn't debuff DR.<br />
<br />
The only other time I have seen DR debuffs cast is on raids when we have 4-5 shaman and some of them are bored.  However, IMO that's a waste of debuff slots.  The disease dots are too slow to be useful on raids, so that slot taken up by MD could be taken up by someone's Blood of Saryryn or whatever.</div></div><hr />

They recently upped the number of effect-slots on mobs. I never get &quot;would not take hold&quot; messages anymore, like I used too. I generally keep Putrid Decay memmed on raids, in my normal Malos slot. We always have 3+ shaman on our raids. Putrid has the advantage of further de-buffing Poison, so Rains land MUCH better. I also use PD instead of MD when soloing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We had 7+ shaman on raids and 6 necros back in the old days. With that many we had to start picking and choosing which dots to keep on the mob.  It's true that it is not as important any more,  but I still don't think disease dots are worth casting on raid targets, so there's no real need for MD.  PD with its addition PR debuff is worth casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Question from about a comment here.  I am a 66 shaman, lousy gear, low aa, however I did pick up VP3.  Does Malicious decay need to be on the soldiers at tables for VP to never fail there?  Was thinking if not I could keep them rooted forever and eventually dot them down with just Breath of Ultor and Blood of Saryn.  If not well I need to make sure I keep MD on them also and not sure how much drain that will put on my mana.  Somewhat concerned about mana cost as I don't have either Affliciton Efficiency or Burning Affliction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes MD is a very good idea and shouldn't be drain on mana. It's 150 mana and lasts 15 minutes. If you want to solo fire I'd strongly recommend getting bane. Will make life alot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">MD lasts forever. 14 mins @ lvl 65 iirc. It Must be on the soldiers for VP to work reliably. One you have md'd the mob you can un-mem it &amp; swap in another debuff or dot. VP3 lasts what 2 mins? Plenty of time for you to regain the 150 mana MD costs :) I think it's wise to Putrid Decay your target also for the extra -DR benefit. That's just me though, but only 250 mana &amp; the same duration as MD.<br />
<br />
Use tribute for burning affliction &amp; mana preservation &amp; put a post-it on your monitor reminding you to turn it off :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
its either been nerfed, or its only good in the pofire anymore  ..l.. to you sony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">To the original poster, if you want to do BoT, VP will work on mobs in the WestWing.  You should be able to tell from most of the posters here that VP rocks as an AA.  It's a cheap AA to get, and there are no pre-requisites to getting it except level.  It was the first AA I bought, and it helped tons doing crowd control -- it casts fast enough to knockback and split the 2 incoming on a pull.  If it it doesn't land, you can still use root quick because you don't have to wait for the spell gems to refresh after you cast VP.  Just keep VP handy as a hotkey and you've QUICK CC in under a tic, and that's even including using MD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">its either been nerfed, or its only good in the pofire anymore  ..l.. to you sony<br />
Were you de-buffing disease resist first? I found it lasted in NC MOST of the time if I hit em with Putrid or Mal Decay first. But not every time, like the Fire soldiers. Still, it seemed usable if you de-buff, and I have used it a TON soloing in PG, on the Discordlings, lasts almost every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">HAving now tried this in fire, I love it.  At 67 Using breath of wushi, breath of ultor, and Blood of saryn this is easy.  (I need to get bane but LDONS are rare and curse coming up in two levels).  It is not as good xp solo as a good group, especially since I am still a little undergeared, and under AA'd and missing Bane and Epic 1.0 for more dottage, but it is nice safe xp.  Pull with MD and then VP, Dot till dead while renwing VP as needed.  <br />
<br />
Sad thing is my 70 Monk with much better gear and Much more AA would get absolutely owned if I tried to solo here.  Maybe I can get him some aa by feighing him while lowbie shaman kills.</div></div><hr />
