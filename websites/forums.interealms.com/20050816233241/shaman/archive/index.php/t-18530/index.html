<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it me or are there only two items in the game that have this effect? If that is true, why is SoE slacking on this? Hell, put it in as a LDoN aug. I am tired of my dots taking so long to cast. Hurry it up, I wanna be uber someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There aren't many affliction haste IV items, only two that I know of.  One is torch of lvaxormaomomom from bertox cycle, which I have, and the other is the pottery item.<br />
<br />
However, there are lots of detrimental haste and general spell haste items that give a sufficient boost to the casting time of dots (in addition to slow, malos, and nukes).  I personally do not feel that the slight extra reduction in dot cast time is anything to worry about.  You generally aren't chain casting dots, and the speed at which a dot lands does not save your life like a faster slow or heal does.  An extra half second of casting time once a minute doesn't make much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Ditto for affliction efficiency IV items.  I have a grummus shield as well, but I don't use it because it isn't worth wearing just to save me a little bit of mana when I do cast a dot.  Standard mana pres (pres of xegony in my case, but mana pres IV isn't hard to come by) is good enough.<br />
<br />
Now, the only time I bring out my dot focus items is when I am in pofire kiting at tables.  I bring them out here because I am constantly stacking three dots, and the extra cast time is needed because I have a mob that triples for 880 chasing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Jinheim. I guess I will have to troll the equipment section for some ideas on what to get although it wont be anytime soon as I am a recruit for a guild.<br />
<br />
I just really liked my Affliction 3 item (helm from SS) and I kind of wish to have it again. Although I am just thinking about getting Spell Haste IV from LDoN and ending my pain. Been soloing alot in Inner Acrylia and the interrupts are getting a tad it annoying for the most part.</div></div><hr />
