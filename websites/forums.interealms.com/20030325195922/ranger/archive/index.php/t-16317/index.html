<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all! So I guess this question will prove just how much of a newbie I am. So here goes. How do you fear kite?  I've  seen people say you root then shoot with bow. But what about the fear part. Can someone help me?:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Traxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Panic animal is a level 22 spell.  It's a rangers bread and butter for soloing.  Standard tactic is to snare, fear, beat scared animal to a bloody pulp, fear again, resume said beating until animal no longer posesses the will to live. <br />
<br />
When you first get Panic Animal, it will be resisted alot and only last a short time, but as your levels progress it will become far more reliable.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jelanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, just get into a pattern of casting panic animal so that you don't have to cast it through getting beat on cause at the level you get it, you will lose concentration often if you try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Panic Animal seems to wear off after about the second Kick. So Snare, Panic Animal, Auto Attack, Kick, Kick, Panic Animal, Kick, Kick, Panic Animal, Kick, Kick, Panic Animal, etc. This way the mob will pretty much never turn and take a nice chunk out of your leg. Just don't Root. Root+Panic Animal don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And always remember to be aware of your immediate area to make sure you are not wandering into another mob. Here are a few things that you may want to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
1) pick your pull to area so that you have room and the pathing works well when the mob is feared.<br />
<br />
2) IF the mob has moved out of your &quot;safe area&quot; remember that when fear is off you can run back to your area and plink at it to get it back into your area before re-fearing.<br />
<br />
3) if you think the mob may be feared into something cast root and dis-engage, when root and fear is off it will move back toward you.<br />
<br />
4) how many use harmony for more than pulling??? yes while your fighting and the wandering mob comes close cast harmony (or the &quot;new&quot; harmony) on it and just watch it walk on by.<br />

Hey Fruits  ... LTNS pop me a tell in game sometime for some catch up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Norwolf: great tip on Harmonizing a wandering mob. Why can't I ever think of these things?<br />
<br />
LTNS... maybe when I /tell you in-game you can let me know what that one means. I'm terrible with acronyms :(<br />
<br />
Oh, right. Long Time No See. I'm a little slow. Which is a good thing I guess. I don't like aggro. I'm squishy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>axis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks everyone i will try these. I especialy like the info on tactics from Norwolf. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not to be confused with root/dot/plink.<br />
<br />
For dealing with  non-animals solo, root mob, DoT it, snare it (so it doesn't rush you when root breaks), and start plinking (shooting) it.<br />
Re-root as necessary.  As mana gets low - you may have to start medding between root unless you have a mana regen buff going (even clarity makes a big difference).<br />
<br />
Slower than fear kiting animals but at least it gets the job done.<br />
<br />
Oh - and bring LOTS of arrows..<br />
<br />
Items with affliction efficiency/extended affliction, or the free DoT from tolans sleeves (and arrows from the bracer) help a lot with this too.</div></div><hr />
