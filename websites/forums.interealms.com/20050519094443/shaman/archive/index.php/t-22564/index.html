<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just think what would be a nice addition to the shaman class in AA abilities / spells which SOE could add. To kick this off I have put some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Am looking here for abilities which class can currently not do but would be a nice improvement for the class.<br />
<br />
An AA ability that works the same as canni but passes the mana to a group member (Useful helping a member get back up into fight after being killed) I though this would make a nice AA put it on a timer of about 3 min same as canni 5 (Timer may need to be tuned a bit though). Could be called Gift of Spirt.<br />
<br />
An AE Malos type spell<br />
<br />
Several Group HoT spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">an ability to turn rabid bear into something you can cast on others</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's called Paragon of Spirit and beastlords have it.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
An AE Malos type spell<br />
<br />
<br />
This will probably never happen.  If it does, they will screw it up somehow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several Group HoT spell<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a possibility, but considering their reluctance to give us an AA group heal it will probably only be group-only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A spell I can cast to charm the developers. Especially Rytan, into not giving Rote tired unimaginative sidestepped upgrades for existing spell lines that have been around for the better part of 5 years..<br />
<br />
When the upgrade is a 10% increase. and everyone else gets 15% increases and the monsters get a 20% increase all you do is make my life harder. <br />
<br />
Thats the spell I want. Either charm developer. Or a spell to enhance the intellect creativity and wits of developers so that they can ****ing think for themselves and actually innovate rather than redistribute the same **** different day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Much like my whole argument. Sadly.. Same ****. different day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would really really like an AE malos spell.<br />
<br />
Hell, make it -20 to the resists and I would still use the hell out of it.  Make it fast casting though...2 secs or so.  Toss a 600 mana cost on it and Id use it every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i liked the idea for aa that focus shaman ona  particular type of spell.<br />
<br />
like healing, damage spells , pet etc.<br />
<br />
these aa would let you be 50% better say at healing, but 50% worse at damage spells.<br />
or 50% better at damage spells but 50% worse at healing.<br />
<br />
or makes pet do the damage our 4 top dots do but means we cant cast dots:)  these 2 are linked and cant be used at same time.. although if you did you would just end up the same so probably not a probelm. (infact if you did use both you end up slightly worse off so no need at all to link except to make sure you didnt click both) and need some way to stop it if you need.<br />
<br />
things like that, call im  focus of healing, focus of damage, focus of spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still want a version of bhali with the speed of FoE but with an attack buff instead of that lev/see invis junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still want a version of bhali with the speed of FoE but with an attack buff instead of that lev/see invis junk.<br />
<br />
Bhali? I must have missed this one. What's it do, send your group on vacation to Indonesia - like evac, only much better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">An updated fire nuke. Though it might be kinda funny to use Wand of the Lava Shaper  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29867) with Burst of Flame.<br />
<br />
Though now you mention it Samanna a vacation to Indonesia would be a neat effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">An ability to cast a buff that can't be dispelled/anulled by the mob.<br />
<br />
Targetable rabid bear<br />
<br />
A buff that increases the duration of all buffs on the target player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">New spells for OoW? How about something crazy like ..'vendor purchaseable'?<br />
<br />
I'd like to see an AA that extends the duration of Spirit Call, as well as making the Scooby gang more controllable.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see something that makes Rabid Bear even remotely worth buying ... Triple Attack, cleric-hammer-level proccing capabilty, flurry, 'ignore death until it wears off'-effects, bells and whistles - whatever it takes. If anyone's read 'His Dark Materials', I'm thinking of something that makes us - albeit briefly - as powerful, savage and awe-inspiring as the armoured bears detailed therein. It'd be a case of 'Cleric's down ... multi mezzes are wearing off. Only the might of the Rabid Bear can save us now!! Rawwrrrrrr!!!!'. Stuff to brag about and reminisce over fondly, after the fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">An ability to cast a buff that can't be dispelled/anulled by the mob.<br />
<br />
i'll expand on this a bit.. a buff that can't be dispelled but counts as a dispelled buff.. IE: if a mob cast an AE that dispells 2 items.. it will only dispell 1 buff if you have the undispellable one on (unless that was what you meant?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still want a version of bhali with the speed of FoE but with an attack buff instead of that lev/see invis junk.<br />
<br />
Here here!  Its the small things that will go far to making a difference, in my opinion.  This would be one of them.  Its disheartening to see rangers get an speed increase in SoW while shaman do not.  I will say that the attack from Bih'li makes it a bit more attractive, but it still maxxes out at 55%.  65-70% isnt gonna break the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't mind seeing the ability to crit can4/chaotic/etc - double the damage for double the mana regained.  Don't make it work with can5 though, dear god talk about a rise in the shaman death rate.<br />
<br />
Keep it in line with the chance to crit nuke/heal/etc - 3%, 5%, 10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, that idea about the 'buff that cant be dispelled' got me thinking... How about this idea?<br />
<br />
Spell: Fake Buff<br />
Effect: When the holder is annulled, instead of losing any buffs, Fake buff will 'Sacrifice' itself instead.</div></div><hr />
