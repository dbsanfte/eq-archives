<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
After some slight twinkage (a friend gave me pp for horse and BP) I'm looking for some guidance on where to go from here for a casual player (read slooow leveler). This Shammy is almost 3 years old and he's my highest char.<br />
<br />
Please see my magelo below and offer up some sage wisdom :cool:<br />
<br />
I'll probably spend the next year between 36 and 45 so I'm looking for advice in the pre-JBB world.<br />
<br />
Currently, I feel like I still need the mana from my wis rings more than ac (1) because I'm LOM more than HP- manna regen slows me down even with Regen BP+Regen+ cannidance (but the regen is still sweet) and (2) with my other ac bonuses from jaundiced etc., I feel like have ac I need if things get bad, plus one or two extra spells from rings.<br />
<br />
Also Ive been willing the trade some AC for focus- I kinda like the Affliction Eff II on the CBB and the Spell Haste II on the Fine Diamond mask.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering about the horse, as I solo most of the time due to RL time constraints.<br />
<br />
When I hit 40 I plan to trade the hammer for the spear and shield, or if I'm grouping I'll use them for extra manna.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

If you are that concerned about mana possible consider the 5ac/35mana/35HP ring. Been awhile since i had one but think they are Velium Jade ( might be wrong on that)</div></div><hr />
