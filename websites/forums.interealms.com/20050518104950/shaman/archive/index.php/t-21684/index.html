<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I posted a similar thread in hunting 30-40, but here I have more specifid question.<br />
<br />
With Befriend Animal(lvl 29).  What can I charm?<br />
<br />
Animals, obviously... but is.. say... a Goblin(enraged) considered an animal?<br />
<br />
i am lvl 29, and want to start wastin some dwarfs. Lookin in the bestiary, there is NOTHING in there around my level to charm... only really low level skunks and such. Unless, I can charm a skele or goblin with this skill.<br />
<br />
Any help on what I can charm to get me to 34 would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sabretooth Grimalkins in lake of ill omen. That's what I did to get to 34. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure you can charm mammoths in Everfrost, but I could be wrong. Also might want to try walruses in Eastern Wastes. Sonic wolves in Hollowshade might be charmable too. I grouped pretty heavily to get to 34, so I didn't ever get a chance to use charm much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cast Sense Animals, it will show you what the game considers an animal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't remember the level cap on befriend animal, but you might try zelniaks and/or wolves in dawnshroud peaks (wolves being better, if they aren't too high level).  Greyhoppers in MSeru are decent too I think.  Cougars in Iceclad might be the right level as well.  Various animals in East Wastes might work too.  Drakkel dire wolves in great divide are nice as well (or the coldain tracking wolves, whichever you prefer).  Stonebrunt might have some animals worth charming and it's out of the way and hardly any company :)..er used to be at least.  Jaggedpine forest has some animals, but they are too high I do believe.  That's all I can think of for the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thx a bunch guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried our charm spell in eastern wastes, I couldn't charm anything besides snow bunny ^^. Helped me for the coldain shawl ( when you need to give vial of velium vapor to the dorf )</div></div><hr />

&quot;Look at the BONES !&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best use of charm animal was when I was sitting around in Butcherblock with a cleric and druid guildie pair. A skunk wandered by, i zapped a charm on it, and made it do dumb pet tricks. <br />
<br />
Then I cast focus, the druid popped on a Pot9, and the cleric symboled the thing. Then me and the druid alternated buffs - I cast infusion, he cast DS, I cast haste, he put on SoW, and then came the stat buffs and regen... Then he cast succor.<br />
<br />
So we had a level 2 skunk who could stand up to some of the guards. What did we do? We offered 500pp to the untwinked newbie who lasted the longest against Skunkinator.<br />
<br />
And in case anyone was wondering, skunk spray is a proc. Focus + haste, and the thing is stinking every time it hits you.</div></div><hr />

haha, what a old-time great movie<br />

You may now return to you regularly scheduled topic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did Greyhoppers in Marus Seru at that point.  The xp seemed to fly almost as fast as Paludal Caverns.  <br />
<br />
The hides they drop sell pretty well too so it's a win/win situation.<br />
<br />
I was frankly amazed at how powerful charm can be.  Almost made me envy enchanters.  Wish we had higher level charms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you look at Allakhazam's website [Zones/Beastiary] it lists the mobs in the zone followed by their type (Monster, Summoned, Undead, Animal, NPC, etc.). I think you can even sort by type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm pretty sure you can charm mammoths in Everfrost, but I could be wrong. <br />
HAHA! You can indeed. I charmed one and my LDoN group gave it full raid buffs, including extended sow! OMG! Then this druid was all trying so solo it, and it was totally outregening her ****, so then this hot **** BST tried to KS her. Ive never seen a Vah Shir die so fast omg. Good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,<br />
<br />
Deewater crocadiles in Oasis are also shaman charmable, though that won't help you when exp grinding.  I superbuff one every time I have to wait for that silly barge to Timourous Deep, or when bored waiting on someone for an adventure.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">on zek servers, you used to be able to charm a bat in gfay tell it to attack random person you don't like, and watch as the guards run after and kill that person.</div></div><hr />

Small derailment...<br />
<br />
We did that once when my ldon group was bored. I had a pet skunk at my side and decided to be evil and buff it.  Then the cleric gave it virtue and so I thought what the heck, and hasted/FA'd it as well.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of laughing about Stinky the Wonderskunk's possibilities with his 1500ish HP, we got a mission and wandered off.  Somewhere near the zone line charm broke and my valorous boyfriend saved me by defeating him....with one swing of his hammer....for 120 points of damage. No proc, no crit, nada.<br />
<br />
We always thought that was a weird thing to happen...a fully buffed pet dying in one swing of a cleric hammer.<br />
<br />
RIP Stinky! *sniff*...../faints</div></div><hr />
