<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to start a thred to gather some &quot;General feedback&quot;  On the New spell line introduced with DoN &quot;Panther line&quot; .<br />
<br />
Personal I had mixed feelings about the spell before I got it . It seemed like it would be a huge hasstle for minimal gain . However since I have gotten it my personal feelings have changed . I do think it is a hasstle however I feel like the gains are quite high . In my opinion this spell is very good and I consider it a nice assest to have .<br />
Generaly I demem a DoT or Nuke for this in EXP groups with several melee and or Pets &quot;which is most of my groups&quot; .<br />
<br />
My personal over all opinion on this new line is very positive . I wanted to get a &quot;feel&quot; for how the community as a whole feels about this issue .<br />
<br />
Feel free to be Very breif  &quot; I hate it , I love it , Im indiff &quot; or to go in to detail if you'd prefer .<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for shareing your opinions and feedback here .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gammink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the most part I like it, it does consume a lot of mana, so that kinda sucks, but the dps is worth it.  I havent been on a raid yet since getting it, and havent been making it well known that I have the spell; however I can see the tells now Soandso tells you, 'Champ and panther pls'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ergra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In oow xp group had this dropped on monk and took dps up by around 150 dps.This is a very nice spell considering some of the new spells some classes got (rangers and druids got shafted).<br />
<br />
Now all id like to see is for it to be changed so it procs off my rangers bow  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got the spell last night.<br />
<br />
I went to Skyfire to do some rough parsing.  Basically, mobs seemed to die about the same time if I put a dot or two + a nuke, or if I panthered myself and my pet.  <br />
<br />
I next did a DoN mission.  First go around, I didn't let anyone know that I had panther.  And as we had a druid and a cleric, I cast a quick Nihili and then tried to maximize my dps.  Most of the time, I took hits from mobs, and as I was additonally melee'ing, I was stealing aggro from the MT using yoppa, bane+melee with a stun proc.  I used a pretty good amound of mana and time healing myself.  And, I couldn't always canni the instant the button came up.<br />
<br />
Next DoN mission, I used leopard exclusively.  Mobs seemed to die at about the same rate.  But, the MT was keeping aggro, I was able to canni and stay closer to FM, the mob didn't ping pong as much, and I was additionally able to toss a nuke or two from time to time.<br />
<br />
The DPS is great.  The burst DPS in raids is great.  The general amount of clicking that I have to do per mob is about the same.  The fights are generally more controlled using panther versus high aggro dots, etc..<br />
<br />
From the very first parse everyone could pretty much agree that this spell was good in terms of damage, good in terms of aggro, and great in terms of resists.<br />
<br />
But, there are a million different ways that SOE could have provided the same effect without the annoyance value of panther.  There is just ZERO reason to make a 1 minute duration buff.  Give us 1 meaningfull, VISIBLE, long duration melee buff (something like the visible +crit enchanter haste), and a faster casting nuke or shorter duration higher damage dot (with negative resist checks), and you accomplish the exact same thing without changing the role of the shaman this dramatically.  <br />
<br />
Shaman Role 1<br />
The role of the shaman used to be:<br />
1.  Debuffing<br />
2.  Healing<br />
3.  Damage dealing<br />
4.  Buffing<br />
<br />
Shaman Role 2<br />
The role of the shaman now is:<br />
1.  Debuffing<br />
2.  Healing<br />
3.  Buffing<br />
<br />
Panther is so much better at dealing damage in a groups there is ZERO reason to cast our dots or nukes really.  While I've never argued about the value of the spell, I still hold firm to my believe that SOE could have let us retain our 4 original roles (as shown in &quot;Role 1&quot; above),  while at the same time changing our existing spells to accomplish the same thing that panther does.  <br />
<br />
1. We are the only (pure) casting cast without negative resist checks.  Why is that?<br />
2. We have the shortest duration and most complicated buff sets (and least visible effects.. enc crits, etc) of any buffing class.  Why is that?<br />
<br />
Instead of addressing the two above items, SOE gave us panther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gammik, you really really need Spell Casting Mastery 3 AA.  It's 10% (static, not variable like worn foci) mana savings on ever spell you cast.  That's 40 mana off've every cast of Malos, 30 from Nihil if you're using it, 52 from Spiritual Serenity, 65 from Panther (times however many pet/melee there are), 56 off Yoppa's Mending.   That's like 300 mana saved per creature your group kills, a free Pained Memory.  Huge, just huge.  Get that AA, like yesterday</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Panther still isn't a buff, it's a damage spell.  It's just like Mark of the Blameless or Pyrilen Skin or the original, the druid AA Wrath of the Wild.  A damage spell with a different formatting, like dots are different from nukes are different from melee are different from archery/throwing.  Your 1-2-3-4 are intact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The two spells provide a way to give a significant  increase to the DPS of a group or raid without the Shaman getting pasted by a mob from aggro.<br />
<br />
I have been using this spell in groups and on raids, and yes, it makes a very noticeable difference in fight durations.<br />
<br />
Mana usage is something you have to consider, but with mana buffs, ft, and so on, a Shaman should be able to keep it on a good number of melee/pets.<br />
<br />
I hope they leave them as they are. Extending the duration initially seems like a great suggestion, but as powerful as these spells are, I think that extending the duration would get the spells nerfed somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last comment on this from me.  After that we'll just have to agree to disagree.<br />
<br />
Its a buff because I have to A) maintain it, and B) get /tells about it.<br />
Nukes, dots, and my dog are not influenced by other peoples desires or actions.  <br />
<br />
Fo7 raises someones strength, and thereby allows them to do more damage, and we can all agree its a buff.  This is just an annoyingly short duration buff that has a very visible effect.<br />
<br />
Ranged fights where you don't send melee in are one place where the power of panther is useless.<br />
Having the mana available to dots 5-6 mobs that are being offtanked while the primary force engages 1 mob are another situation that panther is detrimental.  <br />
<br />
Panther makes us no different than the sword the melee swings.  We are a tool for the melee to do damage.<br />
<br />
Ooo idea! :)   Lets let shaman shrink themselves to the size of augments, and we can get stuck in a melee's weapon! ;) haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I didn't have any initial reservations about the spell so I came in with an open mind as to how good it would be.  Upon casting it during my first raid setting, i realized how much of a difference the spell could be.  While the upkeep cost of the spell is great, for someone with a big mana pool like myself, and possibly a fight where I don't have a huge role outside of dps (like some of the tacvi fights), this spell rocks the game.. significantly lowering the overall kill time of such mobs.  Next time we are in Tacvi killing, I plan on not casting it at all during a named that I did cast it on last time and seeing how much overall difference the spell made.<br />
<br />
personally, I like it.  Duration of it sucks, but with the added benefits I wouldn't have it any other way.  Making the duration longer would I'm sure give us other unintended nerfs with it and I don't want to do that.  Right now, IMO, it's perfect.<br />
<br />
oh, and the rangers and druids didn't get shafted on their spell.  Granted, what they got was another version of snare, but this version has a chromatic adjustment and a resists modifier of -50.. therefore making it land a lot easier (and if you have never seen a mob in anguish run from snare not landed, then you have seriously missed out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spirit of the Leopard is great.  <br />
<br />
The Avatar line sucks because of the annoying recast time and I don't see (on my screen) how much it is improves melees, only parsing of log files shows that.  (I have most hits turned off to reduce spam)<br />
<br />
This spell is great, because I can see it going off (the proc message) from the melees I cast it on.  Plus the melees can see it going off as they proc it.  So I feel the damage done is mine and the melees feel the damage done is theirs - two for the price of one.  <br />
<br />
I use this spell instead of DoT's and nukes and get no aggro.  I can prep 3-4 melees with it before a mob is pulled so they are straight in with the procs while I am slowing.  <br />
<br />
I can cast the spell on DogDog and he is great with it.  heck, I cast it on me, and I am doing some nice DPS!<br />
<br />
I love this spell.  A lot.  It is a great spell and a great addition to the shaman lineup.  It also 'feels' right.  Shaman are melee buffers as one of our main roles and this is a great melee buff.  With this spell I make my tribe (group/guild/raid) great.  Kudos to the designer of this spell.  I applaude you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, it's a buff, for exactly how Ungkor put it... however relevant that is to the thread  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love this spell, today i was DoNing for about 3-4hours and I maintained it on the tank, 2 rangers, bard and my pet. This meant I could only slow/debuff the mobs as nuking/dotting would mean I would lose mana fast. the way i see it is as the solution to our short term DPS problem, in a melee heavy group, we generate the greatest (though indirect) DPS. This makes us much more desirreable than beastlords and enchanters in certain circumstances which I think is what we all want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I must admit I didn't expect to like this line because of the short duration but I got Leopard (maybe will have Panther if my /petition gets answered after the Chieftain ate my stone. =/) and really like it.  I can contribute very nice dps to a group or raid.  If the duration was any longer SoE would have to nerf it.  Whether you call it a buff, nuke, or a DoT I don't care.  It goes a long way to solving our dps and agro problems.<br />
<br />
The biggest drawback to this spell in a raid situation is realizing how many melee aren't hitting anything when you target them.  Sigh.</div></div><hr />

everyone that has specifically asked for this spell so far has gotten the **** off from me.  i refuse to allow this to become another avatar gimmy gimmy gimmy spell.<br />
in my normal group spell line up this has replaced my nuke. debuff on inc, sissak, leopard, yoppas.<br />
<br />
however i do agree it is a buff for the reason that it takes up a buff slot for an exstended period of time (1 min 48 seconds for me.  way longer of a duration than the druid DS aa that is spent after 1 hit.) once this goes to the bard window i'll decide if it should still be called a buff lol.<br />
<br />
This spell really need to give the caster a wear off message...</div></div><hr />

The only bad things I can see with this spell so far is that it takes up yet another buff slot.  I 2box with my BL and man slots are tight.  Yeah, I coudl drop another buff like sense or might, but crap, I just got those in the LAST expansion.  <br />
<br />
On an unrelated note.  Do you think that you would get the most DPS out of this from a wizard?  If the proc-rate is set at xxx per minute (if you get that many swings), wouldn't wizards get the most out of it since they have the hightest crit rate for spells?  Just curious.  Not that you woudl want to do that, just seemed like it would be funny to see a wizard critting almost every time with this for absurd damage adn tearing stuff up with melee.</div></div><hr />

This is what I like about this spell so much. Anyone can melee and add some DPS...<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter what class you are, you can still proc nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea we did.  <br />
<br />
The new snare is a lower percentage then any other regular snare so depending on a mobs run speed, he may still move.<br />
<br />
Even worse though is the duration is variable, just like our roots.  So that runner in Angush you mentioned?  He may be snared now, but when he turns and runs, who knows if snare will still be on him.  General concensus from the rangers is this spell is garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I must admit I didn't expect to like this line because of the short duration but I got Leopard (maybe will have Panther if my /petition gets answered after the Chieftain ate my stone. =/) <br />
SnIP&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Repeat the Still Moon mission where you kill Wong Li.<br />
<br />
Several people in my groupings/raidings have had this problem, and it unbugged them.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
As far as Leopard and Panther go:<br />
Leopard costs too much for a level 61 spell. I can not see a level 61 shaman keeping panther up on 2-3 people along with his normaldebuffng in a normal exp group.<br />
And Panther costs too much for a 69 spell, I'm a moderate raider(jsut got my first qarm piiece tonight, was way excited) with a mana pool of 7.3kand FT15, and I can not keep Panther on 3 people without falling behind in mana.<br />
I do not see a casual player enjoying this spell *quite* as much as a raiding player unless they have a large manapool.<br />
<br />
Those are my ONLY complaints.<br />
Panther's slightly higher DD(adds 145 basicaly to the 405 leopard) does not justify the 110 extra mana it costs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and speaking of raiding with Leopard/panther:<br />
Leopard OVERWRITES the higher Panther buff.<br />
Leopard BLOCKS the higher Panther buff.<br />
<br />
which really made stuff annoying on the last m`sha raid ~_~<br />
<br />
<br />
Mmm, that about covers it, I REALLY love this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">since getting this spell i have only had a couple groups but first thing I make clear is this spell to me is like another dot - I will cast it as much as I can for damage to help the group kill when i can. I think of it as a mobile dot that lasts almost two minutes and transfers from mob to mob as the melee changes targets... If they say panther please and I don have mana for dps i tell them i treat it the same as if i was dotting, when lom i won't cast it. <br />
<br />
Upsides (keep in mind i think of it as a dot, just a dot not affected by my spell foci):<br />
<br />
- elminiates concerns over dots not running their full course - as long as theres a mob in camp this one keeps on going.<br />
<br />
- eliminates the concern over drawing dot aggro and pingponging mobs<br />
<br />
- is a negative resist check (finally) for a spell we can contribute damage with. <br />
<br />
- ammount of damage versus mana cost is rather nice.<br />
<br />
Downsides:<br />
<br />
- melee think of it as a buff when really its a mobile dot or added shaman dps in the form of a buff. I set them straight right off on how i will treat this 'buff' and they dopn't make the mistake of whining about it again.<br />
<br />
- it takes the damage out of the shamans hands. Its clear they want us to be buffers and debuffers and to do all our damage and contribution this way... kinda demeaning for the class that used to contribute more than marginal debuffs and heals.<br />
<br />
- It is a pita with its short duration... but no more annoying than having to recast dots or cast nukes... just not as much fun since others get to do the damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
I think its headed for a nerf... I hope not but thats my fear. PM me if you want to know why... <br />
<br />
I like the spell personally now that i have been able to play with it some and hope it continues to remain as useful as it is now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, this spell is... really good.  I parsed our top rogue (#1 on the server) with gaining approx 200DPS... not an extended parse only a fight or two, and the average was around 200... 200DPS added onto the already 600-800 DPS the rogue can put up.  So, yeah... this spell rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont understand this... taking the damage out of the shaman's hands?? maybe i play my shaman completely wrong... but i melee almost every mob.. grouping that is.. and on raids i even try to get some melee in... after debuffs of course... i see my shaman as an ok tank with cool spells.. and i play him as such.. ive tanked DoN missions.. Ldon mission  and exp camps up to and including MPG.. with the right buffs i break 9300hp and with defense aa's maxed i can stand up to my fair share of mobs... sure i dont have disc's like most melee but i can hold my own.. keeping HoT's on myself while clerics start their heals a little sooner on me than on actual melee classes i can still be effective.. holding agro isnt a problem either.. dots and a cripple is instant agro.. not to mention the TA clicky if i lose agro.. a couple clicks of the ta and im right back on top of the hate list. only problem with how i melee with my shaman is sometimes the actually Tank in the group gets upset that he actually has to work to keep agro.. he just cant hit auto attack and sit back and watch tv..<br />
<br />
as for SoL  yes its hard to keep on 3 or more members of a group... but keeping it on me is easy.. lately ive been casting it on me and my pet.. or me and the Main dps of a group (rogue pally monk)  they seem to like it... just the duration sucks like i posted before... i would love to see the lvl 69 version be the exact same.. single target 405 ddproc but increase the duration to say 3 min or so.. make the refresh time 20sec or there about so you cant chain cast it.. i dont want a group version or the same duration that just does 100hp more...<br />
<br />
thats my opinion you dont have to agree or disagree..but thats just what i would like to see out of a lvl 69 spell</div></div><hr />

<br />
*points at the magelo link ~_^*<br />
I have 13% mana save on beneficial spells, my specialize is alteration, and I have my spell casting mastery AA maxed.<br />
I am aware that there are better foccii out there, but, eh, most of them require heavy raiding to build up the DKP to grab them, and I think I shall be happy with 13% as opposed to the 10% mana pres V that's easily available out there.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity... What do you mean by falling behind in mana?<br />
<br />
I mean net mana per fight.<br />
How much mana I cast out(Malos, panther, a heal, slow, whatever), and how much mana I manage to get back per fight(Canni5, Pained Memory, meditate)<br />
<br />
From beginning of mob, to the amount of time it takes to pull the next mob into camap, my mana is generaly down a little, not a lot. over the course of 3 fights I would say I notice mana falling behind by about 5%, for me personaly.</div></div><hr />

Good.. welcome to the real world.  The world where someone actually has to work at it to keep mana up (you know.. for some people who actually do what they can to maximize dps).  Seriously, if i'm in a group and I'm full mana or near it, then I'm not maximizing my dps and would consider myself a waste to the group.  If you fall behind on mana.. so what.. don't cast panther a fight or two, get that mana back and then do it again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont understand this... taking the damage out of the shaman's hands?? maybe i play my shaman completely wrong... but i melee almost every mob.. grouping that is.. and on raids i even try to get some melee in... after debuffs of course... i see my shaman as an ok tank with cool spells.. and i play him as such.. ive tanked DoN missions.. Ldon mission and exp camps up to and including MPG...group... but keeping it on me is easy.....i would love to see the lvl 69 version be the exact same.. single target 405 ddproc but increase the duration to say 3 min or so.. make the refresh time 20sec or there about so you cant chain cast it.. i dont want a group version or the same duration that just does 100hp more...<br />
. <br />
<br />
That's great and all.. everyone can play their shaman how they see fit, but.  It's cool that you like to pretend that you can tank, and that you can pretend that you can melee, but the real facts are that, regardless of what you try to melee with, you aren't going to beat even the average geared level 50 rogue in melee dps.  You'd be better dps just sitting down to med and then sticking another dot on the mob or castin leopard or panther on something.<br />
<br />
The last thing that we want is to have another spell with a recast timer on it that would require us to sit there and wait for it to pop.  To me, this is the absolute beauty of panther.  I know that I can sit there and demem it and remem it again and not have to worry about waiting a minute for it to refresh.  This is the reason why I have a really hard time dememing champion or vindicative spirit sometimes.  It's just not worth it to demem it and then run into the situation where I will want to cast it and not have it up.  I do agree that the mana cost is pretty extreme, but you can make it work, even in a raid setting.  I kept the entire guild melees with panther the other day during a few named tacvi fights, but my mana pool is pretty extensive compared to most, and I had to use SC a few times, as well as chaining canni5, ancient ancient canni, and mod rod whenever I could.  It sucked yes trying to keep up with the mana, but the benefits to the raid far outweighed my personal discomfort.  Besides, I had fun afterwords realizing how much extra dmg it did and how much I contributed to that overall dmg.  I singlehandedly became the highest dps factor in the guild.  Make this spell have a recast timer on it and to me, I will not be able to use it.  This would effectively make it so that you have to time it, and then retime it every cast, giving much ass pain.  As it stands right now, it's perfect for me.  I know that I can stick it on my pet or myself and then the other melees in the group and can wait for it to need refreshing and not worry about not being able to do anything else during that time cause i'm trying to time it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(FWIW I chose a shaman back in the day because a) I wanted to thump stuff and be able to cast and b) I have a thing for wolves and having a wolf as a pet (albeit a spirit wolf) really appealed. Beastlords weren't an option when I rolled my shaman, but having made one since I miss a heck of a lot of things, not least canni and root.)<br />
<br />
Keeping it up on one melee and the pet isn't a problem and it seems the recipients really enjoy seeing the numbers, a big problem with DoTs being we're the only ones who see how much damage we're pumping out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">and recasting or as you say you had it on all your guild melee at a tacvi fight you would have to chain cast it.. unless you know a secret to buff extentions making it a 3min duration or you raid with max of 10 melee classes.. but i dont wanna turn this into a flame post this is for feedback on a spell sony tried hard to make good.. and for the most part they did... but to have a 20 sec recast wouldnt bug me in the least bit if i would only have to cast it on someone or myself every 5 min..</div></div><hr />

I have 13% mana save on beneficial spells, my specialize is alteration, and I have my spell casting mastery AA maxed.<br />
I am aware that there are better foccii out there, but, eh, most of them require heavy raiding to build up the DKP to grab them, and I think I shall be happy with 13% as opposed to the 10% mana pres V that's easily available out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean net mana per fight.<br />
How much mana I cast out(Malos, panther, a heal, slow, whatever), and how much mana I manage to get back per fight(Canni5, Pained Memory, meditate)<br />
<br />
From beginning of mob, to the amount of time it takes to pull the next mob into camap, my mana is generaly down a little, not a lot. over the course of 3 fights I would say I notice mana falling behind by about 5%, for me personaly.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with 'falling behind' on mana levels.<br />
<br />
I expect to 'fall behind' on mana. I expect it with Leopard/Panther especially. However, I have Spiritual Channelling for those times when my mana gets below my comfort level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Other classes actually use mana to cast spells, no reason shamans shouldn't also.  Wizards, Enchanters, Druids, Magicians, Necromancers, Shadowknights, Rangers, Beastlords all work as hard as they can to oom every fight, afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As far as I understood Haxot, he's talking of an exp session. In a grinding situation the net mana spent per fight should be identical with the mana you regen, in order to avoid downtime. Optimally, you try and adjust your mana expenditure to the pull speed ect. This is what every class does or every player should do. <br />
<br />
Shamans spend mana to cast spells just like everyone else, the only difference is that Shamans have a higher mana regen during downtime, while everyone else has a slightly higher mana regen during the non-downtime(for the lack of a better term). <br />
A Shaman's spells are less efficient, but the more downtime a group has or the less the Shaman is forced to do other things, the higher the advantage for the Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">well, so far I'm liking the spell line.<br />
<br />
I don't try to &quot;maintain&quot; it on anyone, but I do keep it memmed to toss on anything that pretty much is meleeing at the time.<br />
<br />
when I'm soloing, it helps me burn down the mob quickly to conserve mana. (with my staff 210 hit, 400 staff proc, 405 Leopard Proc, 1015 dmg on a single swing, yes, the proc compounds with weapon procs)<br />
<br />
in group situations, it helps me contribute a large boost in DPS towards specific mobs, namely if we have Adds in camp. if someone is offtanking one add, I'll toss it on him, and the mob will get knocked down a bit more before the main mob is dead. less work for everyone.<br />
<br />
in raids....I do my usual rounds, dodging in and out of melee and mobs, slowing, DoTing and tossing this on dual wielding classes, and classes that have high-proc modifiers. this usually helps in situations when its getting late, and the raid starts to get a little low on numbers because of the time. the extra DPS seems to help a good bit.<br />
<br />
but all-in-all I don't maintain the spell on any one person, I toss it on the ones I think need a push in DPS. its a great spell, but the duration could use alot of work....3 mins or so, the cast and recast are fine, and the mana cost isn't detrimental to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">What Leopard/Panther thing ?<br />
<br />
Leopard (level 61) overwrites and blocks Panther (level 69)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Giac understood what I meant.<br />
For EXP grouping, mana output and mana regen should be near the same.<br />
Not counting named, or raiding.<br />
Just an expful group.<br />
Wizards do not burn all their mana out, because then they have to sit on their arse.(At least, the wizards I run with don't, they try to meter it out conceptualy).<br />
<br />
I rarely find an EXP group where you 'burn out' your mana and then afk for a bit,, Riftseekers? Nope, not even there with chain pulls. Med breaks in properly balanced exp groups are rare.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, optimaly speaking.<br />
<br />
And if a level 61 spell drains this much mana from someone who's raid geared, then it's not going to be pleasent and fun for people who are level 61.<br />
<br />
If Panther maw did this, I wouldn't mind so much. But if I where a new sham, just entering 61, hades, how many AAs did YOU have at 61? Here someone reccommended, Oh, go purchase SCM for 12 AAs.<br />
Go get a mana pres item.<br />
<br />
At 61, i dunno about you, but for me, 12 AAs was my holy grail on the trail to Canni5,,, focus items where,, &quot; drool,, Am I ever gonna get one... drop,, please god, please?<br />
<br />
Don't tell me because You guys who have 10k mana pools can easily keep this spell up that it's perfectly balanced. <br />
Don't go the &quot;EQ is for raiders&quot; route.<br />
<br />
Hax<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I look atmyself, and my friends and guildmates someteims call me Uber (someitmes adding a G when I get egotistical)<br />
I look at many of the magelos represetned here...<br />
<br />
Valsuvoius, you have an unbuffed mana pool of 9.2k <br />
I should HOPE you have no trouble keeping people buffed.<br />
<br />
Arumani,,, my dear soul shakes at the thought that people can actualy break 10kmana and hp unbuffed,,<br />
<br />
You guys have no business claiming something is balanced,, if it is balanced for YOU 2 people,, then it is NOT balanced for the poor, 36AA level 61 shaman jsut fresh off the street.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Just because you can scribe it at 61 doesn't mean the spell reaches its full power for you at that level.<br />
<br />
In other words, it may take more AAs and gear to be able to optimally use it.  Until then, you get to play with it and love it as much as you can for the benefit it gives you, because it's only gonna get that much better down the line :)<br />
<br />
Now, the Base2_4 and _5 changes on test worry me.  I don't know what either one does, honestly, but I don't like being handed a spell that makes me feel great about my class, then watching something change on test. :)</div></div><hr />

No idea why you went off on this tangent... Why do people always have to bring up the 'You aren't playing down at our level' card.<br />
<br />
Look... I was in your position as some point in the game, so don't try to tell me I don't know what you are saying just because I am not at that point in the game anymore.<br />
<br />
You can learn a lot about your capabilities by pushing your limits as far as they can go, but I would hope that is common sense. ;)<br />
<br />
Myself for instance... I am testing to see how many people I can keep Panther on through long duration fights in MPG, Tacvi, and so on. I've gone OOM a few times, gotten a rogue or two killed by aggro :D and been at 30-40 health often. I learn from the experiences. I am testing MY limits, so I know MYSELF better, and what I can do with MY mana pool using this spell. No, it isn't easy, but the Shaman class pushed to it's limit's isn't about being easy, at least IMO.<br />
<br />
Things I have learned so far:<br />
<br />
1. Leopard/Panther works great on mobs that like to flip-flop initial aggro. Put Leopard/Panther on your MT just before the mob gets to the camp... helps quite a bit. Put Leopard/Panther on other's after 5-10 seconds.<br />
<br />
2. Raid Mob gets to about 15-20%... hit MT with Leopard/Panther then spam it on every pet and melee at it's back. Watch the mob's health drop like a rock.<br />
<br />
3. Leopard/Panther on swarm pets is devastating.<br />
<br />
4. I didn't know it was broken for SK's, but I learned that today from reading another thread. Hope this gets fixed soon.<br />
<br />
I'm still learning more about the spell's capabilities, but this is what I have discovered so far.<br />
<br />
Once I know my limits with Panther, then I can start seeing how to integrate what I can do with patch healing, slowing unexpected adds, DD, and so on (although I have already been doing this somewhat as it is). Going through this process improves my knowledge and my performance on raids, in groups, and when soloing.<br />
<br />
What my limits are have nothing to do with your play style, and I am not trying to tell you how to play or what you should be able to do, so don't take it that way.<br />
<br />
All I was saying is a mana deficit isn't a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

Why are you saying that? Don't get me wrong, I agree somewhat even though I found a good slot for it, but why did you mention it here?<br />

<br />
That's what adjusting your mana expenditure is.  Heck, just do your pet, the pets proc a lot more than melees.</div></div><hr />

I only have a 6.5k mana pool but using this much mana doesn't really put me very low using an occasional canni. I would say it only puts me around 40% if not a little more depending on if I have pained memory up or canni5.</div></div><hr />

So it can cast faster? it's 3.0 base cast time, so Quick Buff 3 doesn't work on it. I have QoM and it chops almost a second off leopard's cast time. that crap adds up.</div></div><hr />

There were only three items in PoP with bene haste focus for shaman.  Belt, Arms, rare-as-grinch-valentines earring.  Those items were about two years ago for my guild, I apped after those stopped dropping.  In GoD there were, similarly, 3 items, but those are ALL rarer that Rare McRareson of Raresville.  So rare, in fact, that not a single Bene spell haste item from GoD exists in my guild.  No Mindrider range items (whose brilliant idea was it to give that mob a *21* item deep loot table?) , no Choker of Centaur Slaying (never even SEEN that mob, despite weeks &amp; weeks of Demerix/etc farming), no Armguards of Envy.  We do have, as a guild, three Illuminated Hammers, but that's just not a shaman item!  Harro, Time's Antithesis,  Shaman simply don't have a primary slot!<br />
<br />
On to OoW... I've ignored drops for other classes thusfar, but there's no avoiding it in OoW.  Clerics, Druids, Paladins so far have the only Alacrity of the Ikaav items anywhere, on their class-only armor!  Obviously, the arguement could be made that Clerics and Paladins do 99% of their spellcasting on the beneficial side (since stuns are too fast for haste), and thus justify thier getting better haste.  But druids are just like shamans, splitting their time close to evenly between their healing &amp; killing duties, so that line of reasoning is right out the window.<br />
<br />
Itemization on Bene spell haste really really needs to be addressed.  I've -0- interest at all in the 15mil cold nuke foci that get tagged on shaman items, could I please have just one spell haste there instead?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">You just have to explain to people it is not a buff it is more like a disc. It only lasts a minute so it will not be on the constantly. In raids I mainly use it on named and then I chain cast it on anything or anyone I see swinging at the mob.<br />
 I was in a group yesterday and I was able to slow then cast leapard on the tank, necro pet, and mage pet, cast chaotic pain and sit and be fm before next mob was in camp and time for me to slow again. I never had to use canni 5 during this and I was not on my horse. I think I could keep it up on maybe 5 or 6 people in a group situation if I was on my horse and used canni a little better. I lack a few AAs that would also make this better and I also do not have a mana preservation item. So to me right now I agree the spell is perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">well, back to the original topic, I'm finding the spell useful.<br />
<br />
while a lvl 61 cannot chain cast the spell, it does provide an unbelivable amount of DPS for someone of that level.<br />
<br />
a 405 DD proc is nothing to scoff at. at 61, a proc of this power is unbelivable. at that point, the highest nuke a shaman has (unmodified) is 675, for 275 mana, Leopard is a 405 DD (procrate math: x4 = 1620, x7 = 2835) for 540 mana. nuke has a 2.4:1 mana ratio, while the proc has a 3.0:1 (proc x4) and 5.25:1 (proc x7) mana ratio. (those who have the spell know my proc/per cast estimates are fair)<br />
<br />
while you don't get the satisfaction of a killshot, that DPS is all you. and not to mention, with the cast time, you can put this on several targets at once. 3 people, 5 procs each = 6075 damage for 1620 mana.<br />
<br />
the mana adds up, but so does the damage.<br />
<br />
and you don't need to factor in resists, the chromatic resist check of -300 is near unresistable.<br />
<br />
for this kind of DPS, a similar level wizard would die from nuke aggro by the time he reached half that damage.</div></div><hr />

But I hate this f***ing spell with a passion. I hate it so much, I would knock up its sister from spite, then run away to Mexico and leave its family with the burden. I would then come back after several months to slash its tires, steal its girlfriend, hack into its bank account, delete its identity, foreclose on its house, kick its dog, key its car, clog its septic tank, smear vaseline on its toilet seat after putting industrial laxative in every bit of food in its house, force it to watch Kevin Costner movies, and then hire an angry and morbidly obese Samoan man to do horribly non-heterosexual things to its outhole while forcing its family and pets to watch in obscene horror, emotionally scarring it and all its kin for life.<br />
<br />
All this because of the duration.</div></div><hr />

LMAO! Almost shot coffee out of my nose. <br />
<br />
 :p<br />
<br />
Oh, and I wish I had your mana pool  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Just get this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82148). Not the best spell haste, but better than nothing and very easy to get.<br />
<br />
That == tribute.  Worse, even, since it would take an aug slot.  It's the baseline, and hardly addresses the issue.  Melee advance by looting weapons, and to a lesser extent the +% mods like accuracy, strikethrough.  Casters advance by looting focus items.  Focus items are the difference between :uber casters and bazaar casters; foci that they're supposed to get by looting the mobs that players behind them can't beat.  I'm in the highest guild on my server, and we still have mains taking loot from monthly PoTime twink runs to get bene spell haste.  How cool that two year old gear is making folks give up 125hp on that slot, yes? no.  How cool that a guild who beat PoTime that long ago is still proudly sporting that crap.  Because crap it is, when you're working on Tacvi &amp; your 6th MPG mastery raid.  Or, I should say, crap is should be.  But it's not, because we can't get the foci from content we're progressing on.  Read that.  It could otherwise be said: we can't advance by looting the tier of encounters we're doing TO advance.  That's ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Firstly, don't have it, so basing view on what I've seen of the spell (Lucy &amp; other folks casting etc).

If only I had an easier way of getting to it, but being generally anti-social means trying to 3-box for it, which is not that easy.<br />

That being the case...just hang tight until the shards become tradeable and buy yourself what you need.  May be pricey but hey if you don't want to group, it is one solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hope so but it will take time before we probably see those prices come down, as always anything new will be jacked up 1000x higher than it should be.  <br />
<br />
Remember discordant crystals for OOW port spells selling for 50k?  Even if something is plentiful it will take time for pricing to equalize.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Previously the 'master of buffs' (or whatever you classify a shaman) could only justify their existance in groups by parsing hours of logfiles and hours of /tells to people about your usefulness (doesn't really apply to rl friends, close knit groups).<br />
<br />
Now shaman can cast this spell in lue of high aggro dots or inefficent nukes (they are slow) and everyone can see the value of the contribution.<br />
<br />
At 61, the choice is easy.  Leopard &gt; dots.<br />
At 70, the choice is a coin flip depending on your focus effects (dots vs Leopard/panther).<br />
For the raider, you now have an option for high resist targets.  Albiet somewhat overpowering.<br />
<br />
Until the notion of Upkeep based spells (you pay a mana cost per tick to keep a spell up on someone) the duration is acceptable and does a good job of making SHM a viable addition to groups.  Even if you don't believe the arguments it could be claimed SHM/ENC/BST/BRD are all replacable as a slower and SHM were typically less perfered.  Now the case is more ambigious.<br />
<br />
The only real flaw has to do with Proc stacking.  Bards have a similar (at least in proc rate) spell as a result of DoN.  The bards spell probably shouldn't be cast in a group if a SHM can maw people.  If you have a 25% chance ot proc either 75 or 405 damage but not both, most would take their chances with the 405.  Hopefully procs at some point will be ordered so players will know which is checked first.  The last theory I heard was the buff slot order, but bard spells are in their own buff box and appear to be checked first.</div></div><hr />

Bards can't use this spell if they are mezzing and meleeing.  The spell procs make their target switch and they lose the mez.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're probably right. However, once the pull is established as a single pull, the Bard can sing the proc song (melee-heavy group), sing the dot-increasing song (dotter-heavy group), or elect to contribute his own damage via melee/dots, whichever is more efficient. Then, towards the end of the fight, he can switch and chain-mez gaters/chealers.<br />
<br />
Bard proc song is huge, and I can't wait to get my spell. Two goodie-goodie missions done already.</div></div><hr />
