<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after 4 years, im finally going outside to see the Large shiney thing. I have never really posted here much, but did a lot of reading and learning ever since i found the site. Wish i would have found it earlier, a well.<br />
<br />
Sony has unfortunately IMHO taken a good game and community and drug it through the money making pit. I no longer enjoy being led forward with the promise of the carrot on the string.<br />
<br />
To the rest of the Shaman community I wish you good luck and happy travels. I may check in here from time to time, till the addiction wears off completely hehehe. <br />

I've quit about 3 times or so. hehe.<br />

This game rocks -- my brother and I just got our eighth shawls this week.  woot! :)</div></div><hr />

So you're leaving? <br />

Send your Quarter to Sony, I just dont care to play anymore, the fun has gone out of the game. I was just telling the rest of the forum how much I appreciated their advice over the years. <br />
<br />
Obviously your Advice is / was disregarded.<br />
<br />
Have a nice life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GL in real life man. I'm at the door so to speak atm dont think I'll be to much behind you. If the game keeps changing for the worse I wont stick around for it. Nor will I play anyother game made by SOE if that happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since no one else has said it yet....<br />
<br />
Can I have your stuff?<br />
<br />
What better way to say so long to an EQ player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Although I probably haven't contributed much to this board, I'm still glad to know I'm part of something that has helped shaman in general and will continue to help.  It is also sort of sad to know that another member of the community is leaving us.  Each time we have a long-time shaman leave, all shaman lose something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Geeze Soupy chill out.<br />
<br />
 He was just saying bye,thanks and he's movin on . <br />
<br />
Didn't hear a whole lot of &quot;woe is me&quot; in his post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pilson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow.  No surprise why I'm finding less and less reason to peruse these boards.  You folks who are bitter and angry would find very good company at the Cleric boards.<br />

Not all of us are punks, and some are always sad to see someone go.<br />
<br />
When I go, I won't be back for any SOE games either, and I agree they've messed the game up even worse than usual lately.  I don't think either they or Verant have ever really realized what kind of game/phenomenon they have on their hands and how to direct and control it.  I think it's simply bigger than they are; and it's definitely bigger than any accountant could ever dream of being.  Maybe World of Warcraft will attract my attention, but I kind of hope it won't. ;)<br />
<br />
I don't know when my time will come, but I hope you enjoyed yours while you were here.  Even with all the punks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think PoP has killed it for a lot of people, have fun man... laters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This community is a real piece of work.<br />
<br />
You bitch 24/7 about what a raw deal shamans got. About how your now completly worthless. About how every class in the game is better then you now.<br />
<br />
Then when someone says there quiting you start barating him &quot;OMG how dare you take any forum space away that could be used to bitch about BLs/Spell drops/worthlesness in pop&quot;<br />
<br />
I bet if he posted &quot;Im quiting because I don't have torpor/A BL joined my guild/I was LFG for 10 minutes&quot; He would have been greeted with &quot;Way to go man, don't give SoE there $10 a month&quot;<br />
<br />
So im curious why don't you all get together and decided what things were allowed to bitch about. Ohh master of the forums</div></div><hr />

One of the few things you might truly miss is the ability to /ingore soupypoopy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm with Mill on this one... I have finally learned how to actually have fun at EQ, this after leaving many times and once for almost two years.<br />
