<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's happened with every other MMORPG release.  The new game implements a handful of new ideas (and a good deal of things that EQ players have been asking for) - and suddenly these same improvements become high priority for the EQ devs.  I could be putting some of these with the wrong games, but if I remember right... Anarchy Online gave us instanced dungeons.  Horizons (and SWG) gave us the non-carpal-tunnel tradeskill system.  What might CoH bring?<br />
<br />
Fly - don't think this is ever going to happen in EQ.  Though I'd laugh really hard if they put it in as an option in some new zones, or in some instanced dungeons.  It wouldn't be a far shot (development-wise) from underwater zones like Kedge, just without the water.<br />
<br />
Rez potions - as far as I know, CoH is the first game with rez potions (inspirations), and I love it.  Even if it's simply revive.  There are a lot of reasons to not have rez potions in EQ, but none of them are good.<br />
<br />
Fun - okay okay, that was a cheap shot.<br />
<br />
Instanced dungeons are attached to the character - not the group.  So you can solo your dungeons, or you can go in with whoever happens to be with you at the time.  Because spending an hour putting together a dungeon group is just not fun.<br />
<br />
Anyone have others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK, since you asked:<br />
<br />
- Sidekick feature - so you can play with your friends regardless of level.  Man, really took the wind out of my sails when LDoN came out and I was 9 levels below my level 65 uber friends.  Never got a chance to LDoN with them, they have all left EQ since.<br />
<br />
- Branching spell/ability trees - maybe in the next expansion, when they raise the level cap to 75 they could also implement branching spell and ability trees so that not every single class character has the same exact spells/abilities.<br />
<br />
- Single person instanced zones - Just make LDoN scale to one person.  I really don't care about the impact to server loads, just do it so I can solo when I don't have time to find a group.<br />
<br />
- Exp debt instead of exp loss on death - Self explanatory.<br />
<br />
Those are my additional ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Single person/small group instanced zones have been around a long time in AO and the sliding difficulty bar AO provides is really nice. It would be something really great for eq too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Single person instanced zones.. that is really nice. It is pretty nice to be able to just pop on and play for 30-45 minutes if I want to, you can't with ldon,  you need a min of 2hours. I like the idea of rez potions too, we have all discussed this, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't implement that they don't like to give rezzes out too easily</div></div><hr />
