Things shamans have been overlooked for....<br />
<br />
* pets dont dual wield automatically... every single other class does (including enchanters)<br />
* LDON focus item for pets.  It includes necros/mages/beastlords... shamans aren't included.<br />
* druids get to charm animals, necros undead, enchanters anything... shamans get skipped (yes, shamans have a befriend animal spell)<br />
* shadowknight pets are proven to outperform the shaman Truespirit (61) pet<br />
== conclusion: shamans aren't a pet class.<br />
<br />
* 2nd tier of heals, when druid got their heal upgrades 60-64, shamans got nothing.  No upgrade to CH, no upgrade to quick heal.  Okay, at 65 they get the negative effects from torpor removed, and it's called Quiescence now... but same hitpoints healed.<br />
* gates: minimal upgrade to Q, everyone else gets upgrades to their quick heals, including hybrids<br />
== conclusion: shamans aren't healers<br />
<br />
* gates and prior... everyone that is remotely considered a nuke class, can nuke better than shamans. That includes clerics and enchanters.<br />
== conclusion: shamans aren't nukers<br />
<br />
* ldon... shamans get a 30 sec dot that's magic based. Druids get a 30 sec dot that's fire based and has a resist adjustment.  Necros just dot better every day of the week.<br />
* gates... shamans get a brand new shiny new disease dot... which is totally and utterly crap.  It's barely an upgrade to the level 64 disease dot which is also totally and utterly crap.<br />
== conclusion: shamans must be dot classes, but let's give them worse dots than other classes that dot, just because.... <br />
<br />
* gates and prior... mobs start mitigating slow, beastlords get a level 65 slow that competes with shaman slow... <br />
== conclusion: shamans are a slowing class, but let's reduce the effectiveness of slow down because slow is too overpowering.<br />
<br />
* gates and prior... shamans have awesome mana regen.. let's balance that by giving every other casting class (and hybrids) their own mana regen that's passive, so they can do other things while the shaman is standing there looking like they are enjoying themselves cannibalizing..<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, but there's buffs... okay let's take a look. Out of these buffs, what would you like to have... Kei/VoQ, Virtue/Symbol, blessings of the nine, ferocity, Circle of Seasons, whatever the enchanter MR buff is.. vs the shaman selection of focus, stamina, avatar, poison/disease buff.  Oh, I guess 60% haste for a shaman, 50% haste for a beastlord, and whatever insane high percentage for enchanters it is (and group version at that).<br />
<br />
If you had to pick and choose.. what buffs do you use?<br />
<br />
Let's wake up and smell the dung....<br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS SONY DOING!?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
/bootkick<br />
<br />
/rude<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
This isn't to accomplish anything except me blowing off major steam.  I'm FRUSTRATED.   Quite frankly, the class is hurting.<br />
<br />
I already have a new char, a 61 paladin started just after christmas.  I'd rather play the shaman if they'd just make them remotely balanced with everyone else around 100AAs ?<br />
<br />
Just give us a 1500hp heal (maybe 1800 if you want to make me feel like it's christmas), and a 1000hp nuke, and a pet that's at least better than the shadowknight pet? (If you want to have it dual wield automatically, and be able to use the pet focus item from takish, that'd be a nice gift too...)  NONE of these are overpowering, not even all together!</div></div><hr />

Conclusion.  Shaman have a wide variety of spells and things they can do even if they are not the best at any particular task...although...I would argue that shaman are the best slowers even if the percent value of our slow isn't clearly superior (it's just that you don't always need the best slower...just like you don't always need the perfect tank...just like you don't always need a cleric to heal...just like etc, etc, etc, ad nauseum, vomit everywhere.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shut up about the dead horse .. as far as I know my shaman is still alive (just barely but still alive).  Lets keep the discussion going.</div></div><hr />

It may be a dead horse but I do not see what the problem is with blowing off steam. Like I said in another thread if you dont like it dont read it. <br />
Please get over yourself people put alot of work into their toons and would like to feel useful. I guess in your book thats a crime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, its a crime.  I haven't put any time into any of my characters over the past 3 years that I've played EQ.  I don't want to have fun when I log on and I certainly don't like to feel useful in my groups.  <br />
<br />
I think I'm just voicing a frustration that a lot of others are feeling about the state of our boards right now.  That's right, OUR boards, mine and yours.  I'm tired of hearing about this, and I think a lot of other people are too.  We can groan and moan as much as we'd like about the state of Shaman abilities, but I don't think we've seen a single change to our abilities set since Velious.  Not one.  Some classes, like rangers and druids, have been almost completely redefined, but shaman sit at the same place we did at the end of Velious.  <br />
<br />
I think its time to take a step back and look at the realities of the situation.  The fact that our class has been in virtual stasis for so long should tell us that we are, to use a developer phrase, functioning as intended.  In SOE's eyes we seem to be a support class.  We don't do anything well (other than slowing,) but we have a more varied skill set than any class but Bards.  I understand that some people aren't happy with this particular lot in life and would like our abilities bumped up in several areas. However, after literally months of complaining, we have yet to see a significant change.  Thus the dead horse comment.  <br />
<br />
SOE either isn't listening to or doesn't care about what people are saying here.  There isn't somebody sitting at the SOE offices reading the Crucible saying &quot;OK, if they post sixty..hmm no...seventy posts complaining about the state of Shamans, we'll start to address their issues.&quot;  These posts simply don't make a difference and they clearly irritate a certain segment of the readership of the boards.  So I'm voicing my displeasure at the state of the boards, if YOU don't like it YOU don't have to read it.    <br />
<br />
For the sake of constructive critiquing, I suggest that the Crucible should stage a three pronged attack on SOE if you want to see a change come about.  Every day, every dissatisfied user should send a pre-written email to the developers.  Every week, send a pre-written letter to SOE headquarters expressing your complaints about their product.  And finally, circulate an online petition based separately from the Crucible (ie, with a different internet address) to all message boards that might be sympathetic to the cause.  That might, and emphasize MIGHT, get their attention.</div></div><hr />

In the past whining has proven to be the only way to get things chanced. (druids, warriors, etc)<br />
So I suggest as much topics about why we sux as I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah Grimdreg, lets just give up all hope and **** to the whiners.   What a great idea!  How about you propose another original idea like an online petition!  Yeah!  Like maybe if we keep our mouths shut on the board so you can read yet another misplaced topic over which is better, HP or Wis while the rest of just use email!!  Yeah!!!!<br />
<br />
Get real this is an open discussion forum.  We will discuss our class' strengths and weaknesses here.  Right now we are in a period of decline and so you will see posts about our waning power.   But I guess since you don't want to see it anymore we should just shut up and deal.   After all that is how druid's got fixed isnt it?  Didn't they just sit back and do nothing?  <br />
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, there is absolutely no support between ~any~ class boards out there whatsoever.  I don't really understand it myself, but its fairly easy to pick up if you stay up to date with most of them.  The only one that might even be interested would be the monks, since we've always gotten along very well with them.</div></div><hr />

Shammy's are still needed to slow, but the whole mitigation thing really hoses us. Immune I can take on a few big mobs, but mitigation? It just shoves the spear farther in the wound...</div></div><hr />

Guard of Druzzil is the group MR buff.  Adds 75 to MR.<br />
<br />
Yes your rant is valid, justified and true.  I have said for over a month now, Shaman need SOMETHING.  Heck, to not &quot;intrude&quot; on areas where Shaman USED to sit comfortably (2nd tier heals, 2-3 tier DOTS), give Shaman:<br />
<br />
1) Double attack (NOT DW)<br />
2) Upgrades to Disease and Poison dots (About 1/2 way between where they are NOW and Necros)<br />
3) An upgrade to spot heal<br />
4) An upgrade to HoT<br />
5) A pet that doesn't have to /kneel before that gimped Enchanter animation. (Or make it so the pet can stun)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is this utility that some people ascribes to shamans?  My shaman has never been invited to a group because of his &quot;utility&quot;.  If I'm trying to form a group I have never looked at &quot;utility&quot; in my evaluation of who I should invite.<br />
<br />
When I start groups I evalute characters based the the amount of DPS I think they can dish out, based on their class.  I also look at the amount of healing they off the group, and I look at any other skills that the character may offer the group to avoid damage, like evacs, mez, harmonize or lull, or avoiding wasted downtime, such as rezes, or manna/hp regen like SD adn PoT9.<br />
<br />
Shamans do not offer strong DPS in comparison to most other classes.<br />
<br />
Shamans have in the past offered adaquate healing.  Not realy good healing, but adaquate.  This seems to be fading.<br />
<br />
Shamans strong skill has been damage mitigation through slows.  It is a handy skill.  But that too is fading in light of short fights and slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
So realy shamans offer 2 things slows, and heals.  Both of which are becoming less meaningful.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen ranger DPS is stronger than ever.  <br />
<br />
Is there some other great &quot;utility&quot; that shamans offer that rangers do not?  Both classes can root park.  Rangers have snare, shamans do not.  Rangers can invis, lev, and sow.  Rangers offer buffs similar to shamans.  Rangers can track, shamans can not.  Rangers can harmonize, shaman can not.  I want the people that talk about shaman's utility to explain what exactly we offer groups that most other classes do not.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 main abilities in this game, the ability to make mobs dead, and the ability to keep your party alive.  Shaman are not goot at making mobs dead, realative to most other classes, and our once important abilities to keep our party alive is waning in comparison to other classes.<br />

Bah Adonnisninaste, i've played rangers quite a bit, and I've never found it &quot;hell&quot;.  As long as a ranger is smart enough to control their own agro they certainly are not close to &quot;hell&quot;.  If rangers dps was suddenly commonly &quot;mitigated&quot;, and then they were told that they did not deserve any upgrades because they can solo in HoH, I might understand the use of &quot;hell&quot; to describe rangers.  <br />
<br />
The complants are certainly not about shamans no longer being &quot;the top of the food chain&quot;.  The complaints are over the fact that we are becoming unable to do the 2 things that shaman are suposed to eb able to do.  Slow is being nerfed into only useful situationaly, and our heals are becoming meaningless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't bring Rangers into a Shaman argument.

<br />
Agreed.  Rangers have a class defining ability that is literally broken.  Not out of balance like we claim to be, but actually non-functional.  Rangers have been asking for a fix to address line of sight and clipping issues since the implementation of trueshot to no avail.  So if you want an example of how well whining on class boards affects development decisions, ask a Ranger about archery.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Get real this is an open discussion forum. We will discuss our class' strengths and weaknesses here. Right now we are in a period of decline and so you will see posts about our waning power. But I guess since you don't want to see it anymore we should just shut up and deal. After all that is how druid's got fixed isnt it? Didn't they just sit back and do nothing?  <br />
<br />
I'm always amused by responses that envoke the openess of a discussion forum while denying anothers right to make a statement.  It is just as much my forum as yours, and I'm not the only one getting tired of hearing about how we suck.  So I'm going to whine about whining.  As the old message board mantra goes, If you don't like it, don't read it. <br />
<br />
On a side note, people keep envoking the Druid example, but they're the exception, not the rule.  Monks, Druids, Warriors, Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights, Mages and Shamans have all complained about how they're not getting a big enough piece of the pie.  But only Druids really got thrown a bone.  The rest more or less got squat.  A couple of classes were actually nerfed in the midst of their complaints, like the Nameless was playing some cruel joke on them.  Some, like Paladins, probably didn't have any business complaining anyway.  <br />
<br />
Druids showed the EQ community the definition of whine.  They whined about their lack of power anyplace and everyplace they could.  If you looked up whine in the dictionary there was a picture of a pudgy little hobbit with gebs and a wee scimitar taped next to the entry.  Mostly, however, I think Druids caught a break and somebody was actually thinking about changing their ability set at the same time that they were gnashing their teeth all across the digital landscape and considered what they had to say.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and thanks for referencing my petition idea while blowing off the other two ideas.  Nice straw man there.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tormac, you are completely full of ****.  What is this DPS you speak of from Rangers...the ones that take 43 AAs?!?!  Let me guess, you're the one groupleader in EQ that sees a Monk, BL, Rogue, and Ranger LFG and you pick the Ranger first?!?!  Yeah, whatever...maybe after they struggle to make LVL60 and somehow manage 43 AAs.<br />
<br />
As far as our healing, it's a dead horse.  We aren't as good as Clerics, Droods, or Paladins (Never saw that coming).  SOE may or may not change that, but with 20 pages of spells, I think I can find something to waste mana on :P  I would rather see them fix the slow mitigation and make us &quot;slowers&quot; again, screw the heals.  <br />
