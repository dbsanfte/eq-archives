<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Damn, damn, damn. A many times as I've done this, as many times as I've upgraded systems, no matter how much pre-planning and prep work I do, there always seems to be a hangup.<br />
<br />
Basically the problem is that I've gone from a VIA Chipset Motherboad with Athalon TBird 850 to a K7S5A Mainboard with Athalon XP 1800+. Unfortunately it seems as though of couse the harddisk controller chipset has changed. Because of that, I'm getting the Inaccessible Boot Device error.<br />
<br />
For those who will recommend I FFR (Fdisk format reinstall do da, do da), I'd rather not because it would take me about a month to get my system back up to speck with my full suite of Adobe software, Visual Studio 6 Enterprise, and Visual Studio .NET, let alone friggin EQ and other apps.<br />
<br />
Before shutting down for the last time I did what Microsoft recommends which is to remove all devices from devicemanager and shutdown (again this was before moving to new MD). That hasn't seemed to help. I've also tried booting to a recovery console and disabling the via chipset controllers and such, but that has not helped.<br />
<br />
So the question is... has anyone ever used Sysprep? I know at Intel our IT department has one IT image for all machines and runs sysprep on first boot after image is loaded. Anyways if anyone has ever used it and is knowledgable please let me know. I can put my old HDD back in my old system and a video card and run sysprep if I have to, I just don't know how to use it and the documentation sucks. I don't want to cause more harm than good. Like wise, does anyone have any other suggestions other than either A. running a reinstal or B. running a system repair (which I'd still have to reinstall a whole buch of stuff because DLL's would get overwitten).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it seems like it's fixing itself now. Ran a basic system recovery and it's redetecting all my devices right now. TTYL guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm glad your back up and running sori.  Just so you know sysprep is not a repair tool that I know of.  I've used it a lot in the past when building images for 2000 and 4.0 and as far as i know its main function is to remove specific itentifing informaiton from the computer (such as the SID) in preperation for a third party imaging software of some kind.  Now of course most imaging software applies a sid for you so you don't have to sysprep.</div></div><hr />
