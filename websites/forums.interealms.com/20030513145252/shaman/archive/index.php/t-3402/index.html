<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been around the boards for a while, but have yet to check out a good post on the turtle.  Looking for a detailed post on either how to solo the old boy, or how to partner him.  Toss me some good ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heres how Howjan(oracle on test solo'd him)<br />
<br />
Pulled w/ malo<br />
Rooted<br />
Stuck on Malosi<br />
Stuck on a Slow<br />
<br />
Epic dotted<br />
<br />
Torpor'd and canni'd the whole time while only using the epic as a dot(some people may use JBB, he jus constantly cannid).<br />
<br />
basicly he just kept epic dotting and everyting, and 35 minutes(approx) later lodi died.<br />
<br />
It would go faster w/ JBB if thats your personal style</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for that post Xertt, I couldn't imagine cani dancing for 35 minutes to kill the turtle.  Pretty incredible.<br />
<br />
Anybody know of a way to take out Lodizal in less than 35 minutes?  Kind of thinking that I'd be KS'd before then.  More ideas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">depends on gear really...if ya got some kinda FT items or horse it would allow you to slide in a couple banes or poxes.  <br />
<br />
i was able to get him to about 40 percent or so...but een that took me a good 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
mind you i was very lucky since i lack malo....a proc right away from the journeymans walking stick(tash) allowed me to land slow.<br />
<br />
if yer under pressure by people showing up to KS you....you make mistakes....like i did...going hardcore on poison and gulp...forgetting about my own health LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He wasnt Cannidancing<br />
<br />
He was just sitting there and bieng hit while making surehe had enough mana to keep torpored at all times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone else solo'd stomples or something in POM, and hes pretty similar to Lodi.<br />
<br />
I believe what that guy did was just JBB blast(along w/ epic), and cut the time in half.  As far as i remember, he only cast canni4 6 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What about equip? Does that matter a lot? like what do your ac and hp need to be at least?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">over 1k ac should be fine.<br />
<br />
hp's?  a little over 2k buffed would be fine IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen many instances where Lodi is soloed using DS potions Epic DoT, pet and Torpor. Canni constantly and keep Lodi Malo'ed and slowed. JBB would speed up the process but it can be done without a JBB. <br />
But good luck in trying to solo him as Lodi is perma-camped so you're more likely to be KS'ed than get a legit chance to solo him. People have no respect for other peoples pulls when it comes to taking down high end mobs.</div></div><hr />
