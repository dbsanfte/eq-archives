<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read several posts saying the LDoN raids are very difficult but I haven't heard from anyone saying they completed an entire raid.  Is the AP awarded appropriate to the degree of difficulty? How many AP were awarded per raid member? <br />
