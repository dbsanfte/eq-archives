Quarm dead, Zeb freed.... or so we thought?<br />
Posted by Vigilyn on July 16, 2003 at 18:08 EST <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:38:15 2003] Zebuxoruk staggers about and looks at you drowsy, from his weakened state. 'My thanks to you. I am surprised to see you have made it here. We must get back to Norrath. The time has come for me to share my knowledge. Something is coming, a threat to us all, and the sands in the hourglass are thinning. Make haste and take me back the way you came.' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:38:47 2003] Zebuxoruk says, 'I am surprised at the gods for taking such drastic measures, though I suppose all of the creations of the Nameless are capable of displaying poor judgment and irrational behavior. These gods are burdened with powers and responsibilities beyond our comprehension, yet at times even they do not understand the eventual effect of their actions. I am compelled to share the knowledge of the gods with the populace of Norrath, so that I might save their creations. They do not realize that if mortality ceases to exist... if they are not worshipped and held aloft by the beliefs of those that they now have grown to fear... they will fall from power and a new age of darkness will wash over existence as they know it. I did not seek to interfere with them or their realms, only to free them from a fate that awaits all of us. It is this fate that now stands ready, greedily gathered on the edge of the void, ready to test the will of all mortals.' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:03 2003] Zebuxoruk says, 'If they have taken measures these extreme I must rethink what I have done, and what I will do. If there was this much cause for conc...' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:03 2003] Suddenly in a bright flash a feminine figure appears before you. Your ears ring from the loud burst as she slowly materializes. <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:12 2003] Druzzil Ro speaks with no movement of her mouth. Her thoughts flow through you, calming you as you begin to comprehend what she is trying to communicate to you. <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:12 2003] Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'Zebuxoruk, my student I cannot allow this to happen. If you were to escape from another prison the will and power of the gods will have been compromised.' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:17 2003] Zebuxoruk says, 'Druzzil, I have missed you. Wasn't it you that taught me in your own realm to seek knowledge and share it in all forms?' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:24 2003] Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'That I did, but I also taught you not to share your wealth of knowledge if it would affect the fate of others. I cannot allow this to happen. I must set things back to how they were before you and these mortals arrived here, I believe that you cannot understand this and I am sorry.' <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:29 2003] Druzzil Ro looks upon Zebuxoruk one last time, as a wave of sadness comes across her gentle face. <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:36 2003] Druzzil Ro begins to chant an incantation; mana flows out from her body in all directions. Things begin moving slowly in reverse. You become dizzy from the experience and fall to your knees. As you look up the last thing you can see is Druzzil Ro smiling in your direction. She then waves her arms gracefully and points at you. <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:41 2003] There is a brilliant flash and you find yourself displaced through time and space. For a moment you lose touch with yourself. As you wake, you find yourself back in the Plane of Knowledge, moments after talking to Maelin with the information of retrieving the Quintessence of Elements. Druzzil has preserved the timeline, and restored existence back to its normalcy. <br />
<br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:39:43 2003] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br />
[Wed Jul 16 23:40:10 2003] You have entered Plane of Knowledge. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just want to make sure I got this right, the ending is basically Druzzil Ro saying &quot;nope cant let that happen&quot; and then reversing time so that it never happened at all?<br />
<br />
BoOOOoooOOoooRinnNNnnGG.<br />
<br />
Can you say anticlimactic?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;yeah, suuuuuure, you spent months and months beating the crap of yourselves in the Elemental planes, then you wake up and it was all a dream...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe they got tunare's Gnomish Tickler out of the deal, though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How can a demi god like Druzzil Ro put Zeb away, yet the 4 elemental gods cannot!?!?! thats really lame, was hoping Zeb would turn you guys into gods :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll definitely have to compare this &quot;ending&quot; with the next game I play for 4 or so years.<br />
<br />
Next run through they might hire the never-ending monotony of Robert Jordan to lay a solid storyline down for them, but this is a pretty fair end to EQ considering the road travelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">wouldn't it be cool if you kill Quarm, get ported, and they erase ALL your flags so you have to start again ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/idiot on<br />
<br />
Yea that would be almost as great as Quarm when he delevels you every 48 seconds <br />
<br />
/idiot off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was Patrick Duffy involved in the script by chance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, the script sounds exaclyt like they erased all past-elemental flags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fires of Heaven really said it best.<br />
<br />
I could probably make a better ending. <br />
In 5 minutes.<br />
Writing with my ass.<br />
Without a pen.<br />
Without paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i agree, this is a pretty lame ending, i have already 4 rush through my head as im typign this. Seriously disapointing and i feel bad for the guilds that have been busting ASS to get to PoT and experience this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I joined eq after pop came out, what was the ending before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Galnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">man... that ending sure is a kick in the crotch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GotSandDunes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ROFL - SoE knows ancient Jedi mind trick - &quot;these are not the droids you are looking for&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, the original game didn't really have an ending of any sort.<br />
<br />
Kunark... hmm.  Veeshan's Peak?  No real storyline there.<br />
<br />
Velious was the first one with an &quot;Ending,&quot; releasing the sleeper.  Which MIGHT have been interesting if it'd worked at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I only wonder where EQ can go in terms of story from here .. how much more powerful can bosses become if they aren't gods, and what is there now to placate the players that have spent 5 years at the end game level.  <br />
<br />
LDoN not being rumored to have high end content, but I won't take too much stock in that as the rumors pre PoP was &quot;Oh, everything in PoP is going to be low guild number raids and stuff, it will be cool, your 30 man force and go wherever they want&quot; which seems quite interesting considering Rathe Council player requirements.<br />
<br />
So who knows .. This will be a very interesting 3 months coming up for EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the ending suits the game....SoE could not really allow TR to experience any sort of finality, and it makes sense in a MMORPG<br />
It wasnt a dream, what they accomplished did occur for them, but the gods could not allow it to happen. This really is the only story that can exist, as by having what TR did reversed, it allows guild_02 to accomplish it as well and still make sense.<br />
I dont know, I am just rambling, but I think its all you can really expect.<br />
<br />
Moxx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">much as I hate to say something negative....that ending sure was lame.  let's hope thats not the TRUE ending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wish the ending was Zebuxoruk offer you a chance to turn you into god mode for a fixed time(week or month); then you can go duel other god for fun/loot or whatever. then you are gameover after god mode gone or return to game as lvl1 naked if still want play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seriously folks, for a constantly broken, bugged, disorganized, unfinished, unplanned game that has an EverChanging snack mix of developers, programmers, etc you expect too much.  If you are looking for a better ending read a book or get one of those tidy 80 hour games. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">they could've at least run a spellcheck, the name in the text and the name on the pic are spelled differently for Zeb...<br />

{Wed Jul 16 23:39:03 2003] Zebuxoruk says, 'If they have taken measures these extreme I must rethink what I have done, and what I will do. If there was this much cause for conc...' <br />
<br />
read that, twice.... see the oopsie?<br />
I suck at spelling and grammer but I don't sell it to over 400k people</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">**** that is the stupidest piece of **** I have ever read.<br />
<br />
You defeat the combined might of the four most powerful beings in the universe to release the one being they fear... and a DEMIGOD just pops in and says &quot;hmm...no.&quot; and poof time reverses.<br />
<br />
OK, sure it allows the story to be done by another group.. even to be done by the same group once again.  But as a story it just sucks.  PoP was billed as a storyline expansion... all of it was one big story. And the ending is a big reset switch?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I remember playing old D &amp; D, and AD &amp; D (back in the day), and whenever something happened that made little to no sense (Orc casting fireballs, the NPC's knew what we were going to do minutes after we told the DM, people miraculously appearing back in the party), we would look at the DM with a 'huh?' expression on our faces...<br />
