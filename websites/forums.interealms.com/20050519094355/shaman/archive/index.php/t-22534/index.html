<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the things that has been discussed has been an ability for shaman buffs to go over the stat cap.  Looks like they listened...but were concerned that giving that ability to an obsolete class would limit it's impact on the game.  So they made it a tribute effect instead.  :D<br />
<br />
Ok no flames!  Anyways, there are some interesting tribute effects on test...I wonder if you will be able to have more than 3 running at once.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From the necromancer forum:<br />
<br />
Theres new tribute choices on Test server. <br />
<br />
As always this may/may not change and may/may not go live. <br />
<br />
Arm of Power <br />
Level 50 <br />
Tier 1 cost: 40 (yes, these are all pricey) <br />
<br />
Tier 1 increases your max STR cap by 2. <br />
Tier 2 increases your max STR cap by 4. <br />
etc..etc..etc.. <br />
<br />
Theres one of these for each stat. <br />
<br />
Fortune of the Staff <br />
Level 50 <br />
Tier 1 cost: 30 <br />
Each tier increases your chance to crit with blunt weapons. <br />
<br />
Theres one of these for each type of weapon. (Slash, blunt, peirce, h2h) <br />
<br />
There is one for archery, but it doesnt increase crit chances, but it increases accuracy. <br />
<br />
Theres also one that increases general melee crit chances, any weapon type. <br />
<br />
Fortune of Suffering <br />
Level 50 <br />
Tier 1 cost: 50 <br />
Each Tier increases your chance to crit each tick with DOTs. <br />
<br />
Theres also one that increases Nuke crit chances and one that increase heal crit chances. <br />
<br />
Second Chance <br />
Level 40 <br />
Tier 1: 60 <br />
Each tier increases your chance to ressurect upon death. <br />
<br />
Interesting. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Res upon death?  I like the concept... but I wonder what percent it is and how it works.  Would be funny to instantly res back in front of the mob that killed you and suffer another death.  Max stat increase at that price?  That's worthless if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update, interesting stuff, surprised they don't just shove it in the omens of war expansion, very cool indeed.  Then again, since I didn't get to make use of the whole forged pick thing before they caught on, I don't have a lot of Tribute banked :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice one SOE.  Every patch items have their tribute value REDUCED and Im not talking about forged picks.  Regular LDoN drops (about the only source of tribute most people use) have slowly been decreasing as well.  With these changes its not going to be inpossible to have over 300 points of tribute per 10 minutes slipping away.  I blow through 153 tribute every 10 minutes.  Just running an LDoN burns though over 1K tribute points, and drops are so rare for me that maintain a positive tribute account is hard.<br />
<br />
Bleh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tier 1 cost: 40 (yes, these are all pricey) <br />
<br />
Tier 1 increases your max STR cap by 2.<br />
<br />
LMMFAO.<br />
<br />
Considering that Giac (iinm) ran a test a year or so ago where a 67 point strength buff generated an additional 7% damage,....<br />
<br />
You have GOT to be kidding me.</div></div><hr />
