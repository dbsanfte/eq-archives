<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">two warriors, a druid, cleric, enchanter and i tried him befor patch.<br />
we got him to 84-85% befor we evac'd and died, due to his mana/life burn dot.<br />
is there any suggestions on how to kill him. we don't have amazing equip.<br />
any strats we should do ?<br />
he hits like a little girl, but his AoE is grotesque, any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its all about the bards.  I'm in a small guild and we usually take him with somewhere around 20 folks. May well be overkill, but everyone wants the loot :D<br />
Pair of tanks, 2 clerics and the required bard.  I haven't been hit with one of his ae's yet with bard song playing, but with just tribunal for disease resists its about 50/50.<br />
Even with bard song playing, I always wind up malos/slow and spamming heals on folks taking ae.  Even with talisman of tribunal and bard song, enough people get hit when they have low unbuffed disease resist.  Also have remove greater curse up if possible, regular remove curse if not.  Remove curse takes something like 5 casts, I dont know about how many casts of GRC will do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its a tough fight with less than 2 groups.  A bard helps a ton, as the AE's will wear you down if you have low dps.  We have tried with a single group with no bard before and taken a beating.  With 2-3 groups he is gimp.  If you have enough dps to put him down quick, the AE's won't matter much.<br />
<br />
RGC takes the AE's off in one cast, but of course if you have the mana tap/cast-time curse on you, the cast time for it sucks.  I try to keep the clerics and myself AE free.  If you work hard at holding Koro in the right spot, the casters can hide from the mana tap downstairs, but range can be a problem if he moves around.</div></div><hr />
