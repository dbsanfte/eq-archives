<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am sitting in the stables area with a few strangers, hoping for a spectral courier who actually HAD a student's log, (had killed two that didn't)....when a guild killing reavers hollered that Ghiosk was down....low and behold, I was the only shammie in the zone...I scampered over to the bridge and looted the three books and hurried back to my group, the very next pull was a spectral courier...as he died I hear a loud Ding!  Welcome to level 46...and I picked up my Student's Log...a very exciting five minutes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now thats a lucky troll, dont you just love days like that.<br />
<br />
Grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Big gratz, great night for you.. When we did my Epic fight, and had to kill Ghiosk, I sent a tell to the only other Shaman in the zone, to come pick up the books. It was done for me when I was at this step and I make sure my Guild looks for a Shaman who needs the books when we are killing Black Reavers..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where exactly does the Spectral Courier spawn?  I've cleared the western portion of the stables many times in the last 3 days, and never found him!  Does he spawn in the middle of the western stables, or in one of the 3 rooms off that side of the stables?<br />
<br />
Specific details would be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
The frustrated shaman!  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, cool! We were doing Rak for me the other day, and were ae pulling while waiting on a copule more people. Got 2 shaman's their entire set of pages, courier spawned twice. We also got one of them their books. 2 very happy shaman :)<br />
<br />
Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Spectral Courier spawns  in 2 spots.  <br />
<br />
1) Looking West into the West Stable:  He will spawn in the single room on the left side that has 4 spawns inside it.  He will be the last one (at the back of the room).<br />
<br />
2) Looking East into the East Stable:  He will spawn on your left side, in the room that has 2 spawns.  I think he is the back spawn in that room as well.<br />

Camping the Spectral Courier was the TRUE Test of Patience. :)</div></div><hr />
