<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished my Epic 1.0 on Vazaelle over the weekend, was a lot of fun and good raiding experience to get it done. I'm in a guild that's fairly new to raiding (I lucked out on my tear, had someone /ooc in pok that the child was up after a fear raid, so I got my butt there and killed him).<br />
<br />
Took 3 tries to kill Neh'ashiir ROFL, First try with guild we got to the skyway but couldn't get to her because of no lockpicker, we tried the run across with lev thing, but had no luck. 2nd try I went with a friend and 3 others from his guild, we actaully got to Neh'ashiir this time because my friend was on his rogue, did my turnin of the ring from Kirn, and wiped :P. Fortunatly Neh stayed up and my guild went again with a full 2 group raid and whooped her good. Also got the mage torch for someone that came along so all was good.<br />
<br />
Did Rak'Ashiir on Sat, the first time he popped as the Fabled one, at that time I didn't know he could be used for the tear turnin, so we killed the fabled and got a nice bp for a guild cleric, after reading that the Fabled Rak could indeed be used for the epic, we went back 2 hours later and successfully killed him and the Spear of Fate was mine.<br />
<br />
Last night I went on a fear raid for another shaman in my guild, who honestly was kinda jelious my tear luck and I had promised her that we would get hers soon, we cleared most of fear with help from some friends (we had never done fear as a guild before), killed Dread, Fright, Dracoliche and most of the trash in the zone. Wanted to give CT a try, but no one could stay long enough to clear the rest of the trash and try him, a shame hehe. Also got 2 balls of everliving golem for the warrior epic, good times.</div></div><hr />
