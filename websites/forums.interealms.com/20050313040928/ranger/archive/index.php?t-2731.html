<br />
I was wondering has anyone made this kit yet? and if so what is the advantage of it ( like does it have a fletching bonus on it ) <br />
<br />
if so let me know the scoop please<br />
<br />
Also i think i need to bring up my smithing skill to make this kit. Is this true ? or can anyone with the right ingredients make it ?<br />
<br />
Any info will help greatly thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do I get 2 points taking off my skill level for fletching?  Might as well work another skill up since humans are screwed in end run fletching now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pjkea Jungleheart</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err sorry i dont understand..you can only make the new mithril stuff in it? <br />
<br />
and do u have to only be a wood elf or can anyone make it ...dont understand why this guy would need to create a new ranger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I worship Tunare, but I am human.  <br />
<br />
As I understand it, only Tunare worshipping Fier'Dal, wood elves, can make or use the kit.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, even if I get a kit from one of the ranger come lately wood elves, (humans were the first rangers, and the only rangers in the Lord of the Rings universe, which Verant based a lot of the old world game on) I can't use the kit for anything more than a bag.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the new fletching kit is fier`dal only, which means it is only usable by wood elves.<br />
<br />
This new kit can not be used to make any of the regular fletching items that have been in the game up till now.. you have to use a regular fletching kit to make those items.<br />
<br />
However, the patch added many new fletching items that use mithril components.  Mithril is a historical component that elves have used for ages.  It is considered a cultural or ancestral skill for elves to make mithril items, or items with mithril components.  So all of these new items are intended to be made by elves only, so the elves have to use this new kit.  This is the same as smithing and tailoring have forges and kits with race restrictions for making the specific items based on the cultural or ancestral skills.<br />
<br />
Now, for most of these new culturally created items, they still allow a wide variety of classes to used them, but they usually have a restriction based on your race or the diety you worship.  For example... these new bow and arrows can only be MADE by elves because of the mithril ancestral restriction, but they are USABLE by any warrior, ranger, rogue that worships Tunare.  Which means that half elves and humans can use the items as long as they worship Tunare, but they can not make the items themselves.</div></div><hr />

You only need to be a worshiper of Tunare to use the items made.</div></div><hr />

Actually the Dunedan have elven blood as well as human. The Tolkeinian ranger is probably more closely described in eq terms by the half-elf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, that's weird.  Cause I tried making my kit at 133 skill.  Got a fail and skill up.  Tried again, succeeded and skill up.  Now I'm 135 Smithing and own a fletching kit that requires components too expensive to use until I'm 59 with 27 AA points...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Aragorn didn't shave for like 3 days, and he learned all those skills from the sheer manly power of his Miami Vice stubble face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-- Fletching - in Fier'dal sewing kit -- <br />
<br />
Are we suppose to use a Sewing Kit or is there an actual Fletching Kit?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

To make arrows or bows you need the fletching kit. It is a cultural kit so only wood elves can make them and or use them. And as a side note the new fletching kit will NOT make standard bows or arrows at this time.From Eqtrades board...<br />

What was confusing me was in the &quot;Flecthing&quot; header where she wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Fletching - in Fier'dal sewing kit <br />
arrows will change to yield 10, and have race/class fixed, next patch&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess I'll send her an e-mail pointing this out.<br />
