<br />
Is Anyone else really bothered with this new patch? besides that you get a level 55 cleric trying to keep you healed in pov/pos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its a great patch.<br />
<br />
This of course assumes it is implemented as intended.<br />

I realise I am also probably taking a leaf of faith into a very deep canyon, without levitation on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For real...not really a nerf.  More of a correction, since it wasn't working the way it was originally intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Horrible change on the KEI, everthing else is great.</div></div><hr />

Or tell me that is correct.</div></div><hr />

An added bonus is you'll probably see less buff beggars hanging around in the bazaar/PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this will surely slow down the caster twinks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Less people bugging for kei and focus, but probably triple the total number of buff requests, with people asking for hos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do really love this, if this means that now my buffs will no longer ever be able to affect someone that is lower than 46.

also, now there will be less people casting kei and Virtue for the rest of us which sucks...  as I am addicted to the Kei...<br />
<br />
although i could just pl a chanter to like lvl 46 in a few days with my friends 65druid and then leave him in our groups of 6 because he really won't be leeching exp up until he's 60 and make my own 60 buff bot ;D...</div></div><hr />

I don't buff newbies, period.  I'll buff a friend's twink that they're going out to PL because... it's a friend and I know they already know how to play in general.  If a newbie needs shaman buffs or enc buffs in order to play, then they should be seeking out a similar level character of that class to group with.  That's the way the game was designed to be played and it does work, quite well in fact.<br />
<br />
Buff vendors in general skew game balance.  I suspect this is why EQ2 is supposedly changing the way buffs work to where buffs don't have a set duration, but instead are maintained by the buffer nonstop.  i.e. You want my buffs, you need me in your group. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Instead of digging up buried spells, you could take the stance I plan on using:<br />
<br />
Sorry, my buffs don't affect you.  Try finding a shaman near your level to group with, and they should be happy to buff you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thank god for the KEI nerf</div></div><hr />

  Only complaint i have is my wife finally playing a char of her own for real and since its a wizard  i was sorta hoping for another week or three for her lol. But on the serious side she is set to level on her own without c3. Her first words to me was well you did it without c3 and so have our friends. I can do it too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As I've said before, KEI is overpowered for lowbies.  BUT ... plain Clarity is underpowered.  Plain Clarity was designed for old world gear and old world mobs.  Now mobs are tougher, take more mana to kill, and people have larger mana pools.  7/tick is not sufficient.<br />

By the same token, spending all those aa points on a skill you're only going to use to buff lower level characters is a bit on the pointless side.<br />

But if thats what you were looking to do, then you can still MGB Spirit of Bih'li! :)</div></div><hr />

Well, I thought it might be, you know, fun or something.  I was looking forward to it.  MGBing Spirit of Bih'li doesn't quite have the same appeal.<br />

Probably because lots of people had Focus long before HoS ever came out.  Not much point in acquiring a downgrade.</div></div><hr />

I have a friend who is so insistent I have a full spellbook that he is bugging me to go back and get Canni II even though I have III and IV.  Some people just *really* like to have all their spells (not me though:))</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I DO use Chloro/Canni very effectively. Timing it between ticks is hardly difficult. It still can't touch C3. Canni2 probably can, but by then I'll be able to get C3 again, so it's irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I guess at the end of the day it's up to the enchanters. If they're happy with this change and it's their spell, so be it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My biggest problem with KEI prior to this patch was walking through the nexus late and night and listening to people ask for KEI.  If there was no chanter there, I would usually see 5-10 requests for kei in the time it took me to walk from bazaar to the pok book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any kei?&quot;<br />
&quot;need kei&quot;<br />
&quot;kei?&quot;<br />
&quot;where is kei?&quot;<br />
&quot;is there kei in pok?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was just disgusting how addicted and needy people are of it.  I always got it for my beastlord when I was PLing him, but jesus I could do without.<br />
<br />
On one hand, all of the retards that cannot function without KEI might actually have to learn mana-management.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I will never make a caster alt ever again.  After years of playing a shaman, I just cannot sit and med.  I can't do it.  It makes playing a caster alt unenjoyable, and thus I'll never play one again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">First, it still hasn't cut down the number of beggars in PoK.  Even after hearing a spirited discussion about the intricacies of this patch, some assclown /shouts that they're paying for HoV, C3, and any high level shaman buff.  /who assclown:  [27 Enchanter] Assclown (Erudite).  I can honestly remember only 3 days of my Shaman career when I specifically went looking for C3:  the 3 days it took me to get from 37 to 40, and that's only 'cause I was in a rush.  Before and after that, I've never sought it, because it is a crutch.  If I can't function without C3, something is seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
Second, not only has it not cut down the number of beggars, it's increased the number of people selling buffs:  I'm not kidding when I tell you that I heard people selling EXTENDED CLARITY.  &quot;KEI nerft got you down?  Come see me by the Nexus stone for an EXTENDED CLARITY, which lasts 30 minutes!  Donations accepted, but not required!&quot;  It's insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As someone who plays (occasionally) a lowbie chanter (lvl 35 atm) I applaud this change.  Before, there were always ppl rushing off to get KEI from nexus or pok rather than accept my meager clarity.  I could pretty much bet that any caster I would encounter would NOT need clarity from me.  Thus a large bargaining chip was removed. <br />
Needless to say, I abused the hell outta KEI and pot9, getting both and then charm soloing a level or two before they wore off.  ***, if u can't beat em, join em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yeah, PoK was out of control when I logged this afternoon. More shouts and ooc's about clarity than I've ever heard.<br />
<br />
Now we have people complaining that no one is casting C3, as well as people clamoring for lesser buffs.<br />
<br />
It'll calm down.<br />
<br />
But I'd be lying if I didn't say this afternoon's hunting without C3 was a LOT more boring. Right or wrong, it's less fun without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Just for laugh's after last night's patch, I log my friends 65 chanter and start casting kei.  First group, held on 1.  Second group 2.  Third group none.  Lowest it stuck on the person said they were 45.  Even after I told zone you had to be 45+, had level 18's wanting it cast to see if it would stick to them.  Then came the yells for clarity, hehe.  Then people who wante haste no more Voice of Quellous.  Actually had to load alacrity to buff someone.  There were some very sad people in the nexus last night.  Kept hearing over and over, &quot;this sucks&quot;, &quot;worst patch ever&quot;, and remarks along those lines.  I thought it was kinda sad, and funny.  I agree with the general concensus, now instead of unlimited mana, noobs are gonna have to learn mana management.  I have a fellow shaman lvl 57 who always has KEI, and is still always out of mana.  Makes you wonder when the general population is gonna have to go into rehab!  ;)</div></div><hr />

I had a copy of FOCUS of spirit sitting in the bank for 8 months before I even hit 60, and I hit 60 about 2 weeks before SoL went live. I have no interest in catering to the needs of buff beggars, so I have never and will never buy a copy of Harness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I think the kei nerf is awesome...  todays players have no clue what it's like to REALLY level a character.  <br />
<br />
What i dont find fair, and really hypocritical, is that they have not nerfed weapons that melee can use for the most part. So melee twinks can still wear armor far above their level and use weapons they were never intended to wield. that should have gotten nerfed as well imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You people have to get over flaming those who like kei. I don't see what the problem is if you like it. Me personally, I get it just about all the time, because I solo like 99% of the time. Soloing without kei is just plain boring, and sucks, having to sit and canni for like 5 minutes after one pull. It just reduces the downtime, what's wrong with that? Sure, for low levels it is a really powerful spell, and I agree with Sony fixing kei, but that don't mean I hate people that use it. Where's all the people complaining about SoW? I mean, don't you think a spell that allows most players to outrun most mobs, and significantly reduces travel time is a HUGE thing to have? Funny how a level one running around pretty fast able to avoid a lot of deaths isn't getting **** on for his desire for SoW. I know it's kind of a rediculous analogy, but you get the gist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">although i could just pl a chanter to like lvl 46 in a few days with my friends 65druid and then leave him in our groups of 6 because he really won't be leeching exp up until he's 60 and make my own 60 buff bot ;D...<br />
<br />
Actually, I believe they changed the way XP is distributed a while back.  From what I understand, if a character is of level to get XP grouped with you at all, then they get an EQUAL share of XP, regardless of their level.  After that, any bonus/penalty is applied due to the con of the mob - i.e. if it's light blue to the high-level he takes a hit, and if it's red to the lower level and he's past 50, he gets a bonus.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what happens if the mob is green to some party members.  It used to be that the lower levels got all the XP in that case, I'm not sure if that is still the case or not.<br />
<br />
The formula for determining the highest level a character can group with for XP is<br />
<br />
   lvl*1.5<br />
<br />
or possibly<br />
<br />
   lvl*1.5+1<br />
<br />
meaning a level 44 could group with a level 65.  I know a 43 can get XP with a 61, and I know a 44 can get XP with a 65, from personal experience, so this seems to bear out the formula above.<br />
<br />
For those of you concerned about having to find lowbie buffs in the backs of your books.... build yourself a lowbie buff lineup and save it using the new spell list save option.  One click, buff 'em, one click back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I was lvl 38 and deep in SolA teachin gnomes a lesson when my last KEI faded.  I finished off my level, then gated, wondering where I'ld get some easy xp for the next lil while, since I wouldn't have KEI on as a safety net.  I puttered around, bought my 39 spells, then headed to DL, flipped up my LFG tag.  As usual, within 2 minutes, I had a group invite.  Headed over to the group.  2x shaman, 3x BL, 1x necro, solo classes all (pre-patch)  You all should try that one, super fun.  Regardless, the bottom line is, with the new grouping xp bonus, there's NO reason anyone should be below lvl 46 for very long, I finished off my level in just a touch over 2 hours.  Even the casual players will like this, people will WANT all those players who used to solo cause they only had an hour to play to just keep their group at a full 6 members, just to get the mad xp.  This patch opens the door to the non-power gamers who want to get to the end game and do some raiding.<br />
<br />
Was KEI nerfed?  Sorta.  Is the game more fun now?  Definitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">soloing with KEI could be &quot;fun&quot; for a while, but certainly wasn't fulfilling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">OK, so I was thinking about kei, and how much it helps in the course of a fight (soloing). I don't know about others, but never try to pull more than one at a time when soloing. Depending on the mob, I'd say now, an encounter will last me about a minute and a half, call it 15 ticks. With kei, regenning 14 a tick, thats 14*15 mana regen for the duration, total 210 mana. Yes, its 210 more than I'd normally regen without, but is that extra mana going to make or break the encounter? Certainly not, it's not even a casting of E-bolt. Where it really comes in to play, is in the med time AFTER an encounter, so really, what's with all the fuss, saying you don't learn mana management, unlimited supply of mana, etc? Again, I say it makes the game more enjoyable, who likes sitting and medding a lot after every pull, and why do you feel that someone sitting and doing nothing is learning mana management?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I have nothing but pity for new characters.  The game blows for them because they have nobody their level to group with.

<br />
It's a great thing, really. New people to the game have it SO FRIGGIN EASY, especially if you know a med to high level player. Even though I started right after SoL came out, even *I* was without the following<br />
<br />
*Newbie Armor Quests<br />
*Newbie zone maps<br />
*Walk / ported to cities<br />
*Tip window<br />
*Started in a place no so close to guild master . . .<br />
*Had to get corpse at level 1 . . .<br />
<br />
I think if you are against the KEI nerf, you should really think twice. Jump on Stormm (sp?) sometime, people level just fine without it there, and a good many of them are veteran players just wanting to start over. This patch DOES NOT effect them WHATSOEVER, and I think that's just groovy  :) <br />

I've lived without KEI, and got my shm to 63 and my pal to 51. Sure, I buy it now, but I certainally didn't until the mid to late 40's. I need the long lasting wis buff for trade skills  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Kei was nice for those of us with one or 2 60th level characters who did not want to go through the sheer boredom of running a character up through the mid levels to catch up to our main. For that, the nerf is a pain. In all, I DO think it is a good thing, because it de-trivializes old content, by making the casters closer in ability to the mobs they should be fighting. There was also a stigma developing about those mid levels players who would not get KEI that they were lazy, and therefore not be good groupmembers. Try walking through say, dreadlands or OT without someone /ooc 39 dr00d with KEI LFG.. having KEI was becomming a requriement to get a group. <br />
<br />
I think that maybe SoE should implement a /level command that you can use to level a character up to say 25th on your account, if you have one character of 60 or higher. The character would (and should) be naked, so you can twink it to your hearts content. (yes this is possible, you can already do it on test, AND you get gear too) DAoC does this and its really kinda neat. The first 25 levels are trivial now anyhow, and pretty much the same regardless of class. Boom, big complaint of KEI nerf dealt with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Buff vendors in general skew game balance. I suspect this is why EQ2 is supposedly changing the way buffs work to where buffs don't have a set duration, but instead are maintained by the buffer nonstop. i.e. You want my buffs, you need me in your group.  <br />
<br />
I guess nobody will be playing buffing classes in EQII then, eh?  I hate refreshing buffs as it is.  I'd hate to have to do them even more often than now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Apikoros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Man, I just sat and read these embittered, sad, truly deplorable list of posts. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Let me list the things mentioned here that made me sad:<br />
<br />
1. I won't buy HoS because of all those beggars. Yah, you all started at level 40 never asked anyone for help<br />
<br />
2. I hate all those buff begars. If people are polite, whats the harm? Demands and rudeness are another story but you are all just bitching about people asking for anything whether they are rude or not. And you always have /ignore, Also, if people asking for stuff is upsetting you TURN OFF /OOC, /SHOUT, /Auc Come on you all so uber you should know that<br />
<br />
3. I love this one.... &quot;Man, they should play like a real Shaman, learn how to use canni, etc&quot; I did not realize members of this board decided what was a REAL shaman and whose a poseur. When did you all become the arbiters of what is real and not. They can Level the way I had to level. You sound like a bunch of 80 year old bitter men in a nursing home bitching about how kids today just aren't up to snuff. Relax.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you don't wanna play the game in a certain way don't play it that way. The game should be call YourQuest not EverQuest. You can play the game anyway you like.<br />
<br />
Another point, is that KEI opened the door for the casual gamer again. I work for a living, I have a wife, a cat and less free time then I'd like. (luckily my wife plays a 61 Bard so I do get some good EQ time). I play when I can, at odd times and odd hours. Grouping isn't always easy. Raiding next to immpossible. KEI made me level faster, more effeciently and made my limited playing time more fun. So, I imagine after reading some of these postings that you are likely college age or younger with a heckuva lot more free time then me. So if you wanna level like the old days be my guest. I am gonna write a letter to SOE saying what I think of the KEI nerf. Yes, NERF. It was better before. Anyway, just my 2cents, flame away. I'll read it when I get a chance because I only get about 2hrs every other night to play, (see how good KEI is in a situation like that?)<br />
<br />
Apikoros 55th Shaman on Drinal who DID level the hard day and is still amazed when people are like you can get to 50 in 2 weeks. Took me 2+ years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">As someone who plays (occasionally) a lowbie chanter (lvl 35 atm) I applaud this change.  Before, there were always ppl rushing off to get KEI from nexus or pok rather than accept my meager clarity.  I could pretty much bet that any caster I would encounter would NOT need clarity from me.<br />
<br />
Eheh how about how peeps had taken to tellin' groups:<br />
<br />
Groupie 1: BrB need to grab a kei<br />
<br />
Groupie 2: hmmm I need one . . .<br />
<br />
Groupie 4: Still got mine :)<br />
<br />
Groupie3: I have a chanter for a main.  Lemme go bring him here you guys, keep killin'. =) (groupie 3   2 boxes the chanty)<br />
<br />
It shocks me absolutly stupid when people leave the group because they had a kei and if poofed, so now its time to get a new one. . oh and save my spot  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
not to mention I'd think that it must be kinda frustratin' not bein' able to cast your buffs on peeps so often.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I know i get frustrated when i cast HoS (for me a looong cast) to discover oh. . .they have a better buff on. . . .  :confused: <br />
<br />
eheheh</div></div><hr />

<br />
I whole-heartedly agree with the general sentiment in Apikoros’ post.  The reason I play EQ is to have fun, which is why I assume everyone else plays it as well.  KEI made game play more fun.  Yes, my Pre level 46 shaman could have bounced up and down casting cannibalize for several minutes after each solo kill to get his manna back.  But KEI cut down on the down time and made the game more fun to play. And since I’m playing EQ to have fun, more fun is definitely a good thing.  <br />
<br />
I understand that there are bad players out there that used KEI as a crutch and that they can be a problem in a group.  But I also know for a fact that there have always been bad players out there that caused problems in groups.  And I’m willing to bet there always will be.  Blaming bad players on KEI is very short sighted, in my opinion.  I used KEI every chance I got when playing my shaman from 15 to 38 solo and I used it in groups after that.  And though I may have K-Mart quality equipment, I’m good at my job.  I can play with our without KEI and I’ve never had a complaint from anyone I’ve grouped with.  KEI has not worked some sort of evil spell over me, making me a bad player.  At 55 I still get KEI before I group because it still makes game play more enjoyable. KEI does not make bad players.  Bad players make bad players.<br />
<br />
All that having been said, I don’t have a problem with the KEI fix.  Its going to suck when my level 16 enchanter has to make all those manna vials for my shaman to skill up on Wu’s armor, but that’s the way the spell was intended to work in the first place.  What I do have a problem with are people who constantly put others down for making use of a spell that increased their enjoyment of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some say &quot;What's the harm?&quot; when people politely ask for buffs. No harm in me poking you either. But if I poke you again, you might get annoyed. And again. And again. Again. Again. AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN. AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.AGAIN.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons people quit the game is the monotonous content....and the monotonous people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Its the peopel who cant survive without KEI, cant go to there group without KEI, where DEPENDENT on KEI.  Those who make agruments saying KEI is okay are right cause they are people who know how to operate without it.  the ones who dont are the ones who no on likes.  its the ones who cant operate normaly that are the problem.<br />
<br />
that being said i am glad to see the change take place.  Hell even as a lvl 65 shaman in guild groups i was at times finding people who just didnt know how to spend mana cause they where brought up on KEI.  thats not good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Well at first i was against this, but thats cause i like to power level alts with it. In the long run this is more healtheir for the game. I was thinking about it and they really did do a ok job of compensating. Yes, no more KEI, but a chanter in the group will still do their job and if you can stack a bard, bling bling, but the addiotn of the bonuses of exp to groups will even it out pretty descently. This will bring grouping values and exploration back together which even though its a lil bit of a pain sometimes, its really more fun.<br />
<br />
So in the end im a thumbs up</div></div><hr />

<br />
You misunderstand. You cast a buff on someone, and you have the ability to determine how long it will last. If it works like in DAOC, you have a certain number of buffs that you can maintain at any given time. They last forever so long as you are alive and in the game (or until you click them off). This will make playing a buffing class a MUCH more enjoyable experience.<br />
<br />
Apikoros:<br />
1. I won't buy HoS because of all those beggars.<br />
<br />
Yup, that's what I said, and I stand by it. Why should I cater to people who offer me nothing, rarely even a &quot;please&quot; (plz doesn't count) or a &quot;thank you&quot;...nevermind cash.<br />
<br />
Yah, you all started at level 40 never asked anyone for help<br />
<br />
The only people I ask for help are friends, guildies, and groupmates. I have *NEVER* asked for someone to buff me who wasn't in one of those three categories, and even then it is pretty rare. I started at level 1, on day 3 of my server's existance.<br />
<br />
2. I hate all those buff begars. If people are polite, whats the harm?<br />
<br />
Because they aren't polite. Really that simple. Even the 1 in 500 who is is washed away in the seething tide of people who DEMAND that you take your time out to fulfill their every whim.<br />
<br />
 Bottom line, if you don't wanna play the game in a certain way don't play it that way. The game should be call YourQuest not EverQuest. You can play the game anyway you like.<br />
<br />
You can play the game any way you like, but since we don't agree with you we are:<br />

Very interesssstttting. I love the new patch. I play a 52 sham and a 44 shaman. The 52 is my guild raid toon. I'll try to get KEI before raids because I've been too lazy to do Cann II quest. I'ts very helpful in raids. I also play a lot of alts and KEI is not in their vocabulary. I mostly solo with my 44 shaman and my alts. My play time is sporadic so grouping is kind of a problem. I've played for 3.5 yrs and my highest level is 52 on one acct. Leveling doesn't concern me much. I try to enjoy the game and all it's aspects. Tradeskills is one area I spent time on. My guild understands this and knows that I'm ready to help anytime I'm needed , if possible. I think I play my toons fairly well because I've researched them all and know their strengths and weakness and their role in groups. I'm not close to being the best shaman, chanter,druid,monk, etc. in our guild but when I play any of them, I have a fair knowledge of what I'm doing.<br />
<br />
A vereran player who likes to PL others and isn't &quot;addicted&quot; bothers me not. A newbie who's been PL'd past my level in 3-4 weeks and can't play without KEI, I WILL not group with. Heck, this game gives me enyoyment. I have enough stress in RL to deal with &quot;fantasy&quot; stress.<br />
<br />
Sony implemented some very good changes last patch that I've been requesting for years. I'm still waiting for the nerf bat, tho.<br />
<br />
Nerfing KEI just puts some balance back in the game, IMHO.<br />

didnt read any of the replies...just in case anyone else didnt say it. its not a nerf its a bug fix, was never meant to be casted on below lev46..just been a very long lasting loop hole for all group spells 51+</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely can see the point - after having torpor/cannibalize so long I find myself wanting to cannibalize with my ranger when I play him. Try a necro though. They're kinda interesting with their pact line. It's like cannibalize without the repetitive casting. Cast the dark pact, and it slowly sucks your life away and gives you mana. With my newbie iksar necro, he just has to sit and the life drain is negated by his regen.</div></div><hr />
