Might be kinda hard to tell since they all have the same name, but a ball park figure would be nice to know. With 3, then 4 and 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all you have to do is take your level 61 pet..unbuffed..no weapons...and have him attack something for one minute..then multiply that by 3, 4, and 5 and you have it.  Of course this wont be 100% accurate, and will change depending on the mob you fight, but its a ball park figure.<br />
<br />
and has been stated...if you had tried search are quite a few threads about this already.</div></div><hr />
