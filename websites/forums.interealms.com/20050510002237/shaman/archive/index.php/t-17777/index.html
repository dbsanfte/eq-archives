<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's now almost a week after I started this donation drive and here's an update:<br />
<br />
Total donations thus far: 32<br />
Donation total: $634.88<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be as many people that can help this time, but I thought it may take a little longer due to people having donated once before. In reality, the large chunk of the total above came from two people, and those two people do the same thing every drive (thanks!)<br />
<br />
Again, we need a total of $1,800 dollars to pay for the server this period. Anything less and I'm going to have to pay month to month or something. So, if you can help in any way, please contribute so that we can keep going!<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who has helped now and in the past, hopefully things will pick up soon :)</div></div><hr />
