<br />
I'm on FV and recently have been using a second account (the only way to get a second char on FV, as each account is allowed only 1 char) to play the Bazaar game After a few weeks i made enough cash selling junk to look into some of the fun Clr Dru Sham, only 1hb available. In the last couple of weeks I have been through;<br />

Nice life tap but you would get more mana and health back sitting on ya horse<br />

The 6 second stun on this is actually useful ! Proc'd 10 times on one FG mushroom !<br />
<br />
I feel a little bad telling you about how much fun i had with these as i just  have noticed the NO DROP tag on most of them. Looks like maybe FV has some advantages after all ! (apart from being able to say aye and verily all the time, its role play don’t you know!)</div></div><hr />
