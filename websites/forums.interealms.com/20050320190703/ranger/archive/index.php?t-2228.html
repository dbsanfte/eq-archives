<br />
Basically they are guns that regognize their owners and will only operate for them.<br />
<br />
I'm really not sure what my overall feelings are on this. <br />
<br />
On one hand, it's a great idea because it keeps people from getting shot by another person with their own weapon. This is particularly good for police officers and kids that seem to find everything in the house. <br />
<br />
On the other hand it's going to make people who never thought of getting a gun before, go out and buy one. Plus there's always the chance of the gun malfunctioning at the wrong time.<br />
<br />
I can't really imagine them implementing this into the military as it would be counter productive. <br />
<br />
I'm really up in the air as to whether this would save more lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, it's really hard to tell, though there are tons of scenarios.<br />
<br />
You manage to disarm a criminal, then grab it to blow his brains out, then he shouts &quot;Sucker! It's a smart gun, now give it back before it detonates!&quot; Of course, it could work in the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main push behind this is actually law enforcement.  I think in 2000, there were 57 officers that were killed with their own weapons when they were taken away from them by criminals.<br />
<br />
However, the biggest sticking point, is that the recognition needs to be pretty much fool-proof.  The last thing an officer needs is to have to go for his sidearm and have it not work.</div></div><hr />

And that happens so often, it should certainly be the best reason not to manufacture these guns.<br />
<br />
I don't care what the NRA says, I think it would be a great way to protect children. It might not have long-reaching effects in detering crime, but if it saves children from accidental shootings by their parent's guns it would be well worthwhile to install.<br />
<br />
I think the NRA would be for it. Having this kind of safety on guns in the home would take away one of the anti-gun lbby's primary examples of the evil of firearms - the pitiful examples of children killed by their parents' guns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am friend to a mother who lost her son when he was exploring and fond his dad's pistol.  He started playing with it and accidently shot himself.  My friend found her son in a pool of blood at the foot of her bed.  She still isn't the same and this happened five years ago.  <br />
<br />
I for one am for a smart gun if they can be built without malfunctions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never thought this was a particularly good idea.  Anything of this sort will likely rely on batteries.  Batteries die.  The last thing I want to have to worry about if (god forbid) I ever need my handgun in an emergency is &quot;when was the last time I changed that darned 9 volt?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you make anything completely safe, you also make it completely useless.<br />
<br />
As for kids, I understand that a child dying for any reason is a horrible tragedy.  But I'm strongly against the &quot;if it saves one child&quot; argument.  That's normally a smokescreen, the sucker punch is right behind.<br />
<br />
To understand where I'm coming from, I had ready access to a number of firearms growing up.  I started shooting with my dad about the time I started kindergarden (I wasn't in control of the weapon, but I was taught to aim and fire).  I started hunting at age 10, with my father's supervision.  By age 13 I believe I could field strip and clean every firearm in the house.  I knew calibers, and which ammunition went with which weapon.  I was hunting on my own by age 13 or 14.  I finally gave up hunting at age 16 or so, and didn't do much shooting until I moved into a much less safer part of the country.<br />
<br />
Now, why do I expose myself to the abuse that I know is about to fall on me by telling you this?  Because in all those years of handling weapons, of knowing how to load, aim, and fire them, all those times hunting, one thing never happened.  I NEVER forgot I was holding something that could kill.  I never even thought about pointing it at another human being, I never once thought of firing a weapon in anger.  The difference is that my dad told me from day one that I could always say I'm sorry, unless I was holding a gun.  Once you are holding a gun, everything is forever.<br />
<br />
For parents who leave loaded weapons lying around the house, there is no punishment too great, IMHO.  That's plain stupid.  But requiring a type of technology that impedes access in a time of need is a bad thing in my book.  If it was optional, sure.  However, if you introduce something like this, I'm willing to be a bunch of money that someone's going to try to make it mandatory.<br />

There was a time when that wasn't so.  My father bought his first handgun at age 16 through the mail.  No FFL needed, no waiting period, no paperwork.  Wonder why he didn't go on a shooting rampage?<br />
<br />
I don't know why it is.  Firearms were a much more available, much more common part of life not even 40 years ago, and there were not nearly the problems there are now.  I don't think banning, restricting, or destroying is the answer.  That might temporarily fix a symptom, but I don't think it does anything about the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is, firearms enhance the destructive potential of people 10X or more, not to mention help to dissociate between the actions you take and the results.  IE, point and click vs ripping someones jugular out.<br />
Guns might not cause the problem, but they amplify it so much.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the one thing that pro gun folks have to realize is that we don't live in the past.  We live in the present.<br />
<br />
Sure there was a time when just about everyone has fired a gun at one point or another, and had been showed how they are safely handled, etc.<br />
<br />
However, that time has passed.  The laws of the land must change to take that into account.<br />
<br />
The reality of today is that the vast majority of people in the US do NOT know how to safely handle a firearm, much less clean it or store it.</div></div><hr />

No, we do not live in the past, but it's not too late to go back.  The solution IS NOT banning, restricting, or eliminating guns.  Do I have an absolute solotion?  No, because I don't think anyone has accurately diagnosed the problem.  But there IS a problem.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I'm heavily in favor of this idea.<br />
<br />
It would punch a huge hole in the Anti-gun proponents arguments as it would nearly eliminate the accidental deaths caused by children and it would make the theft of guns from homes useless as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not up to speed on the technology issues regarding this but some problems I see with a few of the proposed systems are...<br />
<br />
Finger print identification... Injuries to the hands such as cuts and scrapes will interfere with the recognition technology.  For cops or citizens in need of self defense this could cause problems with reliability.  Couple that with the fact that fingerprint scanners are at best primitive and have high energy requirements this makes this idea unfeasable for the time being.<br />
<br />
Grip recognition indentification... The problem with this is as a person becomes more comfortable in firing a fire arm their grip will change.  Change in the grip means gun won't fire.  Also grips in target practice tend to be much more relaxed while in live fire situations will be tensed.  Grip recognition technology I think is a bad idea as well due to the uncertainty of identification.<br />
<br />
Furthermore both the above technologies might have limitations in multiple users using the same gun.  Guns in police departments and militaries are sometimes &quot;community&quot; weapons used by several officers on different shifts.  And in families spouses often share the same weapons for target practicing and possibly self defense.  This could be alleviated I suppose but having chips issued with the guns that remember how a particular user holds the gun or remembers their fingerprint.<br />
<br />
The system I think which will see the most favor and has the least complexity is ring identification.  Have rings which contain a chip that identify whether this is a valid user of the gun.  If the ring is within a 6 inch radial field of the grip of the gun the gun is activatable.  Yes this opens the door to possible theft of rings but if the rings are unobtrusive and fashionable (say the size of and look of a wedding band) I would wager many people might be inclined to wear them all the time and if only a limited number of rings are provided with the firearm then only the valid users would have the rings on them at all time.  Or if they simply didn't want to wear the rings all the time store the rings in a second secret and secured location (which introduces a second level of security against theft and nosy children so long as a different code is used to access the rings)<br />
<br />
The final problem however with ALL these systems is it now introduces electronic components to an otherwise mechanical device.<br />
<br />
Electronic components are susceptible to water and other environmental changes and thus by default make guns less rugged.  This will be a factor for police military and civilians alike that might make a hurdle to the successful use of this technology.<br />
<br />
The other problem is the destruction of electronics by EMPs.  EMPs fields and areas are becoming more and more common due to our technological society.   More over in the event of a nuclear war the nukes would make all the guns useless.  This is primarily an issue for the military which may just forgo using this system all together, but should we be sieged by a foreign nuclear power the civilian ability to resist would be tough if their weapons are no longer functional.<br />
<br />
Overall I'm supportive of the idea for application to all legal users of guns and certainly this idea has more merit to me than simply trying to ban guns.  It can allow gun ownership to continue while removing a substantial amount of the risk involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really see what the ACLU's action or inaction on this issue has to do with our conversation.<br />
<br />
You can never go back, the reality is that the world is a different place now, and we have to learn how to deal with that.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting that we should ban or eliminate guns, however I do think there should be some restrictions on them.<br />
<br />
It quite simply CANNOT be taken for granted anymore that anyone who picks up a firearm will know how to properly and safely handle it.  It doesn't seem to me to be out of line for someone to prove that they know how to do that before being allowed to use one.<br />
<br />
And just for the record, I am a gun owner.  I actually own 4.  I have:<br />
<br />
.22 Springfield Bolt Action Rifle<br />
.22 High Standard HD-Military Semi-auto Pistol<br />
.38 Special Smith &amp; Wesson Revolver<br />
.45 Colt Model 1911A (Manufactured in 1921)<br />
<br />
I enjoy target shooting immensly and would like to keep on being able to do it.  I also want people to be able to continue to own, collect firearms and use them in a legal manner.<br />
<br />
However, I DON'T feel that it's asking too much for those individuals to have to pass a safety course that shows that they are responsible, knowledgable and safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you know had you said that in the other thread we probably would not have been in as much opposition as we were.<br />
<br />
I actually think a &quot;driver's license&quot; for fire arm ownership might not be a bad idea.  The biggest thing for me would it would have to be a state run program and the data is available to state police only except in the case of a interstate crime in which case having a warrant to be issued would allow the FBI access to the data base.  Federal government shouldn't have access to the information however unless first there is a criminal case involved and secondly a warrant must be issued.<br />
<br />
The States have handled driver licensing and safety standards on their own quite well and I think firearm licensing could be equally handled well there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to change the subject - but along these same lines I don't think that people should be able to vote until they pass a training course showing that they're capable of showing a comprehensive grasp of all of the various political issues they're voting on, and are familiar with the platforms of all the major political parties they have to vote for.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to propose a background check of all voters, so that any with any sort of &quot;violent&quot; misdemeanor convictions or domestic violence cases can be disqualified from voting. <br />
<br />
Then also an imposition of at least a 5-day waiting period before anyone can cast a vote.<br />
<br />
Then these same conditions need to be applied to freedoms of speach, assembly and religion.<br />
<br />
Do that, and I think we'll all be even on what folks are proposing with our right to bear arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aelitan, you answered your own question above when you asked it.  Firearms ownership was commonplace 40 years ago.  Firearms and firearms owners were not villified 40 years ago.  <br />
<br />
Education is the key here.  For all of you who denigrate the NRA - the NRA has always been in the forefront of promoting firearms education for both law enforcement personnel and civilians alike.  As a law enforcement firearms instructor (which I once was), becoming NRA certified was a distinct feather in one's cap.<br />
<br />
The NRA also has developed the &quot;Eddie Eagle&quot; firearms safety program for children - to teach them what to do should they find a gun - whether laying on the street or in their own, or a friend's home.  In school systems that have adopted the program - it has been very successful.  However, it isn't more widely distributed due to the lobbying of anti-gun groups because it has been developed by the &quot;evil&quot; NRA.<br />
<br />
Want to solve the violent crime problem?<br />
<br />
Put the criminals away.  Don't let them out.<br />
<br />
When I was a police officer, there was a subject brought into the Campbell County Jail. He had been charged with Assault 1st Degree.  Assault 1st is where one causes &quot;serious physical injury&quot; and/or one uses a &quot;deadly weapon&quot; or &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; to commit the assault.<br />
<br />
This particular subject had not just one.. but TWO prior MURDER convictions.<br />
<br />
Why was this person returned to the street after the first murder?  Why in the hell was he released AGAIN after the second?<br />
<br />
This is an isolated extremem example yes - but its indicitive of the situation with the criminal justice system today.  &quot;Mandatory&quot; jail time for firearms use in a crime is one of the first things plea bargained away at a trial.  <br />
<br />
The same people are released after multiple violent crimes to continue to prey on decent law abiding people.<br />
<br />
You want to see a marked drop in violent crime rates?  <br />
<br />
Lock up the criminals.  Keep them there.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to prevent accidental shootings in the home? <br />
<br />
Educate children.  Use programs like the NRA&quot;s Eddie Eagle program in the schools to provide that education.  Hell, we've let the schools take over teaching our kids how to have safe sex, we may as well let the schools teach them how to be safe around firearms.<br />
<br />
Infringing on peoples' property rights and their liberty isn't going to accomplish what you think it will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This issue here is that there is a pretty wide divide in the interpretation of the 2nd amendment.<br />
<br />
One camp says that it means everyone has the right to own &quot;arms&quot;.<br />
<br />
One camp says that it provides for the organization of a militia.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, the NRA has no one to blame but themselves for the current situation with gun legislation, because they have not had the balls to run a case that would truely clarify the interpretation all the way up to the supreme court.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, the last case that actually made it up to the supreme court was in the 20's and was a gangster claiming he had a right to carry a sawed off shotgun.  He did not win.  Therefore the last supreme court ruling at the very least shows that there are very much limits on the 2nd amendment.<br />
<br />
Just as there are limits on the 1st amendment.  It is illegal for instance to slander someone, or shout &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded public place, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Research, research, research.<br />
<br />
<br />
You just shot yourself in the foot here Aizle...<br />
<br />
Yes, the last Supreme Court case that added any &quot;definition&quot; to the 2nd Amendment was Miller vs the US in 1939.<br />
<br />
The case was based around a subject who was in possession of a short barrelled shotgun.  The court upheld Miller's conviction because it had not been presented any evidence that a &quot;short barrelled shotgun&quot; had any relevance to a &quot;well regulated militia&quot;.<br />
<br />
The reason they weren't presented any evidence - which if they had, Miller likely would have won, as short barrelled shotguns have been in use with militias and the military since the invention of firearms and continue to be in use to this day... but the reason they didn't hear the evidence was because Miller didn't show up for the case.<br />
<br />
So, what can we determine from your shining example of Supreme Court case law regarding the 2nd Amendment?<br />
<br />
That the weapons protected by the 2nd Amendment are those that have some relevance to military use - e.g. assault rifles etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for what the 2nd Amendment &quot;means&quot; its crystal clear what the framers of the Constitution meant when they wrote it.  The only people with any &quot;confusion&quot; over what it means are those who refuse to research what they meant.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and we can discuss this all we want over and over, but one thing will not change ppl.<br />
<br />
There are millions of folks, me being one, that will NEVER give up our right to bear arms, sorry.<br />
<br />
You have heard the old saying &quot;they can have my gun when they pry it from my dead hands&quot;?<br />
<br />
It's holds very true to gun owners. I know for one, I would die defending this right as many others would too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL....yeah, just try and start an armed &quot;organized militia'&quot;, and see what happens. <br />
<br />
Actually there are a few out there, and despite the bad media image that was plastered on them most are not Neo-Nazi organizations or Aryan nation or Black Supremicists or what other ethnic based organization.<br />
<br />
There is one in Ohio that as of a few years ago was lead by a black man, seconded his best childhood friend who is white, and who has 4 company leaders 2 of which are white 1 of which is black and 1 who is oriental.  The ranks also were composed of multi-ethnic backgrounds and even women.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that a ban is not the same as confiscation(ban prevent the purchase of new weapons, confiscation actually removes the weapons which WOULD be struck down at the current time) many of the weapons available to this group included fully automatic M16s and Sub Machine guns and even flame throwers, Browning heavy machine guns, and even a few mortars.<br />
<br />
ALL those weapons described above were legal just a few decades ago and yet they were never used for criminal purposes.  Also if taken to court according to prior precedent those weapons WOULD be concluded as being used in accordance with maintaining a militia if their definition is that a weapon must be equatable to a military equivilent.<br />
<br />
Also Kullaas if we would get rid of these silly bans on Auto-matic weapons the general public probably would purchase M16s and the soon to be released OICW which would put us on par with our military.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the advantages that our military enjoys over foreign powers wouldn't be present in a domestic battle.<br />
<br />
Sattelite imagery would be less valuable if not down right unattainable due to sabotage and guerrilla units hiding (not large troop formations which satellites are normally used for.  Also the Naval power would be pretty much removed as this would be totally a ground war since the idea is not to flee the US but to retake it.  Also the Air Force would be severely limited cause it would do the tyrant no good to destroy his own cities to root out a few insurgents.  That same limitation would also apply to artillery and tanks.<br />
<br />
So now we have the infantry pretty much left and well they are just people with weapons not far superior to the standard hunting rifle anyhow and couple that with the fact that going fully auto-matic doesn't help in most combat situations anyhow it reduces the advantage of auto-matic weapons even more (the military even has new settings to fire in 3 round burst of which a person pulling the tirgger three times fast can duplicate with only a second or two worth of difference).<br />
<br />
The power in our military lies in bringing down overwhelming fire power through the air and superior intelligence.  In a civil conflict a lot of that would be stripped away.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you got the notion that resisting our army would be futile but its far from the truth especially when you add in the fact that the military itself would split along loyalist and rebellion factions as well.</div></div><hr />

Of course I don't want criminals to have machine guns or for that matter any gun however the fact is they ALREADY are and your proposed gun laws would do notihng since auto-matic weapons are already banned and they are still hitting the streets and killing cops with everything ranging from AK-47s to UZIs to MACs.<br />
<br />
In fact if anything the ban on auto-matic weapons which is already in effect should be proof to you that it does nothing to stop the criminal from aquiring those weapons.</div></div><hr />

It's true. If I ever turned to a life of crime, drug dealing would probably be one of the more appealing choices, just because they get uzis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If all gun owners were as reasonable as Aizle I believe we could come up with a compremise  that many of us would support.<br />
<br />
There are millions of folks, me being one, that will NEVER give up our right to bear arms, sorry.<br />
Men once said similar things about letting women vote.  I don't actually expect to change the minds of the hard-core gun owners.  I hope to start a dialog that over the years will change the general attitude towards guns.<br />
<br />
There is a truism in the scientific field that whenever a new and radical theory is proposed the old guard oppose it.  The new theory becomes generally accepted when the old guard die off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes Kullaas I called the gun bans silly which they are cause they are doing nothing to stop automatic weapons from getting into criminal hands.<br />
<br />
And then secondly I'm calling you silly for saying that I want gangs to have automatic weapons.<br />
<br />
What I clarified was no I don't want criminals to have automatic weapons but that they are still getting them so that means your favored bans are actually failing and one of the tests of law is enforcability and since the law is not being enforced or perhaps is completely unenforcable then the law should be removed.<br />
<br />
Furthermore in the constraints of the &quot;militia argument&quot; I stated that if I form a militia the US should not be able to deny me or my militia members from purchasing military grade weaponry.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the definition of militia would be something not state run or even state regulated as in the 1980s there was a governer who inisisted the National Guard for his state was the state militia and thus could not be called upon by Reagan.  However Reagan did in fact order the National Guard from that state to assist in operations and the governer filed  suit which later was found in favor of Reagan stating that the National Guard does not constitute a militia as it is not self armed and funded (National Guards use state and federal money).</div></div><hr />
