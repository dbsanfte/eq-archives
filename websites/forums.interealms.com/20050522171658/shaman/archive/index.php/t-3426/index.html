<br />
A few key mobs for this quest are broken atm and so the whole quest is on hold.  Since the cudgel is flagged for barbies VI might eventually modify the faction caps.  Give them a year or so.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The epic is better and far easier to get.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the point unless you buy into the myth that shaman can melee reasonably.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients  <br />
Sta: +10 Wis: +15 Int: +10 Poison Resist: +15 Disease Resist: +15 HP: +50 Mana: +75  <br />
Can be equipped in the range slot<br />
<br />
Fairly decent reason right there.  True, I'm sure there are other &amp; better range items out there, but if you can do your epic, you can do this - and you might not be able to kill the things that drop those &quot;other and better&quot; range items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Murjden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, the point was it's a range slot item.  That's why I was looking into this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason I want it, is for the range slot stats. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I'd go with the Talisman of Benevolence over the Cudgel, for range slot. Much easier to get the faction necessary, more useful resists for a shaman, and more wisdom. Slightly fewer HPs/Mana, but it has an AC of 7. And once you get your CoV faction up to Ally, the ToB is quite easy to get with just a single solid group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The wisdom is the same.. <br />
<br />
Cudgel &gt; Talisman of Benevolence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From what I remember reading a while back barb shaman maxed out at indifferent and that wasn't high enough faction for you to be able to compleate the quest. You might be able to get around that using illusions tho. Inky or skelly or Ele form might be less hated than barb and alow you to get your faction high enough to finish the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once you hit 60, I'm not sure you'll really care too much about the cudgel.. currently there are stacking issues, and from what I understand it is an extremely long 15 second cast.. but I guess if you are 4th shaman on a raid or something, it gives you something extra to contribute :) Personally, I like my divine inspiration from ME, AC 15 wis+15 int+15 mana+35... got it about 5 levels ago, if you're 60 you can most likely solo the goranga cheiftain tree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lots of good range items out there.  Took about 1 hour to get people, trigger, pull, kill and turn in to get my Talisman.<br />
<br />
How much time is it going to take a non-iksar to do this quest?<br />
<br />
If you like questing, that's great.  And it's an excellent range slot item.  I just don't think it's enough better to be worth it, for me.  Obviously your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't the cudgel have a clickable buff, and not a proc?</div></div><hr />
