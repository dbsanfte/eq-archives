<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">56 SHM<br />
55 DRU<br />
53 WAR<br />
52 CLR<br />
<br />
We're mainly going there to work on acquiring a set of Elysian Armor for the wifes Druid.<br />
<br />
Might be able to add a 46 Rogue to the group, but the wife isn't really comfy with two boxing yet, so might only be able to do the 4 man group listed above. I'll be three boxing the SHM, WAR, and CLR.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on alternate methods for obtaining gear upgrades for her (besides the Bazaar, we're broke :))? I'd post her Magelo so you could see the Elysians is actually an upgrade for her, but Magelo is down ATM. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Should be fine with that group, but I wouldnt expect much xp or fast kills.  While you're there, you can kill some of the Moktors for Plate armor.  Everyone can get some upgrades there, cept the shammy, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's very doable with that group.  Your biggest problem will be DPS.  UP mobs have ALOT of HPs for their level, especially the Moks.  Don't bother with DIS/POI dots on the Elysians....a complete waste of mana.<br />
