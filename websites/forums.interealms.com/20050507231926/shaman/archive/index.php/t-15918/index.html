<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With pet hold you can call dog dog back when it has aggro and let him sit somewhere while you tank the mob or get hit by a spell / AE without spaming /pet backup. But if you can't keep doggy outside AE he will get hit too.<br />
<br />
Suspended minion2 will put doggy in a pocket dimension but will only works when pet isn't on the hate list. Suspend doggy, go invis, uninivs and recall doggy sounds good too.<br />
<br />
What do you think is better pet hold or suspended minion2? Of course having both will be the best but in the moment I don't like XPing so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/pet hold is better, in my opinion. It allows much better control of the pet during combat, which is usually when the need for control is highest. As you noted Suspend Minion can't be used when your pet is fighting.<br />
<br />
Having both, with SM2, is definately best. :)<br />
<br />
Caveat: I'm speaking from experience as a magician. As a shaman I don't have either yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure I understand what /pet hold really does for me.<br />
<br />
It's the equivalent of spamming /pet back /pet back off over and over - except that the pet will still charge when hit by AE?<br />
<br />
Or is not charging when hit by AE the big benefit of /pet hold?  <br />
<br />
That seems marginally useful, but not a big deal really, given that I can also /pet back off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After /pet back, dogdog will not do ANYTHING but return to you or his /guard spot - regardless of melee attacks, spells, or AE.<br />
<br />
I got this first, so I could have my dog out on raids.  If you remember to hit your /pet back button after EVERY KILL, you'll never have to say &quot;uh, guys... my dog just died... somewhere&quot; again.  <br />
<br />
But Pocket Pet lets you keep him through invis, or CoH, I assume.  I would've liked to've had that a couple times...  But no, not high on the list of AA.  I didn't consider it till after 100 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Suspend minion also allows you to keep the pet through a rez (if you are in zone with body).   If you solo much at all, it proves to be invaluable.   If you raid a ton, then I'd go with the /pet hold MAYBE.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Far as I see it though, there aren't many fights where you would want your pet for SOME of the time in the beginning of the fight.   If it is a fight in which you would utilize the /pet hold, then it is probably a fight for which putting the pet away is acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have both /pet hold and suspended minion 2.  They are both very useful, but for different things.  I mostly use suspended minion 2 for when I want to move from one camp to another, or to have a backup pet if I'm fighting something that has a pretty strong likelihood of killing my pet off if I'm not careful.<br />
<br />
I use /pet hold mostly to avoid having my pet do stupid things on raids when an AE lands, but it is also very useful to prevent your pet from dying to enraging mobs.  After you tell the pet to attack, you then use /pet sit (which doesnt stop him from attacking).  When the mob enrages, you use /pet hold and the pet will instantly stop attacking, but also not move.  He's like his own little semi-intelligent melee. <br />
<br />
Now if only they would make a way for me to make my pet attack ONLY what I tell it to, no matter what...  that would be useful.  As it is now, the pet will sometimes switch back and forth between mobs which I find really irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pet control during battle can be useful to help position the mob. Getting all the pets off a mob while the MT is trying to move it to his favorite spot makes his job a lot easier. That's more of an issue for battles where you can't pin the target.<br />
<br />
If a pet has two equally-tempting targets it will attack the closest one. You can use that to make your pet switch targets. Have it follow (/pet hold, /pet back off, /pet follow) you over to the desired one then tell it to attack. /pet hold makes moving the pet around a lot easier. (Use /pet hold, which tells it to ignore attackers, before /pet back off, which clears the hate list, to avoid picking up a new target between the two commands.)<br />
<br />
Dealing with AE and enrage were discussed by previous posters. /pet hold is very useful for both.<br />
<br />
If you have a friend that was PL'd and has no melee skills you can use your pet as a target to build offense and piercing, 1HB, etc.<br />
<br />
Once you have /pet hold you begin to wonder how you ever lived without it. For a shaman, it is not the first class AA you'd want to get, but it is quite useful. (It *was* the first class AA my mage got, but then pets are more important to mages than to shaman.) Of course, if you don't use your pet much then it wouldn't do you much good, but the original poster was asking specifically about pet AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have suspended minion 2 and I find it to be very useful.  It's very nice for shamans that like to pull.  It's very nice for when you are invising to a fight spot, you can summon a prebuffed pet for no mana, ready to fight with you.  Very nice to keep around for emergencies.  If you are doing something that requires you to invis and move around frequently, you can give weapons and items to your pet without losing them every 5 mins.<br />
<br />
I also like to use my pet for dmg on (yeah we need dmg that badly sometimes) some raids.  It's nice to have a backup dog because I don't have the extra mana/time to heal him, so I just let him die and summon pocketdog 2.0 already all buffed up and ready to go.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that I think your suspended pet should not go away when you are evac'd within the same zone.<br />
<br />
I don't have pet hold and sometimes I wish that I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i am using my /pet hold sometime to pull a hard mob to kill and don t have much room to move.<br />
<br />
1)i cast malo <br />
2)send pet to the mob, then /pet hold him,let me time to slow the mobs.<br />
<br />
i would say get /pet hold before suspended minon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you plan to use your pet on raids then you need to get pet hold, otherwise you are a liability to your raid.  With suspended minion, you can keep your pet when you invis or coth or have to run across a zone or whatever (it doesn't work when you zone, though).<br />
<br />
In 240aa, I never felt the desire to train either of these abilities.  In exp groups, just spamming /pet back off is good enough for me.  On raids, I just don't use a pet because its more of a hassle than its worth imho.  I rarely have to invis and move around when I am exping, so I don't need suspended minion.  The only time I have really wanted either of these abilities was the other week when I was soloing the reports for my seru earring, but that was a very different situation that what I am usually in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just got pet hold for both my SK and Shaman this week and its great.  For SK, i can have pet up while I pull and not worry about it messing up the pull.<br />
<br />
For shaman, its nice to be able to keep your pet under control when casters, enrage mobs, AE etc are around.  I've seen raids lost over bad control of pets, and pet hold allows you to have a pet out on a lot of raids you usually wouldn't be able to.  In my guild, any dps is needed dps, so pets come in handy :)<br />
<br />
After seeing the comments about SM2, i'll be looking into this on soon it sounds like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just got SM2 for my necro. Very useful AA since I like to solo with him alot these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Suspend pet invis move through a zone full of mobs then pop pet out great aa if you hunt in dungeons and Loy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got pet hold a while back (when almost every mob over 61 enraged in PoP) and have used it a lot, of the two I would call it more important. I got suspended minion about a month ago, and immediately went back to exp and get suspended minion 2.  There really is no point to having one without the other.  Our unbuffed pets are cheap to cast, and thats all you get back with SM 1.<br />
<br />
I find myself using my pet a lot more with those abilities.  I frequently summon pet when zoning in, unworried if I will need to invis.  I will buff the pet while waiting on people to arrive, and stick it in my pocket as needed.  With pet hold the wolf doesn't die as often either.<br />
<br />
With both I almost feel like a pet class, and dog dog has even made raid appearances on occasion (pet control and shrink is mandatory to have a pet out on our raids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree that SM1 is not that useful. Fortunately, SM2 is only 3 more AA's (I was expecting it to be another 5) and is something I use several times a night. Places like BoT and Tactics seem to involve for a lot of going invisible to move camps, pick up new group members, check on spawns, etc. and not losing pet buffs, which for me are often timers for stuff like IoS and charisma, as well as pet weapons, is a great time saver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just to clarify, with SM2 the weapons you gave the pet actually stay?  I thought they poofed?  If so, this is excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They stay. With SM2, you suspend your pet, bring it back, and it is as if it had never been gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">SM2 has proven to be pretty handy in some situations.  Suspending the dog effectivly pauses the buff timer on him, and you can pop another dog.  Gives you a quick fully buffed basically mana free pet in battle, should the puppy meet his fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pet hold is required to use a pet on raids in my guild. Something I'll probably be getting soon as I finish CA/LR because I love my puppy pal. <br />
<br />
SM is something that would be really nice to have but don't see getting it anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
