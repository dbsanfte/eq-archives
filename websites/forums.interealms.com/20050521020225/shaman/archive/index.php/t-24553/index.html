<br />
We all know they forgot well just bout every other part of upgradeing our miserable little translucent fella, considering the AA out there ya think that might be a part they forgot also?<br />
<br />
Yea, I know this isn't new news or nothin, but you can only give them so much to deal with at a time and figure it fits in well with the getting them the innate DW.<br />
<br />
Whatcha all think, and if the pet is suppose to cast a spell, what would it be?<br />
<br />
Disclaimer for the idiots who wanted foraged alchemy components. NO NO NO we don't want the pet casting Spirit of the Wolf in the middle of a fight damnit.</div></div><hr />

dog + bite = rabies?<br />
<br />
anyone?<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
it would be hard to make a proc that makes sence if you ask me. something fitting the shamanesque theme would be nice. a low damage dot would be cool (kinda like above), but its probably not going to happen =P<br />
<br />
I do think the damn dog should have SoW when you cast it. I mean it *is* a spirit wolf. why the hell doesnt it have spirit of the wolf? bah whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The wolf should be able to summon a pack of smaller versions of himself. Every 10 minutes or so. <br />

Jibantik howls into the night. Calling for the pack to hunt. <br />
<br />
(Watch as cresting out from behind the mighty spirit wolf (range 100 away non aggro) A swarm of 10 Wolves comes pouring out of the ether.)<br />
<br />
Biting and snarling, the pack will feast once again upon the flesh of the living. <br />
<br />
Personally I dont think mutt should duel weild. I think he should do the damage appropriate to double attacking Like the weapon weilding pets do while they duel weild. And he should have a Hamstring attack that acts like a Weak snare (Only from behind) And acts as a Thiefs Backstab for rules and targeting. <br />
<br />
And yes innate Spirit of the wolf should be a no brainer. <br />
<br />
This game needs more things that make people go what the **** is that and how the hell do you do that!<br />
<br />
More things that give pleasure not for power increments. But instead cause they are cool and fun to use/watch.<br />

<br />
I never expect our pet to be a true pet and thats fine. Just want something to it. Sk pets lifetap, Necro pets lifetap at least. I dont know the newer Nec pets. Mage pets do their things. Heck even Doodad little bears get the awwww how cute thing going for them. <br />
<br />
Maybe some eye beams of death! Or maybe it can proc a slow so it can tell me if preslowed the mob  like the beastlords do without having to debuff it first.<br />
<br />
  I guess the 67 pet being broke just bugs me in general. Not a shaman vs soe thing. More a soe vs paying attention to details thing<br />
<br />
Actually thinking about it pet proc should be a long casting cold proc that does iffy damage or a quick casting poison proc that does low low damage or a 1 point fire damage proc weee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The shaman pet, a caster? yuck. Maybe make it a druid, so we can hold that over their heads or something, and maybe have a chance at being a main healer...<br />
<br />
&quot;Never fear, I have brought Gobaner to MH for us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, okay, joking... I would rather see our pet turned into, say, a rogue or, if it HAS to cast spells, then a ranger - A pet that DS's itself, snares, and has about the same survival rate it does now? Fine by me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No innate spirit of the wolf.  Our pet should be a bard, and it should twist selo's, mana song and (normal) haste.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any bard songs that would benifit a Shaman less.  A mana song howling pet might get us a few more groups, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">careful what you wish for, if soe made it a caster, it would just cast some disease dot that did no damage before the mob was dead. <br />
<br />
I could see the message now, Goner casts Affliction..<br />
<br />
Mutt needs about another 1k base hps and DW. We arent beasts, dogdog will never be a tank nor will it ever be dps. At best, its a ward or a rune.<br />
<br />
As the mutt stands now, its less mana to cast 1 poison dd per mob,   which does more dps than the mutt. Our mana cost only goes skyward when you have to spam spot heal your mutt or make another mutt every 5-10 mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do seem to remember reading about wolves hamstringing prey when they hunt. On a more eq note though dog dog is still serving the purpose he's allways served as a secondary damage source, which seems reasonable enough.... Giving him innate sow really would make sense though.<br />
<br />
That and innate Dual wield. Seriously, how hard is this decision to make ? If the game allows people to force a wolf to dual wield by feeding him weapons, which makes no sense and has to be a bug, then either fix the bug so we know where we stand or just make them dual wield innately and be done with it. Animals have 2 paws they can attack with plus their bite so it makes sense, no ? That way when adjusting it's damage output you know exactly what's what and don't need to factor in the percentage of people who will bother to carry around rusty weapons for their dog. How immersive is that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm going to have to agree with the innate SoW. It shouldn't really be innate sow ... he should just be faster. It's stupid to have a pet who can't even keep up with you when you're running with even Run3. He should always just keep your speed.  Then they wouldn't have to waste spells on things like &quot;summon companion&quot; when dogdog gets too far off. I already summoned a pet, why should I have to summon him again ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc should in no frickin way be no frickin dot!<br />
<br />
Guessing a Straight DD would be the thing, but from the way the AA is put in I would guess that Dog Dog would have to stop and cast it then resume mellee'ing.  Guessin a minor DPS gain for when the proc will hit on what your fighting, while at the same time annoying that your pet would now break roots and try casting against things that are totally resistant.   <br />
<br />
Though haveing the pet cast a debuff such as a cripple/malos thats stackable would be very very nice, so damn nice that we would never see it :(<br />
<br />
And yea yea yea, dog should have innate sow and innate duel weild, no brainer.</div></div><hr />

Sounds interesting but you realize they would have to give every class another 100 dps if we got this..</div></div><hr />

These are some great ideas that would really be fun too watch, without unbalancing our class or pet..I wish the devs had this kind of imagination, as this might actually cause some of the gripes to slow down..at least for a while 8)</div></div><hr />

Except if the mob is mezzed..pet cant target to awaken..I get the message that it is not a real target when bowser is sic'ed on a mezzed mob all the time..Chanter is safe from bowsers awakinging when shammy mistakes a mezzed target for active one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I do seem to remember reading about wolves hamstringing prey when they hunt. <br />
Yup, wolves can and do try and immobilize their (larger) prey by hamstringing it. However, as beastlords have a snare proc for their warders I doubt we'll be seeing anything like it.<br />
<br />
As for pet procs for shamans, I've said it before and I'll say it again - I'm still cheesed off at losing Rabid Companion in the dying days of the Gates beta:<br />
<br />

<br />
A 75 point (-30 resist check) disease nuke going off 10 times a minute would have added a decent chunk of DPS, but I guess they didn't want to turn us into beastlords. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I can think of is maybe the second rank would stop the wolf from proccing weapons (as you get to see the &quot;howling&quot; casting animation when they go off) - could be handy if you've used DoT proccing weapons for soloing, I guess, but not sure it'd be worth spending the AAs to check!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I vote for snare.  Maybe just for like 5 tics or so (like that one weap our shaman's can get.)  The hamstringing idea is the way to go.<br />
<br />
No DPS adjustment, limited applicability (usless for undead, 2+ mobs in aggro range, etc...) but would allow one final trick in or bag, albiet we need the puppy to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Treasure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Id be happy if they simply hit for 10 - 15 more max dmg and had 1000 more hitpoints and more AC. Enough to actually withstand 1 melee round from, say, ANYTHING PoP or beyond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK here was his scenerio:<br />
<br />
Multipull<br />
You get smacked and forgot to put up pet hold.<br />
Dogdog seeks revenge<br />
Dogdog lays the samck down on said mob and gets a first round proc that sticks.<br />
Silly Warrior Picks the other mob to lay the smack down on.<br />
Chanter mezes the dot'ed mob Dogdog was beating on<br />
Next tick of the DoT goes off and wakes up mez'd mob.<br />
Mez aggro kicks the crap out of Dogdogs dot aggro = dead chanter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Except if the mob is mezzed..pet cant target to awaken..I get the message that it is not a real target when bowser is sic'ed on a mezzed mob all the time..Chanter is safe from bowsers awakinging when shammy mistakes a mezzed target for active one.<br />
<br />
Well if the pet had cast a dot (damage over time) on the mob, like was being explained in the post, you will indeed see this.  The dot continues to work, even after a target is mezzed, thereby waking it up and producing the message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Take bst slow percentage, divide by shaman slow percentage and from that get a multiplying factor. Next take the bst pet proc and multiply it by this factor to get the amount of damage our pet should do.<br />
<br />
I do like the chanter killing ideas too however, hmm.</div></div><hr />
