<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just making some observations here, but....<br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed a large influx of new people playing EQ recently?<br />
<br />
It seems that the overall number of people on Brell has not increased (old timers still gone), but there seems to be a slew of new peeps wondering around.<br />
<br />
It seems to have had a wierd effect on the bazaar as well.  Most high-end twink items are being sold rather cheaply, but more common items are still maintaining a decent price.  I would have figured the opposite would have happened due to OoW (Twink items still high, lower-end items cheap due to competition with OoW drops.)<br />
<br />
Other than that, I have seen PoP spells/tradeskill components selling at a premium lately.  (Makes sense with PoP zones being particularly empty since OoW.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of people are server transfers. People move from less populated servers to more populated ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Feh, wish I could move my low end stuff on ARo. <br />
<br />
I think the prices on a lot of stuff have stayed steady, &amp; even increased somewhat due to a lack of supply. Nobody is out there farming it, they are all in WoS.<br />
<br />
Ornate is interesting, even with the gimping of SRT access, there is far less of it around. They may have nerfed drop rate though - had none drop in a 4hr group the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know how long you have been away Predicus, but on brell we got quite a few fresh faces coming out of the PoP/Ldon era. They just leveled up and are dealing with aa's/gearing up. It can be depressing at times being in a group, being the only one in the group from pre-Luclin era times... and having the lowest amount of aa's in the group by almost a hundred =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you a &quot; casual &quot; player? If not, then that sounds like: a) purchased old accounts, or b) levelled up (by a 3rd party) new accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's possible, but many of the folks I run into in the world of WoW have never played EQ.  For quite a few it's their first MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Now that in and of itself can lead to some problems when grouping, but that's a different thread................ :rolleyes:  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well with the sony station pass you get 4 more character slots on eq2. So my guess is that part of the influx is a lot of EQ2 players who bought the sony station pass for the character slots and are now sampling eq1.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since August of 1999, same character as a main. I've always played alot, but before velious it was more explore and questing then exp'ing every night. Of course, 3 years in college hurt my leveling alot, didn't hit 60 till PoP. But now I am in a raiding guild, working in the EP now.<br />
<br />
Its just that I have regular groupmates, one started in luclin, has over 320 aa compared to my 125, and another in Pop with 250ish, for example. Just kinda odd going from the little fish learning form the bigger fish, to being the old fish that has to explain what hell levels were.</div></div><hr />

I have noticed this a lot since I came back after 3 months- there are a lot of players out there that really only know LDoN---&gt; present.  I have heard many questions spouted out in PoK on &quot;where do I turn-in parchments in PoK&quot; and a slew of &quot;WTB Port&quot; when they can run to the place in 3-4 mins.  At first I thought some of the comments were out of sheer laziness, but after talking with a few- they simply did not know how to get from point A to point B without a porter.  There seems to be quite a bit of enigma going on with GoD/OoW, so it begins to make me wonder how these players are 60+ and what have they been doing?<br />
<br />
P.S. dunno about any other server, but there seems to be a small hoard of necros falling out of the woodwork on Brell.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BloodyAccount</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pred, you went back? I thought you swore off EQ?<br />
<br />
The guild went pfffttt... kinda like that sound made when a bumble bee's ass hits him in the back of the head when he collides with your windscreen at 60Mph.<br />
<br />
So I bailed, I hate playing alone, and EQ2 WOW etc are just more EQ with fancier artwork and less content :P<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy being back, if you see me running around its probably not me, me is for sale...I need beer money for when Tsunamai and Xanthia turn up for the Lions tour.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; just noticed I'm logged on with the wrong account :P<br />

Lots of new necros true. People who want to stay round probably had the same idea as me, twinking up the best all round solo class in the game, in case there is nobody to play with. <br />
<br />
I've sold a few copies of Spell: Summon Corpse for 2k lately. Trivial to port in &amp; gank the Ishva Mal with my druid.</div></div><hr />

BARB!!! What's up bro.... I didn't actually mean to leave- RL just caught up with me and took all my time away from the game.  Yeah, it has died down a lot on Brell- not too many on (lots and lots and lots of necros).  I actually enjoy soloing/questing, so everything is still ok for me.  I expect things to pick when one of two things happen:<br />
<br />
1- people wander back in (not very likely...)<br />
2- SOE merges servers <br />
<br />
So I guess I will be around for a while..... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xaas Boneweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was reading the state of eq, and if ppl don't come back for the new expasion, i expect server merges soon after. I would be most ammuse to see them merge then have a bunch of ppl come back and have to split again..haha. <br />
<br />
Xaas</div></div><hr />
