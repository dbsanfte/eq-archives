<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently came back after a long break. I'm experienced in the game and know that levels are &gt; than all for most classes. In the case of shamans I'm not sure what to do. He's quickly becoming my main since my guilds needs shamans, we have 4 65 bards other than mine.<br />
<br />
I'm 59 now and will level quite quickly via a mix of pop and droga/nurga. Question is should I keep speeding to 65 or put leveling on a halt to get on the canni 5 aa path then continue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest getting canni 5 quick.  It's soooo nice to have.  I stopped lvling at 61, so I had the new dogdog, to get it and I'm glad I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I powered my way to 65 instead of working on AA more, and now I'm regretting it.<br />
<br />
At level 65, Canni 4 just doesnt cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Having Q and being able to kinda heal again is worth getting 65 before canni V imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can get malo/torpor for cheap, stop at 61.  If you cannot get those spells, go to 65, then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
I actually think the decision is based on where you want to fight.  If you are happy in non POP content then I say, heck, aa up canny5.  I zoomed up to 65 myself because I wanted the turbo charged ZEM experience of POV, HOH, BOT etc. and for loot and guild reasons - and because I'm an unabashed powergamer (ok I said it).  There's no wrong answer, I am very happy that I took my route and others would be very happy getting canny5 at 61.  I would say, though, that it is a bunch easier to get POP groups now that lots of folks are doing LDON but you will get higher quality groups at 65. (Got to love those tanks with big AA's and peeps who are skilled at what they do).  That is a very important reason to level that often does not get mentioned.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd get the levels. It sounds like your guild needs a L 65 shaman, with or without Can V, not a L 61 shaman with Can V. AA points will come faster at L 65 than they will at L 61. Can V will not speed up your leveling all THAT much, especially if you're grouping. It'll make it more convenient, but not that much faster. By the time you earn enough exp for the 23 AA (?) to get Can V, you'd have enough exp to BE L 65, or darn close to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Gwain.  I had Torpor waiting for me at 60 and so I AAed to Cann5 before moving on.  Of course, I split exp to get SCRM and a few more gems and only now am I going full bore exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm going full regular xp so I can get to 65 and forget about levelling ever again...  So I can just go straight AA from that point on.  I'm of the mind no spell or AA is greater than level 65.  I stopped at 61 and got 10 AAs, which kinda was a nice little AA buffer, but I'd prob be 65 by now if I hadn't done that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My opinion only:<br />
<br />
if you have access to Torpor but not Quiescence, stop at 62 and get Can5.<br />
<br />
If you have Quiescence or neither, push to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, it depends. :)<br />
<br />
Since you say your guild is very low on shamans, 65 will be a benefit to your guild, the additional levels help with resists etc.<br />
<br />
Malos/Fo7 will also help on guild raids if you can get them.<br />
<br />
Canni V is very nice, but it's not essential to a raid, so if supporting your guild on raids is where your focus is, I'd suggest you go to 65 first. Once you're 65, the AA come easily anyway.<br />
<br />
When I did it, I did the AA for Canni V at 61/62, then went back to level to 65. I was in a small guild at the time though, who didn't raid very much, and I didn't want to outlevel all of them. I also had Malo and Torpor, but not much prospect of buying my 65 spells (or even all the 63/64 ones).<br />
<br />
I found that 62 is a good level to get to stop and AA if you're going to stop. At that point you have your best PoP buffs, albeit only single target versions, you have Cloud of Grummus which is a good raid spell, you have your upgraded pet which is good for solo and groups, and you have Tnarg's and Replenishment. All good tools for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Also at 62, you can join HoH and BoT groups without being flagged, and if there aren't any spaces there, PoV/CoD groups will be glad to have you, and you can still get fairly decent (though not as good) experience in tier 1.<br />
<br />
If you don't have Malo and Torpor, maybe you would be better off heading to 65 and skipping them altogether for Malos and Quiescence. The path to 65 might be a little harder as a result, though.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, the best experience is in tier 3 and above, and people there will group with a 65 shaman over a 62 one, so you might find that going to 65 first will be easier in that way.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think there's a wrong decision, just do what you think is best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is some good advice going on in this thread. I am currently a 62 shaman fortunate to have torpor and malo. As soon as I got 20 percent into 62 I switched to full aa and am currently at 13aa.<br />
<br />
I get different advice depending on who I talk to. My GL and officers say that levelling to 65 is the best thing, and if I listen to myself I decide on sticking to aa's until canni V.<br />
<br />
It is true that levelling may be the best thing but having ground out to 62 I needed a break.... I am now in a quandry.... 11 more aa's wont kill me to get but 65 will also be much better.<br />
<br />
I can get groups in BoT but I will be passed over if a higher level shaman is also LFG, which imo is perfectly correct. However, I usually only have to wait a few minutes for my opportunity to arise.<br />
<br />
I decided to go full xp in such zones as BoT, or Tactics, and full AA xp in lesser zones such as LDON. Who knows how this will work out, but if I make Canni V before I hit 65 (lol, I am sure I will) I will return to pure xp until I get there.<br />
<br />
All in all, it is nice to have the options, and torpor/malo really make both options more palatable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hit 60 pre pop (by 1 week) so i went 100% AA until i got canni 5.<br />
<br />
Looking back i think i should have leveld to 62 (for the spells and such) then gotten canni 5.... but def get canni 5 before 65!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got Cann5 at level 61.  It was not exactly....the most readily usable ability until I reached 62 and got new focus + sta.  It eats 1924hp, I had roughly 2500hp self-buffed; it was a downtime tool unless I felt like walking on the wild side and agroing everything within 12 square miles as I dropped down to a bub hp =)  Keep that in mind!</div></div><hr />
