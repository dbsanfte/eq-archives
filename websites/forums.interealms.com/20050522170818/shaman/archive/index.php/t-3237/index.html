<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight I got my 18th AA point and I thought to myself, &quot;Well, you can say WTH and put those four points into a couple untapped skills and become Venerable, OR you can wait another two points and round out Mental Clarity, then focus on Cann5.&quot;<br />
<br />
Weighed my options, bugged a couple people with questions, and then I came to conclusion that, &quot;Hey I am supposed to be playing this game for fun, not to keep up with the neighbors.  Besides, what is practical for me specifically?&quot;  <br />
So, in a moment of non-comformity, I bit the bullet and trained in Healing Adept Lvl 1 and Healing Gift Lvl 1.  That got me my Venerable tag (but hey it's just a tag, a title, so it was only an added perk).<br />
<br />
The way I look at it is this:<br />
<br />
I am not a raiding shaman.  Also, I rarely use enough mana when soloing/small grouping (which I pretty much do exclusively) to justify rushing to get Cann5 (Cann4 still works fine for me, and besides, I have like barely over 2000 HPs self-buffed, so I would really only safely Cann5 when I was with a cleric or paladin).<br />
Also, I do not have Torpor, so being able to get off a better heal ,and the chance of pulling off a double heal, are attractions for me.<br />
<br />
That being said, next 6 points will be going into MC 3, and then I'll concentrate on going for Cann5.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, well wait, there's always Rabid Bear, which I can start putting points into anytime . . . hmm . . . ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a good thread, and gives me a chance to raise some questions I was going to ask, since I am going to finish run and regen 3 this week and get to work on archetype skills.<br />
<br />
First off, your skill picks seem perfectly valid to me.  Being able to heal better is definately a good thing.<br />
<br />
Secondly, what are some alternatives to run3&gt;regen3&gt;mc3&gt;canni5?<br />
<br />
The SCR3 path seems pretty tempting to me.  An extra 3 mana per tick is nice, but so is a free extra tick of torpor (not that i have the spell yet but pfft), as well as the added bonus of having your other spells last longer, which gives you more mana, in a sense.<br />
<br />
Example:  My monk partner and I will ALWAYS have regrowth up.  That's 600 mana every 10 minutes.  Over the course of an hour I cast the spell 6 times, meaning 3600 mana.  If I had SCR3, I would only have to cast the spell 4.6 times (I know you can't cast a spell 4.6 times, bear with me for the math), meaning 2760 mana per hour.   That's 840 free mana per hour, or 1.4 free mana per tick.  That's just for regrowth alone.  You are saving mana any time you have buffs cast on yourself or someone else (the more you buff the more you save), and you get the added bonus of not having to mem and cast the damn things so often.  In addition you get that extra tick (or maybe even 2?) of torpor.... mmmmmmmm sounds pretty tempting to me.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
(after sc3, I would go for canni5, and then SCRM, then back for MC3, btw)</div></div><hr />

You need MC3 before you can train Canni5.<br />
<br />
As far as what's best... I think Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5 is the standard path for a reason, Canni5 is that good. When I made 23 AA points, I became a Master Wincer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Let's assume you did run3 &gt; regen3.<br />
<br />
mc3 &gt; canni5 would make most sense (and it's what I did too)<br />
<br />
an alternative if you like torpor would be<br />
<br />
casting reinforcement 3 (venerable)<br />
&gt; reinforcement mastery (8)<br />
&gt; quick buff 3 (18)<br />
8+18 = 26 (elder)<br />
<br />
back to archetype<br />
<br />
mc3 &gt; canni 5 (12+5)</div></div><hr />

that ends that debate.  runs3&gt;regen3&gt;mc3&gt;canni5 for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the point is that C5 isn't that great without Torpor.  I can't imagine that it would be really.  If you have Torpor though, there's no better AA skill at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went about it strange as well.<br />
<br />
I did <br />
<br />
regen 3 <br />
run 3<br />
Spell casting fury 1 (Next day JBB crits Nerfed, Bastards)<br />
Mental clarity 2<br />
(The 6 points seemed like a huge long path at this point)<br />
(I was in umbral plains trying to heal a warrior with no torpor, Vrs Gantru Bob and got a bit frustrated)<br />
Healing Gift (The healing Crit one I think that is it's name)<br />
(Then I got torpor!! YAY)<br />
Since I had torpor I had to spend the two points I had for SCR 1<br />
(That got me Venerable)<br />
<br />
I just finished grinding out the 6th point and got MC 3  Man rabid bear looked Tempting when I got that 5th point but for a change I held strong. <br />
<br />
Canna 5 will be mine soon. (1 orange and 4 AA points away.)<br />
Then rabid bear.<br />
<br />
The intresting thing is I get werewolf form sometimes. And I can both Crit heal the Lifetaps and Crit blast the Lifetap proc. Doing 70 Damage and healing 140 Lots of fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it would be smart to go for canni5 even if you don't have torpor.  That is what I intend on doing.  I would hate to go the SCR route and then have torpor fall into my hands, and then have to go back and do 17AA points just to make maximum use of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't done much reading up on AAXP before being as I'm only 52 right now.  Is there a limit to how many AAXP you can get?  Or can you just keep AAXP'ing away til you have like over 100 pts and train in just about everything on the list? (boring I know, but hey :p )<br />
<br />
Forgive the noobishness here, just never seen it mentioned and people talking about which ways you should go with the points you have makes it seem like there's a set amount of points that can be earned.<br />
<br />
Thanks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can bank as many points as you want.  They aren't doing you any good though, which is why you rarely see it happen.  People will do it though, for strange reasons, like skipping a title level or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You have to spend your points wisely because it is a pain in the ass to get more.  Every AA point is about equivelent to level 51 (you should remember what that was like if you're 52).  Imagine doing level 51 again... now, imagine doing it 23 times.  That's what you have to do to get canni5 (imho our best skill) the FASTEST.  Now, if you dick around and get other skills instead, you have to wait even longer to get it.  you have to decide what is most effecient and benefitial for you, and go for it.  this is just a thread to help people decide what that is.<br />
<br />
as far as i know, you can have as many points as you want.  however, the useful skills for us end around 80ish i believe.  I haven't added it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cann 5 is the best aa skill for shaman without question. Even without Torpor I imagine it would still be nice especially when buffing raids. If you are with a cleric tell them to toss you a celestial elixer before you use it if you dont have torpor. If you don't have torpor, work on egtting it hard while you work on cann 5, trust me it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">since i have only been playing very casually lately, and i didn't play for 9 months i don't know much about AA... i've heard talk about AA abilities that decrease casting time, like torpor from 6 seconds to 3 seconds.  does anyone know the &quot;perfect path&quot; to get that first?  <br />
<br />
cannibalize 5 might be all that and a bag of chips, but i haven't had a situation where it would save me enough time that i absolutely MUST have it.  i think for the way i play, casting torpor faster would be a much stronger ability.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is a class ability, but it has no prerequisite. Basically, you have to spend 6 in general, 12 in archetype, and then you can start working on quick buff.  It will take 18 points to reach a 50% reduction.  You can find out about all the AA skills at eq.castersrealm.com</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You're not the only one that took a different path. I did the standard run and regen3, then put one point into everything BUT mental clarity. I didn't even think about Canni 5 until I had quick buff 1, rabid bear, and mgb. I smack myself repeatedly now, because I didn't realize how powerful it is. C5 is the most important class skill, bar none. You'll regret not getting it. Don't be ignorant -- put your points where it matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you have torpor I would go for cann v no question about it. You gain like 1000 mana every 3 minutes which ends up being something in the area of 30 mana a tick regen when you spread it out over that 3 minutes. Thats a huge amount of regen. When soloing since I got cann v i use bane of nife and ebolt on every mob I fight and still have no problems keeping mana up.<br />
<br />
If you didn't have torpor then I would probably say go for Spell casting mastery if you wanted to do something else. Mana savings on all spells cast is better than longer lasting buff for saving mana. Longer lasting buffs can get dispelled, the target can get killed, lots of things can end up making that extra duration pretty useless but SCM saves you mana the instant it's cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's more like 700 mana every three minutes, because it takes about 1.5 Torpor to heal the damage.  I assure you though, all you nay-sayers, no other skill has an impact like a free 700 mana every three minutes.  I have Quick Buff 2 (faster Torpor), C5, and MGB for my class skills.  Getting C5 first let me get the others faster.  It wouldn't work the same in reverse.</div></div><hr />

IMO, the only thing that would be truly &quot;ignorant&quot; would be to ignore what is best for you personally, and dump a bunch of points into skills just because everyone else is.<br />
<br />
The truth is, Cann5 is only marginally beneficial to me right now.  As is, I do not spend enough mana on a regular basis to justify rushing to get it (hmm, think I have said all this before).<br />
<br />
Now, someone mentioned Quick Buff, which I completely forgot about.  I may actually delve into that a little next, because everyone in any group situation could benefit from that.<br />

I dunno, will have to do some looking around I guess to decide my next course of action.</div></div><hr />

You're kidding right?  With mage focus items, you can already cut torpor down to 5 seconds casting time.  Even without it, I'm extremly happy with the spell as it is.  It's already too overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">For those that are sayin that they haven't seen a need to have canni 5, I have to say you must not be thinking from all angles. It is a wonderful skill regardless of what your normal situation is be it raiding, soloing, or grouping. Perhaps the mana that you may have held back for emergeny use instead of tossing in a couple big DoT's you can use now because you know it is just 3 seconds and wham you have it all back. Perhaps you will have the means to handle healing for that extra train that gets dumped on you. You can now solo faster because you can kill faster by adding in more damage with your big DoT's and nukes (if it applies), then you have virtually no downtime because instantly you have your mana back. You can buff raids of 50+ people so much faster it will make your head spin. Really, Canni 5 is the be all end all of shaman AA skills as they are currently. It can allow you to completely change the way that you play, regardless of your situation.</div></div><hr />

you misread.  She was alluding to the fact that with AA abilities you can make torpor last longer and cast quicker.<br />

Different situations require different tactics.  If you have no Mages or Druids well, then you do something else.  For small time raids, you can make it work.<br />

I just spent 2 points in Healing Gift last night.  Granted I already have Canni5 and some other AA.  Class Title is not important to me.

First:<br />
Regen 3 (1)<br />
Run Speed 3 (1)<br />
Quick Buff 3 (18)<br />
<br />
20 pts<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 (12)<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery 1 (5)<br />
<br />
17 pts<br />
<br />
Third:<br />
Mental Clarity 3 (12)<br />
Cannibalize 1 (5)<br />
<br />
17 pts<br />
<br />
The goal is to have faster casting and longer lasting torpor.  This is for shamans that don't do a lot of large guild raids, ie those who spend most of their time soloing or grouping with one group.  I certainly fall into this category.  All the shamans with Cannibalize will say &quot;no you're stupid, don't wait to get Cannibalize&quot; need to rethink things.  Yea though the mana regeneration is important, so is being able to heal others.  The faster a shaman can cast torpor and the longer it lasts, the more efficiently they can heal.  Cannibalize is an ability that primarily helps the shaman themself.  Faster longer Torpors helps anyone they group with, AND themselves.<br />
<br />
(That almost sounds like a convincing argument. ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Spell casting reinforcement mastery costs 8 points actually, casters realm is wrong. As far as the path to take, sometimes there is a reason everyone (or just about) follows the same path: it's the best one. Take whatever skills you want but cann 5 is something you can quantify without measuring, logging, timing, etc. It really is that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I put 3 points into quickbuff tonight!  With my enhancement haste III earring, I have a three second invis!  I think that's pretty special.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">For soloing, Cann5 really is not very useful, unless you can bump your HPs up pretty high and have Torpor.<br />
<br />
I have neither.<br />
<br />
Self-buffed I have slightly over 2000 HPs.  So not only would I have to make sure I have full HPs when using it; I would also then have to heal myself back up to a reasonable health, which, with no Torpor, would require me chain casting heals.  That defeats the purpose of Cann5 in the first place!<br />
And this is after/before battle.  During battle, there is no way in hell I could pull it off.<br />
<br />
Now, grouped with a cleric or paladin, that changes.  Even with no Torpor, the cleric/paladin can not only bump up your HPs, but also slap a quick heal or Celestial on you to help ease the hurt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if Cann5 is useful to you, that's great.  But please realize that not everyone is in the same position.  When you get Torpor and enough HPs to give yourself some padding, it ceases to be an issue, but before that, an alternate AA path is perfectly viable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well of course whats best is based on having Torpor. Also, bumping up your HP isn't as difficult as it first sounds, even if you arent in an uber guild. I had like 1700hp unbuffed in that  area for quite a while. I decided to work towards getting to 2k unbuffed so that I could canni 5 better. I was able to do it relatively cheaply with fairly common items as a matter of fact (common meaning like stuff found in velious quest item quality or less). So, with the qualification being that you have torpor already, canni5 still is the best choice in most cases. It doesn;t only apply to raid shaman, Canni 5 is a wonderful thing to have even for the soloing shaman. If you are soloing now, perhaps you may throw in a bane of nife, epic, melee, dog, and bracer nukes to kill a mob. With canni5 you can become so much more effective because you can toss in a pox, 2 banes, and that other stuff, when the fight is over, torpor and canni5 and you are back to full HP and full mana, ready to rock again. and faster than the older way. Canni 5 is one of those skills that maybe you can't see it for how useful it is until you have it, but it really is all that. It helps me in every aspect of my play, grouping, soloing, raiding. EVERY aspect.</div></div><hr />

okay i went to caster's realm and checked the AA information.  hopefully this is all correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to spend 12 points in Arch skills before you can do any class skills.<br />
<br />
This is for shamans that don't do a lot of large guild raids, ie those who spend most of their time soloing or grouping with one group.  <br />
...<br />
 Faster longer Torpors helps anyone they group with, AND themselves.<br />
<br />
I am in a guild that can muster at most about 2 full groups.  Our entire at least semi-active roster is 12 people.  We are not a raiding guild.  The toughest mobs we kill are stuff like the Vadyn and umbral nameds (not Rumblecrush or Doomshade).  We killed Inny once too, with our 2 little groups.  Everything that I have I have got with 10 or less people.  My gear, my aa, my spells.  So I can certainly relate to the small guild/no guild shaman situation.<br />
<br />
I have Canni5 and I am very glad I got that first.  I can't tell you the number of times it has saved me and my group.  The thing I love to do best in this game is to take on tough stuff with less people than anyone else does.  Ever skin of your teeth victory is a tremendous rush.<br />
<br />
I present the opposite side of your argument.  <br />
<br />
For example, last time we did vadyn.  We had 8 people.  2 clerics.  For a long stretch during the fight our 2 monks went LD.  The vadyns hps were not moving.  End of the fight, vadyn at 5% and the clerics are oom.  I burned my entire bar of mana chain healing the warrior with chloroblast.  When you are healing less than 1 hit from the vadyn with each cast of CB you have NO TIME to click canni4 in between casts.  I went oom.  I hit canni 5 and had 40% of my mana pool back and was chain healing some more.  In the minute or more that I single handedly can keep the MT alive it gave the clerics enough time to med 1 cheal and finish him off.  It would not have mattered if my torpor could have been cast in 3 seconds, or if it would have lastest 20 ticks.  I can't use it in that situation.  If he looses agro the mob is heading right for the clerics and me.<br />
<br />
The high priest in acrylia with 1 group.  For exp, challenge and level 60 luclin spells.  Cleric oom, chain healing the warrior against an unslowable mob.  Canni5 buys enough time to let me keep chain healing and the cleric to med 1 last cheal to finish it off. <br />
<br />
Halls of testing with one group.  Had a really hard time slowin the mob, people been eating the AE, getting low on health?  Cleric is getting LoM from healing off an unslowed mob?  Canni 5 gets me back up to a safe level I can torpor everyone but warrior and throw in a few CBs on him while I use regular canni to help allow the clerics mana to catch back up.<br />
<br />
5 person exp/sinew farming run down to Juggs, oops got 3 adds.. maloing, slowing, root parking.  Malo and slow on 4 mobs puts me very low on mana, hit canni5 and now I am ready to assist heal and continue root parking while I use regular canni to get back to full.<br />
<br />
Only healer in Cazic Thule exp group?  Canni5 helps me there.<br />
Farming hate with grp for exp?  Canni5 helps me there.<br />
Recovering from wipeout in Hate?  Canni5 helps me there.  :P<br />
Killing shrooms with a partner in FG?  Canni5 helps me there...I even died to it there the first day I had it. heh.<br />
<br />
In many ways, I think the effects of Canni5 are MORE profound to a small group/guild shaman who is relied upon to contribute more, faster, alone, than most shaman do at a large target raids.<br />
<br />
The experiences I recount are not an attempt at bragging, just trying to share experiences beyond &quot;I can cast grp focus and click canni5 and be at full mana, it's so great&quot;.  I don't talk about what my friends are doing to help at the same time I am using my skills.  They don't realize that Canni5 helps as much as it does, the same as I am sure I don't realize some of the things they are doing.<br />
<br />
Torpor is awesome.  3 second cast time, long lasting torpor is more awesome.  But my role as a shaman does not revolve around torpor and torpor alone.   I love the flexibility of our class and the ability for us to help our group/guild/raid in so many ways.   For me Canni5 only adds to the vast flexibility of our class.<br />
<br />
And to folks who say its hard to get HP gear with a small guild, I beg to differ.  It's not as easy as it is for people who choose daily between 100hp items for sure, but i think i have respectable HP from fairly common and attainable stuff.<br />
<br />
just the other side of the coin.  We all know there is an incredibly vast number of ways to play your shaman and there is no right way, or only way.  If Talamay and others choose to go with Torpor enhancers first, more power to ya.  If Rodahn and other shaman without torpor choose to take different routes, that seems reasonable to me.  I just wanted to share experiences that I thought may be relevant to alternative to the raid shaman playstyles that were described, and may not have been considered.<br />
good hunting, I go to sleep now.<br />
-Henny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Rodahn, I took a look at your profile, and I figured out why you have no HPs.  You are dressed like a druid!<br />
<br />
Here's some suggestions that might help you out:<br />
Fingers:  6ac 65hp fire opal rings, or get a shadel bandit ring if you can.<br />
Earrings:  golden black sapphire earrings with 2ac 35hp 25mana.  Another choice is getting a fingerbone hoop.  perma see invis is nice, plus resists and sta.<br />
Helmet:  Get a group of friends to head to dragon necropolis and hunt paebla for the spirit talker's headdress.  Another option is to go for the dragon faction quest that involves that white dragon in WL, and the giant in Great divide.  It's also a focus item now.<br />
Arms:  Grey flesh sleeves.  They have ac and hps and sta on them.<br />
Belt:  Girdle of Reflection.  Kael quest.  12ac 6wis 35hp<br />
Shoulder:  Barbed dragonscale pauldrons or Tattered mantle or any of the mantles from WW.  Wost quality WW mantle is 11ac 25hp 25mana<br />
Back:  Heiro cloak or Lodizal shield (lodi doesnt have hp, but it has big wis which can be used to offset the reduce wis from the above changes)<br />
<br />
By making these simple or only minorly difficult changes to your equipment, you can gain at least another 360 HPs.  The cost is about 25-30 points of AC, and some wisdom.  But shaman don't need really huge wisdom.  Shaman need mana efficiency.  If you don't run out of mana, you have enough wis.<br />
360</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Actually, nm that drop in AC.  Looking things over it looks like you'll actually gain AC from getting better HP gear.  I was only thinking of the drop in AC from JB armor, but forgetting the massive upgrades to your ac from the rings and cloak and shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it would be foolish to save so many unspent points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
litchebane,<br />
<br />
As far as the path to take, sometimes there is a reason everyone (or just about) follows the same path: it's the best one<br />
<br />
Everyone (or just about) thought +wis gear was the way to go for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Obviously we know otherwise, now.<br />
<br />
What may be the &quot;best&quot; for some people isn't the best for others.  <br />
<br />
But, as mentioned before, it really doesn't matter.  Thats the great thing about the shaman class.  <br />
<br />
Sure, people can post all the times their cannibalize helped them... however, I haven't been exposed to AA abilities very much.  I only have 2 points anyway.  I'm not even in a small guild that does stuff with 10-12 people.  In fact, the likelihood that I'll even get 1 class AA ability is slim to none due to the incredibly small amount of time I put into EQ anymore.    So it makes more sense to me to put points into something that will be more fun than something that might be the &quot;best&quot; (ie most popular).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Hey, Talamay, since you're not going to go right for cann 5 so you're not constricted by having to get 12 lame points in mental clarity, might I suggest Spell Casting Mastery instead of Spell Casting Reinforcement?  The benefits of Spell Casting Mastery look OUTSTANDING.<br />
<br />
I just got finished with mass cann, and I was seriously debating whether to put my saved points into Quickbuff 1 or two points into Spell Casting Mastery.  It was a really tough decision.<br />
<br />
I'm commited to my 3.0 second torpor now...it's taken me 7 months to get 26 points, the thought of having to get 15 more for Quickbuff 3 is a little daunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">glori,<br />
<br />
spell casting mastery looks good, yes.  however, spell casting reinforcement  is required for spell casting reinforcement mastery, which is my second class AA goal after quick buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Originally posted by Talamay Crystalspirit <br />

Regen 3 (6)<br />
Run Speed 3 (6)<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 (12)<br />
Quick Buff 3 (18)<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery 1 (8)<br />
<br />
50 pts<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting closer run 3 and regen 3 are only 3 points each tho =)<br />
<br />
I can definitely see the benifit of quick buff as far as torpor goes. Faster casting is definitely better. I would argue tho that Cann V is more effective than SCRM and at a cheaper cost too. The idea behind SCRM is to make torpor last longer so it heal's more and is more efficient right? Well you can easily afford to cast Torpor a second time with all the mana you get back from Cann V. Sure there is some cast time on it but since your going for quickbuff also that time is reduced too.<br />
<br />
Another thought is with quick buff and how they stack with caster focus effects. Enhancement haste items like the shissar ring and such work with all out buffs except for torpor. Currently I've got quickbuff 1 and the shissar ring and the reduced cast time on Focus, group focus and other buffs is very nice. I plan to get quick buff 2 next which will max out the reduction at 50% for everything except focus. Focus since it's only effected by the aa skill will be at a 25% reduction. I can't however see spending 9 points on quickbuff 3 just to get the effect on torpor. As nice a spell as it is, as nice as a 3 sec cast time would be it just isn't worth 9 aa points for just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Yeah, Taraddar, I have enhancement haste III on an earring and I'm torn about the whole 9 points for 3.0 second torpor. Especially if I get a spell haste III item which will stack with the Quickbuff AA skill and will nearly cap torpor.<br />
<br />
But, I figure I have 6 more points to worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Juujuu, thanks for the advice!<br />
<br />
I would love to get those upgrades you are talking about, but upgrading has never been easy for me.<br />
<br />
That being said, my jewelry would be fairly easy to upgrade since we have a high-level jewler in my guild.  I've always been afraid to replace rings because that is a huge WIS hit, but as you said, it's not total WIS, it's how efficiently you can get it back.<br />
<br />
Helm might not be too hard.  DN not that tough of a place and if I could figure out where to start that quest with Rolaids in WL or whatever his name is, I could probably get that.<br />
<br />
Arms won't be too tough.  Just requiers camping The Grey.  Course, then again, maybe it will be harder than I thought; like everything else on my server, nameds in Grey are pharmed all the time.<br />
<br />
Belt and Back will probably be hardest for me.  Kael quests are out of the question since I am on dragon faction, and Lodi is perma camped on our server.  Heiro Cloak is slightly more realistic, but I have that book for the Cloak of Truth sitting in my bank I want to cash in on some day.<br />
<br />
As for shoulders, if I can grab some IGSs alone I'll be happy.  When you say &quot;WW mantles&quot; do you mean mantles dropped off of named WW mobs?  Because if so, those are out of the question, too, as I am on dragon faction.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I can keep dreaming . . . :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Rodahn, for the back slot consider Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak (ac 20, hp 25).  Pretty easy to get from SG, and not very expensive if you just want to buy one.  Also, IGS is easily obtainable by a single group.  Without Torpor, you'll want to drag a cleric along, but you can do all the crowd-control yourself if you don't have a bard or enchanter handy.  Add in a couple of melees and someone to evac you out, and go beat up the area prior to the city.  IGS drop like candy there some nights (lots of golems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">IGS drop like candy??  Criminy, I've spent a ton of time in the Hole killing hundreds of golems, and I've seen ONE IGS drop - and it dropped from a ratman guard (or warrior).<br />
<br />
Anyway, you wouldn't need a group, just camp the single golem spawn before the dropoff if you really want it.<br />
<br />
Personally, the Deathwatcher Shroud seems better to me.  Off a corrupted elysium in UP.  <br />
<br />
Get a Crystalline Torque for mana perservation III on your neck slot.  <br />
<br />
Get a Coldain Military Wristband for extended affliction III on your wrist.  You can do it solo, but certainly easier with a friend helping ferry a level 1 troll warrior worshipping rallos zek about.  Also we had to clear Shardtooth (who sees invis) get the mule to the Broodmother.  <br />
<br />
Chardok earrings have 35 hp and there are two that shaman can wear, assuming you don't get the new cabbage quest earring.  <br />
<br />
Cazic Thule has a number of great earrings, but no idea on how hard or how common those are.</div></div><hr />

Check out my profile, it might help you with some gear choices (yes, I'm too lazy to make simple suggestions when it's all right there in a profile =P). I'm an Iksar, so I've had to rule out a few gear choices due to the &quot;Iksar can't wear stuff that resembles plate&quot; lameness. Pretty much everything I'm wearing is easy to obtain, and balances out for some decent +Wis and +AC/HP.<br />
<br />
The Chitinous Belt especially you can get for ~500-1k, due to ED's farmage of Lucid Shards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">This thread is quite interesting and first off must say that the enhanced torpor route appears interesting. personaly i am plowing for canni5, partialy cause i know it will be usefull because of the posistion i am in.  I am in a high end raid guild and we only have two shamans, yeah its a lot of work sometimes but quite fun.  I dont know how many times i have been spot healing on a big mob (king T, yelinak, and others ) and thought to myself jeez i m 95% health but is there is no time to canni (sometimes the longer cast time of cann4 is gonna drive me nuts)  i know canni5 would be soooo helpful in a situation like this.  But then again i am in my own shoes not yours, pretty well off gear wise and can take a cann5 unbuffed and have a few hundred HP to spare.<br />
<br />
The arguments for canni5 i go right along with, and i respect the argument for better torpor, but the biggest thing for me is when stuff goes bad and i need to chain heal will i have time to canni ?<br />
<br />
well my two cents of rambling and ps henora i need to look into those potions looks very very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I have group focus, and I am the guildleader and usually only 60th shaman on our raids. I went with canni first for the simple fact that it helps me get AA quicker. It has helped on raids and all the stuff that everyone here states too, but honestly even with no clarity at all - it cuts my downtime soloing considerably. <br />
<br />
And on raids - I have much more mana now and just single focus all melees. <br />
<br />
I went the traditional route of run3/regen/mc3/canni, and have been looking into what next. Mass group buff will be nice for wipes but I am thinking that helping Torpor improve would help a lot too ;) <br />
<br />
I hate the fact that a lot of the focus items don't stack optimally with AA due to caps. Flip side of that is I can simulate some of the AA skills by getting the focus items and try before I buy sorta deal. <br />
<br />
Interesting thread for pros and cons of different paths.... have been checking it since it started up, and will probably keep reading until it dies down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Till you have Can 5 you can think...gosh I really do not need is since Can 4 is so nice and I really do not have torpor yet to complement it with....<br />
<br />
Been there done that had the same thought....<br />
<br />
Then I reached 5 AA pts, had done run3&gt;&gt;&gt;mc3 (I like my mana coming back a bit faster) and was not sure what to do.   So I took the plunge (before anyone really started harming out the line to follow) into Can 5 (rabid bear was cool but 144 min reuse...blow me VI).   It was like someone switched on a mana battery suddenly in me.  I never below 40 mana, I now have torpor so healing back is insane, soloing is nuts (ebolt/bon continuously), raids are by far much easier (4 pts from mass group buff so group focus is used heavily...not an issue with Can 5) and I would say I am 3-4x more effective than I was before with that insane mana regen.  No one has that regen like us.   Trust me once you get it you will say....well crap why did I avoid this skill for so long?   <br />
<br />
Btw if you do go with Can 5 I suggest you start building up HPs over mana pool.   I am now at 2800 HPs (4200 on raids) selfbuffed (focus, sta, primal essence) and working hard to get to 3-3.2K self buffed for that real nice big safety factor for chewing.  I have lost about 200 to my mana pool but that is a drop in the bucket compared to what Can 5 replenishes at.   Oh my AC self buffed is 1200ish and on raids breaks 1250 so you can go for hps w/o losing too much ac.<br />
<br />
Now back to Can 5ing and watching my mana soar!</div></div><hr />

Oh, I'll get it eventually.  But in my current situation (i.e. no Torpor, not many HPs, and the fact that I mostly solo/small group), it's just not much use to me.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get more HP gear.  Got a 6/65 ring tonight and am trying to get my hands on a Shadel Ring.<br />
Other upgrades are proving to be more difficult.  Once I get them, however, I will get Cann5.  Right now I am focusing on either getting Mental Clarity 3 (to prep for Cann5) or Quick Buff.<br />
