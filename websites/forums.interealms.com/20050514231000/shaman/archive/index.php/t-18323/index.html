<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not really sure what to search for so I thought I would just post a new one ...<br />
<br />
I am 59 and having a blast for the most part.  I am very happy with my new main because of what we can do ..<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
Yeah there always has to be one unless your a drood ... From 55+ finding exp groups has become pretty hard to come by because everyone wants to do LDoN, which is understandable.  I would rather solo or find/make an exp group at this time because I find that LDoN is ok exp while your actually on the mission, overall for the amount of time the exp is horrid.  I am trying very hard to focus on exp and lvling than AA's and loot.  <br />
<br />
So should I solo or find groups ... well my answer has been solo because most groups out there &lt; 60 usually stick to tier1 and that means anyone or all the people in the group could be 50 for all you know and if they try tier 2, well lets just say I cross my fingers.  Maybe I have been unlucky lately but for the most part people 50-65 are either with their guild raiding, soloing or in LDoN.  the rest &lt; 62 are trying very hard to find stuff to do, like me.  I don't know but it seems most of these people including myself suck collectivly =)<br />
<br />
So thats why I try to solo .. which leads me to my real question ... For the most part I have been the buffer/slower with the ability to toss a good dot or heal from time to time, but have never been considered the main dps in any group I have ever been in.  I have been trying to solo in some planers spots on the yard trash and while 1 for 1 I can kill a lot of stuff but the amount effort going into killing one mobs is hard per % exp.  Most mobs I tackle use 80-90% of my mana .. sometimes all of it.  So that means to me that my specialization doesn't help my soloing, and my effort per kill is higher than the exp I get .. &gt;&gt; I'm not an effective killer &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
So what should I do .. go for quanity over quality?  I'm sure I could kill a bunch of frogs pretty quickly in Seb for better exp than it takes to kill one tier 1 mob SOLO and seb might actully be fun.  Or should I keep trying for a good exp group?  Maybe switch specialization?  Buffing isnt a critical thing and is mostly done in the down times and when I hit 60+ Ill have less buffs to cast anyway ... slows 1 or 2 casts per pull .. and not too much mana needed for them ...<br />
<br />
Has anyone switched their specialization?  Does this make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well i know what you mean about switching specializations but i have no numbers on how that might help you. Also my browser not working today cant pull up your magelo. Do you have any Mana pres items or Burning affliction items? <br />
<br />
  What mobs are you fighting more specifically? 59 can be a little tough and as you gain a lvl or two more those same mobs your fighting now might be alot easier. Mix in some mana pres or a boost to your dots might make life alot easier. Do you have cann4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;I'm sure I could kill a bunch of frogs pretty quickly in Seb for better exp than it takes to kill one tier 1 mob SOLO and seb might actully be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
IMO, &quot;fun&quot; is the operative word here.  I'm not a log parser or able to crunch fancy numbers in a single bound, but I screwed up a long long long time ago and made evocation my primary specialization.  I never went back and fixed it and really I dont see how this is hurting me.  Also remember that even tho you are soloing alot right now, when you hit 65 you may be grouping only.  Maybe you'll join an uber guild, find a good group of friends to play with regularly, do pick up groups exclusively, you never know whats around the next corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understand what you are going through.  I personally can't stand LDoN, and have only done 4 adventures to date.  All within the first couple of days after the expansion came out.  I tried to solo some tier 1 mobs.  I normally enjoy Plane of Nightmare, usually have fun there.  At the time, I was getting groups for the sole purpose of gathering items for night terror chain sleeves, which have since been upgraded to hurricane.  A few times I got froggy, and decided to try my hand at solo'ing.  This was prompted by a drood in my guild talking smack for being able to solo yard trash there.  So I gave it a go.  I ended up with around 5-10M left, around 10-15% life, and no dog.  Dog died fairly quickly.  I have tried to hone some tactics on them, (tree's, spiders, ravens) but it seem's that I would pull with slow, root, DoT, canni, canni, canni, root, dot, send in dog when root broke and needed to canni, heal dog, canni, heal dog, canni, dog dead, root, dot....well, you get the point.  Although, I have learned a TON about playing my shammy from these boards over the past couple of months, and I will be trying again to take these mobs.  I did have much better luck with rats, goo's, and an occasional mosquito in Po Disease though.  Maybe you should try your hand there?  Anyhow, I would like to see other shaman who remember lvl 59ish post tactics for solo of these area's.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">About LDON,  do you not like doing LDON or do you not like sitting LFG?  I personally love LDON adventures, because once you have a cleric and shaman, the rest of the group falls into place.  I never sit LFG unless I want a tier2 group.  If I want to do LDON, I pull up LFG window, find the cleric that is cooling his heals, then build the group from there.  A shaman and cleric fill all the non-dps needs for an ldon group.  Pick up a tank or 2 which are always LFG and any 2 others and you are set.  10 minutes max to get an LDON group.  Also, now that collections are worth doing, Ive never needed more than 5 minutes to get a worthwhile mission.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm also lvl 59, and i've been wondering about changing specialisation from alteration to conjuration for a while now, as i used to solo quite a bit.  I honestly don't think that's the source of you're problems though, and i can't see that it would have any great affect, though i may be wrong and know very little about that.<br />
I've been soloing yard trash in PoN/PoI/PoJ since around lvl 53, and although it used to take a lot of mana i don't find that tends to be much of a problem anymore.  Sure, it takes a while and my dps is crap, but i've kind of got used to that over the last 50 odd levels.<br />
My equipment is pretty poor, no epic, no jbb, no pox, no regen, only ft1 from solstice earring, burning affliction from coldain bracelet, but i still find i tend to end the fight with 60-80 mana, after stacking plague, eb and bane of nife for however many minutes the fight takes.<br />
I'd be interested to know what mob's you were fighting and what tactics/spells you were using though.  Only advice i can really offer is to get canni IV if you dont have it, try to find a Virtue and KEI before you start though it's easily possible without these, just takes slightly more mana, or partner with a monk/bl.  i've done that once at ww in PoN and we could chain pull without any problems, even with adds.<br />
I've always been suspicious of seb, since i tried soloing there and i died on my first pull, bloody frog had sow and root broke near the end of the fight.  Unfortunatley i was stoicism-ed and couldnt keep up to reapply root :)  d'oh.  good luck there though, you should be ok unless you're as stupid as me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What tactics are you using to solo? My 58 shaman does pretty well solo'ing in PoN on yard trash. I pull with Malosini, then Immobilize, then Turgur's, then summon my drogmor and start root-rotting. If root breaks due to the DD on the dot's, I finish refreshing any dot's that are down and reroot, and back away. This works pretty well, netting me something around 8% of a level an hour, maybe more, with a KEI buff. It's not great, but I can do it while LFG is up. I don't even bother using dogdog here, as having to heal him constantly isn't worth the damage he can do. Keep the mob rooted, and slowed in case root breaks, and you don't have to heal hardly at all, except to help with canni'ing. Tanking in PoP is a very bad idea pre-Torpor, I think. A drogmor/horse and KEI help a ton, of course. <br />
<br />
VL is a good spot to solo, I think, if you can find the floor level mostly uncamped. I did that some at L 57 and found it quite easy. The mobs don't hit hard, so you can use dogdog to tank, while you meditate, if you moderate your dot'ing. I found I could typically slow (maybe malise of some sort first), dot, root, and med, while dog tanked. Eventually root would break, but the dog would tank the majority of every fight and not need much healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your best bet is to sit LFG in POV and hope for a group, tier 1 zones at lvl 59 give very little xp.  If you can find a necro partner, duoing frogs in POS is great also.<br />
<br />
When u ding 60, POV becomes even better (if you have malo) and you will normally have mobs slowed as they are arriving at the camp.<br />
<br />
Grouping is the way to go, turn on LFG straight away when you log in and check out POV and POS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alteration isn't just buffs.  Its malx, it's slow, it's healing (including torpor).  Alteration will always be your bread and butter.  I consider shamans lucky to *have* such a clear-cut specialization choice.  I know that when soloing (which is rare for me, I dislike it), I get a lot more out of my alteration spec than I would anything else.<br />
<br />
Just to add to that.  Alt spec will save your bacon.  When things go wrong, and there are 5 extra critters on your hands, slowing them all will be FAR more important than ... say... dotting them all.<br />
<br />
I'd check your magelo, but they're down (of course magelo's down, it's not a full moon) - but I'd say you're better off checking some of the ideas on this site regarding maximizing your DPS.<br />
<br />
I despise the wasted time organizing LDoN groups, too, but looking back, I've wasted a lot of time with normal groups in the past, as well.  And when you get that group that races through 3 dungeons in 3 hours... well, it kind of makes up for some of the dogs.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN xp is slow 55-59 but I lot of people still do it because it's fun.  I found all xp to be slow at that range.  Personally I find it ungodly boring to sit in one of the planes in one spot pulling safe singles repeatedly - it literally puts me to sleep.  Soloing is equally boring to me - you can't fight as fun of critters and it takes forever to kill.  I have good gear and spells and I'd still rather do any type of grouping over soloing.  You start gaining decent adventure points at that level for LDoNs, which is more of a motivating factor for most LDoNers I group with than xp - since we're all looking to open up some big LDoN armor/augs/etc.<br />
<br />
I love LDoN but I'd get quickly burnt out if that's all I did...so mix up LDoNing with some duoing with my BL bro (shaman + BL is a wicked duo) and a little bit of planes or pickup grouping in loot zones.  I think I soloed once from 51-60 for about 20 minutes.  I find it easy to get groups.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
I will say that the 50's in general are an exercise in pain for xp.  I hit 60 over the weekend and I'm already almost 61 - xp flies in 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Check out Veksar and Nurga.  Both have kunark-era mobs with a very nice ZEM.  Bind yourself outside Nurga for quick access to both.  I also spent a LOT of time in CoM at that level (another zone with old mobs and a high ZEM).<br />
<br />
59 is the absolute worst level of all for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am happy? to see my other brothers and sisters with the same problems =)<br />
<br />
I do have Coldian wrist so BFIII<br />
FT1<br />
REGEN +5 (3 from AA and regen2 ring)<br />
I have cann4 and use it a lot<br />
I do have JBB (I think I would rather be medding that casting this LONG cast timing thingy, only use for finishing)<br />
I have no Epic (need tear)<br />
<br />
I have been root rotting for the most point .<br />
<br />
LDoN is ok .. just not the best place to find good consistant exp.  From start to finish LDoN I bet takes 2-3 hours LFG to split and thats only 90 minutes of fighting = 10-15%.  I bet grouped in PoV would net a lot more for 2-3 hours worth of consistant fighting OH and I can take a potty break.<br />
<br />
I like groups and when I have more than 2 hours to play I try to get them .. I like soloing sometimes when I dont have that much time .. I am a big believer in time management and want to maximize what I am doing at all times.  <br />
<br />
My original post was asking the question (please guess or suggest) if I switched mt specilization to Conj would I be able to solo a lot better &lt;&gt; med &lt;&gt; slightly better.  I know Alteration is very import for the above suggestion about slows but I don't buy into the buffing and big guild ideas.  No one waits for shaman buffs .. and unless I'm MGBing focus to be over written by virt or 9 or some other buff ... why bother ... also if there are more than 3 groups .. there is a good chance there will be another shaman.  I hope no one relies on my healing =)  thats what Droods are for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Velnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm currently 57, but with the help of my 63 mage buddy we have been duoing hobgoblins in PoN. It's kinda slow with just the 2 of us put it's pretty nice exp. <br />
<br />
I would think that a 60+ necro or BL pet could tank them too but i personally don't have any experience duoing with either of two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personally I dont understand how you can Hate LDon. I understand play styles differ, but the bottom line is this: THE XP ROCKS! You dont havr to wait on a group, try to put one together yourself! If you see a cleric grab it! Then the rest will be easy. I found that the wait is no longer and alot of times less than getting into a tier 2 group, due to the limited number of camps in PoS and PoV per player ratio.<br />
<br />
I garuntee if you suck it up and do LDOn you will find that hunting here is awesome noone gets in your way and wih focus, you can excell rather fast. Also I alot of times will pick up a group that wants top do 3-4 adventures at once<br />
<br />
As far as solo, I like to solo the Stalkers in PoN but as you say it will take most of your mana. Down time = missed possible XP.<br />
<br />
Thats what I love about LDON no in ADV downtime. If you control your environment you wont waste much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Didn't really seem like he was saying he hated LDoN per se, but that his experience with it was that start to finish it was taking him 2-3 hours for 10-15% exp, when solo he was getting 8% an hour. If it's 2 hours start to finish, at least for me that small exp loss is worth the loot gained, but the original poster said all they were looking for was max exp.<br />
<br />
I know that I stopped soloing for exp when I ding'd 57 doing Chardok entry ramp. I tried soloing a little in Droga, but still have trouble even with the entry mobs (FM Entrance that is)using what I consider an unacceptable amount of HP/mana  per kill to be effective at 59 (Have BoN, working on Anamatha, no Epic no Pox) and seems like 75% of mobs are casters, the SK mobs suck.<br />
<br />
PoD courtyards are still pretty good exp up to level 61...the bulks are all 55-57 level range I believe, so you get the exp bonus for within 5 levels of yours there, and of course PoS/PoV are very nice exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LDoN is ok but I try to apply what other people have said about waiting .. When I solo (if I can find a decient spot) I normally put up LFG.  I think I have determined that Tak is the &quot;best&quot; dungeon to get chain drops and points, so if they say Hey wanna do Tak you will be the 6th 9 times out of 10 I will say sure!  I just hate being asked wanna .. and then when I get there its just the 2 of us .. /sigh  Part of me wants to ask how many people do you have?  is one a cleric/druid?  Umm well let me know when the group is full =)  But I think that kinda rude so I usually avoid LDoN.  The 30+ minute wait to start an adventure makes me so irksome!! &lt;&lt; haha<br />
<br />
LDoN exp ROCKS when your 65 and after AA exp = 50% ... exp at 55-59 with 20% going to AA is 10-15exp per run.  (I think thats accurate)<br />
<br />
Veksar = poisen dots dont work .. does PoX?<br />
Nurga = casters = dead shaman =) Seriously how bad is this place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Focus stacks with Virtue and 9 (They just don't stack with each other).<br />
2. If you're 59, you don't have Khura's Focusing yet, how would you be able to MGB it?<br />
<br />
Edited to add second point. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Veksar - at your level you should only worry about soloing the goblins at the entrance.  12 - 15 spawns, turn light blue at 62 I think.  Poison/Disease/etc all works great on these guys.<br />
<br />
Nurga - it's identical to Droga but lower level.  <br />
<br />
re: changing your specialization - don't recommend it.  I personally dont think it will change your soloing results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Toktuk .. I ment in the future if I was every to join a raiding guild .. been a while since I played with my 65 toons ... so foret what stacked witrh what .. thanks for reminding me =)<br />
<br />
Snap .. Veksar goblins are a joke and really I am trying to go for quality over quanity .. plus those freaking shaman suck =)  I actually 2 box so buffing my tank is important as well as heals.  The higher up in lvl I get the less I want to box .. get way to distracted  .. I am getting to old I guess or I just need to teach my 3 year old how to play =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Due to an 'exp fix' that went into effect a few months ago, soloing in Any of the PoP planes does not garner as much exp as it once did.  If you are going to go to PoP, take at least one wother person with you.<br />
<br />
Im going to recomend VL, Droga or Nurga to solo, with Veksar not far behind.  Mobs hit harder in the revamped Droga and Nurga, and always hit hard in Veksar (and Veksar mobs have tons of HP).  VL, on the other hand, is relativly low hp low damage mobs.  PLEANTY to kill there as well.  Solo in Kael as well.</div></div><hr />
