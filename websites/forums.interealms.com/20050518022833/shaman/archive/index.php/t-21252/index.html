http://www.guildwars.com    play NEXT WEEK<br />
<br />
interestingly, aside from Bill Roper and the Schaefer brothers, the guys at arenanet were the most influential young programmers and designers for Blizzard's successes going back to Diablo and WC2.  for all those saying Blizzard makes good games, never drops the ball etc should check it out.  these guys helped in large part to shape that conception<br />
<br />
obviously... the following observation has to be made: for all those morons who equate battlenet = WoW.  this time for the first time it's true heh... no fee to play.  I'm sure the game will be secure but this game is going to be HUGE.  for us old timers it's sort of the anathema to what we hold on as &quot;old&quot; eq... this game looks to have stripped all elements of RPG from the genre... team Unreal Tournament for fantasy settings with a some measure of character and skill development... still looks like skill is finally going to be important in pvp.  I'm going to predict this game will have massive sales but prepare for l33t idiots all over these servers<br />
<br />
still... look at the crew manifest.  this group looks good.. they've hired the right brilliant programmers and dont seem to have their heads up their asses... a TON of artists and level designers off the bat for content<br />
<br />
look at the art.  it's the first 3rd generation mmpog with art that looks good.  for all those of you OOHng and AHing over the crappy art in EQ2 and vanguard... THIS is what fantasy-themed 3d game art should look like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">those screenshots were amazing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its been said before, the reason these MMORPGs dont have such good graphics is because what happens when you turn the corner and face 70 mobs that look brilliant? your computer blows up, thats what happens<br />
<br />
but i'll agree.. it does look quite good.. now ive got 3 mmo's to choose from :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah graphics look great. a cross between WoW immersiveness and detail and Lineage character models.   looks like the engine graphics engine got a complete overhauled from last year's E3... it was MUCH more Warcraft 3 looking... even with the same health bar overhead on the mobs<br />
<br />
next week 12-14 is a SNEAK PEAK for this game...  if you're the unlucky ones not in WoW beta or with a CoH account check it out.<br />
<br />
the screens almost look TOO good but they've got an ace art department there... from what I've read guys who worked in the US in PC and console as well as guys from Square Enix and korea.  also remember that the 3 guys who started this company were Lead Programmers when they were developing the WoW engine, the lead network guy at Blizzard, and that each of the 3 founders were the leads on 3 different projects in development (which at the time would include War 3, WoW, Starcraft Ghost) at the time they left to form arenanet<br />
<br />
sounds like the game will have persistant cities so you can socialize, shop, train etc but all the adventure zones will be instanced.<br />
<br />
I really liked NWN when it launched although the mechanics of the game couldn't support a true community and this will take that a step further... by this time next year I'd think in terms of number of players it'll be 1)this game 2)WoW 3) EQ 4)CoH... although of course it's not a very fair comparison since guildwars wont have a subscription fee<br />
<br />
here's what a reviewer had to say: http://www.popcultureshock.com/reviews.php?id=2921<br />
<br />
<br />
What separates Guild Wars from the gamut of online roleplaying games out there? Technical proficiency is a strong starting point. GW is being developed by ArenaNet, an expert development team brought to life by several Blizzard founders: The ex-team lead and main programmer of World of Warcraft, the creator and architect of Battle.net, and the senior programmer of Diablo. Along with an elite roster of artists and programmers groomed at Square Enix, EA, LucasArts and Valve, the all-star ArenaNet team is focused on delivering a beautiful and fast-paced online RPG with an evolving story and absolutely no monthly fee<br />
<br />
<br />
reviewer has arenanet confused with Flagship studios obviously when he talks about &quot;several Blizzard founders&quot; (Bill Roper et al) but the rest of it is accurate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think ill be &quot;sick&quot; next week :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think without the monthly fee the playerbase will be worse. We all like free things, but sometimes its worth paying. Hell i think they should have a mental balance test before you can sign up for games like EQ =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think without the monthly fee the playerbase will be worse.

<br />
To be honest, I noticed no difference between EQ and any of the multiplayer online free games.  Playerbase is largely the same.  Paying SOE my monthly fee didn't really lead to a bug free/hack free environment either, although I do give them credit for taking care of those found hacking and such.  Customer service must be better though, right?  Wrong.  They are basically equal (as in non-existent).  The only difference is the average age is higher in pay for play type games.  However, there are just as many griefers and jerks that are middle-aged as there are teenage &quot;snot nose punks.&quot;  <br />
<br />
So, the get-what-you-pay-for mentality might prove true, but paying for a service does not always guarantee more satisfaction.  If anything, economic principles would lead me to believe not paying would give one more satisfaction :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a lot of players are skeptical how arenanet can pull off this thing without a monthly fee<br />
<br />
well, the short answer is they'll be making less money than soe did with eq... and they wont be able to fund multiple other games out of the pot<br />
<br />
people tend to be conservative in their outlooks so a lot of players hold the assumption now that subscriber-based MMPOG is the only way to go.  but this is not so.  the game that set the revenue model that most MMPOG now operate was Ultima Online in 97.  it's safe to say that kelly flock would have pulled the plug on EQ in 98 if it weren't for the success of this revenue model of selling a box THEN a monthly fee THEN hardware upgrade fees (for new servers and server upgrade) through expansions.  but as close as the weeks of beta there was a furious debate whether UO should a)go with a monlthy subscriber fee with no upfront charge for the game b)monthly fee and also a box charge c)monthly fee and reduced box charge d)no monthly fee just box fee e)no monthly fee no box fee just a large one time subscription fee ($100 or so at the time) etc etc<br />
<br />
the decision was made to go with b to maximize profits.  they didn't know whether anyone would actually pay to play this huge amount per year but OSI was willing to do the bet... as even within the Ultima franchise Ultima Online was just a small segment thus small gamble<br />
<br />
of course this lead to HUGE massive profits since the service basically costs zero to run BUT it's clearly NOT the only tenable way to run a MMPOG.  sounds like arenanet expects higher gross units to be sold with no fee and perhaps also lower costs through more porous retention (people dont play as much or as long)<br />
<br />
of course this revenue model is much less profitable but if you look at an actual competitive landscape (as opposed to the captive one EQ enjoyed for years) it's probably a more realistic one for a small company's first game<br />
<br />
look where all those massive profits got sony... they used the warchest to bloat EQ2 to a 25 million budget in a lengthy development cycle that turned over the entire team a number of times.  they bought out OSI's entire austin studio and funded the development of pie-in-the-sky SWG.  paid for the entire development of planetside.  countless other side projects and useless extentions of EQ<br />
<br />
point is, no company needs such huge profits to the point they dont know what to do with the windfall warchest... hunger and nimbler companies who have to actually work for their revenue might have never delivered LoY or GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting point.  Revenue blown is as good as revenue never earned at all.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take a genius to blow money, so Sony was well-qualified to tackle the project.</div></div><hr />
