I am guessing next step they will start putting the logo on the shields and armors, or on the flags in town.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do you go about petitioning when you get a bad pizza?<br />
<br />
Are there GM's at Pizza Hut?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">...special sheild with Pizza Hut logo, focus: reduce consumption rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was thinking about this some more....<br />
<br />
They could put a pizza hut shop in each city of norath with NPC waiters.  You click on the NPC like a merchant and you get a list of pizza's you can have delivered.  They could have a note function for special toppings.  While we are at it, the list could include beer, soda, or anything else!  <br />
<br />
Payment would be setup like paypal.  you can have your checking account (or credit card) tied to the system or just dump X amount of cash into a holding account for you to buy against.  <br />
<br />
SOE could recover some of the cost for the programing by charging advertising fees for putting pizza hut logo's in the game!<br />
<br />
Wouldnt we all want to see our favorite delivery place advertising in EQ!  All those unused buildings could now have a real function!<br />
<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />

Any SOE employees who might read this.... I AM NOT SERIOUS!  I do NOT want advertisers in my fantasy game.</div></div><hr />

Buahahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For those of you freaking out there does not appear to be any in game advertising. It is just a command that opens up a web browser when you type it in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">so... what webpage opens up when you type /girls ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">so... what webpage opens up when you type /girls ??<br />
When you type that, your computer shuts down, your EQ account is cancelled and they automatically apply to several jobs for you.</div></div><hr />

Did any of those jobs work out for you? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">oops lol didn't see this thread.<br />
<br />
I think SoE are doing anything and everything to get people into eq2. I mean it tells of a desperate mmorpg when it has to offer a 1 year trial to the masses(the trial is only the isle only), and now this. Would the original eq or WoW have to resort to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did any of those jobs work out for you? :p<br />
I wasn't attacking you, I was afraid you'd take it that way. I was just making a joke about eq in general. The &quot;you&quot; in that post was the &quot;one&quot; you not the &quot;you&quot; you, if you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I thought that you were joking, so was I... both times.  :)   I think that the whole thing is funny...  I mean pizza(or wanting pizza) and EQ kinda go hand in hand... seems humorous to me that they would have a command like that in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
if only I could rig up someway to let the pizza man in with out getting up off my seat....<br />
