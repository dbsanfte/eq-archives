<br />
I am finding it quite sad that there are comparable and even much better weapons out there right now - let alone the items that will come forth from PoP.<br />
<br />
An upgrade through new questing would be very welcome. Epic swords should not end up in backpack - they should be anyone's pride to wear as class only *hard work* items !<br />

With the PoP comeing out soon it is a romer that there will be a new quest for your epics(like a upgrade). Plus there may be new lookings on the epics. Really i think our epic should look a little better cause I mean hey, who are the rushers in raids that usally die first huh lol!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katalaeia</div><div class="date">10-12-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or go back to making it a guaranteed drop...<br />
<br />
but it would have to be on a triggered mob like the new cleric deal with Rage :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treece Oakheart</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This issue has been raised many times about the SEOC.<br />
<br />
It is wrong that it does not drop off Innoruuk considering that is what the quest claims.  As the planes are on a booking only system on my server and the chances of getting a booking are on a 14 to 21 day basis, I find that my efforts are far from being rewarded.<br />
<br />
Something should be done where by you hand in an item to a NPC who is in Innoruuks Throne room.  By doing this, it calls Innoruuk to battle.  This Innoruuk can be full strenth with no God loot for all I care, but there are plenty of Rangers out there now, all waiting for the SEOC.<br />
<br />
Rangers UNITE - If them self-righteous Cleric Bastards can cry foul, so should we.  Time to move Verants hand to fix this issue.<br />
<br />
;) I am done - Sorry ;)</div></div><hr />

but oh thats right i just thought of something...you've never been KS'ed for a SEOC and had to start your epic over again...</div></div><hr />

We dont get the chance as I explained.  Though I am sure if it were possible some mug would have.</div></div><hr />

If someone asked me which to change, RNG or CLR epic, I'd say CLR every time.  What they went through was ridiculous in comparison with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind Dniwkwak</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should make it so Inny would drop 2 stones every single time, like VSR. I mean, the quest says that the SEoC drops off Inny because he's all evil and crap, right? So if he doesn't drop it, he isn't corrupt and evil? Doesn't really fit the story that well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because an item is called &quot;epic&quot; does not mean it is supposed to be the best weapon you can use. That is sorta ridiculous, especially since it is an item from the very first expansion. Things have to get better as you progess through the game. This is why VI will probably never put in an actual &quot;epic&quot; quest again. People whined and bitched that they should be the best when it wasn't the hardest thing to obtain, and especially when it was outdated by content that was exponentially more difficult in the expansion after it. I really don't think VI wants to go through that again.<br />
<br />
That said however, I do support them expanding the quests in PoP - just don't bitch if it's not the absolute best item out there, because unless it is the hardest thing to obtain (which means most people wouldn't see it for a long, long time), it shouldn't be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelgadis</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would hate to see people in common inexperienced unadvanced guilds with swords that are like 25 damage, 15 delay, +100 stats and a super damaging/beneficial effect... all in exchange for both epics, a flawless rat squeaker, and an Eye of Orc... when the said guild isn't even capable of North ToV, Akheva Bosses, or even Trakanon.  Talk about being fair.<br />
<br />
/em waits for people to jump him about not having enough play time to match or join super high end guilds/uber guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">logolas</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have had swiftwind since last winter...been to every single raid my guild has done in hate...killed inny once...killed demi's countless times...no SEoC.  the best solution would be a turn in mob that spawns a dude (inny maybe)...that drops one or two of our stones every single time.  that way the wait for stones will start to go down some...my guilds is forever behind me lol....like 5 other people waiting just needing stone...and as a guild we only have 5 epics for us rangers...5 stones in all the history of hate dropping for us (well 6 but one guy left).  you cant tell me you only have 5 epic clerics in your guild hehe.</div></div><hr />
