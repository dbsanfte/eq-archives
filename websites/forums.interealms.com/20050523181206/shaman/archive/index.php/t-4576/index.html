<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings everyone!<br />
<br />
Haven't been playing Everquest in over two years now, played a druid on the Veeshan server for about a year, but quit due to the neglection of my studies, some of you must know how that feels :D.<br />
<br />
Anyways, school is working out fine for me now, and since i've also quit the grand fiasco that is Dark age of Camelot i've decided to start playing Everquest again :)<br />
<br />
I will be playing a Shaman on the Luclin server with some close friends, and would like say that this board has been a GREAT help for collecting info and getting me somewhat up to speed :p<br />
<br />
I know Luclin is over of the newer servers, one of my friends is already playing there and he says it's pretty decent, we will prolly fuss around as a wizard/shadowknight/shaman team, me being the shammy, I can't wait :cool:.<br />
<br />
Happy gaming folks!, adios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to the Shaman's Crucible, Nasbin.  Permit me to show you around:<br />
  <br />
Your barkeep is the quiet, but always cordial Sunmoon.  When he says 'no credit' believe him.<br />
Thantu works the other shift.  He runs with them woodelfs you know.  <br />
The kinda crazy looking fellow is Wildaar.  Try not to make eye contact.  Honorably discharged, btw.<br />
There in the corner is our resident hotties, Gloriana and Henora.  Try to make eye contact. <br />
The troll having the argument with the coatrack is Gikk the Unholy.   <br />
That's Zorlac, kinda loud but he buys a round once in a while.<br />
The leezard is Krakster -- ask him about the JBB sometime.<br />
Landragoran there will chew your ear off about how he once tanked Cazic Thule while he guild cleared Fear.  Just nod a lot.<br />
Soupy is in the head I think.  Figures.<br />
Well I'm Barm.  Mostly I hang around for the pretzels.<br />
<br />
Oh and that empty seat there -- we keep that around for Nixx.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good to have you.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, new guy buys...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shoulda played shaman on veeshan.. I'm on veeshan..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nasbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya well, my old account is a mess, if I somehow can get my very old and very VERY lost password back I could be starting up on Veeshan again, hows the social life on that server now? It was pretty hostile when I left, FOH fighting CT etc etc. :p<br />
<br />
Anyways I do have a naked level 54 druid there, could use her to pl the friends heh, but where is the fun in that eh?<br />
<br />

/wave from the Drinal server (Once a proud member of a Danes-only guild that has been disbanded, sadly. We ruled Splitpaw tho.)<br />
<br />
Edit: /cheer for bumping an ancient post :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sarcoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There is quite a few danes on Tunare, too.<br />
<br />
Especially in the (mainly) European guild Tide. Im in Path of the Ancients, though.<br />
<br />
Im playing a 58 Shaman (born in Halas) and is so happy these days over my ding yesterday :D <br />
<br />
Maybe ill hit 60 before 2003 ? If not - its also cool, as the mighty and frustrating exp-race can get tedious if that is what you focus on 24/7. I have more fun sessions, when i &quot;forget&quot; im KEI'ed and go into Permafrost with dogdog and let him sharpen his teeth on the Ice Goblins. Find some Permafrost Snowballs and throw them at people in Bazaar ;)<br />
<br />
I see lots of frustrating people in EQ... Mainly because they cant get into a group - well. Go have some fun on your own, then. Visit all zones in Velious and Luclin. Waltz into Greater Faydark, in Bearform and hit all the newbies with haste, sow and HoS... Catch some fresh fish in the sea. Travel the world. Solo a dragon - whatever. But have fun....<br />
<br />
lol.. sorry. This thread was about Danes playing eq - and look where i'm heading... Well - back on topic :<br />
<br />
I live in Helsingør near Kronborg, but born and raised in Copenhagen (its still my city)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see me online - threw a /tell after me...<br />
