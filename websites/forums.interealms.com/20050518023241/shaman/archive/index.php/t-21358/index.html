<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are a couple dozen posts here regarding bst vs. shm.  So, with that information firmly in brain, would you do it?  If, next time you logged in, you were presented with a one-time-only choice (no, you couldn't postpone choosing) to convert your shaman to a beastlord permanently (with all gear - with some replacements, obviously, converted spellbook - character flags, etc intact)... would you do it?<br />
<br />
(obviously this isn't realistic, and I don't think it's remotely likely, but I'm very curious as to the results - since the silent majority often surprises me in anonymous polls)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No i wouldnt .. Do i belive that a beastlord is a stronger more balanced class .. Yes i do .. BUT I signed on too be a Healer &quot;hence I chose a priest class&quot; and a Beastlord would have even less direct healing ability than i currently have ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope - Because I don't see the point of having two of the same class on different servers.<br />
<br />
If I didn't already have a well-leveled Beastlord as my new main, yeah, I'd make Gandwer into a Beastlord. Barbarian chick in leather is hawt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah I think I would, they seem more useful than Shaman at the moment :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I didn't already have a beastlord, probably.  I've been levelling my beastlord to make her my new main precisely because my shaman comparatively sucks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No,<br />
<br />
Just because Beastlords have some characteristics similar to that of shamans and may be better balanced I see no realistic reason to even make such a request.  It's about as absured as asking to become a rouge or any other class just because your unsatisfied IMO.<br />
<br />
I'd just prefer to have the shaman class better balanced plzkthx.  Till then FFXI will be the focus of most of my game time /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Despite the fact that I sometimes make snide remarks about the shaman class compared to the beastlord I'd still say no to converting him. Before I retired for the 3rd time I had my beasty on SZ up to 51 and he was indeed very fun but I really love my shaman. Even though some days can be a frusttrating where you are the only shaman on a raid or with a piss poor XP group I still love the class.<br />
<br />
Even with my very outdated equpiment I could pull off the main healer role in many groups with Q and I've always enjoyed slowing and root parking adds. Buffing is tedious before you get all your group buffs then FA kind of makes it tedious again :) but I do enjoy the multiple roles of buffing, slowing, rooting, hasting and healing especially in a good group that appreciates your abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">err.. no, I have them both right now at 65 and i wouldn't even think about making the beastlord my main.  Too much fun with the shaman and too many things that I can do with him that I wouldn't even begin to think I could do with the beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I voted &quot;no&quot; as well. Despite the need for some tweaking, I'm still enjoying my shaman too much to change over to something else. Besides, if I was gonna switch, I wouldn't switch to a Beastlord. Maybe an enchanter? Not sure, honestly, since I love my shaman too much to change anyways. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got to agree with Donar.  Too much fun right now.  I get much more satisfaction from healing someone or rooting/slowing a couple of adds while the rest of the &quot;shaman-enhanced&quot; group beats the first one down, then be focused on just killing stuff.  I've played melees, always get bored.<br />
<br />
- If I wanted to play a melee, I'd be a rogue or monk.  <br />
<br />
- If I wanted to be just straight dps, I'd be a wizard.  <br />
<br />
- If I wanted to tank, I'd be a warrior or knight.  <br />
<br />
- If I wanted to be a pet class, I'd be a necro or magician.  <br />
<br />
- If I wanted to be a primary healer, I'd be a cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
Not really sure why I'd pick a BST, probably to be versatile, but they are obviously not the best at anything.  We are the best slowers, and arguably buffers/debuffers (no, don't want to have that conversation again), for the most part.  So I'll stay put, thanks.<br />

Seriously, if I was certain there were no more balance changes coming down the pike, yes.  I'm still holding out some hope though, so I guess not (yet).<br />
<br />
---Hows that for wishy-washy?---</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No way. I played a beast to 20 and it bored me to death. Then I played a shaman and haven't stopped since, shaman is way more fun for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No way! Cuz i have both, BL for groups, shaman for raids, yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No.<br />
<br />
They need to up our melee, give us a puppy buff and delete BL's.<br />
<br />
End of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes I would. Only because im tired of my shaman. I play to relax my shaman only frustrates me. Has nothing to do with class balance my problem. Just preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">no,<br />
but not because they arent a better class atm. I have a rogue for dps, a chanter for whacked out gaming wierdness and my shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
the reason you see so many comparisons is because the bst is a hybrid shaman/mage/monk and they do things better than their parent classes almost across the board. its pretty sad when a sub class of Shaman (a BUFF CLASS mind you) has a better reason to get mgb than the parent class does. sure mgb lets you 7th the raid faster and for less mana, Paragon will let you SAVE the raid in some cases and is always useful on a raid thats not trivial content. and the worst part of it is...they still out buff us even if you take pos out of the picture. christ what shaman doesnt want bst crack? hp regen + mana regen? and it STACKS?!!! bleh /end hijack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Overall i think beastlords have become the class shaman were intended to be by verant, though perhpas with a bit more dps and a bit less healing.  They serve the role of a melee healer with buffing and debuffing abilities much like shaman were back in velious and earlier.  The only reason i would consider not changing is because of a personal tie to my shaman, beasts are a better class all around.</div></div><hr />

So, with that information firmly in brain, would you do it? If, next time you logged in, you were presented with a one-time-only choice (no, you couldn't postpone choosing) to convert your shaman to a beastlord permanently (with all gear - with some replacements, obviously, converted spellbook - character flags, etc intact)... would you do it?<br />
<br />
FEK and NO.<br />
<br />
As others have alluded to - fix Shaman.  <br />
<br />
Oh and whoever said their Shaman &quot;frustrates them&quot; - spot on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Casual player here so not run into the high end problems TOO much.<br />
Shaman was my 1st ever toon and probably the most fun 1 too get up to 65.<br />
Ive hit the boredom threshold with him as in sick of BoT,LDoN etc and really cant be arsed to get flagged.<br />
But there is no way in the world i would ever delete him.<br />
Ive deleted other high level chars but just couldnt do it with him,too much sentiment etc linked with him.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, I made the switch to a beastlord a fair while ago now.  I only recently finally got my shaman to 65 (even though he was started 2 years before my beast).<br />
<br />
Whilst I did (and still do ) enjoy my shaman from time to time, I have always have been partial to melee, so a beastlord fit my particular play style better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">NO ... <br />
<br />
NOT A CHANCE ...<br />
<br />
NO WAY IN HELL ...<br />
<br />
gotta add here - this seriously stresses the &quot;there are no stupid questions&quot; theory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">no way<br />
<br />
i personally find beastlords highly over rated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hell will freeze over before I even start to think about this :D<br />
<br />
Even with all the troubles we have in GoD, I won't be a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No way in hell, i even know some ppl who got bored of BL's and rolled to another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wouldn't... it would mean I couldn't come here and annoy people. I'd hate to have to go and re-build a bad reputation on another board. :P<br />
<br />
That and I like grouping with Beastlords to be honest. I also like grouping with enchanters. One day I might group with a druid, just for kicks.</div></div><hr />

Good for you, Grafsha, you just posted under it - what exactly does that say about you (especially since you voted)?<br />
<br />
It's about what I expected.  Though I'm frustrated that I didn't add a third option for &quot;already started a beastlord&quot;.<br />
<br />
The poll from earlier in the year ( http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19432 ) showed about a 30% severe dissatisfaction rate around here.  Things are just about the same - though again, these numbers have the &quot;already made a bst&quot; crowd lumped with the &quot;more satisfied&quot; folks, so not a great representation.<br />
<br />
And to the post above that BST aren't the best at anything, they are - quite arguably - the best pet class.  Situationally of course.   I could be a patch behind, but last I knew, they were preferable to mage pets in many situations (or you could argue their superiority strictly by their pet heals, which blow mages out of the water).  Totally ignoring, of course, the abomination that is enchanter charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Based on SOE's response to shaman issues to date, then hell yes.<br />
<br />
I have ZERO faith today in their ability to address any of our issues.  I'm so tired of being ignored that I'm not going to waste anymore of my energy trying.  I fully expect the GoD trend (low HP, high DPS) to continue which further marginalizes our class.<br />
<br />
Take a peek at my magelo, if I could swap out for equivalent gear and AAs I would switch so fast your head would hum like a ten penny nail hit with a greasy ball-peen hammer.<br />
<br />
YMMV !!!!</div></div><hr />

You think a bst is stronger? Your not a high lvl Bst or you wouldn't be saying that. Your sir are an idiot<br />

Necro gets my vote as best pet class.  Sorry, but BST is still at best second best in any major category.  True, enough seconds make you versatile, but they are not the masters of any primary skill or ability.<br />

Never really needed a shaman either to start a group. In fact you don't ever really need ANYONE.  What you need are the abilites, not the class. <br />
<br />
I made the switch over 2 years ago now.  I had probably the best geared shaman (for that time) on my server.  Know what? Best thing that I ever did..but that is me.  <br />
A question like this is really hard to answer because there are so many factors involved and each of us plays differently than the other, with different ideas of what being succesful/fun is.<br />
<br />
Right now, I am not so sure I want to even continue EQ let alone my BST.  SOE has really taken the fun out of something that was once its own idea and made it into just another game.  I hope they can reclaim some of the things that made EQ special when EQ2 is launched.</div></div><hr />

I never expected to be the best at everything or to be viable in every possible game situation - I don't think any class is that way.  I enjoy what I can do.</div></div><hr />
