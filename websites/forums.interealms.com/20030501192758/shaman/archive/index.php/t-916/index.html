<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey again I just dinged 25 and I want to take up Alchemy. Before I even begin how much money should I save up before attempting to start Alchemy? I want to start it ASAP so I can make some money. I need some steps like the first potions to make how much they cost and where to get the ingredients. Any help will be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heres how to do it:<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is generally accepted as the best way to start alchemy.<br />
<br />
1) wait until lvl 29<br />
2) drop 20 point into alchemy at the guild trainers.<br />
3) start making sow potions...each combine is 5.5 pp so expect to drop 500+ plat the first time.<br />
4) read the boards, there are several *excellent* resources here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like Snapdragn said: you really should wait until 29. At level 25 your alchemy skill is capped at 5. You won't be able to make anything worth selling reliably at this point. Once you get to 29, dump as many training points as you can into alchemy (21 is the max) then start on SOW potions.<br />
<br />
It is VERY expensive. I just started alchemy the other day and I am barely breaking even so far. No &quot;mad plat&quot; yet :)  I can see how it becomes easier to make money once you can reliably make SOW potions - there are buyers everywhere on  my server.<br />
<br />
I would say sit down with 500pp at level 29 and start then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Friends dont let friends start alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will not make money by doing alchemy.  It can be a lot of fun, but only in the sense that doing anything else that's expensive and purely recreational can be fun.  You can find more information at the EQ Traders Learn Alchemy Guide (http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_alchemy.htm) although the &quot;Getting Started&quot; guide is not yet updated for Luclin.  <br />
<br />
If you are absolutely set on starting alchemy right now, I would say that you should start with the Dye Extracts (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm#dyes) which are very cheap if you are hunting creatures that drop the components.  But remember that you can train your skill up to 20 for free if you wait until level 29.  And once your skill is at 20, even if you got it there by making potions, you cannot put training points into it.  No tradeskill can be trained by your guild beyond 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Short description of my trials with potions:<br />
<br />
waited until 29, trained at guild for first 21 pts, then started making sow potions.  Have no idea how much money I spent, but it was a lot.  Once SoW potions trivialed out at 37 (?) I thought I was good to go. spent maybe 1k or so.<br />
<br />
But my success rate was only 60%...for every potion I sold at 100 pp I was making maybe 10 - 15 pp.  And any time I sold to a guildie at 75pp I actually lost money.  I decided to make more difficult potions...I made Cure Poison, Damage Shield, and a few Shrink Potions.  Price per combine jumped from 5plat (Sow) to 7plat (Poision) and 11 plat (Shrink and Damage Shield).  After spending about 2K more, my alchemy was 49.  My success rate on Sow potions was barely over 70%, so I was making *20* plat per sell.  Yippe :(<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, I couldn't sell ANY of the potions that I made...and I tried for a long time.  In fact the cure poison is still in the bank.<br />
<br />
Highly discouraged I stopped making potions, and gave up for a month.  Once I got about 3K in the bank I decided that I would start throwing away (oops I mean 'investing') a hundred plat or so at a time on Sow Potions...<br />
<br />
Ended up getting an order for 3 10dose Shrink Potions, and 2 10d Levitate potions... So I took the plunge, took out 1k plat and just plowed my way through the failures and made the 50 potions he asked for.  At the end of the session my Alchemy was 70.<br />
<br />
My alchemy is still at 70 (trivial for Shrink) and suddenly I can make Sow Potions with 95% success...now I can turn 105 plat into 200 with a bit of work.  However, at my level (42) I am better off heading to TM and getting xp and loot.<br />
<br />
If I ever get an order for a higer difficulty potion, I'll make them and hope for skill ups...but I'm not making any more potions just for the 'fun' of it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alchemy can be fun, so pursue it if you want to.  It's nice, if nothing else, to be able to do self ports to various locations.  Tad bit expensive, but nice...<br />
<br />
When I was in my lower 50's, I hit Alchemy for profit pretty hard... had a decent skill, and would stock up on herbs, run to EC, and sell my wares - SoW, Invis to Undead, Damage Shield were probably the main ones.  Sometimes you sold out fast, sometimes it took quite a while.<br />
<br />
I tracked it one day - I spent 300p on herbs, and when I made/sold all those, I had earned 600p.  So... 300p profit for that day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my skill is 175 (really no point going over 70 in my opinion)<br />
 <br />
I started Alchemy at 32 (where sow potions were Trivial) and at 35 (maxed skill for that lvl) I made mad loot, later in life at about 50 in about 4days (or 20 hours gametime) I made 17k (starting with500) and got myself JBB... after that little potion run I didnt want to see another potion ever! but it was well worth it;<br />
<br />
now I make potions simply for fun and if the guild requires some<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bannek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes now that i have done it , I have determined its a huge waste of time and money. <br />
<br />
To finish maxing skill on titan postion buy components for 10p 5 g and the feeakin vendor buys back for 9gold ***! And you ever try selling those stupid thing to players ha forget it.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing i did learn is some potions that sell back as a one charge potion for like 9gold  or 17plat if they are 10 charge, the trick is even if you uese all the charges in a 10 charge and lave only one charge left you can sell back for 17pp or the same as vendor pays for fully 10 charged potion . that could be interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I loved doing alchemy.  I was hunting in Overthere  and would bind near FM zone.  I would end up running back to FV and get more sow potion supplies.  Then would gate back to Overthere and sell.  I lost a bit of money at first but made it back in a bit.  Sometimes people wanted to haggle, but then I would ask in /ooc about average price of sow potions and why and the person would realize I was selling it at a good price.  Sometimes I got trades for items.  What I like about makign potions is it makes great gifts.  When someone helps me or I got a good group I would hand out a few potions.  While us shaman are  used to sow potions, a warrior, (which I played before shaman) for example, would love the gift as it may just save his life.    Alchemy is a skill I played for fun, not money. But I did make a profit.</div></div><hr />
