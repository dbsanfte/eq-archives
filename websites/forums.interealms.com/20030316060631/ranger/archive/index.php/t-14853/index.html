<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tefanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just wondering if Thorny Vine and Untamed drop in Hate.  I know that those three weps do but I've seen some people say Thorny drops in Fear.  Also, how many times does it take doing to Hate to get some of this stuff.   I just it 47 so I'm wondering cause my guild goes all the time.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thorny Vine drops in fear, has always dropped there since I started playing (June of '99) unless they changed it and never told me =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haunted Chests in PoH can drop pieces of PoF class armor randomly, seems rare-ish though.  Untamed drops rarely (never seen a drop personally) from floor 2 off Agents of Innoruuk.  Rev Whip ( floor 1, rats), Culler  and Nightgrowth Blade (floor 2, random?) are the weapons you're referring to I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuvan Truearrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Planar Armor for Rangers is merely a nast y rumor.<br />
<br />
Kinda like the SEoC.<br />
<br />
It never drops.<br />
<br />
Seriously.  Armor of the Untamed is &quot;supposed to&quot; drop on the second floor, or occasionally from the Haunted Chests in Hate.  Thorny Vine Armor drops from the Tenticle Terrors in Fear.  Nasty dispelling buggers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tefanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks peeps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oatasgai is right on the haunted chests they drop PoF armour so you can get some thorny from them.  Never seen any untaimed drop in my time but it is off teh agents of innoruk on the second floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only piece of Thorny Vine armor that drops in Hate from the haunted chests are the boots. <br />
<br />
I've seen more SEoC's drop in Hate than pieces of Untamed hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have seen Untamed Boots drop in 2nd floor. Once. On the same day, our only pally (lv 47) got his BP and Legs (Hate 2nd floor armor). Boy was he happy.<br />
<br />
Rev whips, expect one or two per raid. Never seen the other weapons drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kysran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have seen 4 EM Chestplates, 1 EM legs, bard legs, and a freaking Untamed BP drop once<br />
<br />
But never seen a SEoC or Rev Whip yet.<br />
<br />
Some peoples luck eh? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From hate i have seen (across about 3 full clearings) 0 TV from chests, 2 Rev whips, 1 pair of Untamed Arms, none of those others weapons you are refering to.... and 1 seoc which i lost to a lvl 46 ranger on her first hate raid :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you couldn't gather it from what others have already said, don't go into Hate hoping for Untamed armor to drop. Unless you like being dissappointed, then by all means get your hopes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've seen one pair of TV boots, 3 pairs of Untamed legs, one pair of Untamed gloves, and two Untamed bracers. This is over some 15 runs to Hate.<br />
<br />
Also seen 3 cullers, 1 nightgrowth blade (yay me on the win!), and too many rat whips to count over the same number of trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kyrviel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One trip, cleared just to Maestro on first floor<br />
<br />
1bard leggings<br />
1bard bp (only one bard on raid, needless to say he was very happy)<br />
0 Thorny Vine anything<br />
0 Untamed<br />
3 Rev Whips (One to me, yay!  Other 2 rotted, as the only other Ranger there had one already, thanks again Vekeras =D)</div></div><hr />
