<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last patch my far clip pane has been artificially lowered.  In options it's set to max but the game is drawing at maybe one half to two thirds distance.  I'm sitting in Kurn's (/rude cudgel number 3) and I cannot see across the hall from the middle of the Crusader's staircase.<br />
<br />
Anyone else getting a problem like this, and if so do you have any tips for fixing it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed this in DSP last night, i thought fog rolled in, but now that it hink of it, there is no fog in DSP.<br />
<br />
Also when i cann4 i notice half the time or more my arms dont move when i cast. This might be cause i have it set to a hotkey with a very short delay, but its annoying none the less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cant think of anything else though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Switching the sky option to Simple or None helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not many ideas here :(.<br />
<br />
Make sure you downloaded the latest EQ_options-file(sp??) and that it's actually in use, especially when you use a customized UI in a separate directory.<br />
<br />
Have you tried to move the 'clip plane'-slider back and forth a bit? I got this problem a few times, that the actual slider position did not match the real configuration settings. Moving the slider forces the system to actualize/synchronize its settings with the UI.<br />
<br />
Can't comment on the new options, that supposedly got added to the options window. Maybe have a look there too?<br />
<br />
Or it is simply a new bug ...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A whole lot of my settings were changed with this recent patch. Every singe patch re-sets my font, too, for some reason. I also noticed that the names seem to be HUGE now. I wish there was a way to scale how big things like that appear. I turn names off in Raids, but for general play, I like to have them on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Add me to the list of those with the &quot;fog of war.&quot;  Yes, I tried the slider, no help.  Also, the font size is intentional, patch notes say the font now scales with the size of the mob.  Not sure who thought that was a good idea, or why it was important.  How about fixing important stuff, like class balance?<br />
<br />
Hope they correct the clipping plane issue soon, &quot;fog&quot; is annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The new scaling name size is annoying as hell.  I wish that there was a way to turn it off.  <br />
<br />
If Im 20 virtual feet from a character his name is &quot;frikken HUGE&quot;, being about 3 times larger than he/she is.  The closer I get to the character, the smaller the name gets.  Well, thats great, untill Im about 5 virtual feet away, in which case the name starts to fade away to nothing.  So If Im stading too close I cant even see names at all, even though I can still see the space above the characters head.<br />
<br />
I /feedback for a way to toggle this new sizing on and off every time I log in now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What was wrong with the old way the names worked?  You had to get close to &quot;recognize&quot; someone.  Or you could click on them.  I don't understand why they felt like they had to mess with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,What was wrong with the old way the names worked?

/agree.<br />
<br />
This was a mixed bag patch for me personally.  A few small good things (CotA refund, diamond dust drops improved), one nice thing (raid utilities make pickups SO much easier), and a plethora of problems.<br />
<br />
I HATE the name scaling.  I could care less about special skies, as I play w/ Sky off most of the time.  The fog thing is really annoying, and I'd give up Sky &amp; scaling fonts in a heartbeat to get rid of it.  I'm also suffering (of course) from greater lag &amp; loss in framerate as a result of the patch. :( <br />
<br />
Then to top it off there have been a few mini-patches (or crashes, I can't tell which is which half the time).  E. Marr went down last night at about 11pm EST.  There were TONS of raids going on, lots of people will end up losing drops they had picked up (but weren't saved).  Remember a certain expansion roll-out with a week of daily patches?  It isn't that bad again yet, but we haven't even seen OoW live...<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm glad they are trying to improve the game.  I am also surprised by the name scalling.  I can't recall a single post were someone complained about name size though.  Maybe we need to stop complaining about shaman problems and they will fix them *wink wink*.  That was a joke incase someone missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You know that this is their way of making us beta test the stuff that they are going to use in EQ2, right?<br />
<br />
Beta testing for a game that I am not buying or playing.  /sigh<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I will admit the new skys are nice.  Was in PoE last night doing a quick Peregrin run, and the sky there fit the theme (was a mix of puke brown/green) and was not laggy at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The different font sizes are very annoying and have no purpose on the regular servers...(maybe something to help in pvp, but not needed to bring over to regular servers). I bet it was the same derv who did the 'pink' spell buff boxes a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It makes everything so peechie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Haven't noticed that problem, but I AM very upset with the scaling names.  NPC/Mob names are now written in letters an inch high (as in an inch of my monitor).  It's like those phones for people with bad sight that have number keys the size of quarters and GIGANTIC numbers.<br />
<br />
It's very aggravating, I'm not Mr. Magoo, you don't have to go so overkill on the letters, yeesh, I had to turn the npc names off after 5 minutes of looking at what seemed more like a poorly drawn comic strip than a game of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I guess I must actually be mister magoo.  I find the new names vastly easier on the eyes.  Also, the changes they made to make EQ run better in windowed mode were nice.  Chat fonts seem clearer and tabbing to a new window is a lot faster.<br />
<br />
I did notice that the names fade out when you get too close, which is annoying.   And I had the far clip plane problem as well, but overall I think my eyes are happier with this change than without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you are running a system where the name scalling is working as intended its very nice.<br />
<br />
Ive see screenshots from people in my guild who have the huge name problem, but it looks great on my system.   The idea is fine, and when it works its nice.   It just doesnt seem to work right yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Mass Group Buff is rather interesting since the latest patch ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My clip pane is messed up as well since this last patch, I can't see very far at all.<br />
<br />
Also, now every time you alt-enter out to windowed mode it turns off your trader, grrr. Yes it can be reset but it is easy to miss that it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Didn't think to much of the clip plane but now that i do it seems it's rather short even when at max.<br />
<br />
Names has been okey with me so far, there bigger but not that huge :)</div></div><hr />

Indeed..... 1 shaman to buff everything......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried this in game but my MGB seems to be functioning normally.<br />
<br />
Now if canni5 only had a greatly reduced recast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I believe I've seen a possible reason on another thread Haagen. If you mgb something that doesn't take on everyone in range your mgb resets. If you do something like stamina or charisma (lol) you will find that mgb does not reset.<br />
<br />
It may be fixed now, but it was certainly fun right after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I had an interesting post patch experience...<br />
<br />
Raid called on GoS in the hole so I packed up and headed over.<br />
<br />
I set up for the leap of death as I usually do (I like to watch the ground rush at me when I die). I hit f10 and looked straight down.<br />
<br />
I jumped off.<br />
<br />
I zoned into the Hole.<br />
<br />
I watched myself fall and splat on the ground.<br />
<br />
I zoned, presumably to my bind point in PoTranquility but I can't be sure since I was in f10.<br />
<br />
I poped... looked around... and there I was standing at the bottom of the hole! I DID'NT DIE! I was still fully buffed and geared. Wierd.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the fading/enlarging names at all, but the old ones worked too. Cosmetics.</div></div><hr />
