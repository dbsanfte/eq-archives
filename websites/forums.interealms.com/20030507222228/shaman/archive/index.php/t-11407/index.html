<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dearbhail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i just dinged 54 at the BW fort and that was decent exp 1 % ever 2-3 kills.  Now the stuff is greening out.  Where should i hunt next? i have heard of some gaurds in katta to fight but do not want to hurt my factions.  Any ideas?  I tried the hole entrance and after 3 DB kills did not even get 1% so left there.  Below is my link to my profile just for reference.  I do have a JBB and a horse and semi decent stuff.  THanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Few decent solo choices actually:<br />
<br />
Chardok Zone IN:  Make your pulls at no less than 1/2 mana, I got adds here until 56, at which, everything has come single.  Great Experience and pretty good loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Karnors:  I always solo'd T1 here, which I believe is defined as the first set of stairs to your right as you enter the castle.  This is the area where the captain(?) ** the one who drops the jade mace ** spawns.  Did most of 55 here with little problem.  Occasionally a train will divert itself and a CH will get cast on your mob, which causes some trouble, but for the most part, your standard slow and root park adds (sometimes up to 2 adds) and sic pet and JBB.  <br />
<br />
BW:  If you move away from the fort there is still a ton of blues, just have to be more picky than before.  Experience is much slower here than Karnors or Chardok but those spots may be camped.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have LoY...<br />
<br />
Gunthak (In the large town / temple area) gives 1% at 54 for every two kills. Nadox (zone inside the temple) gives 1% per. Usual hit damage is 30, if you believe that, but i've been maxed for 111 in Gunthak, and 156 in Nadox.<br />
<br />
problem is, on most servers these places are packed with your lovcal 65-only guild who are killing everything in sight and waiting for the nerf stick to beat down on the fact that every mob drops up to 9pp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dearbhail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have LoY but yet to check it out yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got to Dulak in LoY and just camp one of the pirate ships.  The third ship in the line is all DB to a 56 and its easy single pulls.  Also, there is a named captain that spawns on each ship, but I dont know how he timer works as he is always up after a server restart and when I was on yesterday, a 65 bard had cleared all 6.  But even without the drops, the mobs drop 3-7p each in money, plus 75% have a weapon worth 3-5p and about 1 in 15/20 will have a HQ vendor loot (ive gotten a Mithril Amulet, a diamond, 5 or 6 Star Rubies and 8 or 9 Fire Emeralds).  Works out to 150-250p per hour. <br />

Search button also reveals many other ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My suggestion would be to say screw solo'ing 54.<br />
<br />
Get to PoN/PoD and find yourself a group.<br />
<br />
Roughly 5 to 6 hours a night, took me 3 days to get through 54.<br />
<br />
Not bad when you hear people say they've been in 54 for months now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are up for just out and out good fights and great exp to boot. Try to solo in PoD, PoI, or PoN...with a horse and kei, just root rott.  I pull with slow if I get a resist I zone and retry.  Roughly 7 minuits per fight, minimal downtime, and up to 1/2 a blue per kill.  Not for the faint of heart, trains and bad luch in the root department could ruin your day.  Personally this is a good rush for  me :D  Oh yeah 1blue + for aa each kill if you go 100% :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if/when I solo Ive been in ME lately. I havnt been playing much lately but when I do its for about an hour or less. XP is ok, about 2-3 kills for a %, but keep in mind the mobs here have a ton more hp then kunark ones =\ Its nice for me because I can just log on kill a few mobs and leave, and you dont have to move much and if you need a C3 its a few zones away.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ship idea in LoY sounds good, I was there with a friend partnering and it was cake, I think I could take out a ship solo (depending on spawn time) pretty easy. Loot its nice plus they can drop some nice vendor loot. we got 2 diamonds and a few other gems clearing out the ships.<br />

edit=fixed typo<br />

*yes I'm still 54 =D*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I do maidens too.  As stated by others, any of the tier 1 zones will work too.  You can try rats in PoJ, but you need to pull them to the zone line, or you'll get butt loads of adds.  If you pull prisoners, you'll lots of adds too.  I never understood why the sentries help the rats, *shrugs*.</div></div><hr />
