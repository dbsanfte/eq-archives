<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently working the Iron Cudgel of the Hierophant and am extremely paranoid about any quest involving fallible combines.  Could anyone tell which of the ingredients of Xinth are tagged as NO DROP and which are tagged as LORE.<br />
<br />
For example the 2 items i already know about are the Stoneleer Emerald Plume and the gorge moss<br />
<br />
Plume is LORE and NO DROP  (if i fail i am gonna have to go back and get another, grrrr)<br />
<br />
Moss is neither LORE nor NO DROP  (yay, i can use my ranger to forager 4 or 5 of this just in case I get real lucky)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the most part i wish to do finish these quests by getting all the items with Nochnaya (well i did buy one Iksar Skull with an &quot;X&quot; - but don't get me started on how messed up that quest is) but it is my opinion that iksar foraging ability is so [insert harshest word for something inadequate you can imagine here] for getting quest items that i have no compunctions against using my ranger for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korroded Rustyscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I remember is that the mushroom from Nurga is stackable like the gorge moss, while the slate chant rock, also from Nurga, is lore (but droppable, 'tho).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe the cockatrice plume and the drixie dust may be the only NO DROP items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pouch of Dust (FINALLY dropped for me ...) is Lore and No Drop.<br />
To the best of my rememberance, FV Drixie Dust is neither.<br />
<br />
Shabura</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehei am at the same portion of the quest, i have commited Drixie genocide in FV and not gotten the dust yet. am hunting in FV. am i doing something wrong?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I know for sure:<br />
<br />
Firiona Drixie Dust from FV is stackable. not lore, not No Drop.<br />
Sponge Mushroom from Nurga is stackable. Not lore, not No Drop.<br />
Sarnak Night dust from FM is No Drop (not sure about lore)<br />
Slate Chant Rock from Nurga is Lore and not No Drop.<br />
<br />
The combine is trivial at 40 in alchemy according to alkazham (sp?) and my friend did the potion twice without failure with a skill slightly above 100.</div></div><hr />
