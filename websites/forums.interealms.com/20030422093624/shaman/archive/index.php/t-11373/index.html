<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hissanhi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, looking for help here..I need a dusty skull and can't seem to get one.<br />
<br />
Over the last two weeks I have spent 4 hours at a time on 5 different days sitting alone (well me and my dual comp 62nd BST) in the south wing of HS.  After obtaining the keys, and /dueling to save them each time I had to log, we went into south wing and kept 15 spawns dead for a total of 20 hours in 5 sittings.  That works out to 900 mobs.  @ of those spawns were named spots, total loot includes 3 golden Bracers, more enshrouded veils than I care to remember, a bloodpoint, 2 war helms, and much much more.  After getting all 4 needed glowing skulls I have proceeded to shred an average of 12 per session or 60! extra glowing skulls.<br />
<br />
In all this time I only spawned 3 undertaker skels, and none of them had a dusty.<br />
<br />
The spawns I am clearing start at the one way drop and go past the cave named, and branch out to include the room with the raised carpet/trap in the middle.  on the map about half of the entire south wing.<br />
<br />
The question is.. what am I doing wrong.  I have not only all 4 glowings, but all four of the drops needed to finish the 8th as well, just can't find a simple dusty skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got all the skulls while XPing on the 4 mobs right behind south door. But that was a while back it could very well be buged by now.</div></div><hr />

This is a post I made on the champions of Cabilis forums.<br />
<br />
My first 2 visits we cleared out the south wing and nothing. 3rd visit the skull dropped from a skell with the word &quot;hex&quot; in it's name and then I promply told the druid to port us out of there. <br />
<br />
Anyhow comes time to nail VS, we zone into HS and law an behold, a skell with &quot;hex&quot; in it's name, (one of the zone-in wanderes) dropped the dusty skull. VS Fight went well and I picked up my shiny new cudgel and one the way to zone-out (no porters) 2 more dusty skulls dropped both from skells with &quot;hex&quot; in the name and both were in the east wing. We nailed lots of &quot;hex&quot; skells and the tall skells on the way out. The 2 that dropped on the way out were in the East Wing.<br />
<br />
I personnally don't think any wing is better for the dusty skull, if you have a tracker, go for the wing with the most skells up. We had no tall skells in South Wing but lots in the East (non of the tall skells dropped it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hissanhi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like you mean Hexbone...got about a dozen of those killed.  Nice to know they can drop the dusty too...well kinda nice.  Guess this is why they call it EVERquest.  I'll just have to keep banging away at it till I get the drop.<br />
<br />
Oh and no I'm on Torv, but thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have seen the dusty skulls drop when playing my paladin. Seen one drop in the general south wing, and about 4 drop on the passage from the end of the south wing to the east wing. If my paladin had reasonable faction with the mystics, I might try to MQ it with myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my dusty skull thru a very lucky chance one day while soloing zin using the excellent guide found on these boards.<br />
<br />
The wandering mob that opens the east door and walks out to the edge of the stairs sometimes is a skellie. I got my dusty skull and 2 of my 4 glowing skulls from him. <br />
<br />
I now wield the 7th cudgel, and all I need is VS or VSR for the blackened iksar bones.<br />
<br />
Now, I had been soloing zin from 54-60 (off and on...not nonstop) and had killed countless east wing wanderers before I was completely shocked at getting the dusty. This was early Feb 2003 on Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did I just read your post correctly?  You soloed from 54 to 60 in HS?  Can you please post links to how I can do this.  I would like my skulls too and if I can solo I know a friend that will join.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its very easy to solo in HS, although I prefer LCY/RCY PoD<br />
<br />
Important to get Kei and try to get Aego for break in cause it can be nasty sometimes. There are always two mobs that walk around the cube when you zone in. The good thing is that if you dont take a step in any direction you are exactly out of agro range, so bring up dogdog, buff up and dont forget Project alpha. Now the two that walk around can be any types of mob: sperm: bottomless feaster, sepulcher skeletons or greater war boned skeleton. The sepulcher's harm touch for about 550 damage so if two are up root one and send dogdog against the other. Then slow both, Dot, heal if need be and keep rinsing dots. Epic is nice to have as well as JBB but I had neither when i soloed here. Once you have killed both, choose a wing to start at, stand on one of the higher posts so that you dont have to climb stairs to pull. There are always 2 up so make sure to root one and send dogdog in while you slow the other. Once again dot and rinse. Just use this method for clearing all the wings though without bane of nife its a little difficult as ebolt isnt as good. An important thing to watch out for is respawns so its best if you time them. I believe the respawns at entrance are 24 mins. As for the post about someone getting skulls from a mob that came outside a door on east wing I find it a little hard to believe cause skulls only drop of mobs in the south wing. So dont rely on that to get ur skulls. Also at lv 58 you can solo pull most of the mobs in the zone, except the east wing as harder stuff pops there. Your best bet if your collecting skulls is hope that a rogue wants to help you or that a necro with a south wing key drops by. This happens a lot since most necros love this zone and farm it for loot (and south wing has really nice loot). <br />
<br />
Well good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>panthal gimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hiss,i am on torv also,need a necro and shaman to help let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Iranicus said is mostly true, except about the skulls.<br />
<br />
I have never set foot in the south corridor, and yet I've completed that part of the quest...just one more to go, and all I need for that is blacken iksar bones...<br />
<br />
The skulls drop in the west wing as well. I have never seen one drop in the north.<br />
<br />
On one lucky day, I was taken into the east wing (lev trick to get up to the platform, and that door is not locked) and we had a blast. I did get one skull there, but I already had 4 in the bank so I destroyed it. <br />
<br />
So from my experience, skulls drop in the east and west wings. I take everyone's word that they drop in the south most of all.<br />
<br />
As for soloing...once you get the north key, you can solo the north wing around 58...gets easier at 59, and 60 is too easy. The hardest part about the north wing is the first room past the door, before the one-way wall painting. With 4 mobs in there, it is very easy to mistakenly get all 4, ESPECIALLY with the pet involved. I tend to park him outside and use the /back command alot during this part. Pull one mob with slow, root/rot and repeat until you're down to one. Then I let the pet get involved...and from there on he's a vital asset.<br />
<br />
One important thing...keep GATE memmed. If you do get into trouble, let the dog keep them occupied and gate your tail out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How tough is it to solo the south wing?  I checked it out last night, but only did the 4 mobs before the one way door.  These were no problem to single pull.  I waited for those to respawn, but forgot about the two golems guarding the door, and had to gate.  Level 60, no epic, but have malo/torpor.  I have some friends I might be able to call in on this, but I'd rather save them the annoyance if possible.  There will be time for that on the 8th battle.<br />
<br />
On a somewhat different topic, does anyone know what, if anything, sees through rogue hide/sneak here?  I have a 42 rogue on another account let me in the door(gotta love mechanical lockpicks).  All the zone in mobs, and the 4 in the first room of the south wing did not see through hide/sneak.  Does he have any chance of making it through the entire dungeon to the zone out?  Would save me time/cash on getting him out with the new gate potions or thurg potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got my dusty skull soloing at the entrance at 56. Got Virtue, Kei, and Rune5 for the break in. The dusty was obtained from the wanderer that stops at the top of the east (fake) stairs. Took about 3 evenings and was actually very decent exp. If only the golems were on the same spawn time as the rest of the stuff at the zone in, this would be a very nice place to solo till 60. I seem to remember that the golems are on over 30 min timers and the rest of the zone is 22 min. My gear for each iteration of project alpha: 2x Hands of Ixiblat, 1x Girdle of Magi'kot, 1x Muzzle of Mardu. I forget whether it was a hexbone or hamal that dropped the dusty for me. The iksar apparition that you have to fight in FoB hits for about 140-150s, HT for 811 (think hamal or hexbone with a HT), summons, and flees when low health. One of my assistants for that was summoned and killed by the oracle (no faction work done by that guy at all). Can be done with 2 folks (there were 3 at the beginning, but someone got summoned), could probably be done with one.<br />
<br />
In all my time there, I have never seen a dusty drop in the south wing. I have seen dusties drop only in the east wing. I have seen the glowing ones drop in west and south wings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zakisse Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just got my skulls a couple of nights ago and wanted to confirm that while the glowing skulls seemed to drop from random mobs the dusty did indeed drop from the hexbone or whatever it was called.  From fighting in the south and then east wing 2 out of 3 hexskellies dropped the dusty.  The wanderer that opens the east door from time to time was a hex but didn't happen to be one that dropped a dusty that particular night.  After all that we then got wiped by dru and her guardians :oP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Got my dusty iksar skull from an undertaker skeleton walking in the pit area, as we were clearing those mobs looking for the key to the first wing.<br />
<br />
Glowing skulls seem to drop occasionally in the West wing and commonly in the East wing, not just the South wing as the guides suggest.<br />
<br />
North -&gt; West -&gt; South -&gt; East is the order of the keys as well as the level of mobs. Saw several hexbones and undertakers in the East entrance area which I suppose could drop a dusty skull.<br />
<br />
Although the East stairs are an illusion, it is possible to float directly over to the East entrance from another platform ;) The East door isn't locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I spent a few hours in the east wing and destroyed so many Dusty and Glowing Skulls. I didnt know what they were for and being a paladin (with a shammy alt) was getting annoyed with the number of them that dropped. Just wanted to say that in the east wing, past the dropoff at the painting, we had more than anyone could want. Just saying that they are still dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kherys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The skull drops are completely level dependent.. mobs in south and east are on average higher level, thus more of them drop skulls.  Some mobs in west occaisonally pop high enough, thus some rare times you can get skulls in west.  North is always too low level.  Hexbones and undertakers are some of the highest level skellies in the zone, so they of course tend to drop most of the skulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just to verify what most people are saying, my group cleared the North wing and no skulls dropped.  We did the west wing twice and I got one glowing skull, moved to south where I got 3 more glowing and 1 dusty in about 15 kills, we ported out after, didnt finish the south wing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my skulls over the weekend.  Dusty and glowing.<br />
<br />
I did east wing (since the door is unlocked).  Used lev run across from one of the other set of stairs to the east door.  I had 4 dustys drop before I got my second glowing skull.  It does seem to be level dependant.  East wing mobs are definately higher level -many were light blue to me at 65.<br />
<br />
If you do this solo, be careful.  I gated out 4-5 times when I couldnt handle the fights.  I was frequently taking 4+ mobs.  Single pulls were rare.  I did clear all the way to drusilla's room by the time I got all my skulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I looted my dusty skull on mobs in the hallway between the South Wing zone out room and those halls that take you up to the East Wing.  I have seen the dusty skull drop in the basment/pit trap area and in the South Wing as well.  <br />
<br />
I just completed the 8th cudgel on Saturday.  The final battle is kind of an odd event - be careful not to aggro Rile after VS is dead.  (I know, I know, it's completely obvious but still...)  Rile will be KOS to non lizards, but seemed to have a very small aggro range, so the softskins that were with me were able to stay in the back of the room and not get aggro.  The time before we killed VS but Rile aggro.  I had the Skull in the bank, so I couldn't loot the Lore skull off of VS.  I found out it IS MQ'Able, as long as the person turning it in is not kos to the Spirit of Rile.<br />
<br />
Our next raid I smiled as /gu chat was filled with, &quot;What's Carnage?&quot;  and &quot;Who's casting carnage?&quot; and then the subsequent /tells.  &quot;Carnage Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
All in all, fun, time-consuming quests.  Sometimes I even equip it now in primary just to look different.  Good luck!<br />
