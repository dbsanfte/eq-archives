<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've done my epic quest up to the point that i have to go kill the high icon in the hole and get my tear.<br />
<br />
i use a log parser from http://www.gralin.com/everlogs/  .<br />
<br />
this log parser shows faction hits in a numerical fashion. My truespirit faction is listed as 9. presummerably on a scale of -2800 (enemy) to +2800 (ally)<br />
<br />
i've read as long as i follow the quest, i'll have enough faction, i've been following http://eq.crgaming.com/epics/shaman.asp  as my walkthru.<br />
<br />
however, being more than 70% done, and this log parser reporting my faction as &quot;9&quot;. is making me think, &quot;do i need to do more?&quot;<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you check the Epic FAQ sticky thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=7737) at the top of this forum, you'll see a link to What faction is needed at what points? (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1523)<br />
<br />
My post at the bottom of that thread lists the steps that give you faction. At the point before killing High Scale Kirn, you should have gotten 8 faction increases. Your log parser says 9 -- maybe you repeated one step?<br />
<br />
Your log parser is assuming 1 point of faction per increase. However, the Shaman epic gives different amounts of faction for different steps: some steps give a little faction, some steps give a lot. So there is no easy way to tell exactly how much faction you have. All you can do is con a Truespirit mob to determine his general faction level, and make sure you've done all the steps in the right order.</div></div><hr />
