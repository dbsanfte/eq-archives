<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 35 this morning, after a week of being 34. Nope, I wasn't in a hell level. The exp was fine and everything. I could kite and use my pet to their full extent. I could even double kite. It's just that soloing is rather boring, and grouping = slow exp.<br />
<br />
I found myself in a bind and created a twinked monk. Got him to 13 in about 8 hours of playtime, and decided I would ding my shammy. Now I see the shaman as a boring class where everything get's reused and no real additions are made. What I mean is all the spells we get from 39 up are just upgrades to level 34 spells. No new abilities, no new types of spells.<br />
<br />
I would still like to level my shaman, but I'm just wondering if this is a phase all shamans go through. After being grouped most of my career, the time flew. During the 29-34 levels, I was grouped, but the exp was rather slow. When I hit 34 I was able to solo with all the types of kiting rather easily, and the exp flew. It got rather boring after spending so much time doing the same thing over and over again. Can you guys please help me and give me your own advice and expierences? I'm not really sure of wether to retire my shammy now and just use him for kiting or wether to tough it out and hope for near future changes and thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've rarely found grouping to be slow experience unless I was in a really crappy group. Fortunately, I started the game with some RL friends and we group together constantly. Experience is almost always good in our groups. I've soloed alot also, as I play at odd times and sometimes my friends aren't on when I am. I've never done the 'pet-kiting' thing, so I can't really judge how interesting it is as a fighting tactic. Doesn't sound really appealing, but to each his/her own. I've dabbled in root/rotting, but until I got to higher levels, root was never reliable enough for me to solo efficiently using that tactic. My strategy once I got the pet was simply to slow the mob, send in the pet and melee while dotting or nuking (depending on which type of spell seemed resisted the least). To me, it was much more interesting and fairly mana-efficient. Sometimes, if the mobs hit really hard, I'll use a combination of root/rotting and pet/tanking with minor alterations as necessary to maximize efficiency. Try different fighting tactics with your shaman. We can fight in different ways, depending on our goals and to some extent, our gear. If you can't find a fighting style that suits your personality, maybe you should reconsider your class and stick with your monk or start another toon. And remember, too much of anything gets boring. If soloing is getting boring, group some. If grouping gets boring, solo some or start a few quests. Depending on your race, start questing some of the totemic pieces or whatever the iksar equivalent is. Maybe start a trade skill. There's a lot to do in EQ, so no need to be bored all the time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">34 is a good level.  Getting your pet gets you xp much faster.<br />
<br />
39 will change your whole gameplay.  Togor is amazing.  You can stop running from things, and laugh as they try to kill you.<br />
<br />
Another thing you might want to do is only party with 1 or 2 other poeple.  Small groups work wonders for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">fight tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I know that's a smart ass example, but there is some truth to it.  If you find that experience in a group is painfully slow, there are a couple things you can do:<br />
1) go to a better zone.  Basic rule of thumb, the tougher the zone, the more exp a mob gives (ie a lvl 25 mob in Kedge Keep will give you more experience than a lvl 25 mob in LOIO).<br />
<br />
2)  get a smaller group.  Yes, there are incremental bonuses for each party member, but if it's going slow with 6 full members...the next time you are in zone, try and get a 4 person group, or just a 3 person group.  <br />
<br />
3) pull more monsters.  Unless the people you are playing with are experienced players, they are still getting comfortable with their roles at lvl 34...so they tend to play cautiously.  Try to get the puller to pull the next mob when the current mob is down to 30% health, for example.<br />
<br />
I personally went through my slump around lvl 18 - 19.  I got burned out and took a break for a bit...but now I'm loving being a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At Level 35, unless your Defense is maxed, I'd strongly recommend against pet kiting, except for the rare white/yellow MOB you need to kill for a quest or something, where tanking just isn't possible.<br />
<br />
Everquest is a repetitive game, and much, much more so when soloing. Playing a Monk isn't going to be any different as far as this is concerned. What makes it interesting is grouping with other people, and the strategies that emerge from working with other classes. Exploring new areas and fighting new MOBs maintains interest as well. I agree that full groups are generally not the greatest for experience; 2 or 3 person groups seem to be the best.<br />
<br />
Here are some suggestions to break the repetition:<br />
<br />
1. Use Invisibility to solo deep in a dungeon. Kiting generally doesn't work too well indoors and you won't be able to fall back on SoW and the zone line when you get into trouble.<br />
2. Try duoing with every single class. I can't think of any two duos that require exactly the same from a Shaman.<br />
3. Pull for an indoor caster group. Perhaps it's just me, but I enjoy the challenge of pulling and it's a great way to learn a zone.<br />
4. Move through a dungeon, rather than just camping one spot.<br />
5. Even if you choose to solo outdoors, make it a goal to max your Defense (200) by Level 40. If you've been kiting, this is guaranteed to change your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">House is so very right.  EQ is like a tredmill.  Sometimes its a blast to get on that thing and see what your fastest run time is, other times its a drag to even get to the gym.  Anyway, my primary character is a Ranger, so I can tell you first hand that melees can be just as boring as any other class in the game.  In fact, straight melee is probably THE most repetitive thing around short of being a cleric.  Trust me, after the 70000th Sarnak or Froglok or random skeleton or giant beetle that you just hit the autoattack button and your kick button every 10 seconds, you can get pretty damned tired of meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foresaken One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A little update. Since about last night, I decided to change my hunting grounds to the Dreadlands. I hunt the yeti's there and pet kite that back and forth along the west wall. I end up with about 1 full bubble of mana gone, and if it's a dark blue kill, half a blue bub of exp. The loot is great(at least compared to the kodiaks in the gd), and since I have some downtime, I usually share the camp with one other person, so I'm not alone anymore (yay). It's getting really fun, and yesterday I got through half of level 35 in about 2-3 hours. I'm going to ding 36 today(knock on wood), and hopefully get through half of it as well. Thanks for the quick replies. I plan on staying here until maybe I get my pet or hit 40. I could probably get into a good group in the DL's or KC if I'm high enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't count on getting into any KC group until at least level 45 or so.  Too many resists on slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And you'll have the jackasses telling you you don't belong there until lev 49 or so.  Heck, if you can't cast on the critters, keep your groupmembers aliive and in tip-top shape.<br />
<br />
I was doing Karnor's at 44.  It was tough, but it was truly the most fun I'd had in ages... a lot of things were even and yellow.  Just peachy!<br />

Oh, heh, yep, I knew. Sorry I didn't type it our right. I meant I plan on staying there until I get my other pet. Heh, sorry for the mix-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">one of the reasons i play a shaman is because if the huge variety of strategies and roles we can attempt.  i think the class gets more and more interesting at higher levels, since you become an essential part of raids and you become the only one able to solo uber mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was starting to get bored of the same old thing as well in the 20's.  What I did was joing fun guild full of some pretty nice folks.  We are not an uber guild with are average level around 20.<br />
<br />
Now I break the exp grind up by PL lower guild levels and going on raids with them in areas like CB.  It makes things kinda fun and when you do start to want to level again it doesn't seem quite so bad.<br />
<br />
If you play a troll shaman who worships INNY take out a fellow troll and show them the snare necklace quest.  It's quite fun.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes sitting and chatting with other folks you've grouped with is the best part of the game.   <br />
<br />
I make it a habit to take my fishing pole with me and fish in every body of water I can find to see what I can pull in.  Bakings is a fairly inexpensive trade and you can gross the elfs out by eating foods you've created from their body parts you get off the slaves in crusbone.<br />
<br />
Try to make the game enjoyable by socializing.  You find you like it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I been grouping with my Guild Leaders twink Gnome Sk in Iceclad on Cougars. There is a Named Gnoll on the second island behind the Tower of Frozen Shadow. He is in a tent and that is safe spot. Just grab a partner. Sk/Monk IMHO, SoW, haste him. Then slow and Ebreath the mobs when they get there. I use walking sleep because the pulling is so fast Turgors burns my health bar and mana bar to nothing in no time. Two 5 hour days = 1 and 1/2 lvls.  Another Idea is to get a Cleric and an SK/monk and form a group in front of CT on the Lizards out there. Nice drops and noobie zone exp bonus to boot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was rather surprised by this thread.  Level 34 and 35 were two of my most entertaining levels.  Getting dogdog for the first time and not having to read the damned book to med were MAJOR improvements in my soloing experience.  Up to that time, I hadn't played with a pet class before and for the first couple of levels dogdog is actually a tank.  It was kinda like being grouped with a warrior who didn't fight me for loot and who I didn't feel bad about abandoning to a bad pull.  He allowed me to solo places that I couldn't before and I was a little sad to see him go when I outlevelled him and picked up his only slightly stronger brother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i remember several times felling really burned out by the repetition. mid 30's, 42-43.  worst were 54 and 58.<br />
<br />
Key is to vary your role and approach. I ditto the above recommendations.  Duo some, solo some each level. <br />
<br />
Hunt in stupid places where warriors wont go.  I did a day sitting on the bottom of the ocean with a bard hunting sharks for kicks.  An absolutely amazing pick me up.  <br />
<br />
In that range I did a day of &quot;charm&quot; fighting for variety.  That was fun also.<br />
<br />
Go clear some dungeon that is mostly green to you (not all but mostly).  Kill everything.  Cleared split paw to see if I could do it.  Did it first with 2 others, then with one then solo'ed it. Invised to far end and fought out to exit. Had a blast doing it.  Find some dopey zone you missed and crush it.  <br />
<br />
This is supposed to be entertainment.  So find ways to be entertained once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember hitting the wall at 35. Yes I was happy w/pet spell...but it was just a struggle. I found myself wanting to play an old twink or create another one. <br />
<br />
Best advice I can give you is to fight thru it. Once you hit level 39(new spells and a slow actually worth casting) you will start to feel the growing power of a shaman.<br />
<br />
Hang in there kid.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Interestingly I just digned 36 last night and I have been having a lot more fun with my shaman over the last few levels (since 34).  So much fun I basically retired my 32 warrior because he just wasn't fun anymore.  I've been soloing a lot since 34 (I basically didn't solo from lvl 9 to 34 much) and gettign great exp.  I've been killing Zelniaks in Danwshroud for great exp.  I park my pet by Sanctus Seru zone and go pull a small or regular zel (large ones are doable i just have more downtime) with listles power run back to pet and we both melee it to death.  I tank and take the hits (which usually isn't much 2 bubs at most usually, sometimes 2 and a half with a regular zel).  I fully buff myself (str, agi, sta, haste, talisman, shifting shield, regen, fury) and I only str and talisman the pet, i don't even haste him or slow mob ( i want to get hit hehe).  With full buffs my HP is at about 940, my AC is only at 713 but my defense is at about 155 so i'm far short of level cap.  Even with me tanking it's been going up very slowly.  Does dex or agi affect Defensive increases?  I've heard both.  My Dex with fury up is only 115, agi is 149.<br />
<br />
Now I never turn down a group with my guildmates.  Even though the exp is often slower, it's just fun to play with those guys.  Our guild is new and fairly small so we are used to each other and have a lot of fun, even in death.  But I enjoy soloing as well when I don't get on early enough to get a group.<br />
<br />
What's really fun is duoing with the guild's necro (he's just dinged 39).  We have good flexability with 2 pets, lots of dots and debuffs and he can fear kite tougher stuff while me and the pets wail on it.  Although I like to keep tanking to work on defense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So what i hear from you is that you reached 34 and now its boring cause you get nothing new. Well im not going to candy coat it ... Welcome to Everquest. no matter what class you are you dont get any new abilities or anythign earth shaking when you get in your 30's. this is how the game is , not your shaman. <br />
<br />
Now me , im a 52 shaman. I challange myself in this game. Kiting is ncie and all and gets you up in XP nice on higher mobs and stuff. but i am one of the shamans that likes to get hit. Im the shaman Slowing and Nuking and DoTing till i get aggro and get beat down for a few hundred before i LET the tanks have aggro back. I take so much joy steping INFRONT of my pet when im fighting Ancient Forest Giants and taking those 120 doubles and 65 bashes. You make this game exciting if you ask me , its not the game that is exciting. If your bored then challange yourself. Dont sit back and expect to be entertained , step up and make entertainment happen. This morning i challanged myself in Rathe Mountains. I havent been there since like 44.  Well i accidently got a add and after running like i used to in 44 i stepped up and said screw it. lets see where this goes. Slowed bolth and tanked one Hill Giant myself and helped my pet do the other. Now they arent red anymore , but iff you want a thrill i suggest you pull 4 HG's and root them all around you adn take them all out at once , when one breaks root you have to pull aggro from pet and park it away , its truly art form and a dance if you will that goes beyond playing a mere game. a ballet in many ways.<br />
<br />
I feel your feeligns , your where i was in my high 20's. I suggest you challange yourself more if you feel bored cause i have almost every character in EQ and i can promise yout his , when a shaman knows how to use all of his abilities to his FULL potential , he is truly one of the most potent and FUN characters int he game.<br />
<br />
Good luck brother .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I supprised myself this weekend. I can tank and take out a fungi mushroom by soloing - without dogdog or buffed :).<br />
<br />
With a druid friend - we pulled three, and took them out - both tanking them. About one heal needed here...<br />
<br />
With and enchanter - we pulled the patch and let the pets tank some whilst we each took out others..<br />
<br />
With just me and a rogue - the rogue tanked, and each time the 'shroom cast he would dash behind it and backstab it.<br />
<br />
Had a look at jagged pine - at 58 there are some low dark blues and cyans... perfect dogdog material for soloing.<br />
<br />
Well - why am I mentioning this?<br />
<br />
Well at 33 I was stuck in lake of ill omen, soloing cyans to get to 34.. then I started in Overthere, Dreadlands, SolB.. I moved there from SK at 24.. when kunark came out. I was sick of the place.. but there are many other places out there.. If you stick to old world then they have less hp... but I'd advise travelling to each zone at your level and looking at it :) <br />
<br />
As a shaman your in the lull... at 40 you become groupable with any level.. that for a shammy is one of the biggest boosts to what you can do and where you can go..<br />
<br />
An epic really helped - I use it almost all the time depending on encounter time and need to med.<br />
<br />
The level 34 pet is not stunning but it does get you used to controlling it and at 39 there is a good upgrade. That pet will do some good damage later on..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Personally, I love playing a shaman. I'm an attention whore and the shaman always gets the attention. ;)<br />
<br />
Cast a few buffs and the melee loves you. Malo and Slow that ToV Dragon and an entire raid party loves you. ;)<br />
<br />
The post 30's spells may be mostly upgrades, but they are some really nice upgrades. A 60 shaman and 60 Monk can duo in Fear. Not many classes can support that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Its all a matter of taste.  For me I found that each spell rank seemed to favour different tactics based on my skill level.  When I need to work on defense or offense I soloed.  At 51 its easy as cake to beat the crap out of a seafurbies, get exp, and skill up.<br />
<br />
At 34 I tried something different, I soloed brownie outcasts.  That was awesome fun.  As an untwinked shaman, killing dozens of pixies until a BO spawned (usually 2 at a time at the rate cujo was reeming pixies), cast cancel magic, slow, and chain nuke. usually kill 2 in a row before having to respawn them by killing pixies again.  Brownies are about the most fun to kill.  They are druid mobs so I got my anti-druid anxiety out in a hurry.  The exp was pretty good and I seemed to sit in a spot where stuff was pathed through.  I recall once going afk and when I came back my pet was just finishing off a named that had pathed through and sit aggroed on me.<br />
<br />
Basically ... in a long winded way, I'm saying you can vary tactics, mobs, and basically play how you want, but in the end your experience comes down to what you make of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think I hit a lull in the high 20s/low 30s.  For me; I hit 35 when Velious came out so I went right over and started to explore a bit and kill in Iceclad.  So that was exciting.  I pretty much skipped Kunark until my mid 40s.<br />
<br />
54 was probably the WORST level for me.  Nasty, evil, horrible hell level with pretty crappy spells to look forward to.  (Group buffs were less than single versions, Bane and Tigirs were SUPER rare at this time.)  57, 56, 58, and 59 are all pretty boring dings, all you're doing is looking forward to 60.  Then you hit 60 and cry cause the only spell you have to mem is Single Focus ;P<br />
<br />
I'm not helping am I?<br />
<br />
Spell drops are a bit better now, and if you can get them, it's a whole other world.  But the lvl 51 shaman with the new Slow doing Hate/Fear/Vox/Naggy is alot of fun.  Definatley do those!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This may just be me, but I find that whenever I get to a &quot;class defining&quot; level on any character, it NEVER meets my initial expectation.

Some time later I'll end up playing that character again and am always amazed at how much cooler he is than I remember.<br />
<br />
Go figure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was in the EXACT same situation  you where. I hit 29 and my hunting partner I had been hunting with since level 9 decided he was tired of getting PKed (We are on Sullon Zek) constantly so he rerolled to a goodie ranger. I was now stuck. Sullon Zek hunting is drastically different from blue servers. You can't just run all over the world to find the best exp spots. I finally settled into a routine,and a very boring one, of soloing Golras in TD. I made it to 34 and was going insane with boredom so I created a Ikky monk. That lil sucker made 17 in less than 3 days. I was blown away when I went from 13 17 in one night in Kurns. Yes  I know Sullon exp means I was getting 100% normal server exp (still 80% by sullon standards) + a bonus for kurns which is like 20%. I was seriously blown away. <br />
<br />
Playing a monk does wonders for the ego because you are seriously powerful at such a low level. I was soloing in kurns at 11 (only twinkage I got was a PSU and a +hp necklace) while SKs, shammies and necros where all grouping. at 15 when double attack kicked in I was clearing the bottom level solo. But I digress. I went back to my shammy after I hit 17 and found a new partner (a two box cleric/monk combo) and we rocked Lguk and SolB on a daily basis. When I hit 37 I went with my guild to CoM for a week, hit 39 and OMG I rocked! I was finding all my old hunting spots to be boring and too easy. Spectres in Ferrott YAWN, Hulking Golras, NO WAY IN HELL will I ever set foot on that Iceberg again. Once you  hit 39 nothing can stop you (well except for the odd red con shrieker or 5 in the deep ;), long story not gonna go there) and it just gets better as you get higher. I am still soloing at a level that a lot of other classes could never conceive of. Ebolt is godly. Just keep at it. The one great thing I can say about shaman you have one of the only classes that can truly decide whether or not you want to group or solo all the way into the high end. No monk will be soloing anything worth his time at 55+. Sure there are things to solo at that level for a monk but its inefficient and to much work for to little gain. Plus you ever here of a monk soloing a WW dragon? ;)</div></div><hr />
