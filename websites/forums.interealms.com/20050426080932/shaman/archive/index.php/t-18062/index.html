<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi All - I am a newly dinged 53 shaman. Tied with highest shaman on server.  I am able to single pull in HHK, must be due to level.  I still dont' use pet because it aggro;s guards. So I root rot.  Can kill em with two EB if i time it right. <br />
<br />
Is there some wherei can solo with my pet?  <br />
<br />
BTW - thanks for the PoH advice, it came in handy.  We did well.  No shammie drops, but we had to do a CR tonight for someone who went LD and got a couple Shaman drops. Go figure- 30 people in raid - and only two were shamans, both from my guild.<br />
<br />
Loving the EQ.  Any advice is taken as law - thank you fellow shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamluke256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can use your pet in there, just keep root on the mob and you will do fine.  Also if you give your pet 2 fs weapons he will be a machine.  What I did at 53 was pull with slow, root the mob, then dot it.  It only took one e-bolt and pet dps to kill a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hoppers in DSP hopper caves should be nice for you now. Pull to the outside, and park doggy on the grass waiting for you. Take some time to learn the spawn and so on. This mob shares cave (time share) with tribals, so they may not be up when you visit. Of course the attraction of flawless and superb hopper hides to sell is a bonus.<br />
<br />
Jagged Pines is not to everyones liking.. but hunting the poachers at the camp can work ok.<br />
<br />
You can solo hill giants in Rathe Mountains, and Ice Giants in Everfrost. <br />
<br />
Some of your solo ability is going to depend on equipment (eg focus gear), and some on creative problem solving for particular areas. If in doubt, practise an area IN  A DUO... with another character that snares. You have the &quot;saftey&quot; that the mob will chase you more slowly, and you can check what dots land and what root works. With snare kiting, tell doggy NOT to taunt, and he will run behind and snip the mobs heels. If you are doing this, of course, you should not root the mob.</div></div><hr />
