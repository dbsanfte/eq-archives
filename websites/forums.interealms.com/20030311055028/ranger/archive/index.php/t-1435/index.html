<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for useful information about this mob!<br />
<br />
We all know he drops an awesome bow:<br />
<br />
Bow of Doom   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Damage: 33<br />
Delay: 35 <br />
Ratio: 1.060 Amazing <br />
Str: +10 Sta: +10 Dex: +10 Wis: +10 Magic Resist: +8 Fire Resist: +8 Cold Resist: +8 HP: +50 Mana: +50  <br />
Weight: 2.5 <br />
Weapon Skill: Archery<br />
<br />
I am trying to get my guild excited enough to start considering him for periodic killing.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for strategy, tactics, and other information on this mob.  How many HPs does he have?  What kind of attacks?  What are his resists?  How hard is he to kill?<br />
<br />
Please help me if you can!  Post links to other information if you know of some good sites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balerius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doomshade is along the lines of Vindi but with more HPs.<br />
<br />
Doesn't hit quite as hard as Vindi but flurries instead of rampages.  So a good set of rolls by Doomshade can produce a string of flurries that can eat your MT's HPs in a hurry.  Doomshade has no special resists that I recall.<br />
<br />
Pretty much a straightforward melee fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chayse Meridian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">he drops a few good bps too wicked mail for chain as well as a48ac (i believe, could be a bit off) plate bp with tons o stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>grader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dont flame too bad but im 90 percent sure we parsed him at 660k Hps, flurries alot, make sure to cripple him. good ch rotation and hes toast with good damage dealers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">660k of htps seems too much to me, but didnt parse it, so dunno.<br />
<br />
No special resists on him, all mine fire spells worked, shamans could use cold DDs, Enchanter offensive spells hold too.<br />
<br />
Flurry a lot (mean A LOT)<br />
<br />
Dropped some FT2, FT items, no bow, no BP .. darn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doomshade doesnt drop any breastplates. Rumblecrush drops several BP, including the Wicked Mail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doomshade doesnt drop any breastplates. Rumblecrush drops several BP, including the Wicked Mail and Calamity's End which I have on my Wizard alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khazidhea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">would be so useful if any1 has a tactic to calculate respawn or any info on it, like 72h repop, or new random repop like 24 to 72h ... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>valphoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am eyeing that perty earing... the earing of endless speed. I was wondering about how many people it will take to kill this guy. my guild does all the normal stuff AOW, ssra etc. so how many people do I need to lay down the smack down? I was guessing about 12...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I take it he is immune to attack speed changes?<br />
<br />
Tripples?<br />
Quads?<br />
<br />
Does he hit as fast as Vindi? Or does he just hit as hard as Vindi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thundax Stormkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I consider Doomshade to be of similar difficulty to Rumblecrush.<br />
<br />
About 24 people is probably necessary. I guess less could probably do it, but it would be difficult.<br />
<br />
Both these fights are probably a bit easier than Vindicator.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gilerael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hits 420s, flurries. Hard to tell between doubles/triples/quads when you add in the fast flurries, but she (yes, SHE! con her) is roughly as hard as Vindi, unslowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Seen it go down with 14 people...mainly 4 mana burn wiz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goldeneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">we use a 4 cleric cheal rotation with a 4 sec pause and that is cutting it really really close.  Better if you have a 4 cleric chain and another cleric+druid with spot heals to keep the main tank up.  Last time we did him with like 26 i think.  The main tank went down at about 40% the secondary tank went down at about 15% and the third and last warrior went down at 5% heh.  Luckily me and the other Warder were able to hold aggro, pop weaponshield and buy an extra 40 secs to finish him off, PHEW!  Was a sloppy kill though, really need to have the clerics on their game, lotsa mod rods, spot heals, blah blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Denrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been wanting to kill doomshade for a while now. After reading all of this I REALLY want to kill DS. Sounds like a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shadohawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sounds like a Lord Bob fight (you know, that guy with the ridiculous name in Velks). He flurries (alot), 400's or so. Just a lot more hitpoints with Doomshade. Sounds like a fun fight. Basically your clerics better show up on thier game. Also, we have two or 3 druids bridge healing the MT while the clerics CH. Just in case someone fizzles hehe. Works like a charm on Bob. Add someone dropping mod rods, and extra cleric or so and you got the same fight, different mob.<br />
