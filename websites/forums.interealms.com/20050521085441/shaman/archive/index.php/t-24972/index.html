<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the duo threads have been done to death but I've narrowed it down to specifics that I'd like some insight on. I'm quite experienced in EQ, especially with Shamans, but I've been away from the game since before PoP came out so I'm way behind on knowing what's changed. Basically I want to play a Shaman for sure and want to 2 box him with another class. I was originally going to do it with an SK which is my favorite class, but I've done it before with a Monk and really want to do something different than melee. I know Necros and Mages are both very powerful but I'm trying to decide which would complement the Shaman the best.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking Necro has great utility spells combined with stackable DOT's for insane DPS. They also can FD, fear, snare and their lich line will be awesome when used with the Shaman's regen. My only worry is that their pet just won't hold up as well, even with slowed enemies.<br />
<br />
Mages on the other hand have nukes which are a great thing if I need to burn something down very quickly. I know their pets are far superior to Necro's and with the Shaman buffs on it and a slow'd mob I'm sure it will eat through just about anything. What I'd be mostly missing is a snare and I lose some of the utility of the Necro.<br />
<br />
My goal is to be able to do just about anything with this duo. I know that Necros, mages and shamans all can do some amazing things alone and I'm sure any combo of the 3 would do great. What I'm really wanting is to be able to get a wide variety of loot and do some of the harder quests without help. My playtime will vary so it will be difficult to do some of these things relying on a group but if I have a powerful duo then I can do it myself.<br />
<br />
I really want to do the Necro option and play 2 Iksars. I want the regen and natural AC bonus so that I can get away with lesser gear at first. However if I went the Mage option I'd probably get a Troll shaman so I could get the snare necklace. As I said I think I'd prefer the Necro with my playstyle, but my biggest worry is at the higher levels the necro pet may not keep as well as I could hope, especially if slow doesn't land. I know a mage pet can tank like a warrior, especially if buffed I just hate to lose the Necro's utility.<br />
<br />
What would you guys suggest in this situation and what kind of things do you think possible with either duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally lean towards Necro.  Pet is basically equal, FD, and Rez, and depending on gear, generally higher dps.<br />
<br />
In addition, the necro's dmg lineup is in sync with yours more.  If you have to root/rot because the mob is too tough for the pet, Necro will be of far more use.<br />
<br />
Then again... Me, another shaman, and a mage were waiting for coh in Yxxta for Uqua.  We pulled a cragbeast for the heck of it.  Two shaman could heal the mage pet against the GoD mob just fine:)  Shocked me.  Of course, I burned like 4k mana on heals lol.  <br />
<br />
Trust me, duoing hard stuff is so much more enjoyable if your necro can just FD and rez you.  Mage pet might be slightly tougher, but it'll do you no good if you can't pull singles, can't root rot, and can't rez if you get overwhelmed.  <br />
<br />
Ok.. this is the last duo thread I ever comment on haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well at least mine was well thought out :) I just needed some opinions of those that are more in the know with the states of other classes since I've been away.<br />
<br />
Thank you though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go with necro.  Reason being is pet kiting.  Necro's can snare and draw insane agro, just send in both your pet and the necro's pet and just run the mob around in circles.  The pets will pretty easily kill it as will your DoTs.   I've seen a necro in our guild keep solid agro vs the entire raid (on a stationary non-summoning mob).  Noone else could pull him off the mob's agro target.<br />
<br />
Necro's just have too many spells that are invaluable to a duo.  Mez, FD, very good pet, DoTs, SNARE, Rez, etc.<br />
<br />
Unless you really want for RP reasons I'd go with a non-troll/iksar.  The AC/Regen just don't really benefit you that much imo compared to the massive xp hit you take (20%) that is completely out of date and should be removed.  By not having the penality you'll level faster offsetting the loss of the little bit of regen.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it now, on a pure xp stand point, I'd go with Froglok Shaman (for the ultravision and no xp penalty) and gnome Necro (gnomes get an xp bonus right?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Necro all the way , although both is GREAT !! no whining tanks asking for buffs all the time (FA blues)  :p <br />
<br />
Necros save butt (agro kite ) , and as pointed out have rez and summon corpse , fd for pulling tricky stuff , and snare ( a must ). And if they have all their crit aff AA's and DD AA's they are the most awesome sight around .<br />
<br />
Maybe im biased as I am lucky enough to have a necro partner with over 500 aa's . We take down mobs that I see groups wipe out on .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd definitely go with a Necro.  In tandum with a Shaman that's quite a bit of power sir.<br />
<br />
Jara - I've not known anyone to be able to outaggro me when I try, which granted isn't too often these days :)  The only time I have an issue on aggro is if they had a decent head start, and even then it's only limited to a few classes (warriors and admittedly necros!).  It's tough to keep up with a lot of dots ticking away on top of spamming TA.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well it sounds like Necro is the way to go and is more in line with what I thought would be fun. Mages seem powerful but a tad boring because their method of killing is pretty much the same at all levels. Necros can change it up depending on situation which is what I like. <br />
<br />
Since someone mentioned race I had a few questions. I don't know much about frogs but are there any penalties that frogloks have? Can they wear plate, etc..? It would be nice to have a good and evil race so that I could go bank anywhere with one of each. I'd go dark elf with my Necro just because I've always liked Dark elves so that's a no brainer for me.<br />
<br />
Also a few more q's if you guys don't mind. Would you recommend leveling them together from the beginning or solo them up until 10 or so? I was thinking it'd be hard to gain the defensive and weapons skills while 2 boxing at first because I couldn't keep control of both of them in melee situations. I was thinking solo to at least 10 and then start grouping them, but again I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lvl them together the best you can , that way u will know how to deal with any situation u may encounter . By the time u have lvled up to a high lvl , your skills would be maxed anyway . This is just my opinion and I'll prolly be disproved  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vivitron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't worry about faction for banking, it really doesn't matter in post POP EQ. You can get to pok to bank from just about any old world city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im sorta contemplating this duo too.  I remember back to the days i would duo with my mage friend, and we would destroy stuff.  But then again, i also remember growing up under my guild leader at the time, he was a Necro, and watching him come into a grp and take us all the way into a zone, kill the boss mob with us, and get us all out safely.  We would have most deffinitely died if he didnt show up, so watching his power was truely a sight to see.  But i think im just gonna do both.  Lvl em up and see which one i like to play with more.  After about 30 or so i should have a final answer on the one im gonna keep.<br />
<br />
As for lvling, i would suggest lvl up to 20 or so as solo as possible, make sure you tank a lot.  After 20 you are going to be getting less and less into the fight and it will take more for defense to skill up.  You will always be able to learn to control both chars. post 30s and do it to the point where when you hit 50s 60s you should have the timing down perfect.  Lower lvls are for gaining the defense skill imo, and to do that well now a days you need to get in the fight and take the hits often.  Just my 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I did some more research and it seems that everyone who has input on a necro/shaman duo seems to assume that I will be aggro kiting everything. Maybe this will be done outside but I was thinking more along the lines as having the necro pet tank the mob while I slowed and healed and the necro just loaded up his DOTs then FD. <br />
<br />
Is this a viable option for a Necro pet or would the mage pet be more suited to this style of gameplay. I figured that any mob that I could slow could be tanked by a necro pet and the DPS from the necros DOT's along with my Dot's and dog would make the fight short enough to keep the pet alive. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not really, Necro pets don't tank too well. Nor will it taunt well.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 necro (which I haven't bought omens for yet) and of course my level 70 shaman. Child of Bertoxxulous did alright tanking anything slowed up through valor and whatnot but anything beyond that was just too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Oh and chain mujaki (now soulspike) is actually pretty badass if the nec is tanking, har har.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are planing to do straight-up tanking, the Mage pets are a much better choice than the Necro pets.<br />
<br />
As a counterpoint to Grizlor's experience with his necro pet tanking in PoP, I used to have the level 61 Air pet tanking slowed mobs in ToSR with only the Mage healing it (with the 1200 point PoP heal). The new 66+ pets are even better.<br />
<br />
I must admit a certain degree of bias when I say I would go Mage first without any hesitation, since I have been playing a mage as my main since release day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think anyone has mentioned the necro staple yet - mobs up to lvl 55 can be fear kited and there is no easier way (and usually safer way) to gain xp. With this method you don't have to waste mana healing pets and can use all your mana for offense = faster kills = more xp per hour.<br />
<br />
I used to fear kite in Overthere with my necro and could easily go 2-3 mobs before having to med a bit - these were very high blues and even whites at mid to high 30's, plus you could run to the guards if you got into trouble (nice having lvl 50+ guards to run to in your 30's :) ). Only problem was the KS'ing dragoons doing their patrols :(<br />
<br />
Necro all the way for me - FD and rez save a lot of heartache although it will be a while before your necro sees the rez.<br />
<br />
Races, you seem set on dark elf but gnome is probably the best for the necro - gnome necros are mostly not kos in both evil or good cities plus you get access to tinkering if you want to take that up.<br />
<br />
For shaman, lots of threads about best race for shaman. My personal opinion trolls and iksar advantages don't outweigh the 20% penalty. <br />
<br />
As an ogre I would say the 15% penalty is bearable for the unstunnability but your 2 races would start to drift apart in levels.<br />
<br />
Froglok, Vah Shir and Barb seem to match best and I don't think there is much to pick between them but Vah Shir would just edge it for me with innate sneak and safe fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah depends on what you are looking for... <br />
<br />
Mages are insane their pet is a real work horse and as it was said the air pet can stun up to lvl 70.... those are mobs that you cant touch with a Shaman/Necro Duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vanexx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necros 67 pet tanks just fine for most things you will xp on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd go mage.  I think that the Necro may offer some nice possibilities, but I almost think that to maximize the necro/shammy combo you are going to be doing a lot of work.<br />
<br />
I think it will be much easier to maximize char potential with a mage than with a necro.  Use whatever to pull, mage sends pet and casts a debuff if necessary, based on timing, switch over to shammy and land the slow.<br />
<br />
I think the necro may offer better options in say 15% of the scenarios that you are going to face on an hour to hour basis.  The rest of the time, I'm thinking that mage pet would be your staple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree 100% with Mages being a TON easier also.<br />
<br />
Think about it this way.  Mage=220 dps and never draws agro off of the shaman.  Pet=100dps + Mage nuking (easy)= 120dps through the fight. <br />
<br />
Necro to keep up 220dps is doing a WHOLE lot of Dots and FD to clear agro and what not. <br />
<br />
BTW my lvl 67 Wiz with Strike of Solusek and Max Crit Nukes AA (up through PoP)with 30% Fire Damage ring.... Max crits for ~6500.   The mage I grouped with the ONLY thing better the mage had was the lvl 67 Omens spell (that he duo'ed with his shaman to get) and one level of Omens Crit Nukes AA. His max crit is ~6600.  And due to the one higher level of Omen AA he crits for max more often.  I realize that when the wiz gets their Omens spell and another level of Crit AA the wiz will pull ahead but still the gap is so close that when you add a pet with 7k unbuffed hp, the fact that the pet can stun up to lvl 70 mobs AND it dishes 100+ dps all by just hitting the /pet attack button... that's crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vanexx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Might be sacriledge to say, but run the necro as main and run hotkeys/macros on shammy..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd go with necro for 2 reasons ... snare and FD.  yea the snae kinda blows but the ability to FD split made it much easier for me to Duo safely.  I used to keep it snared and  sit stand and keep the mob always running between me and the necro (it is tough to get the dot aggro balanced tho) but that was almost a year ago and no longer have access to a necro but that is how i did it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you say something like that no one on these boards will bother listening to your ideas anymore.  this site is for people who WANT to play shamans as mains, not for people who want to macro shamans...<br />
if you want to macro a shaman go to http://www.macroquest2.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=9165<br />
but don't bother posting here.<br />
<br />
not to say post count means anything but i doubt you even care what i have to say...<br />
<br />
edit- btw, i run around with a guy who plays 6 toons without macroquest or any such program, and he runs them just as well if not better than someone who macros....this proves to me that you can play a shaman as a main and play classes such as necros or bards with pure effectiveness...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a 65 necro (which I haven't bought omens for yet) and of course my level 70 shaman.

<br />
I do solro regularly with my necro and shaman duo.  The pet does fine, just use the combination of protection of calliv (think thats it) and Q to keep him alive until slow and your golden.  Beyond that I would have a hard time seeing any pet really do a spectacular job at tanking.  There are a few places in OoW I could see it working well also.  As far as aggro goes, well if the pet is tanking the shaman really shouldn't dot as our dots seem to draw a silly amount of aggro so I mainly heal and do damage with my necro. fd if you draw too much (generally I fd every two dots or so, fd aa is $$).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If your lazy like me I'd say go with mage. /pet attack nuke once or twice and you dont have to do anymore on your mage. Also where mobs do summon in OoW I really dont see you being able to tank with a necro pet very well compared to mage pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Necro - hands down.<br />
<br />
BIGGEST PERK OF ALL: regen. Shaman and necro are individually self-sufficient on mana regen - the necro passively. A mage WILL have to worry about having KEI or such at higher levels to keep a steady, fast killing pace. With shaman providing necro with regen (health) it is just heaven.<br />
<br />
When a necro talks about aggro kiting don't fall for the illusion that a large kite path is needed. As long as there is enough room to keep out of hitting range a necro can aggro kite.<br />
<br />
As for who is the main the and who is the &quot;bot,&quot; Galelor, chill a bit. I duo a shaman and necro and neither is the main, neither is the bot. There are situational instances where the shaman is primary (most attended to) and the necro is support. The reverse is also true. Neither is &quot;special&quot; as they are working as a team - each contributing what is needed in a particular situation.<br />
<br />
Both are capable of saving the &quot;group&quot; in more ways than one. Getting aggro can sometimes be more important than preventing it - especially when duoing. For both shaman and necro getting aggro is just a spell cast away.<br />
<br />
DO NOT FORGET necros also get slow - for undead mobs. Charm also. These are very handy spells during mid levels up to 65. Veksar is a nice leveling as well as gear improving zone if you are working camps to gear your toons as they level. Besides slow and charm, the necro undead nukes are extremely mana efficient.<br />
<br />
As you can tell, I am necro biased as a shaman duo partner. That shouldn't take anything from mages. In my experience, a mage is a great shaman partner also. I do however think the options and opportunities for a mage/shaman are more limited and much less imaginative.<br />
<br />
Shaman and necro are ying and yang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You wanna dou/solo? then necro/sham rocks.<br />
<br />
You wanna join a guild? then sham/mage rocks cause mage adds 20 odd dps to sham (toys) and sham adds 20 odd dps to mage pet (avatar and buffs) plus you can bind yer sham close to the entrance and be a COTH pair (great raid latecommer tool).<br />
<br />
ALSO shams are very very very busy in raids if they want to contribute a lot. Mages send in the pet and nuke everytime they reach 80% mana.<br />
<br />
BUT necros can manapump clerics.....<br />
<br />
If you wanna duo, go the necro, if you want to raid go the mage.<br />
<br />
If you want to be loved and chased, go a cleric 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why does everyone keep saying duo? He's not talking about duoing he's talking about 2boxing. There is a HUGE difference. You're not talking about a Necro or Mage playing at 100% potential, time and focus will be split between two toons, His shaman and his mage or necro. Necro and shaman both need alot of attention to maximize there effectiveness. Mage doesnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mage Pros:<br />
Best Pet tank in the game<br />
Air Pet stuns up to level 70<br />
Shaman buffs have more effect on Mage air pets then Necro pets (ie, more stunning)<br />
Very Easy to two-box (macro /pet attack, /cast 1, /cast 1)<br />
Improved invis and Call of Hero makes traveling easy<br />
<br />
Mage Cons:<br />
Lack much of necromancers utility<br />
PITA epic 1.0<br />
<br />
Necro Pros:<br />
Feign Death<br />
Snare<br />
Great Pulling<br />
Good DPS<br />
3rd best pet tank in the game<br />
Charm/Dire Charm good pets<br />
Self mana regen = no need to KEI<br />
Mez at low levels<br />
Fun AA's<br />
Fear Kiting rocks 1-55ish<br />
Agro Kiting works level 12-70.<br />
<br />
Necro Cons:<br />
Difficult to 2box to full efficency<br />
Is debatable whether or not Pet tanking is viable at higher levels<br />
Agro kiting is a PITA when 2boxing<br />
<br />
So, what's my opinion?  If you're two boxing, save yourself a headache and go mage.  If you have another IRL friend, have 'em play a necro and the two of you go to town.  If you are an experienced 2-boxer and know how difficult necro/shaman combo is and think you can do it... why you reading what I think?  Go play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>forsurenot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am a shaman and been duoing with Necro for awhile.  The 67 Pet when LDoN focus equipped, geared, with Wunshi and Conviction have nearly 9K HPs.  It has good defence, and very good at holding aggro, where I can slow right after engage, malo, then keep a Bane on it, + 1 or 2 poison rains depends on mob hps.  We camped instanced named to farm runes/item since lvl 65.  And now it's like a breeze that we got most of our OoW spells from farming.  We occationally go to RCoD and can try camp named with another a cleric friend, just for conviction refresh+spell haste.  Necro FD and Dps, Pet tank (it life taps and stun) , snare, we can pretty much kill anything a single group can kill.<br />

Anyways, Necro/Shammy duo = +++++!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm quite experienced in EQ, especially with Shamans, but I've been away from the game since before PoP came out<br />
<br />
I've done it before with a Monk and really want to do something different than melee.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the lines above are critical. It was a very different world 2 years ago and it's hard to advise a person who hasn't seen at least 600 hitters considered trash mobs in PoP and even harder hitting critters considered trash mobs in GoD+. Conversely, Shamanic healing is much more powerful at 65+ than it was at 60, and I am not sure how to best illustrate the difference.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a faster game than it was back in the days of high HP/low damage mobs and you need to be able to hit buttons faster, which makes two boxing harder. I two box my Monk Shaman from time to time, but it's generally more work than I like and I doubt I would enjoy a Shaman/Necro duo, at least played to its potential.<br />
<br />
Mages sound like vastly less work, although I never played one. Also, they do need KEI+ at higher levels, but you'll find it for sale in PoP most times of the day. Besides, droppable mana regen (formerly known as FT) items and easy to get augments are plentiful now, so it is not quite as bad as you might think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Snare is great to have as when your two boxing rooting is very difficult to maintain.<br />
<br />
Rooting is also a pain when two boxing cause stuff hits the closest npc when rooted, and manouvering it the weak point of two boxin.<br />
<br />
However its faster to PL a mage than a necro cause mages have tougher pets, and they have a DS.<br />
<br />
I'd go the mage, cause with the fight durations being so short, you need to be very busy on a sham, and you drop your effeciveness very very quickly when not cannying and such in order to run another box.<br />
<br />
Ive tried all the different combo's over the years, and i'd have to say the mage is probably the most group fun, great low maintenance dps to add to your debuffing power.<br />
<br />
Mind you, from 1 - 4 hit everfrost for slaughter round the pok stone, then you can hit Paludial till 20.<br />
<br />
Dont worry bout root pet, wont stick anyway when pl'n, use fire for the ds.<br />
<br />
Give it one of them poles from poj (cant remember what its called) that you buy in the baz for about 5pp (two hander with bigger than innate dmg).<br />
<br />
You should get him to 20 in a night.<br />
<br />
Then head to Nadox and do the shaman rot/zone thing.<br />
<br />
pull mob, send in pet(s), land two dots, wait till mob at 15% then zone.<br />
<br />
mage needs to do 1pt dmg to get the xp. PEt needs to do at least 20 which should be ok.<br />
<br />
At the nadox zoneline you can do the fire ele's and the guards on the other side of the zone.<br />
<br />
Will get you to 40 pretty quick.<br />
<br />
30 - 47 is a bit of a pain.<br />
But with oow it may be a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
