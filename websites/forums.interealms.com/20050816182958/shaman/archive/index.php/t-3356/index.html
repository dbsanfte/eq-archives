<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The spell I would like to see the shaman class get and will push for believe it or not is GROUP SHRINK ! <br />
<br />
Ever been on a Tov, Ssra, Grieg, Etc.. raid and had to be the shaman they passed around from group to group to individaully shrink 50 people in the raid? YUCK!<br />
<br />
I think it would need to have a confirmation box  like &quot;Do you wish to be shrunk?&quot; YES NO or something but there ya go...<br />
<br />
Moo!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">but that would ruin the effect on the VT loot that already does this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's pretty lame that the only way to get this effect ATM is in VT anyway. It's not like Group Shrink is some kind of uber effect which gives massive l33t abilities. It's a utility which would, if nothing else, save every shaman an incredible amount of frustration. If a person needs to be 'endgame' level uber to not deal with frustration every time a raid goes indoors, then that's a really ****ty way to put a game together.</div></div><hr />

I'd settle for just having a confirmation box and removing the group-only restriction, but I'd much prefer group shrinking. Ideally, both would be implemented, allowing for /targetgroupbuff to work.</div></div><hr />

Doubt we'll ever get snare.  Stun... maybe a poison based stun would be something we could eventually see, but it would be resisted by any mob immune to stun of course.  But nice to use on completely MR mobs that can be stunned otherwise.<br />

But, even with the Orb available, I still want to see a group shrink spell.</div></div><hr />

I must admit that group shrink would be awsome.. Also removing that dumb &quot;indoor&quot; limitation.. <br />
If potion works outdoor, then spell should work outdoor. Also, with group shrink, group grow.<br />
<br />
BTW have you ever casted grow on a druid pet ? You can make it the size of the huge boss bear on PoG ) Usually druids are happy to see their pet that size.. But we all know that size doesn't matter :D <br />

So you have problems soloing casters without stun and snare? Maybe some melee have problems soloing melee mobs, should they ask for castable slow? How about torpor too? Sounds silly doesn't it. If a melee came here and said they should get those spells would you flame them? Sure you would and rightly so.

Its truely sad so many old shaman are quitting this game becuase the whiners shall inherit the earth. when there is a problem with the shaman class why would the dev even want to fix it when the entire fanbase is whining about crap like this.<br />

I think a few of you guys should actually look at what other classes get for spells and actually look at what we get for spells. compare them and then ask yourself who has the right to complain.</div></div><hr />

Oh jesus another a*shole on the board.  Ya i wana be able to stop a mob from gating, that warrents melee getting slow and torpor, your such an idiot.  <br />

My god you mention you would like to have a couple utility spells and you get flamed by some j*rkoff.  <br />

Let me get this straight im supposedm to take down my epic and equip my howling harpoon, melee and hope stun procs, and hope it isnt resisted before the mob gates.  Jee thats really smart :p<br />

Also, isnt that snare spear from, uhh veeshan's peak?  <br />

I solo for XP I don't group anymore, whats the big f*ckin deal about having a spell that stuns a mob.  Clerics, Paladins, Druids, they all have stun spells but shaman getting one oh no that would be unbalancing rofl.<br />

By all means lets reduce the class boundries even more so you can solo a caster with less risk. Shamans don't need a snare spell, they don't need a stun spell. If you find you NEED these spells to kill something, maybe break down and group with a class that has them? <br />

Ya its called swapping. You want a real suggestion? Fight the mob close enough to its bind point so it doesn't gate. Works wonders.

Clerics, Paladins, Druids, they all have stun spells but shaman getting one oh no that would be unbalancing rofl.  <br />

If all classes had the same spells, what would be the point of classes? Because some other class has a spell doesn't mean a shaman should get it as well.</div></div><hr />

As if there is not enough class overlap already.  Why don't we just give everyone all the same spells and get over with it.  It's pretty stupid to waste your time asking for things you will never get.  <br />
<br />
I think what Madd is asking for is not unreasonable.  However, I cringe everytime I see a thread like this.  It is inevitable that it will degenerate into people acting like this is the druid board and asking for everything from rez, ports, stuns, snare to freakin manaburn and complete heal.<br />
<br />
Impressive amount of swearing and avoiding the filter there Thunndar.   Now if only you could put some of the creative thinking you used to circumvent the swear filter to work on how to stop gaters and runners...</div></div><hr />

I half agree and half dont - I would only like this if they increased the number of buff slots that you are allowed at any one time from 15 to say maybe 20.<br />

There... now you can kill casters. Why anyone would want to I don't know. They almost always do more damage than a melee version. <br />
<br />
Should be thankful you can root too instead of bitching you don't have snare. Monks, Warriors, Rogues and to an extent Mages can't even do that. I think if you ask anyone they'll tell you Monks are the kings of AA farming, and they don't have ANY way to stop runners. More thinking about EQ and less thinking about swear filters. If you were REAL clever you would've used ASCII codes.<br />
<br />
Plus, unless those melees carry around a nice stack of pumice (with no channelling ability and at 30pp a pop) they can't remove a DS either. So soloing most casters is off limits to them too.<br />

Returning after a long EQ-hiatus (finally getting my Fungi traded in for Torpor drew me back in, cant wait to scribe it), I read we suddenly need Stun and Snare as spells?<br />
<br />
Is this idea the influx of Ex-Druids and Ex-Necros that began to switch to our class?<br />
<br />
If you really have problems with gating casters and still want to solo them despite this being a group game sgc316, take a small trip to the  Stonebrunt Mountains. Our hairy little friends there drop equippable totems with a rightclickable stun with castingtime under 8 seconds. Its only 5 charges, but they arent lore anyway.<br />
<br />
Does nice for some emergency interrupts, dont know if its viable to use them for hunting casters full time (I dont know if hunting casters full time in itself is viable though :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">One person wants Snare and Stun; there's no 'we' stuff, I definately don't.  That is way outside our area of spells and the people imo, who think we need it have no idea of class balance and are just thinking about their own 'uberness'.   Get in a group with someone who can snare and stun if you 'need' it so much.<br />
<br />
Why can't people be reasonable and consider the impact it would have on other classes and if it would REALLY make us more useful in the end game?  Because really, that's ALL we need balanced for.  If you have all your lvl 60 spells, if you can't solo effectively, you might want to relook at your strategy.<br />
<br />
IMO; the ONLY things that need looked at for our class;<br />
<br />
lvl 60 spell drops - if Torpor and Malo are class defining (and we all know they are) spells, getting them should be possible without being in an Uber guild.  A long, involved, money sink of a quest like PotC would be keen.<br />
<br />
Raid Stackability - Whether that's making us more effective as a secondary healer, making us have a better range of stackable Buffs or Debuffs or whatever, just make additional shaman on a raid useful.<br />
<br />
But the whole concept of giving us totally new powers, is not only beyond the scope of Class Balancing, it's greedy, short sighted and inconsiderate to everyone else in another class who also wants to be 'useful'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Group Shrink would be a relief (and group growth would be a comic relief :D). Without the absurdly outdated indoor/dungeon limitation. And with at least a confirmation box (which would take care of ANY grieving use you could fear from shrink) or, more interestingly, with a player controlled '/sizevar [on|off|maybe]' command (persistent, stored in the eqclient.ini) that would allow a player to always accept or refuse or be asked for confirmation when a shrink or growth spell is cast on him. <br />
<br />
- A new, post-55 DD, in the 800+ range, either poison or cold or maybe disease for a variation. Or maybe Fire, if Verant is looking into something to irritate the druids. Possibly with a recast time greater than 15 or 30 seconds and a mana ratio just a touch better than Ice Strike to appease the number-crunching crowd. <br />

- A level 59 combined AGI/STA/CHA (heh... may as well throw it in and I never saw anyone complain of having too much CHA) buff under one icon to mirror the STR/DEX/HP of Focus. And a level 60 group version. And no AC component unless you make it stack with Aego. That or expand the freaking buff range to 18 with an additional 3 slot only for bard songs. Either would be grand.<br />
<br />
- Level 59 or 60 Malevolent Spirit, for level 40-42 pet with a werewolf skin and combat capacities at least comparable to the pet a level 58 SK can summon. I don't begrudge the SK their pet but it still freaking ridiculous that of two pet using class, the hybrid has a better pet than the pure caster. And either make it a quest or make it drop on the Velious or Luclin tables because, whatever the fixes done, the Kunark drops are still an utter mess.<br />
<br />
- And if, after 2+ years, they still want to actually do 'something interesting about Disease DOT' someday, here is an idea... Have the regen rate of the MOB cut by 10%/disease counter from a disease DOT (to a max 90%). That would work out a 10% for Sicken, 40% for Affliction or Scouge and 90% Plague or Pox. Now, THAT would be something interesting about Disease DOT. And Necros would like it too. And there is only a handful of MOB on which that would be visibly useful too, making it the perfect Verant upgrade: showy, but completely pointless most of the time.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, the one thing that I would have to agree with everyone on would be a group shrink spell that is able to be cast with /tgb on. If they cannot do that, then at the very least they should change it from group only to putting a confirmation box on it just like on translocates.</div></div><hr />

That will sure address many issues with the shaman class. Or how about new STA buff? Too bad many high level tanks are already at 205+. Or how about new AC buffs? If someone really wants HP, we already have PE.<br />
<br />
How about increasing duration on RH/Brute?<br />
How about uncrippling Primal Essence?<br />
How about giving us back the beta SoL poison DD?<br />
How about juggernauts actually dropping Malo and Torpor?<br />
<br />
But no, let's hope VI gives us more Group Acumen, Group Shrink, Group CHA, Group True North and other junk spells. That will sure address the many issues of the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">What issues of the shaman class? We can solo pratically anything outdoor, including MOBs that no other class can touch. Unlike most of the solo classes, we are wanted and extremely useful in exp or loot groups. Most raids are no-go without at least one shamans or come to a screeching halt when the last shaman leaves. We have a pet but don't require it to group or solo. We have the best slow in the game (or the ONLY slow where MR MOBs are concerned), DDs, DOTs, buffs, debuffs, heals, Cannibalize, etc.<br />
<br />
Plus, we have had the development team running so scared since Kunark that they haven't brought themselves to add any seriously NEW spells to our lines or to really fix the drop rates on our level 58+ spells. If there is an 'issue' about the shaman class, it's that we're the victim of our own success.<br />
<br />
Considering that, they will NEVER give use snares or stuns (because, honestly, we don't need them) or anything seriously out of the range of things we can already do. They don't want to have another bad surprise 2 weeks down the line because we're suddenly even more capable than they ever imagined we would get. So all we can hope for are for minimal *adjustments*. Spells that combines things that we already do, extension on our lines or maybe, just maybe some global change that happen to benefit  us because it benefits other classes too.</div></div><hr />

Why do people always have to reply with sarcasm?<br />
<br />
Look, putting charisma in a combo-buff is just kinda pointless. In combat, there's only two classes who actively want charisma, and by the time you're getting these combo buffs, they've generally got all the charisma they need. Outside of combat, for selling et al, there's really no need for any effect other than charisma, so your charisma buff works fine. It's just a matter of sense.</div></div><hr />

Because it was the first thing he did after getting out of bed that morning and was pissed? :D<br />
<br />
But you're right. CHA is fairly irrelevent but for 'chanties and bards, and it would probably be messed up in a couple of AoE. I can think of 2 reason a to put CHA there though.<br />
<br />
a) Verant like making combo buffs with 3 components. Acumen? See Invis, UV and STA regen. Focus? STR, DEX and HP. SOE? SOW, Lev and See Invis. DMF? EB, Lev and PR. And so on, and so forth. So, if they go around making a third combo spell for us and CHA isn't the third component of it, what does it leave? AC? And since none of our AC spells stacks with with Aego... instant obsolescence. SOW? Can't be cast indoor then. ATK? Yeah, right... like they would give us something actually useful, plus you can just bet it would end  up messing a bunch of hybrid spell. Bearform? Wouldn't the druids be tickled pink if we suddenly had a share-beaform and a group-bearform...<br />
<br />
b) Heh... for all we know, put +55 CHA on the puller or the MT, especially if it comes without an additional icon, and Divine Intervention may actually see some use? <br />
<br />
But who cares about CHA. What I really would still like is at least 3 more buff spaces for everybody and an additionnal 3 more dedicated to the $@#! bard song. I am tired of nearly dying because my last buff slot is neatly filled up by a Chorus and neither Torpor nor CE can land on me.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure a mob will gate even if you pull 2 mobs.  Snare is another story though, and it depends what 2 mobs you pull.  If you pull 2 frogloks, the first one won't run.
