<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my list of things that must be fixed before I'll purchase GoD.  I've quit hoping that Bane, Rabid Bear, and Alchemy Mastery will ever be fixed.  But I'm drawning the line here:<br />
<br />
1.  Make Chaotic Pain drop in place of Plague of Daruda<br />
2.  Make our Ancient spell a DD something like this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4973&amp;source=Live) or this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4975&amp;source=Live)<br />
3. Fix throwable potions so they stack like other throwing items<br />
4. Fix SC IV and V so they are true upgrades<br />
<br />
Chaotic Pain is NOT an upgrade.  It simply makes mana regeneration at 65 more convenient.  It should not be a reward for finishing content that at the moment is beyond the reach of ALL players.  Rather, it should be available to ALL shamans, regardless of play style.  Virtually every other class gets a new spell that is slightly less effective than their Ancient spell.  We get nothing.  Plus we get a bunch of lack luster, bugged AA's, and yet more alchemy that doesn't work right.<br />
<br />
Someone asked Brenlo if shamans would be ingored in GoD.  He said no.  He lied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Asking for anything of Sony on these boards is a lost cause.   Since our community is now hosted by a person that Sony finds objectionable, any request here is likely to have the opposite effect.<br />
<br />
Some of them do read these boards... but as long as we've sold out to SuperSales, they will not listen to anything we have to say except to think &quot;Yeahup, that one really got their goats... good job!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say that 3 &amp; 4 will probably be fixed.  1 &amp; 2 are a long shot, though.<br />
<br />
Chaotic Pain IS an upgrade.  Why?  Because it gives the ability to regen more (if only a little more) mana while doing other things.  Should it have been added a long time ago?  For sure.  Should it be easier to obtain?  Definitely.  But don't get your hopes up.<br />
<br />
I don't blame you for taking this stand.  It's disappointing, sure.  But there's a lot of good stuff in the expansion you'll miss out on.  An expansion is far more than just it's spells and AAs.  Don't limit yourself to that.  /beg</div></div><hr />

I dont quite understand, are you trying to be a total ass or not? You didnt always seem to be this arrogant but maybe you changed?<br />
<br />
So what if it takes 1492 of your precious points if the zones where you get points are strictly for people like you? Is that really sensible or wise? And does it really make the rest of us (&gt;95%) into whiners?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, you don't understand.  I was all for having our spells cost 1492 (or whatever) from LDoN type zones that everyone  could get into.   Personally it makes no difference to me, but having them purchaseable with adv points is fair to everyone.  I was stating how so many whined and bitched that 1492 was too much, almost all of those people being those not in high end guilds.   I wonder how many that were whining about 1492 points are actually happier with the way it is now?  I'd bet almost none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thrilled to be able to buy RGC for 800AP instead of 60Kpp.  Especially since my quild has finished Luclin yet.  Not that plat is not easier to get just that 60k is an amount I have never had at one time and even at that RGC was not alway to be found in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If the new spell can be purchased for AP I will be happy with the price.  I still think the spells should be a bit better but that is a fight we fought and lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly my point, Jaradis.  Ancient spells for other classes are modest upgrades of new spells that they get in GoD from other sources  (drops, quests, adventure points, etc.)<br />
<br />
Examples: <br />
<br />
Thrushar's Frost, beastlord, 743dd, 274 mana<br />
Ancient Frozen Chaos, beastlord, 810dd, 300mana<br />
<br />
Order, cleric, 1210dd, 401 mana<br />
Ancient Chaos Censure, cleric, 1320dd, 438mana<br />
<br />
Sylvan Fire, druid, 1705dd, 430mana<br />
Ancient Chaos Frost, druid, 1860dd, 464mana<br />
<br />
and the list goes on.  Spend some time on Lucy.<br />
<br />
Shamans were treated very differently from other classes.  Our accessible spell is a useless DoT that isn't even an upgrade of existing spells.  Our Ancient spell is something that should be accessible to all shamans who play the game.  It doesn't increase shaman power.  I barely keeps up with the status quo.  It's like C2 was compared to C1, for those of you who remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So does that make you happier or the game you play better?<br />
<br />
I dont think I whined about 1492 being too much for me but it was easy for me to decide on my own that it wasnt worth it to me so I dont have a single spell from LDON - or any other item for that matter except stuff that dropped while doing adventures.<br />
<br />
If you want the game to be this way there is nothing I can say that will change it but its really difficult to see how its fun or how its a wise business decision. Maybe in the the short run it is (and that very well explains how messed up this latest expansions seems) but in the long run it will kill EQ. And you and your uberguild friends wont be enough for SOE to keep the servers running. I give EQ a year (max!) from now to reach a point where half the current players have left.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile you can enjoy the latest expansion which I helped pay for because I bought it based on false/very lacking information from SOE yet I probably wont be using it very much if at all. But the next expansion you get to pay for all by yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All they have to do to get me to buy the expansion is make the canni spell acquireable by people that aren't in high end raiding guilds (drop the damn ancient tag on it!).  That would be the only reason (besides maybe the secondary forte AA) for me to get the expansion.<br />
<br />
However, I think the chances are greater of pigs sprouting wings than SOE changing anything on the spells, but (PLEASE!) prove me wrong!</div></div><hr />

You can have my expansion I doubt I am gonna use it much until WoW releases hehe. And definately not at all after WoW is out.</div></div><hr />
