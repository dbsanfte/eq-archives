<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what buffs of shaman stack with the bard.. and also with other classes.. thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All buffs stack with bards other than SoW at lower levels (Unless they fixed this).  The only real issue is Focus not stacking with Paper Tank/Cleric self buffs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure all shaman buffs stack with all bard buffs. Cleric's self hp buff + mana regen shields do NOT stack with shaman's Focus line. You can however stack IoS onto them. Similiarly the self-shields mage/enc/wiz/nec have don't stack with focus, but do stack with IoS. FA doesn't stack with enchanter's NDT...SoW and Bih Li don't stack with SoE. I believe there is a ranger self attack buff that FA doesn't stack with, or at least there used to be. About two weeks ago I had trouble with FA overwriting the clicking SK buff from the Goblin Skull Earring that someone was using for a junk buff. But last week we didn't have that problem. So I am not sure if the ranger buff still has stacking problems with FA. FA did stack with the beastlord's single target attack buff (Ferocity?), that surprised me. Hmmm...that's all I can think up right now.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about that one... haven't been able to get myself to save up 20 freakin AA's to try it.  I just cast single target Focus on my pet... and I know that if he started gettin our VoQ's/KEI's, he'd be all addicted, and I'd have to take mah doggydog to rehab :(<br />
<br />
But every one of your spells should stack with bard songs, that I know of, which is the beauty of it.<br />
<br />
As far as shaman stackability, if you have two shaman cast the level 29 brown bear form, then you cast the form of the great bear for a polar bear look, and you three stack so that you are in the middle, you look like a furry oreo!</div></div><hr />
