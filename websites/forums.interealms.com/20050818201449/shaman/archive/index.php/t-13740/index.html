<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I grouped today for the LAST time....<br />
<br />
I hate BoT. I mean really hate it. Either groups go apesh*t trying to move around to hunt named mobs and CR all day or you get trained all day. So when I was asked to go to BoT, I said &quot;Sure. We head to Deep South. If the named pops there, you can all roll on wahtever drops, I don't need any of it. But we go to DS and we STAY there. No moving, no hunting for named.&quot; The cleric who offered me a group agreed to this term. <br />
<br />
We all get to DS and lo, the cleric and wiz both lose the KEI they had recieved earlier. No chanter in BoT (I was shocked) and so, they up and gate to PoK to get some crack. This is 9am on RN server. Took them 30 minutes to get KEI and return. Bad enough, yes, but after the wiz dies 3 times due to overnuking too early, he has to rinse and repeat this cycle. Then the cleric dies once. Another 20 min go by before we return to the grind, as I utterly refused to play main healer, hoping the SK MT we had would get pissed enough to look for new group memebers. Finally, after a half-wipe caused by the SK dragging 4 mobs to us and nobody having the sense to zone, we again need to find KEI for our casters. <br />
<br />
The fact that BoT remained chanterless for 5 hours is amazing in itself. Gotta look into that one day. <br />
<br />
What got my goat is I spent at least 2 hours waiting for crack-headed morons who think that they can't live without KEI/Tranq. I understand that it reduces downtime, but these tards had horses and I am sure it would have been minimal. And I know for dmnaed sure it wouldn't have been 2 out of 5 hours worth of downtime. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: PU groups? Never...again. Ever. Solo xp is a bit slower, but by god at least I don't spend 2 out of 5 hours with a thumb up my butt. <br />
<br />
This is a sign, indeed, that the talent and quality of the players gaining access to higher charachters and zones is not limited...it's falling. To quote George Carlin: The human IQ is passing the human life expectancy...in opposite directions. <br />
<br />
Can anyone firmly deny that the ability of the average Joe to play his charachter HASN'T fallen rapidly? Is this NOT Tardegeddon? Players who used to take other's ability to play their classes without mega-twinkage, over-powered buffs and easy-outs for granted are dwindling and growing in numbers at the same time. Why? We are quitting left and right. <br />
<br />
And we aren't coming back. And we sure as hell won't watch EQ2, SWG or whatever do the same to us again. Not after the work we put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG were those casters not using their horses and/or have ZERO FT or something?<br />
<br />
Gating off to get a KEI is lame IMO (especially if they took 30 mins to get back!).<br />
<br />
But I guess not every class regains mana at the insane rate a Cana 5 Shaman does. :)<br />
<br />
I'd have probably offered to Queisance (or 2k heal) the tank to save the cleric some mana. Last time I did that too much though the cleric complained, asked for a haste and started to melee!! /lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dude, that is the problem! I Q tanks right after slow sinks in, wheter the cleric likes it or not. 99% of the time, he DOES. And then he sits on his horse's @$$ FM for 3 hours till KEI runs out...then has to leave for 20-30min.<br />
<br />
But it's not just these guys..it's EVERYONE of late!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as I utterly refused to play main healer<br />
<br />
There's your problem.  Screw clerics, screw wizards.  Get an sk/pally for a tank, and 4 other melees (or mages/necros) for damage - rangers are monks are particularly good too.  That's all you need, and you have no fools who go running off for kei at first chance.  Plus your healing really can't stand up to named mobs, so no worries about the group wasting an hour to kill a mob that 50% of the time is going to drop nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">**rikkety old shaman mode on**<br />
Youngin these days have it so easy. Back when I was your age I had walk up hill both ways in the snow!!!<br />
**rikkety old shaman mode off**<br />
<br />
In all seriousness things have gotten soo much easier for new up and coming players and those of us playing for a long time have had so long to develope tactics and practice them.<br />
<br />
Just thinking back there have been so many changes making life easier since I started playing.<br />
<br />
No spell book at any level- back when i started you had to look at your spell book all the way to 50.<br />
<br />
Lessened exp loss- yes back in the day you used to loose twice as much exp as you do now a days. Back then no one could revive let alone do an exp res so that exp was gone gone gone.<br />
<br />
Equipement- back when I hit 50 a warrior dual wielding yaks who actually had a haste item was as good as it got. Heck we had warriors wielding exe axes and dual wielding lang sueax's and silvery axe's. We spent days farming phins guards for haste belts after the revamp to kedge so that we could get all our melee's haste items. Now a days most level 20's have a haste item of some sort or another. Weapons that used to be top of the line aren't even worth feeding to pets. C3 and aego in the bazaar? Heck i didn't get my first clarity till i was in my 40's.<br />
<br />
Don't even get my started on the no exp loss no corpse till level 10 or the no spell book to med at any level or the high I can't accidentally hit autoattack on my red as all heck guildmaster.<br />
<br />
Yes new players are spoiled silly and it shows sometimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes BoT is pretty much a sess pool on my server too and one that I thankfully never have to return to again unless we're killing agnarr.</div></div><hr />

Then you get 8 or 9 mana regen/tic simply from that druid buff, and replace the needy cleric at the same time!  Add a pally as main tank and you're completely set with rez and everything!  If casters run off to &quot;get KEI&quot; or whatever, remove them from the group and invite the nearest LFG melee DPS sort.  <br />
<br />
Simple really, just define the limits of how much bull**** you are willing to take!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well named pops right in DS.. so that you didn't have to worry about.. IMO ppl in bot atm are good players but once the flag restriction is lifted my tank will always be guildies, and if I'm not the healer a guildie will be healer.. if the wizzy overnukes you just let him tank..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like having KEI, but I have never paid cash for it. I know shamans get good mana regen, so I guess it's easy for us to do without, but KEI has become a crutch. I've seen people leave to go get KEI at all levels.<br />
<br />
I've been in a group where this addiction has caused deaths - I was playing my alt enchanter in a group in DSP, when the level 28 cleric gated to Nexus while the puller was out pulling, because my clarity wasn't good enough.<br />
<br />
It does make things go faster, but it's considered pretty much mandatory these days, and that's annoying.<br />
<br />
A group can do without KEI, it makes things slower, but as Kkrush points out, not as slow as 30 minutes downtime each time while you try to find someone to cast it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cracks me up just as much as shaman who don't cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Just need to find a happy medium. I never head out to exp without it(although I haven't ever left a group to get it), and when I'm soloing I'm never without. After 3 or so hours it's usually time to sell anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I feel both ways about this issue.  As a shaman, my downtime is self imposed; that means that if I dont want it, its not there.  When soloing the longest downtime I think I've had since about level 45 or so is about 3 minutes.  And that was before Stoicism.  Now my downtimes average about a minute to 90 secs. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I do have an army of alts spread across 2 accounts and every one of them (with the exception of the naked 24 rogue) has to worry about mana.  And every one of them has a KEI account fund that is very important to them.<br />
<br />
Can I solo my wizard without KEI?  Of course.  But the 10 minute medding session after 4 kites gets really old really fast.  Can my SK work without KEI?  Absolutly, but imposing 5 to 10 minutes of downtime on my group after about 15 to 20 minutes of fighting isnt fun for me.  Can my cleric keep up with 3 to 4 melee and a caster or 2?  Yes, but only if all are performing thier roles.  If there is a ranger that thinks hes a tank and wont get his damn finger off of that Taunt hotkey (thats another story) then he's usually looking for another damage dealer while hes desperatly throwing mana at said ranger to keep him standing.<br />
<br />
Yes, it sucks sometimes.  Its annoying to those of us that have incredible mana regen abilities.  I dont hear to often of necros crying about needing a fix either.  But remember that most other classes dont have a steady and reliable system that will get them mana back in a hurry.  <br />
<br />
Also remember that if those casters didnt set 20 minutes out of a three hour period to get KEI then you would be having alot more downtime in your group.  I think its a fair trade.  Ill give someone 20 mintues every three hours to save 20 minutes every 50 to 70 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fireonyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I understand about KEI dependency....  Lvl 52 shammy here (1 damn gold from Canni3, still usin canni 1).  Was in a group yesterday and we where killin the Guards in PoN.  I could of just Malosi and Slow, but I wanted all of my spells on it... Slow/Malosi/Incapacitate/Plague/E-bolt.  And I did get all of those on every single guard we pulled (except the one that feared me for a good measure of the fight, had all but e-bolt).  Could I do all that w/o KEI? Yes... Could I of done it and still have enough mana regened for the next fight?  Hell no! We were pullin yard trash in between pops, and I slowed and incapacitated the banshees, and all 5 on the nettlings.  I have a horse, and am troll /w ikky bp, and had the lvl 63 druid regen on me, which helped even more.  But would it be worthwhile to stop for the 10 min or so for me to go get KEI, or wait on my downtime to get mana back, or even do less debuffs/dots...  Fortunately, we had a chanter bot /w kei there, but I think it would of been worthwhile to drop out of group for 10 min to go get another shot and come back.  You guys with Canni4/5 might be able to do all you want w/o KEI, but if I want to cast all my spells on all my pulls (for faster exp), then ill go get KEI!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Chanters are quitting or playing twinks.<br />
<br />
Why play a class that is used for 1 thing. Buff bitch. Stand up cast kei cast haste and sit down. Go afk for an hour and come back and re haste.<br />
<br />
I am oversimplifying the problem, but basicly. Chanters are sick and tired of being marginalized in the end game. Of being buff bots. Especially when what attracted people to the class was teh power to twist an unwinnable fight into a win.<br />
<br />
Every class has mana regen better than a chanter when they are grouped with a chanter. And guess what due to the Kei craze and the mez and charm and stun nerfs, noone really needs an enchanter when they get thier kei at the bazzar.<br />
<br />
So there are going to be a great deal less chanters. And Come June 1st this will be readily apparent. Because Pahbi has organized a mass cancellation of account by chanter mains to happen on that day. <br />
<br />
Will it work. I am not sure. But I do know due to the charm nerf. Due to the affliction item nerf. Due to Pacification working and allowing single pulls all day long and no real crowd control. Due to bliss being less effective as Root. (Greater immobilise or whatever) Due to tank mezing becoming the mez of choice when available, I have moved a shadowknight to my 65th chanters account and My enchanter Pana will be a buff bitch in fact.<br />
<br />
It is a damn shame that chanters have been getting the shaft for so long. And I know people will start screaming BUT THEY SOLOED MINI NAMED IN BOT!... Guess what. a few of them did. Just like way back when a little shaman that could soloed a dragon.  The nerfs and or lack of upgrades that followed hit the entire class. And with Kei so available Noone wanted a lower level chanter in groups, so the supply of new enchanters willing to play is dwindled massivly. <br />
<br />
Get used to wanting Kei. Maybe not the shaman due to our regen. But all the groups you make. Chanters are tired of getting bent over and are walking out the door or in other bodies now.<br />
<br />
(sighs) It really sucks too. Cause I used charm when I could to make groups. Not exclude others. Now the nerfs of all the little things that made the chanter class special are in place. And being told No we will just tank mez. and oh haste plz has done the damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I&#8217;m mildly addicted to KEI. I always get it before soloing.  When it runs out and if its time to sell, I&#8217;ll get a fresh one before heading back out.  If I&#8217;m going to join a group I&#8217;ll bet KEI because it makes a caster&#8217;s life so much easier.  But once it runs out in a group I go back to cani dancing.  It&#8217;s more work for me, but it&#8217;s not a big deal.  <br />
<br />
The only time I can see stopping a group for KEI would be if the cleric is expected to be overtaxed and a KEI would help keep the group alive.  I do my best to avoid pickup groups, so when I group its with friends.  So I&#8217;ve not had any bad experiences with KEI.  But I can certainly understand the frustration if the group has to stop every half hour for KEI if a caster dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The Solution to the problem of chanter desirability is two fold:<br />
1) They need to give chanters an AE stun that affects lvl 65 mobs.  Just one, so you would need two or more to make stun locking possible.  As it stands, chanters have no way to stun a mob in PoP cept for mez, which takes up too friggen much mana.  Even clerics and paladins can stun.  So why not chanters?  IMHO give them an AE stun and a single target stun for PoP.  That will make them master CCers again. <br />
<br />
2) They need to play.  Need to play in groups.  People have gotten out of the habit of using chanters for groups because so many of them refused to group forever.  <br />
This problem is two fold tho.  Before the nerf, the uber chanters got all the AAs they really could ever want, they got tons of loot, and they got bored with the game.  By the time the nerf came along, it was too late to save their interest in playing their enchanters.  Honestly, if you were used to THAT fast of AAxp, would you be able to stand grinding in BoT?  No?  Didn't think so.  <br />
So these chanters just quit or switched to a twink.  <br />
Then there were the chanters who never got to abuse CoD before it got nerfed.  They feel slighted, and some of them quit over it.  <br />
<br />
Basically by making one class &quot;GOD&quot; in PoP for so many months, SoE killed it.  Then didn't offer them an alternative to being &quot;GOD&quot; like being a good CCer or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Also, they could add a short term clarity type buff for enchanters to cast on TOP of clarity line that would add like 5 or 6 mana regen to a caster.  So it would be clearly better crack to have a chanter in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Kkrush:<br />
<br />
That's why I hate grouping - I've soloed about 95%, the other 5% was duoing with non stop single pulls. So much downtime in groups, not just the whole kei thing. This one is afk, that one is afk, this one has to med, that one has to med. I spent about 4-5 hours straight (besides the 2 times I died) in PoJ the other day and got MAYBE half a yellow xp. I don't think I'm ever grouping again for xp, just for raids, unless it's friends.<br />
<br />
About the kei thing though, it's great for a soloer. IMO it just cuts down med time, at the higher levels its not that much advantage, 250 mana is one spell. Therefore, I'm a fan of it. But, I could care less really about it not being available to lower levels, they just have to get used to buffs from players around their own level, the way it was intended to work out. I never even had a kei until i was about 32 or so, yes it was slow, but, since the game is intended for group play, if you group, a C1 or C2 is fine, and I do agree that it helps you learn to play your class better by learning how to manage mana.<br />
<br />
There's still hope for the newbies though. Perhaps SOE in its relentless quest to nerf kei, will forget about VoQ, which will become billed as, &quot;the new, better, and more improved crack&quot;....lol</div></div><hr />

I've only been playing EQ now for 6 months, and my Shammy for 3 months.  I never considered myself &quot;addicted&quot; to KeI, but use it occaisionally when I want to lvl quickly (usually pre-spell lvls).  I'm not twinked, don't belong to an uber guild, and was never PL'ed, so it's nice to be able to chain pull playing solo once in awhile so I can get my next dogdog.  But for the most part I just canni my way through without the mind altering.  I NEVER sit in PoK/Nexus until someone /shout they're casting, I NEVER /ooc for it, am tired of the &quot;looking for KeI&quot; chat spam, and have NEVER nor would I ever leave a group in search of it.<br />
<br />
However, it concerns me that SOME of the &quot;veterans&quot; of the game MAY feel that us newcomers have used KeI to advance faster, without building up a skill base for our toons.  Personally, I feel I have learned how to play my toon well, not great, but well.  I developed my own tactics for (KeI-less) soloing that works well for me, and although not perfected, have developed a style for small and full groups as well (I solo primarily).  I'm sure that will all change when I hit the planes...<br />
<br />
Yes, we do have it easier than the &quot;pioneers&quot; of the game, but I just hope peeps keep an open mind when someone like me /ooc LFG in high end zones.  I'm payin' my dues and becoming a better Shaman for it.  When I hit 46, will I immediately hit the planes thinkin' I'm the shiznit?  Not a chance.  I know I'm not ready.  I have much to learn, and this board and peeps who contribute have tought me much of what I know now.  I have the utmost respect ingame and out for the &quot;pioneers&quot; who dealt with the challenges.</div></div><hr />

The rush of a chanter in early kunark was unmatchable. They were needed. Yes groups could function today with the knowledge they have now. Root worked just fine back then even tho at the time few used it that way.  (Root parking wasnt practiced for a long long time.)<br />

Charm was a 7 minute refresh and made the chanter into a needed thing. (Talking the high end CoD) Yes it was too powerful, the best nerf by far would have been the 1% slow method. It would take the uber DPS out of the equation. (While still adding very very good dps)  and also keeping the charm for a bit then kill method of crowd control viable.<br />
<br />
Instead chanters got a 33% across the board xp nerf. +50 MR so that it doesnt land some of the time and lasts ALOT less. (If you tash first the mob is beating on you. That is what the -50 resist was supposed to stop I think) and a massive nerf to Pet aggro holding that makes it impossible for a chanter to use a charmed pet in smaller groups. <br />
<br />
The Aggro and the xp nerf hit every chanter down to level 12.  and they have not been soloing Bot named. And coupled with the No we dont need you we have C3... Why the hell would a chanter play if not already like 56+... for the animations you cant control. For the garuntee that death is every third spell you cast? A chanter leveling up is HARD. They have to have groups. Or charm solo. But charm solo for a lower level encahnter is the riskyiest thing you have ever seen. and on top of that they get a 33% xp penalty when they perform in flawlessly.<br />
<br />
It is bull****. A heavy handed appesement to the classes that bitched. I hope to god that every chanter in the game quits. And people are stuck going Looking for Kei willing to pay. For months till verant gets off thier asses and fixes the ****ing class.<br />

I can't stand downtime, and I can't stand people who are so dependant on KEI that they can't think straight when they don't have it.  It's ridiculous!  Chanters have been selling KEI out their arses for so long the majority of players in the game now need it for the everyday grind.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by a 33 percent experience penalty?  I must have missed something.<br />
<br />
I actually like Landragoran's idea of giving enchanters a useable stun for PoP.  Prior to PoP I could attempt to mez a mob and then stun it if mez bounced.  Or I could block gating by stunning.  In PoP, if mez bounces (which it very often does) then I simply have to sit and take the hits until I channel through a second attempt (or die).  It really does make mezzing alot riskier.  I can interupt gates using mez, which is sort-of ok except that it costs me 275 mana to do it. <br />
<br />
It is hard for enchanters to get groups, though.  If a group can get KEI in nexus, and replace the enchanter with a class that does some reasonable DPS, they usually will.</div></div><hr />

Would I leave a group to go get KEI? No and I have kicked others out of the group for that reason...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">This isn't about KEI.<br />
<br />
This is entirely about DUMB ASS PEOPLE. Which is a good 30 to 50% of Everquest. Anyone who would leave a group to get KEI, would probably leave a group if someone said they would buy an item they were auctioning, or run off to turn in a rune while group was still going. This has nothing to do with KEI.<br />
<br />
On another note, when the **** will you people realize that there aren't that many new players entering the game. We need to stop catering to &quot;new&quot; players.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing, don't act like KEI hurts enchanters. First off the ones casting it make tons of cash, second the lower level enchanters using it can use charm with so much more ease (and charm at low levels is pretty damn godly for exp gain). Also ENCHANTERS SLOW, the most needed ability in PoP is slow, and there aren't nearly enough slowers to go around. Add ontop of that haste which doesn't last as long as KEI and you still have more then enough reason to group a chanter.</div></div><hr />

I've never left a group to sell an item and I have I never left a group to turn in a rune etc.. but if someone wants to do that then it's their perogative.. you are a better player because hey you're never fm.. the other guy wants to slow the mob, get his xp and be fm at the same time what's wrong with that? He just got a new toy (rune) and wants to see what it gives him.. if a wizzy in my group said getting kei I tell em go get it.. if someone gets an ethereal and they are level 61 w/o all their spells (ok this can happen in theory) let the poor guy see what treats he gets!!! That's the fun of the game! <br />

When I first started the game 6 months ago I guess a lot of people started up with me,.. because at level 40 our WHOLE group would be like hey kei wore off lets roll and refresh.. no one minded we had a blast..</div></div><hr />

boohoo enchanters.<br />
<br />
If your enchanters are bored and think they are just buff bitches, then you aren't using their talents very well.<br />
<br />
I am shocked to hear it coming from someone like Snoww, who in the past has championed the non-traditional, small guild/group stuff.  <br />
<br />
Even with the small nerfs to the drastically overpowered charm, charm is still insanely strong and allows my guild and our groups to consistantly do more with less.  <br />
<br />
Sure enchanters, they need to buff.  OMG so do I.  OMG so do clerics and druids and rangers and pallys and beastlords.  The difference is, their buffs are insanely good and last forever.  Parse the difference in DPS between a raid hasted with SOV and one hasted with swift like the wind.  VOQ and KEI make a huge difference, when coupled with the different class manaregen buffs and bard songs and KEI lasts for freakin 4.5 hours with AA.  How can you be a buff bitch if you have to buff once in 4.5 hours??  Shaman buffs barely break 2 hours with max AA.<br />
<br />
Yeah they complain about being reduced to buffing machines.  I would argue that I am harrassed for buffs just as much as the average enchanter, except no one offers me 100pp for casting a single spell on them.  In fact, I am expected to cast half a dozen buffs on them, for free.<br />
<br />
Our main, active enchanter has been out of game for over a month because he has been busy in RL.  Sure we can bot him for buffs but there are still a ton of things we can't do or are very hard because he isnt there... and we have 2 level 65 bards that can provide some of the things that he does.   A bot chanter for buffs just doesn't cut it for us.  We have come to rely heavily on things that enchanters can do.<br />
<br />
Why someone would insist on tank-mezzing when something could be set to drooling, I have no idea.  Especially in POP with mobs hitting so hard, it makes no sense not to neutralize those mobs if you have the ability to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BACK ON TOPIC!  :)<br />
<br />
If you are in a group of people who can't live without a certain buff and that class is not in your group... you have a problem.  I don't do pickup groups, but even in guild groups... if you have to leave and do something else your spot is gone.  If you cannot function without KEI, should have got it before you came.<br />
<br />
I am not ashamed to admit, I freakin love KEI.  It makes the game more enjoyable for me to not have to canni a lot, instead just using canni5 for my manaregen needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You are right I am a huge proponent of small guilds and Small group tactics.<br />
<br />
And Pana is my hot box enchanter. She was my main for 44 levels back when I suffered from CNCS. (Constatn new charecter syndrome)<br />
<br />
The reason why I am bringing this up is because encahnters once one of the holy trio blah blah blah, really are in a ****ty place.<br />
<br />
The reasons are many. But I will save my fingers and yalls minds from me trying to explain.<br />
<br />
Basicly it comes down to this. <br />
<br />
Chanters have had all thier teeth ripped out when it comes to fun. Sure they can still charm. But if they go for a good pet they get a 33% xp penalty. And with a 255 Cha. And total domination 2 at level 65 With malosini and tash on a mob, I can and have had 4 breaks in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
At 700 mana a pop to recharm 300 mana a pop to Word of morell And i think 350 mana a pop for sleep to give me the time to get the charm back under control To have the charm break again before the mez wears off. <br />
<br />
It is not fun. That is what it comes down to. It is like trying to slow a mob with a Self curing disease proc. Might last a minute Might last 5 seconds. But the mana is being soaked away.  Sure I can break it out and deal for a big raid. But I dont raid much. I play with friends And the option to charm allowed me to make some fun groups. <br />
<br />
That option is gone now. Labeled under too much damn trouble.<br />
<br />
Verant is taking away the fun for an entire class. Much like slow mitagation. We want to feel powerful and special. Not a cog in a 100 man machine. Or at least I do. Every damn class in the game is overpowered Vrs every other class at something. And all of those are being balanced away.<br />
<br />
Screw that.<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy RABIG Bear  E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Chanters have had all thier teeth ripped out when it comes to fun.<br />
<br />
Please define fun.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
What I've seen is (and I paraphrase), 'certain things are impossible without an enchanter.' - actually the converse, 'only with an enchanter certain situations become workable and this is fun.' but given the conservatism of the EQ playerbase the first implies the second.<br />
<br />
If enchanters consider fun being the most powerful class in the game, and they will complain until this is true, well, sorry.<br />
<br />
I'm all against class dependancy. Not interdependancy (like melees needing healers and vice versa), but flat out dependancy. Like, &quot;sorry, we can't do this until the enchanter logs in.&quot;<br />
<br />
A fully AAed druid can cover for a cleric, there are 2 slowers in the game, 3 classes that can tank passably, there are scads of damage dealers.<br />
<br />
But any time anyone does something that might break the enchanter stranglehold on certain functions there are screams about losing class defining abilities.  And now there are screams about being locked into a certain role (hint: if no one else can do it, it's all you baby).<br />
<br />
You can't have it both ways.  Either you need to allow other classes an unadulterated charm, mezz and long lasting mana buffs, or you need to accept that your jealously guarded monoplies will lock you into servicing them.<br />
<br />
Though there are stacking issues, just like every other class that's not pure damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
As for KEI.  I'm pretty indifferent to the change.  I never use it myself - I kinda dislike it because I feel like I'm wasting mana since I pick points I can handle without it. <br />
<br />
But I think the addicts are really pathetic.  On the flip side, taking KEI away won't stop them from levelling or make them smarter. They'll still be stupid, they just will be stupid without KEI.  Whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you guys had it much tougher.  But I will not set here and let people dis on lower level players without proper justification.  I played a druid through the tough times, I know about the low mana regen etc etc.  But I have finally come back to my senses and picked up my shaman again (my first ever character).<br />
<br />
At any rate, I am only level 55, but I am a good shaman.  I take critisism real well even from non shaman, and I adjust my game accordinly if the advice is good.  I do not run off to get KEI, but I will get it if I am sitting in PoK while LFG.  I would never leave a group to just refresh it either (unless of course we are at some terrible hard camp and everyone voted for me to gate out and get it).<br />
<br />
At any rate it is absolutly terrible to jumble everyone who is not 60 - 65 into one group and say they don't know how to play the game.  I actually think people who say that are the ones who, on raids, are thinking everyone in the raid sucks but them....<br />
