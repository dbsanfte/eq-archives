<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, so there I was starting in on the ascent part of the teir 2 solo quests when a guildy monk, an app monk, a beyond time geared warrior, and a robo cleric go passing me by.  Once done with the cat I was on I hopped over them and snagged the next one, second later get a group invite.<br />
<br />
  No one told me what to do, but I know what I want and I know what they're there for, to complete these boring tasks as soon as possible.  Without breaks between pulls I buff them all, and yank out leopard.  For the next 2 or 3 hours I was the leopard bitch, I barely slowed I never healed, not even myself, all I did was cast leopard and activate aa's and can my butt off, it was all I could do to keep up enough mana to keep my pet and the 3 mellee buffed with leopard. I have preservation of xeg, chronostrum,ft15, mc3, can, scrm and even took down a couple of the flowing thought 3 potions I been skilling up on and still was only hovering between 5% and 30% mana the whole time.   We worked up and down from entrance to abit past b ent hopping over other groups and a necro and beast duo'ing until we all got our map pieces then we went up into the spiral for the kryn.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure that Griz's post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26069)  was not the first clue that people had that shaman can finally HELP with dps again, but really we have a choice, help with dps or fill our usual role or somewhere in between.  I know that necro and beast weren't happy, if they had others spells on I'm sure they saw the 405 spam, although seeing 3 time+ geared mellee's flying by casters isn't really anything new anymore.  And this was just with Leopard, Panther is going to destroy my mana bar in new and interesting ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ye need to be more plain.  I catch your tone that you're unhappy about something, but I can't pick out what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think his beef is with the mana drain that Leopard is.  ;)<br />
<br />
I've already discovered that for me and my significantly lower mana pool and gear goodies than Jeng, it takes careful rationing of the buff to maintain a decent balance between dps and mana.  I don't cast it on everyone all the time, only tend to go all-out and buff it on everyone when significant burst DPS is needed, such as against nameds.  During &quot;normal&quot; pulls, I usually only hit pets with it, cause in my own personal experience, pets seem to proc the spell WAY more than players do.<br />
<br />
The faster the mob has to die, the more the proc buff gets cast.<br />
<br />
Leopard has suddenly replaced my damage spells in my grouping lineup.  I don't DoT much anymore...Leopard does my damage for me.  Besides, it gets really costly to Leopard AND DoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've always been a mana conservation freak. I have to hit canni as soon as it pops, gem or hotkey,to keep my mana regen controlled and efficient, but with Panther, my mana drains a lot faster than I can bring it back, even in groups. My manapool is nothing to sneeze at. I'm top ten on my server. These spells just cost *a lot*. This is why I think they're balanced. On a raid, I can at least pop Spiritual Channeling and keep it up on all pets and melee - without it, I run OOM fast. And then, of course, there's the matter of the times I am my groups only healer during nasty AEs and nobody gets panther ...<br />
<br />
People think the spell is so overpowered, but anything can look amazing under the right circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's great, I have a spell I can cast and go OOM on at last other than spamming healing (seriously, no sarcasm).  Balancing mana regen vs buffing timing the casts etc, it's all adding a strategy back into the game for me.  Having to think about what I am doing is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, I don't think that the first poster was complaining AT ALL.  He was saying that FINALLY we have the ability to actually go OOM.  Not only that, but he was able to finally have a group agree with him that he was more valuable (or at least as valuable) spending his mana on something OTHER than slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can't wait for the panther line of focii to come out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Already out, it's called a bard :p<br />
<br />
  Actually, do the bard DD song work for these at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Panther foci = Bulwark of the Dragorn,  Avariciousness of the Ikaav</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I 2box a 67 BL, so now I really just use him for slows on inc while I start to hit the pets/melee with maw.  Works out pretty good.  The faster kills offset the lesser slow and he can take a beating better than I can.  Works out ok since he slows and sends in pet adn then runs in to fight while I canni back mana.  I guess this would be no issue if I had a TA..but I don't.  With this being really my only shaman duty in these groups, I can keep maw on pretty much all the melee/pets, but do NOTHING else.  It isn't overpowered, it is just a DIFFERENT job for us.  I can do this for dps, but not other things.  If I was having to slow/heal, I could do this as well.  It balances out.</div></div><hr />
