<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is written a tad tongue-in-cheek after reading another thread... but, as some have noted, many new shaman are unaware of the benefits of cannibalization.  I figured we could all post our hints/tricks here and then link to guild pages where they may do more good (since conjecture has it that the unknowing ones don't visit these boards with any frequency).<br />
<br />
I (as a 58 Shaman) have been cannibalizing for many a level... and wouldn't trade it for the world!  When the rest of the group's healers are LoM or OoM, I am  normally able to cover heals if we get an add.  It's rather a nifty ability, and one it would do the young shaman well to learn.  Yes, at lower levels, the return is, indeed, much smaller... yet you still end up on the positive side.<br />
<br />
Rule #1...... ALWAYS regen yourself first... that way, as you gnaw on your arm, you are actually regrowing that flesh.<br />
<br />
Rule #2...... ALWAYS watch your hitpoints.  I have a guildie who canna'd himself to death!  As you get higher levels of the spell, it becomes even more important to WATCH YOUR HITPOINTS!!!<br />
<br />
And a little trick... pay attention to your mana bar.  Canna once, then sit until you see that mana bar bump up on the tick... stand quickly... rinse, repeat.  You'll regain mana twice as fast, as you get the mana from canna... and if you're sitting on the tick count, you get the mana as if you were medding as well.  I have a guildie who's a troll shaman who has this method PERFECTED!<br />
<br />
<br />
Any of you other shaman out there have anything to contribute?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Canna 4 saw me canna myself to death for the first time.<br />
Damn friend was over and distracting me while i was on a raid. :)<br />
<br />
As for the mana bar method, I used that in lower levels, but with canna 4 I find that I no longer really sit down unless I am getting low on health.  On a raid this means basically never, as I have trained my clerics well. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol  OMG I came SO close to dead with Canna4 the other day... could only see the tiniest sliver of red in my life bar.  Needless to say... I healed up ASAP!  WONDERED why the warrior I was with kept asking if I was ok!  hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I go with the transparent inventory screen for when to stand, the Hitpoints blip up a bit, I stand and cani.  I don't look for the miniscule blip on the bar, as that is much harder to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Canni can be amusing.  Who say's Monks, Necro's &amp; SK's are the only ones who can feign?  Simply canni down, paying very close attention to your hp, regen, and how much damage canni x deals to you - When you can cast it again &amp; be from neg 1 to neg 9 hp, CAST!  You will fall unconscious, stand up, and drop real quick again!  Amaze and astound your friends - especially if you have Bear Form, and can do a bear rug impersonation!!!!  (Extra exclamation marks for emphasis!!!!!!!!!!)</div></div><hr />

I am gonna have to try this one out one day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Canni'd down as far as I could one day then tried to switch some HP gear with Wis gear and wondered why I went unconcious suddenly.<br />
<br />
Didn't die but oh so close.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just be sure there aren't any mobs around that'd kill you... Orc Pawns, for example. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Canna is the greatest thing since sliced cheese. =p<br />
<br />
On raids, I have the monks and paladins trained to heal me while I cann out. Works perfectly in situations that you need to heal or rebuff.<br />

<br />
I've canni'd myself to death while watching TV.  It's pathetic, I know.  When you wake up in a cold sweat because you just canni'd yourself to death in a dream.  That's worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find that some of the new UI mods make Cannibalizing even easier.  Get one that shows % health and mana.  When one moves, stand, cann, and sit.  Much easier to watch them tick up than the bar creep along.<br />
<br />
And when you do so, you can see just how much better mana regen is with cannibalize than without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh EXCELLENT idea!  I haven't even fooled with modifying my UI aside from what's do-able in game.  Definitely gonna try that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I killed myself for the first time with Can1 (wich im still using *sigh*)<br />
<br />
I went to my inventory screen, said I had 60 hitpoints left, just needed a little more to cast that GHeal so I could continue my journey.<br />
<br />
Inventory screen lies, theres my tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I've found that your current hp can waver with lag or high latency.  The % health/mana seems more stable, for some reason.  I never see it bobble up/down.  <br />
<br />
I basically use it as a &quot;tick timer.&quot;  Drove me nuts watching my health go up, drop down, go mostly up, go down, jump up again, then finally kick up the last 2-3 points and settle down.  By then, about 1/2 the tick was used up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm just a 57 Shaman but realized many levels ago, the importance of canni.  I'm looking forward to C4 and working towards C5.</div></div><hr />
