<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Couldn't find this anywhere recently, but confirmed it last night. Extended Enhancement 2 or 3 no longer sparkles with each cast of Stoicism, and its confirmed that I'm not getting the extra tick that I normally do from it. I've tried removing other focus items that I wear and still no difference. Also tried using a EE2 item (drakescale belt instead of my Amulet of Insight) as well.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this with torpor/EE3 or Q/EE4?<br />
<br />
And the final question.... is it intentional or a bug?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think perhaps for the lower level EE stuff, the minimum duraiton for the buff is either 36 or 48 seconds for the EE to work, and since Q line is only 24 seconds, it doesn't apply.<br />
<br />
the higher level EE stuff from time supposedly works on 24 second buffs, ie: Q line.<br />
<br />
i do know for a fact that SCRM does extend Q an additional 2 ticks.  1800, sometimes 2100 HoT for 200 mana...uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, EE does not affect Torpor/Q, never has.  <br />
<br />
On a hijack note, what the *^(&amp; is up with &quot;Spell recovery not yet met&quot;  When casting Q after Cann5 when you have QB2-3 and HAste of mithaniel?  This has not gotten me killed yet, but it will at some point I am sure.  Very very annoying bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EE2/3 used to work for stoicism. Bummer. Guess I'll have to wait until I do my AAs to get the extension back.<br />
<br />
Looking at Allakhazam and sure enought EE is listed with a 48 min second duration.<br />
<br />
Looks to be a fix then. Sorry for the confusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cast Q before you use Canni 5. You will avoid more deaths/close calls that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only item in the game (I think) that extends Quiescence is a Crown of Amibivalence from VT.  It adds 15% extension to ALL spells with a duration.  It even works with my buff clicky items!  Except my Torque of the Wyrmlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think there are one or two PoTime foci that also work on Torpor/Q, but you're right, the Crown of Ambivalence is the bee's knees.  I lurrrrrve mine.<br />
<br />
Funny bit was on the raid it dropped, as we got closer, one of the other guild shamans with fewer points than I had kept egging me on to bid on other items.</div></div><hr />

EE 1/2/3 have always had a min duration of 8 ticks.<br />
<br />
This isn't a fix. This is you imagining things.</div></div><hr />

Call me whatever you want, but a judgement from someone who doesn't have a EE item in their magelo ought to hold thier tongue.<br />
<br />
Sure did enjoy stoicism healing over 800HPs each cast though (I lost count of how many times I had measured it btw).<br />
<br />
Eluding to the hijack above, I've noticed the 'spell recovery not yet met' when mashing c2 as fast as its clickable. Seems like you'll get it cast and half way through the cast it realizes that its not met the recovery time yet. NTP servers out of sync possibly? hmm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me, where did you manage to find a historical record of my past magelo profiles to determine that I didn't previously have an EE item? Or have you hacked into my account and looked through my bags to see if I have one there?<br />
<br />
So got some logs, or better yet screenshots, of it happening?<br />

Please take careful note of the lack of chages to the minimum duration field on the History pages...<br />

Just a little FYI, this does absolutely nothing to support your claim. I get 800 point healing from Stoicism quite often with nothing extending it. It is a timing issue. It has always been possible to get extra ticks out of HoTs due to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, i don't have an EE item but I have been given the extra tick, actually I think I get it quite a lot. When using it during downtime, I never cast it unless I'm at least 800 below full, and usually get to almost 100%</div></div><hr />
