<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started on the Guardian server, so far I have:<br />
<br />
Gard L Tron, Radiation/radiation defender<br />
Dirk Menton, Katana/(forgot) scrapper<br />
Enticer, Electricty/electricity blaster<br />
Loral, Gravity/radiation controller<br />
Pulverizor, Fire/(forgot) tanker<br />
<br />
Of the 5, Loral has been the hardest to play.  Her missions have always had lots of mobs congregated together big clumps, making me have to work at rooting (with gravity effects) multiple mobs.  Gard is my favorite, he has a debuff, heal, and awesome buff from the primary power set, and some pretty decent damage dealing capacity from the secondary power set.  For my first pool power, I chose teleport foe, but I think it may be a better skill for a tanker, because it generates a ton of aggro if it fails and mobs are clustered together.<br />
<br />
Some EQ guildmates have started a supergroup on Pinnacle, so I rerolled Gard L Tron on that one, with the same combination of attributes.  He's only level 4 at the moment, and I'll probably do things slightly differnt with him.</div></div><hr />

I need to experiment with other types and character designs though.  <br />
<br />
I've been really impressed though.  It's remarkably polished for a new release.  <br />

Except my stupid graphics still get goofy.  I can't fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Me and most of Solusek Ro's former EQ players are playing on the Justice server.<br />

Cross Posting this from my server boards:<br />
<br />

<br />
Linking it because it is huge:<br />

<br />
The white suit is my current main:  Jinheim.  He is currently a level 11 defender who gets his powers from his mutant hair.  Opinions on his looks are either &quot;extremely cool&quot; or &quot;extremely gay&quot; - no in between.  I wouldn't have it any other way.<br />
<br />
The black suit is the first character I really played:  Kadron.  He is a level 9 energy/energy blaster that I will probably play again if I get bored of Jinheim.  I think that this is probably the second coolest character ever created.  The cigar and horrible grimace are an awesome combo.<br />
<br />
The pirate is a freaking pirate.  This is the coolest character that ever has and ever will be made.  His name is Harrrr and his battle cry is &quot;GOING LIMP&quot; (google for &quot;bloodninja&quot; if you dont know why that is funny).  He is a level 2 earth/mace tanker that I will probably play for a laugh some day.<br />
<br />
The chick is a controller named &quot;Control Phreak&quot;.  I made her because I wanted to see how hot of a mangina you can make in this game.  She has a great ass.  I got hit on within 5 seconds of loading the tutorial.  Ladies, if you want to seduce me, this is the look you should go for.<br />
<br />
It took me a while to figure out how to convert TGA to JPG.  If you're having the same problem, use this program:<br />

What Graphic card are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Geforce 4 TI 4200<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the lastest drivers and made sure I had the newest version of DX9.  I even tried the reference drivers, but EQ wouldn't load.  <br />
<br />
It's odd, because things look ok initially, but then I start seeing dots and weird lines coming off graphic angles.  Then like walls of color that block my view and distort things.  <br />
<br />
It's incredibly frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm hard to say I would check COH support board for more answers.   I had that problem also in EQ and it turned out to be a bad video card.   Don't suppose you have a extra card laying around that you could swap it out with?<br />
<br />
I found my card did find in one game but in others I got what you are getting.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I was sure it was a driver issue, but maybe my video card just crapped out.  Hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gart, that sounds alot like an overheating issue I had a long while back with my first Voodoo3 card.
