(At work, sorry forgot her name).<br />
<br />
Handed the Refined Ancient Sword to her, and she responded with something like &quot;How did something of this power get into the hands of one so inexperienced. I'll make sure it gets into the proper hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she ate it.<br />
<br />
My GM took pity on me and reimbursed the sword, with the advice to wait until I'm 50th.<br />
<br />
I'll be taking that advice.  But every ranger I've talked to (and certainly everything I've known) about the quest says there was no limit.</div></div><hr />

I've heard of at least level 40s having the sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think she'd turn around and give that sword to the next 50+ ranger that just happened by?<br />
<br />
Ranger turned Rogue I'd say!!!<br />
<br />
Kill her!!</div></div><hr />

You could do everything except for the final turn-in.  But I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

So they may have changed it recently. Personally I like the change but I do feel sorry for those trying to complete it early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye it was changed, but I have no idea when. Personally I am glad, there is no way anyone under 50 should get their epic weapons imo, regardless of class. I am sure there are others that disagree, but I know I worked hard for my epics, especially since I was unguilded at the time when I got them. How insulting would it be to see a level 35 twink with his epics? Just my thoughts...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definately not 55+ please. I did almost all the work for Swiftwind on my own (pulled together the raids, dished out the cash for stones/coffins, etc.), and I am only 53. Anyone who knows me knows I level intensely slow, and I raid almost constantly. To top that off, I am not even guilded anymore. Level is not necessarily an indication of worthiness for your epic. My two cp's :)<br />
<br />
On a side note, the heads for the HoT have been rotting in my bank since 51:p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benji</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My bet would be that the implemented the level minimum needed for epics(like they said they had when they FIRST put them in..) they reason they wouldnt say anything is because technically it was a bug before that they werent, just because VI was to stupid to have remembered to put it in.</div></div><hr />

L55+ is too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I ask what level you are as I would like to research this?<br />
If you don't want to post it on the glade, my email is crydee@questing-ranger.com<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm mostly curious to find out if there is any block at the beginning of the quest. It would be very bad if the level block only exists at the end of the quest when you do the final turn ins.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try to get my lowbie L5 ranger alt over to Telin just to see what type of response I get out of him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were doing it solo, it would just *poof* as all Epics have a minimum lvl. of 50 or 51 to complete.</div></div><hr />

Twinks also have people playing them and those people also have to do the same amount of work to get the epic as everyone else do. If they have the time to twink their alt good for them. Drop rates are completely random. They want the items they'll have to go raid for it. It's not like higher lvl have better drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50+... when epic went live verant SAID that only charicters lvll 50+ could complete the quest. It was later discovered that VI sort of fibbed. If this was a fix to that process I see no problem with it since verant PUBLICLY SAID when epics were introduced that the min level to get them would be 50. <br />
<br />
also, there is not much better then swiftwind at lvl 60 even in an UBER raid guild and being the top of the foodchain.. <br />
<br />
look the stats on swiftwind freaking OWN in every way ESPECIALLY The attack :) and since it is off hand it represents only a VERY small precentage of your damage.<br />
<br />
Earthcaller also OWNS. Sure i don't use it in my main hand on raids but have a sword with decent damage that procs 50% slow with a 500hp DOT is freaking godly. Think of it as a willsapper on crack. So at the high end it may not be a great every day weapon but it is one HELL of an item to have sitting in you bag for 24/7. There are ALOT of mobs out there i solo with ease thank to primal proc and this bad boy. ( maxed out dex this damn thing goes off like mad so it becames a pretty reliable way to slow things. <br />
<br />
HOnestly, you are ****ing nuts i f you destroy or never get ranger epics. no matter WHAT guild you are in or WHAT gear you have these things belong in the bag of weapons/items you carry with you all the time. ( along with jboots/dain ring/tash stick etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farmatyr</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ranger epic doesn't require killing anything that a level 46 would be out of place on a raid to kill. I strongly feel that if something can be obtained by someone earlier than Verant wants them to have it, they have made the quest too easy.<br />
<br />
But, there's no logic in making the epics 50+ now. The epic is a smaller upgrade over standard level 46 weapons than it was when it came out, and will not be used as long. All they are doing is making it less worth it to do the epic.</div></div><hr />

Most people don't twink hardcore enough to have better, and most server economies are fubared enough that Lammies are cheap.

Most likely you just managed to do the turn in between the two patch dates.<br />
<br />
then of course, if you did it on the 9th then Verant finally made these epics 50+.  Fine by me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pigott</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Farmatyr, show me these weapons you speak of, because since their release I haven't seen any weapons that even come close that I would take over these if I was a level 46 ranger. Other then weapons that were well beyond my guild and myself to get at 46. Even then Epics are still a viable option at times. I would figure that 99% of all epic weilding rangers did this quest post 50 instead of pre 50 so this only effects a very small portion of the player population out there, so I don't see how this would cause a dramatic downward spiral in rangers not going after their epics.<br />
<br />
I do think however if they planned to make the quest behave like this they should have emplimented the changes a longtime ago instead of waiting till now to do so.</div></div><hr />

No. Actually. You can be as low as L46 and still be able to loot the planar drops yourself. All other epic drops are not in areas that require a level to enter.</div></div><hr />

At lvl 58, I'm still trying to get swiftwind, and I cant think of a single item in the game that would provide as much benefit as this one blade and that doesnt require me to leave my friends and join a bigger guild.  I'm just curious, maybe I've missed something, and can you direct me to where I should be hunting that could provide me with a drop that can come close even?</div></div><hr />

So I never knew the ranger epic was 'broken&quot; so that lower than 50 could even complete it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You EARN your epic when you have all the items needed to finish the quest.  I could have finished my epics AT 46 but due to friends in the game who are allready 60, i chose to put that aside and gain levels so i could actually group with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means you had it very easy compared to the rangers who are complaining.<br />
<br />
One of the problems is the SEoC.  Even if the twinky is the only ranger on the raid, it really hurts ranger mains to see an SEoC go to someone who will not be using the blades to effectiveness (because you're on your 60 enchanter, or whatever).<br />
<br />
Another is the jade reaver.  Again, Verant making rarity and worthlessness come together to make a challenge.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, probably a very rare case (the scenario I describe above).  But the fact that it does happen is a vast annoyance to people who really do have to work at getting their epics.  Having a 60 main and his friends help a 48 twink get his epic is not the same as getting it on your own merit which is what the rangers who speak about it are mad about.<br />
<br />
I think this problem primarily arises from the fact that Verant very rarely makes a quest that is both challenging and fun.  A few quests in Velious, and a few new ones implemented in the Old World are about the only quests I would say are both fun and challenging to do at a level appropriate to risk/reward that they represent.</div></div><hr />

stats are 11/22 3sta/agi rogue only<br />
<br />
for awhile lots of twinks were getting it at low lvls.. then someone in their 30's posted on the Safehouse that they couldn't get it, and got the same message as the guy who started this post. Seems like VI is cracking down on quest<br />

I am happy for this change :)</div></div><hr />

Swiftwind is still the aim of 99% of the Rangers in non-uber guilds. Wouldnt be shocked if u had to be 55+ to get epics, u have to get to 55 to get HoT and i'll trade my HoT anytime for Swifty :p<br />
56, and still working on it...<br />
And seing a twink alt with an earthcaller is just plain ridiculous due to the rarity of the gem...</div></div><hr />

I arranged each hunt, each raid, and did every step of the way with my own to hands as it were. I feel priviledged to have the friends I do who helped me all along the way.  If you are not in a Class AAA guild that is able to get Primal or the next best thing, epics represent the pinnacle of weaponry for you. I currently fall into this catagory.  YOu simply cannot beat twin lighning blades!  For one, they are the coolest looking epics out there.  Second, excellent stats and effects.  Lastly, hell, you got your epics.  Unless you had your 6 level 60 friends help you or your uber guild got it for you at level 50, it means ALOT to you.  Your epic, your UBER...(Man I hate that word).  Its sort of like owning a Classic Vette.  Sure, it may not have all the bells and whistles but it shows time and effort invested to get something worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

The point was, i COULD get them at 46 if i had really wanted too.  They are not that hard, and, i am no twink, this is my main character of 3 years.  you dont have to be 51 or 55 or higher to get them,  you can finish all the steps at 46, there's no shame in that.  BTW i am unguilded, and as i said before, i am putting the epics off, until i can get high enough to group with the friends i have made that are allready 60.  the point was, when you have in your inventory all the pieces to complete your epic, that is when you have earned them.  (note: im not talking about Multi-questing, because you dont actually have those items on you).</div></div><hr />
