<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pliskin</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Icefang (nice mob to solo in Eastern Wastes) is currently broken on my server (Antonious Bale).<br />
<br />
He's stuck in a loop where he spawns, walks forward, runs off (this is part of the Coldain ring quest, but he should only do it once a day max), then 5 seconds later respawns (you can track 2 at once if you're quick) and repeats.<br />
<br />
He's been doing this for two days now. If you engage him during this time he fights you for a couple of seconds then disapears before spawning with full health and no aggro.<br />
<br />
The Dwarf Ghost who should spawn occasionally here (Korrigan?) is not spawning at all either. Definately something broke.<br />
<br />
A couple of questions:<br />
<br />
a) Has anyone noticed this on another server or is it just us?<br />
<br />
b) What's the best way of reporting this. I've tried petition, but had no responses (surprise, surpsrise).<br />
<br />
It's a bit of a pain as I was all set to camp him right through to 49 :(</div></div><hr />

Had the combine not failed I would have gotten to this part today as part of my project to get the ring for members of my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prae</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's doing this as well on E'ci, and the ghost does not spawn at all.  I waited there for an entire EQ day (foraging) and he never showed up.  I hailed the dog, even tried attacking the dog thinking I might fix it by killing the bugged spawn.  5 seconds into battle, he despawned, then repopped right where he started and began the loop all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shar Nightwynd</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To my knowledge, he is doing this on all servers.<br />
<br />
I believe he is scheduled to be fixed during the next patch.</div></div><hr />

On bristlebane btw</div></div><hr />

I was going over to camp him but there where some other peeps there. maybe i missed it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daadwen</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">broke on sol ro too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underbrush</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Made rings 2-5 last night, ran down toward Kael on my want to help camp Geos for the shawl quest and he wasn't on tracking. No big deal but I feel bad for anyone stuck at 5, as if Rodrick not spawning after the zone has been up for some time wasn't enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, can I take Poxbreath solo if I manage to single pull him?</div></div><hr />
