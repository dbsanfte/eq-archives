<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">[i]I use /hitsmode cause I really value my chatwindow space.  Perhaps the new GUI will make this entire problem a thing of the past. [/B]<br />
<br />
So..can anyone tell me how this /hitsmode works?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">eqphreak is right.<br />
<br />
but if you really want to learn go google for it. There are several good pages on the internet about it.<br />
<br />
Basically, you create up to 3 small windows on your screen, and all combat hits are relayed to those screens instead of your chat window. <br />
<br />
Really good for melees - no more battlespam flying by and obscuring important messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">type /hits and see what comes up.  There are a bunch of hard to understand instructions.  You can play with it for a while and figure it out if you are patient.  Took me about 10 minutes to get it set up the way I liked it, I've had it that way for about 3 months now.  Even tho it was a temporary solution, it was better than not using it by a long shot.  I think the only people not using it atm are the &quot;purists&quot; who like to see their hits or the people who haven't heard of it/don't know how to do it.  Actually that could account for most of the EQ population . . . so dont feel too bad.  <br />
<br />
Wednesday we are promised a new graphics interface which should make this all much easier and slicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The seperate windows are really nice when grouped with the melee's.  I just fiddled around with the modes until I found what I liked. <br />
<br />
 I then wrote them down on a scratch pad and stored it away for those times when someone else wants to try it out...now if only I could find it!<br />
<br />
Anyways, would be nice if you could place chat channel text in a seperate window as well. The bazar channel on AR is worse than any battlespam I've seen.</div></div><hr />

So..can anyone tell me how this /hitsmode works? <br />
<br />
Here is what I have in my eqcleint.ini for the hitsmode section.<br />
<br />
[HitsMode]<br />
MyHitsMode=3<br />
MyHitsAlwaysDraw=1<br />
MyHitsX=222<br />
MyHitsY=850<br />
MyHitsCount=4<br />
MyHitsFontSize=2<br />
MyHitsShowHeader=1<br />
MyHitsShowBG=1<br />
MyHitsBGWidth=300<br />
OtherHitsMeMode=3<br />
OtherHitsMeAlwaysDraw=1<br />
OtherHitsMeX=222<br />
OtherHitsMeY=925<br />
OtherHitsMeCount=4<br />
OtherHitsMeFontSize=2<br />
OtherHitsMeShowHeader=1<br />
OtherHitsMeShowBG=1<br />
OtherHitsMeBGWidth=300<br />
OtherHitsOtherMode=3<br />
OtherHitsOtherAlwaysDraw=1<br />
OtherHitsOtherX=222<br />
OtherHitsOtherY=1000<br />
OtherHitsOtherCount=4<br />
OtherHitsOtherFontSize=2<br />
OtherHitsOtherShowHeader=1<br />
OtherHitsOtherShowBG=1<br />
OtherHitsOtherBGWidth=300<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are my 2 buttons macros to turn it off and on, taken from my character .ini.<br />
<br />
Page2Button9Name=HitOff<br />
Page2Button9Color=5<br />
Page2Button9Line1=/hitsmode my on<br />
Page2Button9Line2=/hitsmode me on<br />
Page2Button9Line3=/hitsmode other on<br />
<br />
Page2Button8Name=HitsON<br />
Page2Button8Color=16<br />
Page2Button8Line1=/hitsmode me m3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 300 1 <br />
Page2Button8Line2=/hitsmode my m3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 300 1<br />
Page2Button8Line3=/hitsmode other m3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 300 1<br />
<br />
See attach for what it looks like at 1280x1024<br />
<br />
You can also get a .ini editor that will help you fine tune it at: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">does hitsmode effect logging?  So can I turn others hits on and be using hitsmode and they are still recorded the same way in the log?<br />
<br />
sorry newbie question hehe<br />
=Hen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye Henora, they are still recorded in the log.<br />
<br />
I have three small boxes of about 3 lines each that I just use so I can see when I'm being hit, and who dogdog is pawing on. Oh yes and when I'm jabing people with my spear ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With the new interface, you can create as many chat boxes as you like, and direct different channels to the different windows.<br />
<br />
For example, one box for melee messages, one for group chat, one for ooc, one for chat channels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It took a little bit to figure out, but it was fun while it lasted. I'm looking forward to the new interface.</div></div><hr />
