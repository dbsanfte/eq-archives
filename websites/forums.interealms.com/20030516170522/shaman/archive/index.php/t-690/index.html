<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya fellow shammies,<br />
<br />
I know that we discussed which root is better when casting on the mob in the pass but now I am wondering which root is better for parking mobs. <br />
<br />
Here are some examples.<br />
<br />
1.  Because of the new slow agro I learned it is better to root the mob first before slowing, which root would you use? why?<br />
<br />
2.  If I was soloing and I needed to break a camp of 2 mobs by rooting 1 and letting the other come at me, which root would you use? why?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I do not have paralyzing Earth yet but lets pretend I do when you give an answer and then give me a secondary answer because I don't have the spell yet.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For parking, Enstill is better.  Longer.  But it breaks too easy for root and rot. <br />
<br />
And I always slow first.  Easier to root it if it's slow and I can move it to exactly where i want it if it's slowed first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always use Root, simply because I don't have two slots to devote to the spell. If I had the slot, I'd probably prefer Enstill over Root for parking. But most of the time I'm just trying to keep something with the melee characters, especially with all the new slow aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And I always slow first. Easier to root it if it's slow and I can move it to exactly where i want it if it's slowed first.<br />

I would usually agree with you but for the 1st example I was refering to a Chardok raid I will be doing tomorrow.  Last Chardok raid I went to the mobs really agrod on me because of my slows, I mean the mobs will be down to 40% of health with 10 melees and others taunting the damn thing and then I would cast a slow and still agrod on me. /sigh<br />
<br />
So tomorrow I will try something different instead of having a healer designated just for me, ;) I will  park the mob first before slowing it.  I did this towards the end of the last raid with just root but wasnt lasting long so thats where I came up with this post. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about..um.. stop in High HOld and get one of those DA idols...LOL<br />
<br />
Ya I'd root too then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Root.<br />

Fast and cheap...just how I like em!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tried others.  Always come back to good old 30mana root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jahaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have found enstill to be all but worthless.  More mana for a *chance* to last longer.  Considering many times it breaks just as fast as regular ol root ive all but forgotten about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It depends on what I'm doing.  Regular everyday use I use Paralyzing earth.  It stays rooted for a long time, and I never seem to have a problem with dots breaking it too often.<br />
<br />
If I have to stop something right away, I dig out Enstill, cause its faster casting than Paralyzing earth.  for instance, in the 10th ring War, the giants are fast enough that they will be out of range by the time Paralyzing earth is done.  Use Enstill, and you can stop them if you have giants running to Thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">cheap old root :) and i use it ALOT, cc, losing aggro, keeping aggro, parking, whatever :) hell i even use it on raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bormikbonespeaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always use root.....i can hold 2 to 3 mobs rooted at 0 mana(with cani IV), just a waste to use the others....as they have the same chance to break</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Coner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have got to throw in my 2 coper here.  I like to play enchanter for my groups, I often group with friends when there is no enchanter and I consider root parking my specialty so here go's my bable;)<br />
<br />
when soloing in a new area I will usualy keep 2 roots memed, imobolize for the fast cast and solid duration, and perilizing for long parks.  for a situation I know what to expect I will use reguler root and perilizing. root for low mana because im JBBing and it wont last long anyway and perilizing to park adds.<br />
<br />
In group of ppl I know I can count on to watch my back &quot;still enchanterless group&quot; I will have reguler root and perilizing up again.  in a pick up group where im playing enchanter its imobolize and perilize. imodolize for the slightly faster cast.<br />
<br />
for reguler traveling or groups with an enchanter only root I have memed is imobolize<br />
<br />
<br />
when meming a secont root the spell slot I usualy put it in is my dd, cince when doing parks I rairly have the mana to spair. and if I do jbb works just fine<br />
<br />
hope I was clear enouph, I love non conventional groups.  I have often found myself in groups of 4 melee a cleric and myself or 5 melee and just little old me, and these turn out to be the most entertaining groups.  dont be afraid to try what you wouldnt normaly thank would work yes you may die but its all part of the fun. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sabassos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Paralyzing Earth all the way.  Last up to 3 minutes.  Park it, and I can get two epic dots off on it before it wears.  Speed of it seems fast to me, maybe slightly slower than enstill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use regular root.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that if you are rooting and melee folks are beating on it.  If they have weapons that proc, such as Frostbringers, etc... then the DD component will break your root.  <br />
<br />
Root = cheap, fast and effective.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also train your friendly neighborhood rangers to help you out.  If they see you getting beat down, they can also root...works well for me in CT.   Ranger snares, then roots the inc, I slow, and each time I get summoned he re-roots.   If you are having rangers help you on crowd control on adds though, remind them to use their low damage root or else rooting it could do enough damage to make start summoning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use immobolize always because it has a nice low casting time which is exactly what I need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Always have regular root memmed. Sometimes if I know I need to part something I will try a longer lasting root. But from my days of soloing in CoM I got so pissed off when using Enstill to try and split spawns I never used it again. Every time I cast it broke before regular root would and that's with no damage being done to the mob. Waste of a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Immobilize,low cast time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Elric the Feeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Root.  Its cheap.  Root then slow, getting bonked on the head by a big friggin giant hurts to bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Our slow doesn't agro anymore. It was fixed. Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, that is correct Riokhan however, Slow still generates agro, some mobs still really hate being slowed such as Giants. ;)<br />
<br />
And for the record, I have been experimenting on all the Root line of spells and it comes down to me just use ordinary Root and Enstil for long parking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Root...Loot...Toot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I always have root up just because it is cheap and relatively fast casting.  When I actually need to seperate mobs such as when duoing and two get pulled, I use paralyzing earth.  It lasts far longer on average than any of the other ones.   So root is always up and paralyzing earth is sometimes up as well for soloing/duoing situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I keep coming back to root.  Cheap, and I never notice a difference in lasting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wait until you get paralyzing earth. Its all I use for rooting now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have no problem channeling enstill through 3 unslowed frogs.<br />
If you got agro from resisted slow it's just as likely root will resist too...<br />
<br />
I want a spell that will hold the mob long enough for the group to kill at least one other frog. Unless a melee has a procing weapon I find most enstill last untill the mob is over half dead.<br />
<br />
I can time enstill off my epic...If I enstill then epic, epic will wear off an instant before enstill. Enstill lasts full duration about 80% of the time.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to shed agro (just want to slow and get out) use root.<br />
<br />
If you are PARKING use enstill, lasts longer...<br />
<br />
mana cost? is that really an issue?<br />
<br />
I can still pull every frog between gang scarab camp and chef for a group with no chanter or bard and never run out of mana. My melee never have to wait for the next frog. Have forced a few rangers to use gloves to snare cause they go oom.<br />
6 named makes for a nice camp and alot of exp :)</div></div><hr />
