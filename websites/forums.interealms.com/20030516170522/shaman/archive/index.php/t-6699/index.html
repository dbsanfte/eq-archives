<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Molerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am alvl 52 to shammy just come  back to  the game. I have no cash , bad items, and no guild to help.<br />
<br />
So what i need to know as Buying MQ rights is out of the question<br />
is it possiable for me to hunt in the area not to far into kael and get some if very very rae chain drops for the thurg armour quests.<br />
<br />
On a side  note can anyone suggest good places to make cash (not just pp drops) evenif it means collecting tradeskill stuff to sell at bazzar. Place's i have tried are Rockhopper's , IG's (always camped), Seafury's (always camped on my server).<br />
and of corse HG's but get little to no xp from them 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
So any help or advice on either of these subnects would be greatly appericated.<br />

<br />
corroded chain will drop in Arena or King area. Kael is a good training ground for some raiding tactics, Giants get tougher as further you go into Kael. So assamble a raid force (try with 2-3 groups) and see how far you can get.<br />
You might be able to hand around zone in (from WL) and wait for a pickup raid to assemble, but I would not advice to do so. I got some bad expirience with pickup raids of any sort (not just Kael). But if you don't have the guild to do it it may be your only chance.<br />
<br />
Money is hard to come by. I know that many tell you to hunt HGs or stuff like that, I wasnt much into that because you don't get XP. If you dare you can try the evil vendors in Echo Caverns. Go from Shadowheaven to Fungus. Directly after zoning in take the right tunnel. At the wall click at it, go through, keep near wall on left side and go till you see a fort. 2 guards are down at the entrance, 2 archers are at the top. As Lvl 60 I can pull them single, you might run into problems. But they are pure melee mobs with low resists, so you might be able to just root them. They have about 7k HPs. After you killed the guards at entrance try an archer. They summon you up there, so be ready for that. Those archers drop each 2 bows that sell for around 18pp.<br />

So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kael can be done with a single group.  You don't need a raid to get armor.   Doing the bank area will get you decent xp, faction, and some armor drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted this question a while ago: look in the hunting guides section for lev 51+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Molerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all might leave the evil vendors u speak about for now as i said my gear isnt up to standerd so that hampers me a little.<br />
<br />
Might have to try pick up groups at WL entrance cuase i dont have a guild.<br />
<br />
 Anyway thx for the info and advice guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could try the rockhoppers in Scarlet. If you go to the base of the path up to the top of the plateau thingie, you can pull the ones that spawn nearby.<br />
They can drop the superb and flawless hides needed for acrylia tailoring and smithing. Sell well in the bazaar. Should also be good exp for you, if not a challenge without gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For cash you can go to Droga. On my server (Tarew Marr) Green goblin skins are sold 300 pp and Mnts Death salt for 100 pp in bazaar.<br />
You wont get many exp (if any) but you can hope to get ally with Chardok and get a nice ring (and more if you continue the quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can get chain drops near zone in kale  back when i was first working up cov faction  got a set of boots of the blue guy neat wl zone dont rember his name he drops the glowing black sword too.<br />
