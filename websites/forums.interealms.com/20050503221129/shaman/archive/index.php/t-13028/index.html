<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this was old bug and happen many time in last 6 months, I not sure if anyone notice it but it rare<br />
<br />
when I have Torpor/Quiescence on myself but near fade, then I try cast <br />
a new Torpor/Q before it fade, now bug happen here :<br />
<br />
if 2nd Torpor/Q land at same time as 1st Torpor/Q fade, then you will see &quot;You fall into a state of torpor&quot; , immediate follow by &quot;Your state of torpor end&quot; , you just spend 200mana on nothing ! <br />
<br />
it rarely happen because 2nd Torpor/Q need land at &quot;bug&quot; time to cause this happen, I not sure if this &quot;bug&quot; time is 0 second before it fade or few second before it fade<br />
<br />
I hope someone seen same bug can explain more clearly, I did /bug all time when happen but VI did nothing;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has been around for a while. It happens to my Paladin with the Yaulp line of spells all the time =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Long time bug, can happen with any buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It used to happen alot more...like I would see it happen multiple times a day on regular buffs even.<br />
Now though it can still happen it is rather rare and I have not seen myself for a couple months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It happened to me with acumen the other day. It's just a case of good timing gone wrong, I guess. ;) I do wish it would get fixed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This bug has been in game for about 4 years now.<br />
Grats you on finally finding it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This bug hasn't affected me since I thought they fixed it about a year ago.  I'm suprised it's still around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't had this happen for about 5-6 months now, thought they had fixed it as well ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Still happens with a lot with me and Regrowth, dammit its annoying. Thank goodness it cant happen with group Focus because of its cast time, by the time you notice your icon flashing you cant load it and cast in time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Having read about this bug on this board, I have made sure not to let it happen to me on self buffs. When I notice that my buff is blinking and I have time to cast it, I watch my cast bar, if the blinking buff hasn't faded by the time the cast bar reaches 20%, I click the buff off. I have never had to recast a buff on myself this way. Granted I can't help it when I have to rebuff someone else, but I always ask them to make sure that the buff is gone as I start to cast..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It happened to me quite a bit when I first got torpor, caught it once the other day as well, it's been much better though, probably because of SCRM I still can't time the recast perfectly....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&gt; it's been much better though<br />
<br />
If anything, it's worse now than it ever was. Playing a bard makes this particularly plain, especially whe trying to e.g. kite with the L5 selos, because when you twist you're re-casting your buffs every 18 secods or so.<br />
<br />
It's a common complaint on e.g. EQDiva, and probably the higher your ping the worse it is - I'm on a satellite downlink and it's very frustrating.<br />
<br />
I doubt this will ever be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Really old and really annoying bug. Happens to me a lot when refreshing VotB, sucks a lot when it &quot;double fades&quot; on a buff you can't recast for a while.</div></div><hr />
