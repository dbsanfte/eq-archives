<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 47 level troll shaman.<br />
<br />
I recently started an ogre shaman to see how a different setup would work.  I've managed to get him up to 31.<br />
<br />
I love most of the changes except....<br />
<br />
When I'm solo in dungeons, root just isn't reliable enough to stop runners.  I know there are other ways to snare mobs other than the snare necklace, but they all seem to either be charged items, or procs which seem unreliable.<br />
<br />
Not everyone else is a troll, so I'm hoping there is something I'm over looking.<br />
<br />
When soloing in a small area where you can't let runners loose... how do the other races do it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your slam skill is helpful, I use it all the time when I have runners. Slam then root when they are stunned.   But after 50 (51 I think) you get immobilze which casts in 1.75 seconds, its a very nice run stopper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dispell SoW, use root, and never chase them.  Mobs will stop running once they're a certain distance from you, and you can usually get a nuke or dot on them at that point without driving them deeper into the zone.  Otherwise, just wait for them to return and deal with whatever train they bring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Root, root, re root, and root some more. Not entirely reliable (Heh I can remember some of the trains in Lguk) but hey, it works most of the time. Just gotta pay mega attention....dont canni while mob is about to die, since it takes a few seconds for spells to become active again. That few seconds can screw ya some times. <br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed, is if the mob starts to run, and you are solo, sit instantly. Most of the time it will come back for you immediatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once I get to know the lay of the land (ie learn when they are going to run) I try and root them before they get to their running stage. Then if you do enough damage before the root breaks they won't run but rather walk off. It just takes a few kills to get the general feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another option, which doesn't always work and doesn't work for everyone is to stay at low health, so the mob doesn't run...they'll finally turn to run with very minimal HP left.<br />
<br />
It's not all that efficient, but it does work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or pull 2 and keep him rooted nearby. His friend shouldnt run then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Put your lvl 14 root up for its faster cast, OR DD it, OR let the hasted pet bash it and stunn it with you tossing in slams for good measure.  Mobs only generally run to maximum spell distance so you can nail them with a jbb from range (assuming there are no terrain or indoor LoS issues).  Pull an add on same faction, this generally keeps the mob close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bye the time a mob is ready to run, it doesn't have many hit<br />
points left. Providing you still have a dot or two on it, just one<br />
nuke should take it out most of the time. Root first, just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman or shamans, not shamen.<br />
<br />
Kill them faster.<br />
<br />
As a barbarian shaman, I never realized how incredibly handicapped I was until troll shamans pointed it out to me. How silly of me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bring along my druid. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another trick I've found helpful is to find out which *direction* mobs pathing causes them to run in. If you know that, you can lead them the opposite way to give yourself some more breathing room  and prevent adds. Other than that I recommend root,stun, and prayer, in roughly that order.<br />
<br />
-Valka/Xegony<br />
<br />
ps. remember our epic will not break root, neither will our other dots *after* they have been applied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't solo in dungeons.  I went LOIO - FM - OT - DL - KC and now I'm getting ready to hit Velks.   <br />
<br />
If a mob runs on me I just /q.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I try and keep a low mana DD available (Blast of Poison is nice) to finish off the mob.  I don't use my best DD because:  it's overkill, higher fizzle chance, longer cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I soloed dungeons all the time at that level.  Still do.  When the mob's health starts to get close to &quot;flee&quot; level, use root.  Keep it on.  Hopefully you have a dot or 2 on him and pet on him.  You can keep meleeing him, just keep him rooted.<br />
<br />
At least that's how I think I did it at that level, good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Another thing I just thought of is the Howling Harpoon...it ain't a snare, and it won't stop em from running every time, but an extra stun or 2 now and then is better than what ya got now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most mobs will only run as far as max casting distance, that is until someone starts to chase it.  That's why I have a &quot;/melee sit&quot; hotkey.  This may not help as much inside but it's a good thing to remember when fighting outside.<br />
<br />
Inside I try to root, DoT and then nuke.  If the mob gets around a corner and I can't &quot;see my target&quot; the DoT is still working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When mob starts to run, I'll root, refresh epic, then go pull something else while pup finishes it off.<br />
<br />
Never fight on 'pathing' lines, so the mob has to move back onto path before it runs off<br />
<br />
I used to solo in chardok slave pits (near BK) before the caster changes, the pathing in this room gave me time for easily 2-3 root chances before the mob ran off ;)<br />
<br />
If fighting non summoners, sitting works well too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've been solo'ing in Sol B lately, doing greater kobolds. I originally went there hoping to find groups, thinking I wouldn't be able to deal with runners without snare. But I've actually done quite well solo. I've had one runner get a significant distance (and train KPC on me :p ) in 3 yellows of solo exp there. <br />
<br />
The most important thing is to make sure you have some room for it to run without getting adds. Of course, when you start clearing an area you can't guarantee this, but clear out the running path with your first pulls. After that it's a lot easier. <br />
<br />
Still, you want to keep them from getting far. Things that I've found help: Dot'ing the mob certainly helps, as it's dying while running. But I haven't been doing that as I'm in the JBB stage of life and it would waste mana. So I just root when they get to the point that the next JBB blast would send them running. Usually the root lasts until they die. Also, the puppy helps a lot. He often stuns them when they try to run, and he also finishes off runners really well unless they're at max &quot;running&quot; hp. But the biggest thing is to make sure you position yourself so that the mobs have along enough straight-line running path (when they're hurt and slow, at least) that you get a clean shot at rooting them AFTER they start to run. If I root before they start to run, and have enough room to cast another one after they break root and run, I very rarely have a problem. In fact, the only runner I've had so far was when I DIDN'T position myself such that I had a chance to root after they started to run. <br />
<br />
You can cast a root pretty fast, and the mob doesn't really get very far in that amount of time, if it's hurt. <br />
<br />
None of this guarantees success, but it definitely helps. I've found it works well enough to solo in dungeons with runners, when I expected it to be virtually impossible. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">don't solo in dungeons. I went LOIO - FM - OT - DL - KC and now I'm getting ready to hit Velks. <br />
<br />
If a mob runs on me I just /q. <br />
<br />
I've actually grouped with somebody like this.  His life was spent entirely in Everfrost, Oasis, LoIO, FM, OT, DL, KC, and Velk's til 55.<br />
<br />
And he did go LD on me, twice, when something started running towards the rest of the Goranga.  First time was well within the laws of chance.  After the second time I rooted the one I pulled right next to him.  Figured he'd get the hint of my displeasure by being whacked on, besides, it was slowed.<br />
<br />
Well, we got an add (darn druids haven't learned to safely quad in Maiden's yet) and I got busier.  I figured since my companion  was a lev above me, he should be able to handle a gatherer no prob.  I pulled my pet and proceeded to beat the tar out of the Centien.  I kept asking if he was OK, since his health was dropping.  Paused my beating of the Centien to heal him once and re-click the Goranga, which was near death.  My companion dropped, then the Goranga dropped, then the Centien dropped, all in about 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
How was I to know he was AFK?  He didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
I root with Immobilize, or Enstill if I need longer term parking.  I keep them Cursed throughout the battle.  They usually turn to run, get a couple steps, and keel over just as the &quot;Your Curse of the Spirits has worn off&quot; message hits my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always try to set up where the mob won't run into anything before he hits the end of his leash.  The mobs have a maxium distance that they will run, and it's well inside casting range of even the epic--just don't chase him.  In fact, move a little the opposite direction as soon as they start to run so you can control how far off they get.  The DoTs or pet will finish eating him.<br />
<br />
Alternately, for most mobs, you can just ghetto snare by pulling another one when the first is about to run.  Social mobs don't run if there are two in the camp.<br />
<br />
Both methods are quite effective.  I prefer the first one when available (depending on types of mobs) as the pet can eat them, and they aren't doing any damage while trying to run.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Basically, I either:  1) Root the runner and take the beating like a man before finishing the mob off, or 2) try to do the low health trick (as has been mentioned).  <br />
Number two is much more risky, so I generally just stick with the first method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tainted breath at lvl 31 so far hehe, takes the last few HP off of em and I can get started on the next right away... If theres nothin else I just beat on it with my pokey stick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's all about the pathing.<br />
<br />
When you're first killing in a dungeon watch the way things turn to run and kill in that area. Eventually you should create yourself quite a bit of space to work with. As long as the mob isn't sowed you can probably kill it before it gets where it's going. If it starts to get close throw a root out. I've kept mine memmed since level 14.<br />
<br />
Using the example from SolB (going to assume it's the pool room because the flee pathing from there heads to KPC). Best spot to break that solo is the SolA zone. You drag it up the stairs and kill it there. More than enough time to kill your target before it makes it down to his friends. Then work your way up towards the pool room because the flee pathing from there runs back through the mobs you already killed, so theres just nothing there the train with.<br />
<br />
If melees with no root/snare can solo indoors (/point monk) then casters should do it easy. &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; is the enemy though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I sit down and wait. He comes running back. I root. Then laugh at him and Epic dot.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I finish em off fast. Sometimes I make it last. Other times I am dealing with his 3 buddies that have come to help.<br />
<br />
It is the gaters that really piss me off. I hope there is a special spot in critter hell for those damn Specter cleric guys in Karnors.<br />
<br />
Kill em 4 times before they are out of mana (thanks C heal) then the bastard gates. BAH!<br />
<br />
I have stood in a mass of 3-4 drolvargs till death trying to kill that damn ghost before. I didnt care if I was gonna die as long as he died first. <br />

I have been fighitng in CoM for about 2-3 levels now and the dead never run. I decided to see what soloing was like in the Hole. Almost got the first hall cleared when my pet chased mob a few steps (I thought he was not far enough yet) before I could root. Well he aggroed 2 more warriors. I thought I could handle them. About 1 minutes later I was loading.. ack. Die and learn I always say.</div></div><hr />

Everyone is killing MY mobs at the enterance of The Hole.<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you know it runs, debuff the suckers MR and slap roots on at low health.  I tend to carry at least one larger nuke for runners as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I solo in Sol B alot, and the only runners I worry about are shamen. Cause they  have sow, and just take off like lil bastards.<br />
<br />
For the other dogs, they start running and my dog just kills it fast enough for me not to worry, and if my pet is gone for to long, I summon him back, and see what kind of friends he decided to bring ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Debuff MR if you are going to rely on the root method.  That's key or one of these times you're going to get a couple resists and end up in trouble and possibly seeking a cleric.  <br />
<br />
Lemme see, what's a good example . . . ok Sebilis.  How do I stop runners and gaters?  I dont have a snare item.  What I do is to pull another frog when the first one is about 2/3 dead.  Then they assist each other and are all happy to stay and die.  Problems with this method are when the add is a healer, that doesn't work so well then.  In that case I try to time an Ice Strike to coincide with the mob going under 20% hps.  I also will have dots on them at that point, which will give me more of a margin.  <br />
<br />
Dispelling sow also works fine now that Turgurs can't be dispelled.  If you're lucky and use annul or nullify, you'll get a couple other buffs like celerity that can make a frog attack faster than he really should while slowed.  <br />
<br />
In chardok, I solo a lot under the bridge.  It's a capital spot really, the mobs are plentiful (usually), I'm out of the way of trains, and I have room to work with runners.  The mobs in there don't sow themselves and so run rather slowly.  I use pathing also to keep them walking around the room away from me rather than running out of it.  <br />
<br />
Monks know all these tricks already.  As my monk (lvl 52, fungi, 1080 ac, 35% haste item) I have learned how to solo mobs that run and mobs that cast.  You have to be smarter than the mob, anticipate what's coming and plan ahead.</div></div><hr />
