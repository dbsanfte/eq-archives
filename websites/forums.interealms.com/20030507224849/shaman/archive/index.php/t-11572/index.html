<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking at working my way into Sebilis.  I'm 51, and I'm looking for a guide for Seb that would let me know what I can solo and what loot to look for.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any good exp or tips on Seb then please post em!<br />

The knoights are easy to solo but the shaman aren't and the wizzies are a pain in the butt (ice comet hurts).  I recommend ya get a group to hunt in here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree.  At 51 you are too low to solo there.  I tried soloing entrance at 57 or so.  I could do it, but the caster frogs were a pain and I had to use a lotta mana to nuke them.  Also, the entrance mobs all come in two's until you break spawns.  Not really woth it in my opinion.<br />
<br />
At 51, maybe you could solo in BW, Scarlet Desert, or Tim Deep seafuries.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You'll need a group at 51. What I suggest is that you look for a group in Seb and if that doesn't work then go to CoM and solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best place that I got XP at 51 was doing the Bards/Nobles in HK. I would get KEI and head there. At 51 was getting almost 60-70% in 3hrs at 51, and about 40% by the time KEI wore off, at 54. Stayed there till 54. Went from 51-54 in a day and a half. Just go to the room in between the 2 pulls, park dog dog, pull with slow and then E-Bolt, and JBB away. LOL, also CoM is great XP.</div></div><hr />
