Dam my favorite source of tribute is getting nerfed.  This makes me depressed.  Guess its time to say goodbye to droga.<br />

Look for other favorites to be nerfed as well.<br />

architects sceptre from LDon was changed from ~4k to ~1k this last patch. Rather sucks IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Typical Sony over reaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tempest robes are like 7500 now instead of like 25k :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">gomduig's are 12k now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">forged pick went from 320 to 3 considering they only costed 2pp to make this is the biggest nail in the coffin on that nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For things like forged picks i think they should be nurfed they break tribute when you can get as much tribute as you want at that kind of ratio. Alot of the other things are fine tho. Sure you could regularly get the sceptres for 1k or a bit less in the bazaar resulting in about a 4 to 1 tribute to pp ratio but i think it's fine. Those things are way too common and it helps keep the item value from going totally threw the floor.<br />
<br />
Tradeskill stuff does need to be fixed but item value doesn't need to be nurfed unless it's 10x tribute or more IMO. It's good for the economy for those sceptres to actually sell at 1k instead of dropping to a couple hundred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've not been one for Tribute yet, but it looks like a lot of items are being brought down to roughly what they sell for in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If they start adjusting tribute for current bazaar prices, they are going to be doing a LOT of adjusting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I find that good management of tribute is a key in making it useful. You have to use it only when necessary and turn it off when you're just standing around.  I used the forged weapons to max my tribute for a couple thousand plat and I've been using it daily since the changes.  I've only spent about 5000 tribute points so far.<br />
<br />
Altering your tribute window so you can always have it up is definitely a good move.  You will alway notice when your tribute buffs are running and can shut them off when needed.<br />
<br />
Outside of pricing mistakes, I think ldon is the easiest way to get tribute items (if you're in a guild that doesn't use the drops that is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
Drat!  That stinks. :( <br />
Tactician Bulwarks, Kingly boots &amp; Feathered cloaks were my tribute bread&amp;butter. :p <br />
<br />
Ring of exalted Freedom took a hard blow:<br />
Changed tribute from '13159' to '3000'.  OUCH!<br />
Ardent Necklace: Changed tribute from '13519' to '4668'.<br />
<br />
Yup, sounds like Droga farming took a major hit.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they start adjusting tribute for current bazaar prices, they are going to be doing a LOT of adjusting.<br />
<br />
Agreed, if they take this path they will have to be re-evaluating thousands of items every month or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Frekkels are you sure on the Ring of Exalted Freedom?  I have been farming that for months and I always thought that it had a Tribute of around 3K.<br />
<br />
If they have a program to check the Bazaar prices they may just infact reset the Tribute Points every few months.  I am pretty sure that the original Tribute points were based on the bazaar prices.</div></div><hr />
