Strength of the Elements<br />

Ring of Bathezid/Spirit Wracked Cord<br />
<br />
Veracity Earrings<br />
<br />
Halls of Testing Quests (bracer/charm/mask especially)<br />
<br />
You can do most of the 10th ring quest solo at 60, up to 7th simply..8th if you know what you are doing in a few hours if spawns are up, if not no later than 2 weeks.  Ring 9 takes a while and you will need a few buddies to finish it, but it is WELL WORTH THE TIME INVESTED&gt;....and the 10th well...10 ac 10 sta 10 str 10 sv mag 100 hp 10 atk 10 damage shield 10 regen that stacks with all our Luclin spell slots but Chloroplast (won't stack with call of earth either, but warders&gt;son/pred/coe still).  Also, the divine aura scroll you get for handing your ring to the dain at ally status is phenominal for tough battles your guild will face later on.<br />
<br />
Strength of the elements are ac 15 15 str 15 sv cold/fire, 100 hp shoulderpads, gotten from questing in wwastes and killing Guardian Kozzalym (simple duo you +cleric ifyou have epics...slowable), killing phinigel autropos in kedge (again, same duo/trio tops at 60), getting a ground spawn in skyfire, and then parking a brell rogue mule at yael and loggin him on before you play until you find him up...bring 2 clerics (he deathtouches :P) and a smattering to fill your 6 man and go get yourself some new shoulders...combine all fusible ore in the box the guy in WW asks for, some human wizard...hand back..poof 100 hp in the shoulderslot+otherstats.<br />
<br />
Ring of Bathezid/spirit wracked cord is a time consuming but worthwhile quest that results in 85 hp ring/100 hp arms/wrist/shoulders+aura of battle! Get ally in chardok first (most time consuming arguably..im 0 for 4 on drusella's urn though....my time is rapidly getting consumed killing her off, moreso than the faction..see below) by killing off Droga...waste any named mob you find, soothsayer to chief is awesome for this, ae if you can (cleric ae +anymag/wiz+you is plenty usually) and spend a few days down there.  Save salts/skins and hand them in to the woosae non kos sarnak in chardok to gain faction.  Don't give up..going from kos to threateningly is the toughest climb.  Once you are ally, you do a bunch of easy errand running for ring 1, then go wait for the angry goblin in droga to spawn (5 day?) bring one cleric and maybe one other ....kill off the forced spawn (hand in first) and turn in result after more easy errand running = ring 2.  Then hit jugs in Sebilis till you get a sinew, then camp Drusella Sathir in Howling stones till she drops an urn.  I have killed her 4 times, she's definately the bottleneck...no urn in 4 kills...some folks are reporting 7 kills with no urn...I keep on trying.  It's so worth it tho.<br />
<br />
Earrings of Veracity are the bane of my existance (2 more reports!).  Easy errand running for the first 2 earrings, the good one requires reports from seru.  These are horribly rare drops, very very time consuming and a full group kill+ for most new to be level 60s.  The end results are staggering though, especially if you kill Seru himself, and use his head for the last step of the earring (WOW, can you say wrong...20-25 to all stats 100 hp ish style earring).  The middle of the road veracity earring (reports one)is still VERY nice with truesight and 50 hp, 15 to a lot of stats :)<br />
<br />
Halls of Testing quests are still some of the best slots for our face/bracers that exist..neck arguably as well.  Tear quests from dozekar+named result in an aura of battle mask+85 hp, and 2 unreal bracers with 100 hp+other stats..and the silver bracer of speed has 41 percent haste to boot.<br />
<br />
Those are the quests worth doing IMHO :)  The rest are just fluff to be replaced rather quickly if you are involved with a strong guild.  Every ranger should have the strength of the elements and spirit wracked cord done ESPECIALLY IF you don't have a guild at all....just get your normal group together and work hard.  Eventually you will end up with a few of these :)<br />
<br />
If you were looking for some mid-high level gear, Might I suggest thurgadin Armor quests by killing with your 6 man in Kael arena area...bring a dire charm enchanter and have an absolute blast shooting away, or just tough it out with a pc tank :)  Also, you might look into the ice forged shackles (gnomes, iceclad) quest for a 30 hp? bracer with some stats,  Collar of the storm if you are on Giant faction is a rather nice neck piece till you replace it with something else.  <br />
<br />
And do your Raincaller quest if you haven't...because every ranger should play &quot;hair club for gnomes&quot; at least once :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need Ally faction with Di'Zok to get the first two rings.  Just tell the Herald &quot;I serve the Sarnak&quot; in the upper Amiable range and he will hand you the first ring.  Once you have that, you have the faction needed to complete the second ring quest.  You only need the Ally status to complete the Cord.<br />
<br />
Also, if you maintain your faction with Di'Zok (btw, only the sarnaks inside Chardok and the Sarnak Spy in FM are on Di'Zok, all others will attack you), you can recharge the 2nd ring, which has 5 charges of a right click, insta cast 25 point DS that lasts about 25 minutes.  It does not stack with Warders or Shields though, but comes in handy when a particularly tough SK uses Shroud of Hate on you.</div></div><hr />

Even Sean (after Morting his epics a while back) went and redid the quest just to get Swiftwind back. It's a very nice sword to have, even if all you do is shoot arrows at things. Earthcaller can be nice too - even if just to proc slow on a mob, then switch to something else.</div></div><hr />
