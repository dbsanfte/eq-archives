<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">if I am going to get epic, then should i ever worry about other weapon skills or just get a decent 1hp?  either way, what are some good weaps to get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should absolutely work on your other skills. You won't get your epic at level 1 and early piercers are nothing short of pathetic. Seeing as how Shaman only have 3 combat skills to work on it won't take you very long to max all of them. I'd be kicking myself if I wouldn't have work on my 2 hand blunt seeing as I just got my hands on a Drakkel Icegrinder. You never know what kind of weapon you're gonna get your hands on during your journey to your epic. So work on your other skills as well, otherwise you'll be kicking yourself later for not building your skills. It is much easier to build them up earlier than later.<br />
And some will even tell you that they use their epic for its DoT and switch it out for another weapon while meleeing. For meleeing I'd personally use a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang over the epic. So work on all your skills...<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i know exactly what weapons i will have...this will be my twink, i forgot i don't have the same sig here i do at ezboards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's a twink, Drakkel Icegrinder and Rune Etched Icewurm Fang are probably your best bets. The Icegrinder procs at level one. I can't remember when the Fang begins to proc. Swap them out and max both 2hb and piercing.<br />

<br />
SoF: some lame curse of the spirts effect<br />
Howling harpoon: pierce (procs stun)<br />
Iksar Beserker Club : 1hb (fastest thing a shaman can swing in the game as far as I know, use for 1hb training and interupting)<br />
Dizok Oracle Shilaghe : 1hb (procs slow)<br />
Blight, Hammer of Scourge: 2hb (procs scourge)<br />
Tarmok Battle Staff: 2hb (bane vs plants and can get 130+ hits in with it 33/44)<br />
Granite Face Grinder: 2hb great ratio for a 2hb, general damage dealer<br />
Evercirriculum: 2hb 15/25 (procs knockback) - great for annoying tanks and interupting casters, and its groovy cause its a broom.<br />
Journeymans Walking Stick: 1hb (procs tash)<br />
<br />
<br />
point being, I use them all, and find them very helpful. With crappy weaponskills they are useless.<br />
<br />
pierce 200<br />
2hb 194<br />
1hb 185</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sprinkler of the Spirits is 7/16 and very nice stats<br />
<br />
usable by clr/dru/shm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The rune etched icewurm fang doesn't proc until level 35 but it is still a great piercer before then since it's so fast. I got one in my early 20s and it made soloing much, much nicer. I love that spear. I also concentrate on 2hb and use a Blight quite a bit these days. I haven't put much work into 1hb, which may come up and bite me in the behind, but I haven't come across any decent 1hb weapons, so it hasn't been a problem yet. I still plan on raising it at some point though, as I may run across a 1hb that's too good to pass up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aerroch Icedragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shrug, I use a Paw of Oppola, and have since level 40 or so.  If I ever ended up obtaining an epic, I would equip that, but for the stats/spell, not for poking stuff.  I much prefer medding/casting/cannidancing to poking anymore....piercing's at like 160ish, 2hb 150ish, and 1hb is like 26.  I just don't really use weapons, even while soloing.</div></div><hr />
