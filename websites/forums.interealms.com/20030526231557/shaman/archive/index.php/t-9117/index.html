<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today my guild got our first glyphed rune word and we decided to turn in for shaman spell.<br />
<br />
I got Ferine Avatar.  I swear I almost cried in RL, the last of my choices for a level 65 spell.   I felt wretched that we could have tried to turn in for hand of virtue or something else, but we blew it on avatar.  I almost never use regular avatar, I just don't have the slots to keep it memmed often and it is far too costly to use in exp grps.  Though, as a guild with 0 primal weapons perhaps I should have been using it more.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I came here with a bit of good news, despite the fact I was unhappy to get the spell.<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar only has a 1 minute recast timer!!<br />
It also requires no emerald.<br />
<br />
This really makes it leaps and bounds more useable than all the previous versions, in my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">um duh, its late and i realized this should be in the spells forum, sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would have been nice if it was a groupbuff though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is a great spell, you can keep it on 8 or 9 melee at all times with good timing and casting reinforcement aa and item.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation you would probably have to assign 1 shaman to this as his main duty.<br />
<br />
Someone in FoH discovered that there is an attack cap from items and the primal procing avatar is limited also by this cap. I believe some of the ubers out there are already limited by this cap, so casting the avatar line is useful to them as castable ava isn’t limited.<br />
Also they don’t have to swap out primal to get the effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Casting avatar every min on 9 pre assigned melee is difficult, as you need to keep a list.  What I did was create a small channel window, called it avatar list, and created a hotkey that tells me who I cast Ava on last<br />
<br />
/cast 5                                 (Slot 5 is where I keep my Ava spell)<br />
/3 %t has been Ava'd     ( 3 is Ava channel name)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent idea, Murphy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tis a good idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice suggestion Murphy!  Works like a charm.  <br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />

I just wish there was a way you could pipe the /time command alone into that window.  Its part of the &quot;other&quot; filter command but that include /w and out of food, dismount and tons of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I keep ancient Avatar mem'd as well when on a guild raid or grouped. I cant seem to think of a useful spell to keep in slot 5 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This thread is just you trying to cheer up about getting the worst 65 spell; that's ok though! My first and only rune resulted in Ferine Avatar as well. I'm not happy about it, but it's not completely useless.</div></div><hr />
