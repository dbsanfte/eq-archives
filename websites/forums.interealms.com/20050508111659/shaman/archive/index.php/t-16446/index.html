<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xeoc Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious how people handle the role of being the primary or only healer in groups, particularly LDON or dungeon crawls.<br />
<br />
I have been using nearly 100% of my mana on heals and regens, but the difficult decision is buffs/haste/slow. <br />
<br />
Slow obviously decreases mob damage output, therefore making healing more efficient, but thats lost healing mana. I know that slowing is a major Shaman role normally, but when I am 100% of the healing power of a group, I have trouble deciding when to take the blinders off of being essentially in cleric-mode.<br />
<br />
I am looking for advice from tenured Shaman about making the decision to burn that healing mana that may be needed for an overpull, etc, on other things like slowing and haste.<br />
<br />
It's much worse when there is no other haster/slower in group, because then the decision is even sharper, as haste/slow would greatly increase the offensive/defensive dps, but would leave me completely unable to heal 6 people through thick and thin.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any sage tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The way I look at it either you are the healer or you are slowing, but you really don't have the mana or the ability of control agro if you do both.<br />
<br />
I have only been the primary healer in MM dungeons where a good portion of the slowing can be done by the Necro.  As far as the buffing goes that is no problem if you can get folks to understand that if they want to have buffs refreshed they will have to wait just a monment.  Usually the time that it takes to recast buffs is only about the time it would take to kill 2-3 mobs so you are not looking at a big loss of time if you only have to recast buffs ONCE during the 90 min adventure.<br />
<br />
I have been on two adventures with duel shaman and those two adventures were extremely successful as judged by how much spare time we had left.  It is odd how different Shaman are now as far as stackabiltity compared to the old days.  It used to be that 2 Shaman were a waste of a group slot.  Now with stacking DoTs and mulitiple roles, two Shaman in a group can function in two very different ways.  Which reinforces my point that as a single Shaman in a group you have to choose what function you will play.  I basically break it down into Healer/Buffer  or Debuffer/Damage with of course some overlap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At your level, it is probably better to heal than to slow. If things are taking a long time to die, making slow more efficient, but you don't have the mana to slow, try using Drowsy. In general, don't waste mana on stat buffs (Sta, Agi, Dex) at low levels; HP, AC, regen, and haste are the main things to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, pre 51 and turgurs, using a lower level slow generally helps a ton, the difference isnt that great usually and you'll save a monsterous amount of mana in the process.<br />
<br />
But if stuff is dieing quickly it often simply isnt worth slowing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In ldon as the primary slower I usually malos and nuke.. worked for us so far =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At your level heal and haste were the key.  Regen if you can afford the mana, it saves some healing.  Again dont worry about buffing unless you are full mana and looking for a place to use it (which doesnt sound like the case).  Slow is probably only worth it if the mobs are taking a long time to die.  Like the above poster mentioned use the lower level slow if you are going to.  It uses quite a bit less mana (20 for drowsy vs 60 for walking sleep) and the difference in slow % is not that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agreed on using the lower level slow.  At 58 I still find myself swapping out Turgurs for Torgors for fast pull/fast kill groups like LDoN has.  The mana savings add up and the difference in slowness isn't that great IMHO.  I can usually handle Primary healer/slower roles, preferably with help from a KEI, in that case.  Although admittedly I do better at that outdoors where I can get standing med on my leezard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At your level, you are better off just healing rather than slowing.  Your slow just doesn't make a big enough difference to warrant the mana use and aggro generated.  As you gain more and more levels, you'll slow more and heal less, and eventually you'll start healing more in addition to slowing, as you get uber gear that gives you plenty of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pelnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have now played 2 adventures and been primary Healer on both.<br />
the first went great had a small group of 4 that handled agro well so i only had to worry about the main tank.  They understood that i couldnt do the full job of a cleric and buff too so it went well.<br />
<br />
My second trip was a disaster and I should have pulled the plug before going in.  the group was a bunch of misfits and loosers who kept arguing and one by one biled on the adventure untill we went from 6 to 3 and got pounded.  The idiots while we were in the dungeon broke mez on multiple mobs and I could barely save the chanters life with the limited mana I had.  after 1 death and down to 3 in group I gave up.<br />
<br />
As primary healer I was straight cleric no buffs and constantly oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've have been primary healer in LDoN with another sham on a warr and with an ench on a pally... never really got below 50. I enjoyed it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm level 52, and tend to get planar groups quite often so usually i'm not the primary healer, because 1 level 52 shaman being the only healer in a tier one plane = death.<br />
<br />
When I do LDoN adventures I can usually handle being the primary healer, but its not something I really enjoy, i'd much rather slow/dot/nuke :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slowing has always been the key to being a main healer as a shaman.  Combine slowing with regens and you should be able to handle things with reletive ease.  If you have 2 tanks, be sure to have them rotate aggro.  The tank with the most health that round should be the tank for the next fight.  Make sure that the main dps melee in your group has haste, dont bother with anyone else in the group, at those levels you normally have 1 Rolls Royce twink dealing out most of the damage anyhow.  Always sit, dont ever get up to melee, no matter what cool twink weapon you have.  Lastly always have root mem'd.  If you see multiple mobs called as incomnig... be sure to root before it hits your melee.  You will not be able to keep up if your melee are tanking multiple mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Winney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At your level I would think healing is the most important if that is what you have to do. Our slow at that level is rather small, you could most likely save more hps on group members using regen and heals instead of slow and spot heals and having to worry about mana, you could parse and crunch some numbers to be sure too. Later on with some work you can do both roles. I have been both primary healer and the slower on three different missions, two in Ruj and one in Tak. We finished with about 10 minutes to spare each time. I am level 65 with 144 AAs, full Ornate armor and FT6 With that the lowest I got was 28% mana. I would not have been able to do that with no Enchanter, but since we had CC and Pacify available it wasn't that bad. So yes it can be done later on in your career<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">at lv 61 and after 12 Ldon adventures (9and2) i can play the part of the healer it sucks big time , but it can be done, only have extended buff of 5%  buff up before we go in and then space out the haste regen so your not trying to cast haste/regen on eveyone at the same time seemed to work fine :) we won with time to spare even after one of the members couldn't zone in  and i kept haste regen sta/agi/khura's up the whole time we where in there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I start my own ldon groups and i perfer to be the healer and slower more dps with out another healer. <br />
<br />
Slow first then heal. Our heals wont do much if mob isnt slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I lvl'd up at off hours so I tended to be main healer/slower/buffer in groups.<br />
<br />
Basically if the cost of healing is above the cost of slowing you of course slow.<br />
<br />
If the cost of a buff takes away from healing or slowing it better be effective, the most effective buff is haste at low lvl's.  That is the one you really want on your mellee, stats are fluff.  Second is regen, which works great if your tank doesn't have a problem not being FH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Level 61 primary healer in PoD LCY = much winning. Enchanter / beastlord slowing, though.<br />
<br />
Level 61 primary healer in level 65-oriented MMC = instant wipe. Enchanter and beastlord slowing.<br />
<br />
I really don't know why.</div></div><hr />
