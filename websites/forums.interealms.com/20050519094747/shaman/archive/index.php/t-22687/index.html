<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As requested in Junaper's two-boxing thread, I've started a two boxing guide. This is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions or comments please feel free to add them. <br />
<br />
Multi-boxing guide<br />
<br />
Hopefully this guide will provide some getting started tips and suggestions for people considering multi-boxing in EQ. I started dual boxing my shaman with a cleric about two years ago and have never looked back. Currently I regularly play 3 characters and occasionally play 4 depending on who I’m playing with. I still definitely don’t know everything there is to know and hope others might add their suggestions to this guide as well. <br />
<br />
There are many reasons why you might want to play multiple characters. You may have odd play hours and have trouble finding a group or just don’t like people, some like the challenge of trying to run multiple characters at the same time, and others do it to effectively farm plat. Whatever the reason, there are many advantages to playing multiple characters and several disadvantages. Its nice to be able to log on for an hour and get some quick exp by myself when I don’t have time to get in a group, but its also a pain to keep multiple characters geared (and flagged). In the end I find it very rewarding and much more challenging to play multiple characters and be successful then doing a single, but it will be different for everyone.<br />
<br />
Getting started:<br />
<br />
Deciding the best way to play:<br />
<br />
The first decision you need to make is whether you’re going to use more then one computer to multi-box. It is much more efficient to use two separate computers then run multiple windows on the same box, but this isn’t an option for everyone. Having two (or more) computers side by side gives you the ability to access them at the same time and be able to easily see what each character is doing. This is especially critical for harder to play classes (more on that later). <br />
<br />
If you have two computers, but can’t afford or don’t have space for two monitors you can get a KVM to switch between them. These units come as cheap as $30.00 pre-wired for two systems. In most cases, they will have a hot key sequence to switch between the two boxes such as scrl-scrl-up.  This is the cheapest way to put too boxes to work, but you lose the benefit of instant access to both characters. If you’re computer isn’t fast enough to handle two windows, but you have another old box around collecting dust this is a possibility to consider though. <br />
<br />
The last option is software multi-boxing. This involves running multiple copies of EQ on the same system. This requires the least in the way of hardware, power, and heat, but you lose efficiency switching between windows and zoning can be especially brutal when running more then two characters at once. More details are provided below under software. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Software:<br />
<br />
The first thing many people ask is if they need to buy another copy of the software to start another account. Sadly, the answer is yes. You must buy another set of the software including all expansions. Currently SOE is offering a one-year package with all the current expansions for like $120.00. Starting next month EQ Platinum will be available for about $30.00 judging by the price of the previous packages. This will include all expansions through GoD. Occasionally SOE also emails current customers new account codes to use for friends or bot accounts. This is another good way to get started. <br />
<br />
If playing on the same machine you have a few options and a lot of it comes down to personal preference. First is to use EQ’s built in windowing function and call two separate instances of EQ. I’ve found this to be the slowest personally, but many claim it to be the most stable. <br />
<br />
There is also WinEQ, which has recently gone commercial (I think). I tried this program, but it had various graphics issues and lockups, and I wasn’t very impressed overall. The one nice feature this program has is the ability to tile the windows and it can give you a very nice four box look (on a big enough screen). <br />
<br />
I use EQ Windows myself, which is available at www.eqwindows.com. It also has some stability issues, for one it doesn’t like the windows task manager much. I have found it to be the easiest and most effective current option though. It can provide very quick switching between windows, which is critical on a same system setup. You usually will need to download a new version when SOE does any patch that relates to graphics.<br />
<br />
For any setup, I’d recommend having a separate copy of EQ installed for each window you plan on using. The primary reason for doing this is that you can have a separate configuration file for each one. For example, you may only want sound turned on for one of your instances, but not the others or turn on certain models for each window Vah Shir + horse on one, human + horse on another, ect. This also makes it easy to keep separate screen setups without screwing with your UI files. Maybe you want to run one window at 1024, but due to performance run the other one at 800. <br />
<br />
To make easy copies of your EQ directory you can just copy and paste it to a different folder (you don’t need to do a full install). For example if you have EQ installed at D:\evercrack you can copy and paste the folder to D:\moreevercrack to make a separate instance. <br />
<br />
Once you have EQ up and running, the best way to conserve system performance currently is through use of the clipping plane and the viewport command. The viewport command allows you to tell EQ which part of the window you want to use to render the game world. My primary multi-box system is setup with a window size of 1024x768 and a viewport of like 800 x 500. This gives me plenty of space at the side and bottom for my UI boxes and helps the system perform better. Especially in zones like PoK. <br />
<br />
Hardware:<br />
<br />
Hardware is very important to multi-boxing without giving yourself migraines. The issues that directly effect EQ multi-boxing performance are Memory, Video speed, Processor speed, and hard drive speed (in approximately that order). For memory, I would highly recommend no less then 512MB per character. Each instance of EQ uses about 350MB of RAM and if you have any less your system will spend a lot of time swapping to the hard drive which will kill your frame rate. The faster the memory the better, I would want at least PC2100 DDR to dual box at all.<br />
<br />
You could write an article this long on video cards alone. I use ATI and Nvidia, depending on which is the best at the price range I’m looking for. My three-box system currently has a Radeon 9800 Pro in it and runs flawlessly. It is also a very good deal right now as you can find them for $200.00 or less. Around $100 you may be able to find an Nvidia 5600 Ultra, which is also a fine card. Nvidia Geforce 4x00 cards are also good and available for around $50.00.  If you’re using an Nvidia card that ends in MX or even worse, integrated video you really need to upgrade. <br />
<br />
Processor speed can have a bigger impact in multi-boxing then it does in single box. If you have the money, get a P4 processor with hyper-threading, but if not there are some great deals on Athalons. The Athalon XP2600+ is a very good deal for horsepower that it provides. At a minimum, you probably want a P4 or XP chip for multi-boxing, and the faster, the better. <br />
<br />
I personally don’t worry too much about hard drive speed as long as it’s a 7200-RPM or better, but this is one place you can definitely gain some performance. One suggestion I’ve read a lot is to have each instance on a separate physical hard drive if possible. Serial-ATA raids are also very nice if you have the cash to splurge. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game Play:<br />
<br />
Comming soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WinEQ (The paid version) is much better than EQW in my opinion, primarily for &quot;emulated full screen mode,&quot; which removes any borders around the game window and restore some immersiveness when 2-boxing.  You can also name each window, so when alt-tabbing with more than 2 sessions, you can cycle to the exact account you want.<br />
<br />
Talk about graphics options....I multi-box (2 instances on same computer), and I have Luclin models on for my 2 characters only, but I have to have them off for the other races due to lag.  Same thing with spell effects (P2.4C, 1GB, SerialATA striped RAID, Radeon 9800, so not exactly underpowered in the comp department).<br />
<br />
Take about the Windows Application Compatability Toolkit, which allows Alt+Tab to switch windows under XP.  Also, with native EQ multiboxing under XP (no software), you lose mouse control when one account is zoning.<br />
<br />
Hyperthreading is dubious for performance gains when multi-boxing on the same comp, at least until I see some real tests.  The extra registers on a HT processor help to be sure, but HT works best when one app is FP heavy and the other ALU heavy.  2 apps trying to run identical code run into the issue of HT processors still having a single set of execution units.  I'll explain more if needed.<br />
<br />
The attack on assist variable is another reason why it's good to have separate EQ dirs.  Also, if you can spare the HDDs, have each EQ directory on a seperate FDD on a different IDE channel.<br />
<br />
Talk about hwo the use of EQW and WinEQ do techincally violate the EULA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive been playing off and on with a Zerk twink for the last couple weeks and I will say this about one boxing it.  EQwindows works fine but it has some issues.<br />
<br />
For me I have to let EQ load fully into a char before I defocus the mouse pointer from the window.  If I try to do anything when it is loading sometimes I get to where I cant focus the mouse pointer back into one of the windows and I have to log and reload that account.  It is a pain.<br />
<br />
One great thing about EQ Windows is that you can load up two accounts fully, unfocus the mouse and just use the keyboard (as long as the window is focused on one EQWindow the keyboard will work).  This works great for my shaman because I can just setup hot keys and click on the window click on the hot keys using the keyboard I want then click back quickly to my zerker.  I know they have a key combo to switch back and forth but I like this better.  It works great when traveling too because you can just use the Use key for Knowledge ports and such and you dont have to switch back and forth or wait for one account to load to get the mouse back.<br />
<br />
One thing you want to add to your guide is a section on Hot Keys and using them.  i.e. target, assist, spells, emote... etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just some hints from my experience.  I 2-box a Shaman/Cleric on Bristlebane, and a Ranger/Shaman on Lanys (Currently).  People learning to 2-box need to make the first decision of which toon is going to be the &quot;bot&quot;.  For me, I bot the Cleric on BB, and I bot the Shaman on Lanys.  Shaman and Clerics are 2 of the easiest classes to bot IMO.  For that matter, any pure caster is pretty easy because avatar position isn't as important compared to a melee.<br />
<br />
Hot Keys are your friend.  If you are like me and don't own a Nostramo, learn how to maximize your hot keys.  Every Shaman knows how to hot key Canni, but if you are botting a Shaman, you need to be able to scoll thru keys w/o thinking.  Saved spell sets are a Godsend, best thing to ever happen to 2-boxers IMO.<br />
<br />
Practice Practice Practice.  Spend significant time duoing before you join open groups.  I don't like grouping with crappy 2-boxers anymore than I like grouping with E-bay'd toons.  Good luck to you all!!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All very good advice. I've used both the eqw and wineq and found them to work equally well in the past although I did have some problems with wineq with lockups and such. Since the latest release of wineq and eqplaynice I've had zero stability issues. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm using wineq and eqplaynice (paid version). I play on a p4-1.5 with 512meg and a 256 gf vid and have no problems running 2 and sometimes 3 windows with the sound turned off and clip plane lowered on all but the main window. (btw, turning off your sound will greatly increase your framerate) The tile mode comes in handy but you will not be able to read the text unless you change the font and /chatfontsize 5. Also, the paid version of eqplaynice is well worth the money no matter which wineq you use. It reduces the framerate on the background windows to aprox 1 frame per sec wich reduces the cpu usage overall. If I don't use eqplaynice it takes aprox 20 mins to load up my second account and the framerate is horrible. With eqplaynice everything runs just as it should. Untill something better comes out I highly recomend paying the $10 (for 3 months) and getting the eqplaynice / wineq. That will at least hold you till next patch when sony integrates it's own version.<br />
<br />
One last thing before I head out to work. You can have one char follow the other and not be grouped. Just group the 2 chars, type /foll on one char and then disband. This is handy when when your PLing a twink and grouping isn't an option and you want to keep the PLer close to the twink. Also, to avoid problems, ALWAYS turn the clip plane down on the character that is following. It will reduce the lag and help prevent the second char from breaking /follow and running in circles for eternity until the next patch day.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
