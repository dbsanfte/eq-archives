 1.  Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).  (currently being evaluated) [possible upgrades to healing abilities in omens, current abilities will be evaluated after launch]<br />
<br />
2.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.  (currently being evaluated) [DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future]<br />
<br />
3.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. (currently being evaluated) [possible upgrade to Malos with omens]<br />
<br />
4.  Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
5.  An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. (currently being evaluated)  [possible upgrade with omens]<br />
 <br />
6.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. (currently being evaluated) [Omens spells still under development, current abilities to be evaluated after launch]<br />
 <br />
7.  Reduce DoT aggro!  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
8.  Endurance regen buff.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
9.  Reduce the cost of alchemy components.  (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
10. MGB Shrink.  (currently being evaluated)<br />

Now I for one would like to say from the very bottom of my heart. Thank you Sony Online Entertainment. it is good to know that you care so much for us. That you love us so much that you are willing to take what had to have been weeks worth of work to come to the conclusion that current shaman issues are complety fine. And that Omens of war will be able to catapult us to a new level of superior gameplay.<br />
<br />
After the time and effort you have put into the class top ten list. It is beyond a doubt that you have the best and the brightest working for you. And that thier steller examples of creativity, forthrightness, and increadible gift for getting right to the root of all of our problems was time and sweat well spent.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I truly want to congratulate you on being such steadfast leaders in the Online gaming market. Without a doubt your attention to detail, the cleverness that you show every single day, and your can do attatude will carry you even further into the future as the single best representaion of a bunch of lying cheating swindling bastards .<br />
<br />
That you So much SOE. <br />
<br />
We are truly not worthy to give you yet even more money and time. <br />

<br />
Implement the MGB'able shrink we've been crying for since forever, increase the stupid duration on FA, slap endurance regen on it, lose the recast on malos, and then erase alchemy from the MOST important problems facing the shaman community.  In the 10 minutes it takes to code that, you just freed up 5 slots on that list, which should have never been slots to begin with.<br />
<br />
Address our concerns now, before you expect us to pay you money.  Stop treating the EQ community like the drug users we are and give us something to praise you for, rather than something which makes us despise you.<br />
<br />
You're getting closer to identifying our issues, but you're not getting there fast enough and you're not acting on what you already know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's how I'd fill out that list.  Not with a vague listing, but with hard numbers and fleshed out concepts.<br />
<br />
1. Healing:<br />
-Daluda's mending: change from 1690 to 1950 hp heal, change recast from 2.25 to 5.<br />
<br />
2. Nukes:<br />
-Velium strike &amp; Ice age: reduce cast from 7.8 to 6.5 seconds.  Obkin's spear of mending sees mana reduced to 300 from 343 and cast decreased from 4.2 to 3.7.<br />
<br />
3. Dots:<br />
-Counters on dots remain, but counters no longer determine agro.  Dot agro is coded to be exactly in line with agro from nukes dealing similar damage.  Dots will also now check resistances on a per/tick basis rather than when the spell is first cast.<br />
-Ancestral vengeance sees increase in dmg/tick from 546/tick to 595/tick, putting it below the necro's curse, but making it respectable still.  All curses see their recast reduced from 30 to 10.<br />
<br />
4. Buffs:<br />
-Ferine avatar's and champion's duration increased to 36 minutes and made group spells (non mgb'able).  Ferocity 1, 5% damage modifier, and 5 endurance/tick added to FA and Ferocity 2, 10% damage modifier, and 10 endurance/tick added to Champion.  Mana cost increases accordingly.<br />
-Fo7 sees shielding 1, 3% dmg modifier (str/dex) and stats cap 55, while Wanvu sees shielding 2, 5% dmg modifier and stats cap 100.  Spiritual vigor sees addition of stun resist 1.<br />
-Upgrade to Bih'Li, make it equally un-pronounceable, but give it 63% speed (slightly less than SoE) and 35 attack.  Also, Shaman group haste spells see their haste increased to the level of their single target version.<br />
<br />
5. AA's:<br />
-Current Alternate Advancement abilities are changed to reflect dots as a viable means of dealing damage, making a critical affliction AA that mirrors fury of magic in every way.<br />
-Rabid bear's duration decreased from 5 to 2 minutes and given a 60 minute timer.  Add a no faction kodiak illusion, strikethrough 10, combat effects 10, in addition to its current effects.<br />
-Rabidity (3/6/9) increases duration by 1 minute and decreases recast by 10 minutes per rank on rabid bear.  In addition, the 2nd rank gives puppy an innate 30 damage disease based proc.  The 3rd rank increases puppy's dex by 75, the proc's damage changes to 75 with a -10 resist mod.<br />
<br />
6. Miscellaneous:<br />
-Make shrink mgb'able with a consent option for raids.  <br />
-Level 61+ puppies innately dual wield.  <br />
-Malo line sees recast changed from 30 to 5.<br />
-EP+ focus effects maintain their power up to level 70.  Focus effects like Improved damage, burning affliction, improved healing, etc will see their effects reduced.<br />
<br />
That only took me 6 bullets and I gave shamans something to sink their teeth into and test/argue about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not one to normaly complain too much, and I still enjoy playing EQ most the time...<br />
<br />
I'm not even in &quot;top end&quot; content. But playing in GoD and doing hard LDoNs I do see and experience the issues we have, although I can only imagine it just gets worse.<br />
<br />
How long have we been saying we need something done to make us more desirable? <br />
<br />
Yet they continue to either ignore us, or try to placate us. <br />
<br />
Do they not realize how alienatied and angered a portion of there player base is becoming? Or how many of us are simply hanging on untill we find something that catches our eye? <br />
<br />
It just astounds me that they continue down the path they have been traveling. I mean for crying out loud they won't even give us a straight answer, oh other then Rytan who's basically shown how he feels towards us.</div></div><hr />

No way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Is the purpose of our heal one where we continually spam it, or is it one where it is used to save a group member in a precarious situation?  Maybe it's just me, but I think I'd rather have a larger faster heal with a slightly longer recast than a slightly slower gimped heal with no recast.  My numbers were probably a little low on the healing amount, but that's the basic idea I'd prefer.<br />
<br />
On another point, at least you can say no way to that bullet and point out specifically what you don't like.  It may mean more criticism for SoE, but at least a setup like this will spur discussion with something more than misconceptions based on rumors.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I didn't think out the numbers on that heal like I should have.</div></div><hr />

------------<br />
<br />
Very good review of our needs.  A few comments.<br />
<br />
1) Like Gloriana I don't think our burst heal recast needs to be upped.<br />
2) Druid Ice Nuke is 6.35 seconds (ours should be the same)<br />
4) I would be happy with single FA, 15 min duration<br />
6) Really all we need is out of group shrink with confirmation. Not MGB<br />
6) Malos recast is from 10 seconds to 5 seconds (mis type)<br />
<br />
Also on my list:<br />
<br />
5) VP aa should have a negative resist modifier maybe -50.  Also we should have an Omens AA for VP to reduce recast time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">... and in regards to Daluda's... what about those just starting Gates content and, oh, may not have it, but are just as useless? or maybe unlucky and may not get it for a long time?<br />
<br />
Nobody gets handed all the spells for an expansion right off the bat... balancing spells and an expansion around the spells FOR the expansion is just... not an intelligent move.<br />
<br />
New expansions, should be balanced around spells and AA in the previous (though AA can be gained anywhere, so ... not so much on that one), not on those in the current (except for, maybe, deeper, however, they should be obtainable, fairly reasonably, by that point).<br />
<br />
No content should require any single class, period, that's just bad design in a multiplayer game, especially a massively multiplayer one. By the way, I am available for birthday parties, bar mitzfahs, picnics, and employment by gaming companies running MMORPGs that need a little &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am curious as to how other classes and their top 10 lists are looking as far as changes or evaluations...are they being told to essentially hurry up and wait? Or are they getting answers and getting changes?<br />
Either way, letting things hang out to dry till OoW comes out is NOT an answer. Fixing a CURRENT game problem by adding 5 levels, spells that are currently an unknown factor in usefulness and accessability, and AA that may (will) have insane costs is not the way to do things. Knights are broken in the high end tanking without really being overgeared or having way too many healers spamming them, Shadowknights far more than Paladins, and they too have been basically left hanging. Berserkers have no class defining AA, no real role in the game and really are in need of some love. Clerics need a little basic utility to help their portabilty (Invis, See Invis EB, and Lev would tickel the HELL out of a RL friend of mine that is a 65 cleric) and Monks need the nerf bat removed from their posteriors.<br />
This is simply causing more strife, more confusion and more anger...a top 10 list that gets NO consideration in the current environment is just like when you sat down with the Sears Christmas Catalog when your were 8 to pick what you want...lots of shiney pretty things, but all you really are gonna get is socks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As far as I am concerned the player summit hasn't happened.<br />
<br />
I could have save SoE all that expense by simply drafting a statement for Smedley to release saying the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;When all of you buy our next expansion we MAY get around to looking at issues currently in the game. Meanwhile over the next couple of weeks we are going to toss out some bones for you to keep you thinking we DO care. <br />
<br />
We'll also elect Community Class correspondents that we will completely ignore but hey, you can give them your issues and then bug them allowing our Dev's some free time to spend around the coffee machine&quot;<br />
<br />
There you go, a few lines that would have saved them all that expense.<br />
<br />
Smedley goes to Devs &quot; Hey guys, what non-essential things can we strip out of Omens and barely noticeable upgrades we can give some classes to make the EQ players think we really care&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev 1 &quot; well we can increase shaman regen spells and HoT's, it won't make a damn bit of difference to their situation so we don't have to worry about balancing it&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev 2 &quot; We can give them the cool new raid features, no-one is going to buy an expansion purely for those reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smedley &quot; Wow, you guys are cool, take a big fat bonus, and go back to ignoring player issues&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personally? I think the &quot;guild summit&quot; should have picked, say, 50 people, at random, but in categories.<br />
<br />
10 from &quot;raiding guilds&quot;<br />
10 from &quot;guilds with an average level over 60, but maybe only 3 groups on during peak&quot; (casual raiders I guess)<br />
10 from &quot;small guilds&quot; (maybe an average of level 30)<br />
10 without guild tags and not applying for any<br />
10 guides (yes, guides, at least 1 from each of the above categories too... I know that sounds strange, but if anybody's been around a large variety of issues, and player involvement, it's them - and if anybody works a very unthankful job, it's them - so they might be able to throw in a perspective even the previous 4 groups couldn't, at all)<br />

So.................you say............that the PLAYERS who gave feedback are to blame and not SoE?<br />
<br />
I do not know what type of drugs you are using but it must be strong stuff.<br />
<br />
Let me recap it for you.<br />
<br />
SoE sees a drop in subscriptions<br />
SoE sees a lot of angry people at various class boards<br />
SoE decides to use the good old smoke screen trick and invites people and states they will really listen this time<br />
SoE then checks and indeed anger level is dropping as people post the &quot;give SoE time to fix things&quot;<br />
A few months later anger levels are building up again as SoE did not do anything<br />
SoE appoints some poor guy as class spokesperson<br />
SoE still does not act but claims that when you buy OoW all will be fixed<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Would you believe them? If yes then buy OoW. if no then leave EQ and the $$farmers at SoE.</div></div><hr />

Of course, you mighta picked it up here. There are quite a few Bertoxx folks who post regularly and use this term, like Fuda, myself, Wuud, Otani (he may not use asshat, though, he has more class than me, heh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As for the topic itself, I knew it was going to be this way. Trying to balance all the classes at 65-Gates would just create a situation where they would probably have to be re-balanced at 70-OoW. I can certainly understand them trying to focus their efforts more on getting OoW right the first time (LOL, thats a god one eh) than put a lot of time and effort into balancing now, then having to do it all over again. New levels, spells, Aa's and gear ALWAYS change the balance in some fashion. <br />

fortunately alot of other classes seem to rightly or wrongly feel the same why so this time hopefully enough wont jump automatically and buy it. thats my only hope and certain wont be buying it straight away unless alot changes before release. as it is to soe, my purchase in on hold till you do something that makes me want to play again, and depending on what my guild do, eq as a whole might be on hold.<br />

we arnt alone though other classes are feeling the same lack of respect. and well balance you after OOW.. but it just seems the wrong way to go balanceing an expansion on classes that arnt balance? that cant be good.  surely you need then working correctly first?<br />

Of course, you mighta picked it up here. There are quite a few Bertoxx folks who post regularly and use this term, like Fuda, myself, Wuud, Otani (he may not use asshat, though, he has more class than me, heh).<br />

sorry to break it to ya bud but the first time i heard the term asshat was on a construction site about 12 years ago so it wasnt born on EQ but i will say i have met more asshats in EQ than anywhere else in my travels so it does deserve a home in EQ.<br />

now as far as the top 10 list goes all i can say is speak with your wallets that is the only way anything will happen because the only thing SoE cares about is their cash flow. now dont get me wrong im not saying you have to quit the game all togather but if enough people would take a one month break it would hit them where it hurts and only that will open their eyes to actualy start treating their player base as their employers instead of treating us like the crack heads and their holding all the rock.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who is gonna keep playing this game at least somewhat competiviely is gonna have to buy this expansion just for the 5 levels even without the spells, etc. That and the AAs. Lvl 70s boxes will be farming all the spots that currently take a grp of 65s. For example OoW will pretty much guarantee an uber guild the ability to single grp AoW thereby making a bad farming situation even worse. Non OoWers are gonna get squeezed out of the game unless they are only playing socially. SOE knows this and is counting on it to either keep the sales up or frankly hurt EQ to benefit EQ2 (hope they not this stupid).<br />
<br />
Personally I believe that the whole 5yr level update is a myth propogated by SOE to cover the fact that they messed up GoD. And if they did indeed hold back then they only did it to give themselves a guaranteed winner (as close as it gets) with OoW.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As far as dots resisting on a per/tick basis, I see absolutely no reason why this would be a bad thing.  Instead of being forced to recast a dot that was resisted in its entirety, a resist will be reflected in a single tick, which, when you think about it, is the way it should have been implemented.  Nukes can be partially resisted, dots should be as well.  When the game was young, I can tell you it wasn't a big deal.  But today, it's absolutely necessary that the entire dot system be revamped if we hope to remain current.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that this change, combined with a change in the AA system to reflect dots as a relevant means of dealing damage, as well as a change in the way dots generate agro, would make mobs fear us almost as much as they did back when my friends and I were tossing around Ice Comets and Ebolts.  Sony is currently 'looking into' dot agro, but for us to see any real changes, those three things must be developed at the same time.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm a sucker for lost causes, but I think reinstating the battle shaman isn't hopeless.  A fundamental change in the way we deal damage is all that is necessary.  Dots are the lifeblood of this change, but at the same time, adding special combat effects to certain buff lines, specifically offensive effects to a longer duration group FA, would amp the damage of our melee partners.  You may not always be dealing that extra damage yourself, but regardless, it is part of our total dps as shamans.  Toss in an improved Rabid Bear AA and an improved OoW puppy zerg, which we can use to put out nice burst damage, and I think many complaints we have about damage dealing will subside.<br />
<br />
After all that's done, the rest of what we need as a class seems to be a retuning of certain ridiculous items on different spell lines.  The recast on malos and our curses, puppy dual wielding, reducing cast time on velium strike, etc.  Fundamentally, that will take us about as far as we can go in today's environment.  It won't entirely solve how useless many people feel when mobs don't last more than 45 seconds, giving their shaman very little to do to a mob besides malos/slow/nuke.  But that's not a shaman problem so much as it is a content design issue for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll end up losing half their effectiveness on spells that will end up being worse than casting the level 65 spells we have currently.<br />
<br />
In other words, you'd be better off casting a level 65 spell because it'll be more effective, than casting a level 66+ one.</div></div><hr />

They are trying to force people to play more by creating a situation where gear w/focus must be replaced in order to be more effective. I think they just came to the realization that they made gear and focus stuff TOO good, and didnt leave themselves any room for expansion. Their solution, make older gear and older focii obsolete in the lvl 70 EQ World. Keep us chasing that carrot. I guess they still just dont understand that most of us will chase it ANYWAY. <br />

I think what Karaab was saying was that it was a suspicious bunch of people being invited. High-end raiding guilds and moderators of all the leading classboards.....hmmm....I would choose them too if it was me but only because thats the kind of people that has the most influence on the largest amount of people. Not because they are more knowledgeable about current issues.<br />
<br />
Its just sad that most of them refused to admit or realize that they were being used by SOE. I cant really blame them I had just hoped they would have been able to see what was going on through all the pampering.<br />
<br />
The joke that is our &quot;Top&quot;-ten list is just sad proof that they didnt intend to do anything noticable until well after the next expansion.<br />
<br />
They could have EASILY taken one point on each of the classes topten lists and done something about it if they truly wanted to. They could ATLEAST have outlined what would happen and promised that it wouldnt be neccessary to buy any expansions to benefit from the change.</div></div><hr />

 nothing really, as said its just thier way of making you play to get more gear, the fact that is a items had the same percentage but 80 more hp and mana would do the trick doesnt make it through the dev`s perceived ideas of what makes the game fun. but we already know that the current devs ideas of what is fun is thier own and not what most players want.<br />
<br />
also to a certain point the poeple who point out why complain just quit are kinda right. i think the thing that keep me playing so long is i was still mainly doing pop, only just got to god (which is aweful, repeative boring etc) and OOW is just one step to far. so the answer is for me the only reason i stilled played was because i was still at the fun stages. Now i am at the not so fun stages i am seriously considering stoping.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Just to restate the obvious ... SoE is going to TRY (and likely succeed) at selling you a product, THEN test it and look at balance AFTER it's release.  I just had to point a couple of definitions out:<br />
<br />
From dictionary.com<br />
beta<br />
<br />
/bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 1. Mostly<br />
working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in beta'. In<br />
the Real World, systems (hardware or software) software often go<br />
through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta<br />
(out-house?). Beta releases are generally made to a group of lucky<br />
(or unlucky) trusted customers. 2. Anything that is new and<br />
experimental. &quot;His girlfriend is in beta&quot; means that he is still<br />
testing for compatibility and reserving judgment. 3. Flaky;<br />
dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy).<br />
<br />
Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a<br />
pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software<br />
by making it available to selected (or self-selected) customers and<br />
users. This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product<br />
cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout<br />
the industry. `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test<br />
phase; `Beta Test' was initial system test. These themselves came<br />
from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a<br />
feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any<br />
commitment to design and development. The B-test was a<br />
demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.<br />
The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed<br />
on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C<br />
test repeated after the model had been in production a while.<br />
I guess we should all feel good as we are all considered by SoE to be lucky or valued customers for BETA testing their software in production.  Personally, I feel all warm and gooy inside ... no wait ... thats diahrea ...<br />
<br />
Video games are more adictive when there's some kind of challenge that frustrates you, but you overcome or at least adapt to.  With mudflation from expansions of content it looks like SoE has managed to find new ways to frustrate us since they can't seem to make the content reasonably challenging enough without going overboard or nerfing (a proven subscription killer).  I see excellent business practices here, let's hope no-one else picks up on it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is also the get better/improve, alot of games you work at it to get better things, increase your power etc, not just the challenging content. That is what they arnt doing as a shaman i found i really had very little need or reason to level. sure there are a few things that getting to level 70 helps/needs but not enough to make me want to? There is no spells that really stand out great, or many that stand our as need to get and that is why OOW fails. At 65 with the gear/ aa i have i will easily out do a 70 shaman with less aa and gear. and the stuff in oow needs good gear, for the most part.</div></div><hr />

I mostly agree.  My comments were more directed at pointing out what SoE has done well (well being relative to the business, not the players) and trying to keep it light hearted at the same time.  RPGs are based around character development, EQ more than others.  All the old reasons for progression are still there (see and beat new content and keep up with the jonses), but there's less desire to grind with all the dominance of the game swapping a few select classes and most of the others fighting for scraps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's good to know that all the 60+ focus effects will only work for 5 levels, and we'll have to collect a whole new set to just to become as marginally effective as we once were, despite the fact that previous focus effects worked on a wider variety of levels. I mean, rather than making a substantial portion of your player base happy and making level IV focus effects work up to level 70 by changing two bloody numbers they want instead to try something new that makes absolutely no sense and penalize the entire playerbase that relies on their focuses.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Who is making these decisions, and why do they still have a job? <br />
<br />
Doesn't Sony see that they are butchering this game? Obviously Rytan has no clue what he's doing and lacks a modicum of imagination. So why is he the lead spell designer? What has he done that is so revolutionary to be in a position of such prestige and control? It seems all he does is use a percentage calculator (improperly) to update spells and take the least useful of the best ideas a community offers and tacks them on at a fraction of the said useful percentage. Has he done anything to redesign the spell system? Why are people that aren't furthering the game allowed to continue to work on it? <br />
<br />
If something stagnates, it dies. Sony Online Entertainment is right now at the very cusp of being able to breathe life into this game again or continue doing absolutely nothing, thus giving it the killing blow. They have a product that has the potential to make them a hell of a lot more money than it is now, but it would require a level of corporate competence and consumer empathy that nobody allowed to make any changes possesses. It would require a lot more work on their end. The Guild Summit was a good start, but it wound up being absoutely nothing more than that, a start. Once again, a good idea stagnates.<br />
<br />
I'm not a computer programmer. I don't design or develop software or hardware. I can't say how easy or hard it would be to do all this. I'm just an account executive by day and horrible bastard/writer by night when I'm not Shamanginaing. If I allowed any of my accounts at work to stagnate the way Everquest has I'd have been removed from my position years ago. My company doesn't allow for stagnation or marginal improvements. They want one thing: results. You keep the client happy or the client leaves. If you have an unhappy client that's sticking around because you're giving them the best deal, you don't abuse that relationship, you fix it. As a writer I can afford to let a story stgnate, because when I come back to it I can do so with a fresh pair of eyes and improve what at one time was brilliant but in time has become mediocre. (Does that sound familiar to anyone?) <br />
<br />
That's why I simply cannot understand why Everquest is in the state it is in.  <br />
<br />
Right now Sony is just getting ready to put this game into Cold Storage by continuing with a lateral progression of spells and content lacking any creativity or imagination at all. What ever happened to outdoing yourself? What happened to revolutionizing genres? Sure, they say they're limited by old code ... but I don't think that's it at all. I think they're limiting themselves. They want money? They could make a killing by keeping Everquest at the top instead of having most of the player base just waiting for the next best thing to jump ship. By making the game the powerhouse it once was, drawing new players in and keeping a firm hold on old players they would easily improve their profits by 150%. If it was just one or two mistakes, they'd still have customer loyalty. Your customers have to love you to do that, and you have to make them love you.<br />
<br />
I just don't get it. <br />
<br />
I still have fun with my Shaman and love her dearly, but lately I find my fun comes more from the company I keep than the content I explore. I have more fun in /gu than I do raiding. I'll even be buying OoW. Not because I support Sony, but because I support my friends and guildmates. I believe with fervency that Sony Online Entertainment needs to re-evaluate their corporate structure and clean house before they can begin to effectively re-evaluate the classes. You can't spackle holes with incompetence.</div></div><hr />

not totally true, they stoped because people stoped leaving and so they thought we done enough now lets get back to making money.  not buying oow will do little to hold you back , you just wont get to OOW, which at this point wont be any hardship till maybe 2 month later when they finish thier beta? unless your guild is mad, or finished god/pop they would still be doing god/pop. You need this gear for OOW, least the bits further in. as for aa you can store 30, so you can catch up for oow aa, although there isnt many that are brilliant or add that much, and even then it only if you have the gear to make use of them most times. As for level 70 it will take very little time to get to 70, but for shaman there really isnt much reason to do so. maybe by making a stand your guild mates might think you know if shaman are bad enough that you dont buy it and say so and why , perhaps they feed back to ask for shaman improvements? SoE is gambling that levle 70 will make most poeple buy this, despite alot of negative feedback. and not just from shaman. call them on thier gamble dont buy it. it really wont hold you back that much, their is only 1 flaged zone and it will be likely very difficult to get to (it the top zone like vt, i expect some long time sink). Just waiting a couple week will make them sweat, and you can get popele who will buy it (cleric, wars, enc, druid) feedback.<br />
<br />
but not buying OOW you WILL hurt soe porfits. they will take notice. and despite what you say they did change GOD alot. change to spells to way more useful spells for us, not quite to where we wanted but they did change them that was due to poeple leaving! not buying god, though alot blindly bought it then left so more the poeple leaving that affected this, but still lot didnt get it too. IT will have an effect, but using your arguement is the best way to make sure everything stays the same.<br />
<br />
i only bought god after the improvements, and i wasnt left behind. and that was 5 months after it came out! at the very least you can likely leave it atleast a few weeks to a  month while poeple find out what to do.<br />
<br />
bottom line if you are happy with the spells we get, and happy with the way shaman are buy it, if not dont! and make a stand.</div></div><hr />

Look at BSK.... they have not got their special AA yet... (9/14/04 will be on... it takes 6months since BSK was born.)<br />
Same thing might happen for us.<br />
<br />
Conclusion; they want to concentrate on OoW because it produces some money. And they will stop to think our problem as long as they want. Good political way to resolve problems.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!<br />

Very true and frigging priceless! (OK, so I'm easily amused today ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">By not buying the expansion I'm hurting myself more than Sony. When my guild starts progressing through OoW content I'd be left behind. If I wait until Sony changes something to buy it, I'll be 5 levels behind my guildmates, not to mention the AAs. I'll have a lot to catch up on. They won't all not purchase it because I say not to, or because of Sony's track record. They want to play the game, to progress, get better gear and with the current decisions sony has made GoD and OOW will be the only viable spots for us to raid ... Time will be nice, but there's no point to it when we can start tackling GoD and skip it completely. It will become the next Vex Thal, all because of pisspoor product management.<br />
That's exactly like saying that your vote doesn't make a difference in government elections. I believe we are all agreed that that is untrue. If you want to effect change, then everyone needs to stand up for what they believe and not worry about what others do. It's pathetic for us to complain constantly but refuse to take advantage of the best option at our disposal to make any difference.<br />

We all want to beat EQ in some way or another. <br />
I realize you probably didn't mean that literally, but I still want to point out that I *don't* want to &quot;beat EQ&quot;. If I beat it, I will have nothing left to do and no further reason to play. That, I don't want. I want them to continue developing content that continues to provide a challenge, preferrable to a wide range of levels, regardless of whether or not it trivializes lower level content. There are always gonna be people who waste their time dominating content far below their level for cheap thrills or farming purposes. I don't want progress impeded by trying to make sure that doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />
