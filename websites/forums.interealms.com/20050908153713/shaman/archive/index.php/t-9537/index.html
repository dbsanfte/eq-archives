<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently running a duron 750/512mbsdram/GF2MX400 64mb <br />
I keep getting these lag spikes where my lag bar goes from 30s to 4000s constantly. My movement isnt lagged by it just acts like its going to LD or the lag bar will frag red till I mess with the clip plane or sky setting which normally fixes it. I normally run with clip and sky off and server filter on to help but I know people with worse PCs getting alot better performance out of them and was just curious if any of you have had the same problems? I also have tried the umbra and conservative file swap tricks which also made no difference. Hopefully someone can give me a few ideas I havent tried yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I get the same thing, and have DSL from a good ISP.  My guess is that it only seems as though playing with settings fixes the lag (other people have claimed that zoning, hailing npcs, and various other activities fix it), but that if the problem's going to go away it will do so regardless of whether you play with settings, hail npc's, or do headstands while worshipping Satan ;)  Personally I think its on EQ's side; we all know Sony won't spend a penny more than they have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fyi, /serverfilter was acknowledge as broken by SOE. this is were all lag peak came for the past monthes.<br />
<br />

its a free software program that sniffs out spyware on your comp.<br />

I was amazed at the improvement I got in lag issues after running. From downloaded at various sites, (kazza) I had picked up a large amount of spyware.  These little buggers were sucking up enough of me bandwidth to cause lag issues with EQ.  Just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />
