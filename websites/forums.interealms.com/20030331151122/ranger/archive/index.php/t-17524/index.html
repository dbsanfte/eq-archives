<br />
<br />
note: I cannot LFG for hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thicket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will be hard to find a group at that lvl imho.  Prob better to look else where for a group other than the planes unless you have friends you can join.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bariax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Plane of Justice (the weights in the waterfall) and get to know the zone.  There are a few places where I see partial groups (3 or 4 people) killing prisoners and the like.  PoJ I believe is the lowest level of the planes.  But it can also get more difficult as you go further in the dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Will I be KOS to anything in PoJ? went there by mistake when I was exeploring and was sooo scared of dying, a nice rogue showed me out though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not KOS unless you use wolf form. If you are fighting though and sub 59 the guards will assist whatever you're fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heilos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only the Gaolers of Justice will assist at the level, but they are pretty far in from where you will probably be fighting.  I solo there all the time at 58 and the Sentries of Justice do not assist what I am fighting (rats, prisoners and the like).  I believe once you get to either 60 or 61 the Gaolers will not assist either, its all level based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Memamen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be carefull in PoJ. I hunt there alot and in the early 50s the rats will attack you if you attack anything. Im not sure if the Sentry of Justices will also attack if you attack something (they are usually cleared most the time). The Iksar monk Ssrale and the Bird guy Twak (Not sure if that is their right names but it is something like that) will assist any other prisoner. I started hunting here at level 48. From 48 to 51, I got right at 1% per kill and 2% from the Iksar, he is the highest level prisoner I believe at level 48. At 51 it has slowed down to 1% every 1-2 kills. Hope that helps some if you do deside to go hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go fear kite in JP at 50, imo, unless you have fungi, then do BGs in LOIO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kinladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Plane of Justice Prisoner Killin 101<br />
<br />
Under level 56, all prisoners/rats/gaurds will assist each other. <br />
<br />
56 and higher, and most prisoners no longer assist, (That Monk Sralm will always assist no matter the level) in the first sections of the prisoner cells. As you move deeper in the levels for assistance go higher, and there are prisoners you will be KoS to. <br />
<br />
There are different levels to the PoJ jails, and each has thier good and bad points. Just do not take for granted that all mobs will not aggro. in fact on the second level if you are under 54, the rats wandering around will aggro without assisting. Poor little gnome SK friend of mine was a rat munchie recently. (And I didn't even get a chance to pratctice my gnome punting that night)<br />
<br />
I can tank on most of the prisoners in this area fairly well for exp groups, especially with a slower. Actually, since finding a cleric is so hard sometimes, my typical prisoner grind groups consist of a shaman, druid, ranger, warrior, pally, monkie. With a shaman these guys are a cake walk.<br />
<br />
If you go into the tunnels for the high AC/Wis Ring components everything will be KoS to you, and wait till you have a full group, with a good tank, a chanter, and cleric. The tunnel mobs are mean, thier hits come very hard, very fast, and have large aggro ranges. <br />
<br />
I've made PoJ my home for the past couple weeks, and have been getting really good exp, and even got my first AA point in there. It's a good grind zone for many types of groups, even the not so perfect ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tulouis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go fear kite in JP at 50, imo<br />
<br />
/agree. Is good exp, under-utilized zone, virtually empty now. And the animals actually drop decent coin and sellables =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, so I shouldn't really try the planes till 55ish then?<br />
<br />
Figure if no planes o power then its JPF till 51 or 52 then ethier JPF or the Hole enterance.<br />
<br />
*sigh* oh, well. I guess that sic XP will still be there in 5 levels :)<br />
<br />
just curious btw, on avg how long does it take to get an AA pnt. at lvl 60? at lvl 65?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hit Jaggedpine, the exp there is great up till about 54. Get yourself a KEI if possible, wolf form when you zone in and fear kite the griffons and anacondas. VERY nice exp and little downtime with KEI. I duo'ed with a druid from 52 to 54 there and the exp was good, considering it was being split. Solo, you'll do very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zempten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye JPF is nice. I stayed till 55 and then got a magician and cleric and headed into the Gnolls Tunnels and got 1 yellow a hour. No downtime either as the magician's air pet was rocking while I was just shooting with my arrows and buffing pet. If adds came I would just root them away from group. I was in the Barducks area. <br />
<br />
I personally find 57 to be a much better time to find a XP group in PoP type zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">An AA takes me around 2-2.5 hours (at lvl 62) in BoT with a good group...first tier zones aren't much better than say CT, BoT/PoV/CoD etc are where the good exp is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not wrong to, but you'll be sitting lfg a while</div></div><hr />

Looks like I am just gonna keep whaking those Bloodgills around for another level or so though then head to teh forest</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and on average do y'all think 4-6 hours per level is reasonable for 51 to 55 or even till 57?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Much more than that, outside of PoP, unless the removal of hell levels made some truly drastic changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Popigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">4-6 hours per level? What the hell am I doing wrong, its taken me about 20 hours to get from 51-52. Ive tried everything, Soloing JPF, Soloing DSP Hoppers, Grouped KC, Grouped Velks. Someone please tell me the secret!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Group PoP, and you'll probably get close to 4-6 hours per level.  Of course, it's probably pretty hard to get a group there at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Underbrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by TheRiov <br />
Not KOS unless you use wolf form. If you are fighting though and sub 59 the guards will assist whatever you're fighting. <br />
Found that out after leaving the trials area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Damn, 20 hours for a level? On the  Bloodgills I can make about a yellow every hour or so (KEIed though) and if I just fear-kited in DSP it takes about  2 min or so per kill with almost no time to find the next one, thats also about a yellow an hour</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KURB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">the bloodgills are doable at 50???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">sure. I think I dinged 50 there actualy. Using kunark gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>quixotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You are still 50 though right? It wasn't until 51 (or was it 52?) that the real exp shock struck and it just kept getting worse it seems. I just play now and dont even look at the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aanlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just hit 55 this weekend.  54 was without a doubt the absolute slowest level ever.  I thought 51 had been bad.  Took me probably a month of on and off soloing/grouping in Velks, BW, and KC.  Was constantly LFG it seemed and no one wanted a 54.  Told Either too high or too low.  Hopefully things at 55 will be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">KC is the worst exp I have ever gotten on Hawkwind...but that's probably because JPF spoiled me. I was getting anywhere from 40%-50% a day (3 or so hours) soloing in JPF with my self-buffs. I plan on staying here until I ding 55, then I'm going to try and find a group in the Planes or something. I never leveled so fast post-50 until I hit JPF - it's so sad that I wasted so much time soloing in DL and grouping in KC... I could be 56+ by now. Bleh. Now I can't stand grouping because of JPF, and I think I'm gonna cry because soon I won't be able to hunt here anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I hunted Griffons, Panthers, and Snakes...mostly Griffons because I could kill two in the time it takes to kill one panther or snake - I think they have more AC and/or HP than Griffs. /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lol kinda funny, wish there were this many exp spots back when I was 50. I recall doing Bloodgills and having to fight for the spawns and several near deaths. This was back without swifty and using swarmcaller.<br />
<br />
50's are the worst levels for most classes, particularly rangers.<br />
55+ it starts to improve slightly. <br />
<br />
There are alot of options at 50. I can also recommend the hole entrance. Very good exp and soloable or safer to duo. Chardok entrance or exit might be doable with one or two people if you were careful.<br />
<br />
POP is overcrowded as it is, if you aren't 60 finding a group is difficult even in Tier 1 zones, unless you are a chanter or cleric.<br />
<br />
I actually wish there were more spots to hunt at 65, I miss the old world. These days it's valor, bot,storms, or hoh. The last three usually require bringing your own group and the former is commonly called the Loio of POP these days :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lanandrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you get a guild group or a group that you know personally to go there, then you should have no problem hunting.  And you'll get absolutely UBER exp to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rolyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Another nice little exp spot at lvl 50 - 53 is the bat3 camp in SolB.  Invis up, head through SolA (look at a map from eqatlas or something to find the bat3 camp - its right next to the solA zone-line.  When you zone in, systematically take out the bats using swarmcaller to slow, and root/heal yourself when necessary.  This part is a little slow and dangerous, but fun.  Once everything is cleared comes the easy exp part.  You see, the bats are fear-kitable.  Start with the bat nearrest to the solA zone-line.  Snare him, fear, and whack away.  He'll path all the way to the tunnel, which is where you turn  back and wait for 'em at the zone line again.  As soon as fear  breaks, he'll come back for more.  Rince and repeat, pulling each bat to the zone-line before fearing 'em.  Our 18 second fears are perfect for this, as they drop early enough where the bat doesn't keep running away and get you into bad train-situations.  Just remember to not follow it too far down, or you get into some nasty areas of the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Also, this is particularly nice because you get the dungeon exp bonus (20% I believe).  One can do this well into 53 IIRC.  Anyways, good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Catwalkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">With a healer-type friend (druid or shammy works as well as a cleric) you can do the Coldain Traitors/Bodyguards in Eastern Wastes.  They are pretty good exp till 56.  Just avoid getting Stoneberg, he hits lots harder than the others and is more resistant.  Harmony does work on these guys and the zone isn't that far away with SoW, if you do get in trouble.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />
