<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Contagion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas all, <br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone could suggest a good place for me to powerlevel my friend's 40 rogue.<br />
So far we have been messing around in Echo Caverns on Underbulks/Fiends and the TM spawn area when possible.<br />
<br />
Was just curious if anyone could suggest any other spots?  We both have all expansions enabled.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
