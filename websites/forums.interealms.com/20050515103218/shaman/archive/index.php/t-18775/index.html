<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far ever new expansion has had at least one feature that made me want to get it (even LoY, the bank space and maps were enough of a hook). <br />
<br />
I've seen absolutely nothing yet for GoD that would make me want to spend 5 x $30 on it. They're adding new instanced content, but if anything like the horrible LDoN raids that will mean nothing to me. I don't have time to grind AA's anymore so that isn't a big deal. SoE's track history with new spells doesn't have me anticipating much at all in that department. <br />
<br />
Am I missing something about this new expansion that would make it even remotely worthwhile?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of the same old:<br />
<br />
1. Go to mob<br />
2. MT tanks in a corner or against a wall<br />
3. Others stay at max melee<br />
4. Clerics Ch rotation<br />
5. Others assist heal/cure as needed<br />
<br />
You actually have to do some other more interesting thing's or figure out some means of continuing on.<br />
<br />
Personally I like these more creative types of raid content and am looking forward to more of them.</div></div><hr />

Personally I like these more creative types of raid content and am looking forward to more of them.<br />
<br />
And where did I see this creative raid content in LDoN?<br />
All I see is a lot of trash to be killed and then a fast Boss (ok the bosses are kinda fun but the trash section sure aint)<br />
<br />
And to answer the original question:<br />
No I doubt I will buy it, seen nothing that makes me want it and the EQ has become very stale recently.<br />
NOW if there where some interesting abilities or spells that would be different but getting another set of spells that marginally improve the current ones we have is not enough for me anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't bought an expansion after PoP on either of my accounts, I just am not entirely happy with the direction the game has gone in.  While there's an outside chance the expansion could go back to EQ's roots, have some quests, worthwhile tradeskills, content for the non-uberguilder 98% of the playerbase or equipment for them that makes a group of them as powerful as one Time-geared character - in which case I would buy it - there's also an outside chance that pigs can fly above Hell's snowy landscape ;)  So, not buying it.  No way in hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll wait my usual month or two for Sony to get most of the awful bugs out and see what other people think about it.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I know I would like to see is the new Beserker class. But then I suppose people will be making twink Beserkers so all the spots that their armor drops will be camped and their stuff in the bazar will be way overpriced. Again, I'll wait one or two months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Waiting to see more information. I will probably buy it though as eq as lately is just so boring to log on, and raiding wise, my guild don't want to raid ldon, and since we now in time, elemental raiding gets boring. I hold optimism for the expansion, they have always maintained an area of novelty and innovation with each expansion, nothing to say they won't do the same this time. On first glimpses though I hate that leadership thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is some intresting things, but mostly its just the same old same.<br />
<br />
TIll they address the real broken things about EQ and stop catering ot mostly the high end raids and make EQ more like it was before SoL came out, I dont really see myself buying anymore EQ products, unless the beserker class is hugly fun to play or something, which  i cant see that happening. Pure melee cant solo and waiting fro a group is lame.<br />
<br />
Never know, but i voted no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And where did I see this creative raid content in LDoN?<br />
<br />
Just to clarify... I said more creative... they could be improved on, but LDoN raids *are* more creative than pre-LDoN raid content.<br />
<br />
Synarcana isn't one where you clear a bunch of trash to just kill the boss.<br />
<br />
Sand Beast isn't one where you just kill a bunch of trash to kill the boss.<br />
<br />
Guk isn't one where you clear a bunch of trash just to kill the boss.<br />
<br />
Need I continue?<br />
<br />
Oh, and GoD will have more LDoN style adventure/raid content, so yes it applies to his 'original question'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">for me it all depends on the AA/spells added as far a content goes there is still far too much content I havent seen and will likely never see. (try getting keyed for VP, ST, or VT in a guild that is only interested in pop /groan ) I boutght LDON the day it went live without really researching what the new stuff was and with the execption of bane was extremely dissappointed spell wise and the instances are not in my opinion what they were advertising. therefore it will be waiting untill i know if it is actually worth it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nah , Sony can only make crap software like : loy ,pop ,ldon,luclin .

Maybe they put in some interesting raid stuff the the time people, but everyone else just got the clear crap for three hours, kill boss stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It think its quite obvious that 99.5% of all powergamers will buy any expansion that offers new bosses/zones/AAs/spells.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm not an uber powergamer by any means, and for the first time ever I am very much doubting that I will be in any kind of rush to buy this expansion.<br />
<br />
LDoN was supposedly gonna make it able for casual players like me to get resonably good equipment so I bought that. Now several months later I realize that I could easily have survived not buying it because it sure as heck doesnt make a casual player elemental-level equipped...unless you play it for well over a year. And then you would still not be able to do much else since everything &quot;interesting&quot; is strictly for powergamers.<br />
<br />
I just wonder how long SoE can get away with releasing expansions where all the interesting things are reserved for uber-guilds and powergamers. My guess is that they number around 20000 for all servers combined. But SoE still focuses a huge amount of their resources on keeping those people playing instead of making it a better game for the rest of the 400000+ customers they say they have. But sadly it will apparently take something like the release of WoW to make them realize how shortsighted a decision that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well said Spiritblood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You gotta love that 'GoD' thing...soon before WoW and EQ2 will likely release EQ releases an expansion that proclaims itself as 'god' (of MMORPGs) !  :P<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
I don't like the sound of anything they're adding in the next expansion.  If they add more fun instanced content that can be enjoyed by the majority that'd be nice, since I like that, but I either don't like or would prefer not to see the other stuff they're gonna do.<br />
<br />
I mostly enjoy EQ but I long for something new, different, and better.  EQ is a great game but it's not without flaws and I really, really hate the greed it breeds.<br />
<br />
It could just be that I'm bitter because although I play a lot I choose not to be in a guild and have a casual style - which means I haven't had a gear upgrade in almost 10 levels, have 1 of my 65th spells, and I'm broke - with no reasonable prospects for improving that situation anytime soon.  I kind of get sick of feeling like unless I'm in a strong guild or a plat whore that I have no chance of even being mediocre.<br />
<br />
With any luck there will more solid release date info for WoW and/or EQ2 before GoD release, which could impact my decision more than anything.  Who knows, by that time some of us (ME) might be in beta for one or both of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chelesa_Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">With each recent expansion I usually say I'm not going to buy it but usually end up getting it a week or so after release.  This will probably be no different lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For me, I don't even care about new content ...<br />
<br />
Until Sony at least makes a promise (heck, it can even be a blank promise) that they will look into fixing crashing issues, I do not plan to buy another Sony product again.<br />
<br />
I refuse to spend any more money on a game that continually aggrivates me by INCONSISTANTLY crashing anywhere from once every 15 minutes to sometimes only once every 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Heck, I would even settle for an acknowledgment that their programming sometimes conflicts with some systems. But all I ever get is &quot;There is a problem with your system and we cannot resolve it&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think LDoN(is) and GoD(might be) a great expansion for the non-'powergamer'.<br />
<br />
Instead of putting in block of 3-5 hours or more to get equipment upgrades, a player can spend shorter amounts of time per session to eventually get equipment upgrades that are quite good. I wore the Incorporeal Tunic with some augments on it to upgrade from a Vindi BP for a good while. LDoN is a benefit to the casual player. The only benefit to the 'power-gamer' is one or two temporary pieces of equipment, a few augments from vendors, and the dropped raid augments. LDoN is more of a benefit to the non power-gamer. All I can put in my equipment is type 7 and type 8.<br />
<br />
Of course, this might change since no one really knows what changes GoD will bring. There might be additional items placed on vendors that are more than 1492 ap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it'd help at all, but one of my wifes systems was constantly crashing while zoning. She deleted all her ini files and recopied from another system and then everything worked fine. <br />
<br />
A few months ago I had a system crashing like your describing from every 10 minutes up to once a day. It turned out to be a marginally bad <br />
RAM stick, changed it out and everything was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'll order it just because I'll feel left out if people go to new zones and I can't :P Then of course one month after I get it I'll regret ever buying it :) Although lots of new AAs and some look pretty good...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">GoD looks like a steaming pile of monkey excrement.  I have seen nothing at all interesting to pull me into preordering it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would be less likely to think it was Sony's fault if I didn't start crashing IMMEDIATELY after a patch (about 3-4 patches ago).  Before that patch, I never crashed at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do thank you for taking the time to post a suggestion, however.  Heck, its more then most SONY tech support personnel would do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have bought every expansion to date.  Usually pre ordered them and was checking out the new stuff on day 1 of release.<br />

There is nothing in the release information so far that even has me remotely interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sanctum Keeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well from some of the AAs that they are releasing i dont think its worth it, we get some Weapon AAs and Enhanced Rabidity, this is crap, instead of working on the old AAs they make new ones to improve the old ones who were worth crap. This is Insta expansion fever, they released LDoN not so long ago, to me they just trying to make more money before the new MMoRPGs get out.</div></div><hr />

Don't do it in-game or just turn the volume down, put an empty text file called nosound.txt in your main EQ directory (folder) and try running the game.  Sound accounts for a huge amount of problems &amp; conflicts in this game.  Without it you're really not missing all that much anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sadly i feel that eventually i will get it. I mean, i'm here...answering a post...about a game that i play all the time....and when im not in school or playing it...im reading boards about the game. So overall its just another investment in my hobby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So far i havent seen anything interesting in the marketing-mumbo-jumbo for GoD. More zones - *yawn* (how about proper revamps of old and empty zones?), more AAs - *rude* (instead of fixing or replacing insults like Rabid Bear), new Class - *shrug* (will introduce new balancing problems), new tradeskill recipes - *laugh* (like the halfarsed things introduced with Ldon which nobody really needed?).<br />
<br />
For the first time since i play EQ I am in doubt if I will buy the new expansion.<br />
 <br />
I am a more casual player, in a casual raiding guild (2 times per week, not Elementals enabled). For the casual player LdoN was ok, but for the casual raiding non-Elemental-guilds it was a smash straight into the face. Currently we have big problems to find anything worth raiding at our scheduled raid times, cause everything is killed within hours after spawning. If Verant would introduce instanced raids for the non-Elemental guilds I would consider GoD useful. I think 80 percent of the current playerbase would find it useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other odd thing is if you buy this expansion from a retail store you get a special in-game item.  So, I decided not to pre-order this expansion.<br />
<br />
Seems to me this is kinda backwards...if I pre-order (i.e.;  support the company before even seeing the product) I should get something special...as it is, I get more by waiting. :confused:</div></div><hr />

 This sucks, that sucks, blah blah blah.<br />
  If ANY of you hated the game as much as you pretend to on these boards, you wouldn't be wasting so much time playing it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">well, at the moment, all I can see about that next expansion comforts my idea. I won't buy this expansion. Having to do AA to FIX game problems isn't my conception of the game. ( aka: group buffs hiting pets ). Next expansion is 50 AA for pet innate dual wield ?<br />
Having a -30 resist mod slow but 70% and+50  more mana isn't what I expected since beasts will have a resist adjust too for 25mana increase.<br />
The only one thing I can see, but that is important, is that beast slow has its casting time increased from 3.5sec to 5sec, dunno what it does with their innate casting haste, but should be behing us.</div></div><hr />
