<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a lot of discussion about dot aggro lately and have spent a lot of hours doing a lot of testing the past week or so.  I'm going to share some of my results and then offer my thoughts/analysis.<br />
<br />
Setup:  The tests were doing using an SK and various DoT casters.  I used a shaman, a beastlord and even a necro in spots just to test my results across a couple classes and to test different dots.  The usual setup was me pulling a mob and then having the SK pull it off me with a 200 hate spell.  Then I'd do various things until the mob turned, then hit the mob with 200 hate, wait for turn, cast again, and just ping pong aggro back and forth like this keeping track of exaclty what it took to turn the mob each time.  Characters were on level ground, same faction (max KoS hehe), had backs to the mob at all times to avoid ripostes, etc.  The tests were as close to identical as I could get them.  I'd stay in 3rd person view and keep the distance between chars as close to the same as I could without using /loc.  <br />
<br />
Case 1:  Plauge -  Plague is very low initial aggro.  Once the SK had taken aggro it took me casting plague and then it doing 2 ticks to turn the mob, then my SK would cast a 200 point hate spell and the mob would turn back,  next plague would tick 3 times (55) and then turn away from my SK, after this I'd cast a 200 point hate spell again and the mob would turn back.  Then plague would tick 4 times and mob would turn.  This is where it stabilized.  Plague almost always takes 4 ticks of 55 to turn the mob from a 200 aggro cast by my SK or 4 X 55 for 220 total &quot;tick&quot; damage.<br />
<br />
Case 2:  Venom of the snake -  Venom of the snake is higher initial aggro like most of us know because of the poison counters.  The thing to note though is that once aggro was onto the SK it took 4 ticks of Venom (59) to turn the mob.  A 200 hate cast and it was back on SK, 4 more ticks, and it turned away.  This was tested numerous times and to turn from a 200 hate cast usually took a total of 4 X 59 or 236 total &quot;tick&quot; damage.<br />
<br />
Case 3:  Curse of spirits -  This was nice because curse of spirits is low aggro when cast and it builds up as it runs its course.  What would happen with curse of spirits is this...<br />
<br />
11, 23, 35, 47, 59, turns away from SK, cast 200 hate mob is back on SK, 71, 83, 95, turns away from SK again, cast 200 hate again mob back on SK, 107, 119, turns away SK again, cast 200 hate again mob back on SK, 131, 143, turns away from SK again.  <br />
<br />
In other words it was 175 total &quot;tick&quot; damage (+ landing the spell), and mob turned, then 249 total &quot;tick&quot; damage and mob turned, then 226 total &quot;tick&quot; damage and mob turned.  <br />
<br />
Case 4:  Venom of the snake + burning affliction.  This was just like the previous tests except once I landed the spell I swapped in a burning affliction item to focus the damage of all the ticks.  In the previous tests Venom took 4 ticks to turn a mob.  However, once I added in BA the mob was turning in 3 ticks.  I'd get things like...<br />
<br />
65, 64, 67, TURN  (or 196 total &quot;tick&quot; damage)<br />
70, 63, 64, TURN  (or 197 total &quot;tick&quot; damage)<br />
<br />
I kept hoping for a series of 60s to see if it'd take 4 ticks then to turn, but mob kept turning from 3 ticks instead of 4.<br />
<br />
Case 5:  Plague + critical affliction.  Plague is just extremely predictable and after all the tests I ran it was just really easy to predict when the mob would turn.  Like was said before once the initial spell is cast and the first couple ticks happen plague settles into this really predicatable situation of 4 X 55, turn, 4 X 55, turn, etc.  However, with critical affliction a tick of 110 meant that mob would turn in 3 ticks instead of 4.  <br />
<br />
Case 6:  Scorpion venom + critical affliction.  Scorpion venom does 146 per tick (spell is basically ebolt, but eats an eth to get).  What happens with scorpion venom is that it takes 1 or 2 ticks of 146 and the mob turns to bst, cast 200 hate with SK and mob is back on SK, nother 1 or 2 ticks and back on bst, etc.  This is how it always goes.  However, with critical affliction what happens is that if a crit tick of 292 turns the mob my SK could cast a 200 hate spell and the mob simply wouldn't turn back.<br />
<br />
How I think dots work after all this testing:<br />
<br />
When a dot is cast works like any other spell and generates aggro.  In the case of disease dots this is quite low; well in the case of poison dots the aggro is fairly high.  However, what appears to be happening is that each &quot;tick&quot; the dot generates more aggro based upon the amount of damage it does.  Now I've also been testing nukes and the aggro they generate seems to be tied to the spell itself.  One example was having a spell with base damage of 675 get resisted and generate more hate than a spell with base damage of 450 that was ID focused and crit.  Unlike nukes though dots seem to simply do aggro based upon the amount of damage the tick did.  The tests with BA and Critical affliction both showed noticeable increases in aggro.  Also from the testing this amount of aggro generated by a dot tick seems to be in the area of 1 point of &quot;tick&quot; damage to 1 point of aggro.  From my testing I don't think it's quite a 1 to 1 ratio, but there are many unknowns with aggro still, so I just can't say for sure.  <br />
<br />
From all of the testing (this isn't even a 10th of it) it does appear clear though that dots are generating aggro tick after tick.  From the tests though this doesn't seem tied to the counters on the spell, or duration it runs (unless like curse of spirits the damage scales up), but rather just to the amount of damage that tick did.  Meaning that even though poison dots are higher initial aggro if you stack a couple disease dots on the mob that total up to more &quot;tick&quot; damage you'll be generating just as much aggro per tick.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think this needs to be changed.  We've all known that dots did crazy aggro for their damage as it was, but this double aggro seems excessive imo.  You pay aggro when the spell is cast and lands and then you pay aggro again tick after tick.  It's no wonder people are pulling aggro even when all they do is use bane because each tick they doing about the equivilant of an anger II proc.  With BA this appears to go up and on those great crit ticks we paid so many AA for appears to make it go up even higher.  <br />
<br />
I hope I didn't get too far off track hehe.  There are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to aggro, but from all of these tests and others I've done the amount of aggro dots are generating each ticks seems excessive in my opinion and I do think it should be looked into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, it appears to me that what is happening is the original spell generates a level of hate, then per tick damage increaes that hate. <br />
<br />
As dots do damage over every tick we are permanently at a certain level of hate &quot;potential&quot; + per tick damage. So when we start to load on dots to do our damage that potential + per tick damage are cumulative. The problem here is we are permanently hovering around the max hate level unless you have a seriously well equipped tank, or a good pally/sk.<br />
<br />
it would be interesting to load up some of the lower level SK hate spells and see how much hate it takes to get aggro initially from a shaman pulling with a DoT.<br />
<br />
Most good wizards (i.e. ones that don't like to die) will not nuke until a mob has lost, say, 50% of its hps and therefore his big nuke raises him on that list but keeps him below aggro level. Unfortunately for shaman with todays FPS game if we want to do significant damage we have to DoT very early keeping us very close to the top of that list - especially if we have already malos'd (minor hate) and turgur'd (major hate) the mob.<br />
<br />
Even reducing the initial hate of a spell will not help us do damage much, because of the per tick effect we can easily stack enough dot's to keep us right up there on the hate list.<br />

even with crap desease dots, you crit 3 in a row, and you have aggro.<br />
<br />

<br />
what i find funny is ... wizards can crit nuke for 7k+ and not even get the mobs attention, BUT, when i dot for a little over 2k i go plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it looks to me like dot damage is equally proportionate to hate.<br />
<br />
I'd say ~0.87 hp from a dot = 1 point of hate<br />
<br />
That would answer why the turns happened around the just near the 175 hp mark (note the mobs first turn on the curse of the spirits pull)<br />
<br />
this is VERY evident when necros are stacking dots and mobs are summoning.  Unless you have a warrior with enrageing blow and anger3 on 2 weapons your screwed if you stack more than 3 dots unless you FD every other tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's very true.  In fact by simply loading up a couple of dots I couldn't bring mob back onto my SK by chain casting 510 hate spell as fast as it refreshed (6 sec refresh, 1.5 casting time).<br />
<br />
it would be interesting to load up some of the lower level SK hate spells and see how much hate it takes to get aggro initially from a shaman pulling with a DoT.<br />
<br />
I've been doing testing to try to nail down initial aggro, non-melee damage aggro, poison counter aggro, etc.  There are a few unknowns with aggro, and I just can't get numbers that are exact.  I've got some working numbers that I'm testing around and I'm trying to nail down atm through ceiling/floors.  The aggro of dot ticks and their increased damage from CA/BA really started taking over the bulk of my testing until I was sure.  I'll go back to trying to nail down other aggro numbers soon.<br />
<br />
If DoTs already do aggro per tick there is no need at all to have them also do initial aggro.<br />
<br />
The issue with that is it appears that if aggro is credited per tick then effects like CA/BA actually raise the aggro the spell is doing.  Where as if you remove all aggro from the ticks, then you just have the initial aggro like most spells.  Using 69/70 spells you are going to be generating an enraging blow procs worth of damage every tick, just from two spells and that's without BA/CA factored in.  It would make sense to have dots be very low initial aggro (like disease dots/curse of spirits) and then have their aggro go up as the spell does more damage.  However, the current ratio of damage to aggro is too high imo especially with the initial aggro you get off poison/curse spells.<br />
<br />
like i said twice befor, crit affliction is a death trap waiting to happen.<br />

<br />
Yes critical affliction actually appears to be doubling your aggro on that particular tick because it is doubling the damage of it.  This holds true not only for poison dots, but like you say even playing it &quot;safe&quot; with disease dots if you stack a few and get a couple crits you can still take aggro.  Thankfully disease dots have lower initial aggro so it's easier for a tank to keep up and stay ahead.  Also like I said from my testing that 7k+ nuke is being treated just like a ~3k nuke would be.  The crit part doesn't appear to add aggro, the focus part isn't adding aggro.  That's another issue.  Also I'm unsure atm that SCS actually helps the &quot;tick&quot; portion of dot aggro.  I haven't had a chance to test it, but I wouldn't be surprised if SCS just effected the initial cast of the spell.  That means that a couple back to back crit ticks of BoS/Bane/etc could generate more aggro than the 7k nuke easily.  I do think this needs to be addressed very soon though because with OoW out in a couple months now and the amount of base damage some of those dots have I just don't see some of them being functional.  It's already possible to keep aggro off some tanks just with bane.  With even higher base damage on dot ticks it will only get worse.<br />
<br />
it looks to me like dot damage is equally proportionate to hate.<br />
<br />
I'd say ~0.87 hp from a dot = 1 point of hate<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Yes, that number of ~0.87 is pretty close.  If you actually look over the plague/Venom tests you'll see that 4X55(59) turns the mob, but 3X seldom does.  I've been using that number to try and test various situations to see if I can disprove it or if keeps holding up.  I'm also trying to do more tests on nuke aggro to see if they use about the same number for aggro generation.  Also like I said above, especially with the next expansion DoTs you will have so much damage on a &quot;tick&quot; that even if you were FD and stand up to re-cast something a couple crits on a tick and you will get summoned.  There's just too much aggro coming from the amount of damage the tick does.  <br />
<br />
Looks like nukes get crits aggro free, get ID focus aggro free and are completely effected by SCS.  It actually appears that some dots in the next expansion will generate more aggro from the first tick than they did to be cast, and that's talking about some of the higher aggro spells in the first place.  I do hope this is looked into and retuned.  DoTs have simply fallen more and more behind nukes since original EQ and really need attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, point is, it appears that DoTs are at least close to a 1:1 ratio of damage to hate on a per tic basis--which explains why crits are such a death trap.<br />
<br />
Nukes are clearly tied to a specific amount of hate.  When they land, they're not 925+ hate.  Wizards don't have crits of 6000 hate (-50 hate concussion spells notwithstanding).  Heck, wizards don't have 3000 damage spells that do 3000 hate.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that SoE has a percentage of hate tied to each tic that's different per spell and/or spell line.  (ie, that percentage may be adjustable per spell).  So . . . results may vary somewhat.  However, I don't think any of us can deny that they have way way too much agro on the tics given that we're apparently expected to stack DoTs.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, SoE is screwing us still.  &quot;Here's your dps!  You just can't use it in groups!&quot;  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This also speaks indirectly to issues with Taunt.  It is my understanding that when a Taunt is successful, the Warrior / Ranger / SK moves to the top of the Aggro list.  Of course Taunt seems to work along the same coding lines as Feign Death (It always fails when you need it most).<br />
<br />
Certainly Shaman need either some &quot; lubbin &quot; from Sony that doesn't involve lead pipe cruelty, anal probing, or malignant indifference or a mechanism for aggro reduction other than Root.<br />
<br />
I would * gently * recommend that the Dev's look at DOT aggro, however if history is any example, a 10 page Shaman petition with reams of testing will be defeated by a simple &quot;no.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
/cry. :(   I just invested in Critical Affliction III.  I think I'm going to turn into a DD shaman. :( <br />
<br />
Sad part is, even with a Bracer of Exploration (Fury of E'ci 30% cold focus) and beginning a cast to time it (hopefully) landing just after the tank breaks mez, I still can only get ~3 casts off on a trash Sol Ro mob when on a mini's raid.  That's not slowing or malosing - just chain casting Velium Strike.  With 2 crits (FoMM3) I'm doing maybe 5k in damage, but the average is more like 3k in damage for ~800 mana (with MPIV).  The upside is I can chain cast this until the cows come home (or I run out of mana) and never draw aggro. :p <br />
<br />
With BAIV/AEIV &amp; Bane, I can do close to 3k in damage for less than half that amount of mana (~360), but if I crit a tick I can end up yanking aggro.  If I add a nuke on top of the single dot, I can end up yanking aggro.  Trying to juggle cast times and mob health so that I'm not casting on a corpse is very frustrating just to add a little damage.  Again, this is only when playing on raids as Shaman #4 where debuffing &amp; slows are already taken of.<br />
<br />
I'd use Spear of Torment except that I don't have a damage focii for it.  Sometimes I end up using it anyway just because VS takes forever to cast. :rolleyes: Tears of Saryn of course is better DPS but it is situational and I hate breaking mezzes.<br />
<br />
Excellent post by the way. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems like the simple solution would be to take the total unfocused damage of each dot and toss it into the dd hate equation, making a dot just like a dd of the same damage in terms of hate.<br />
<br />
One would have to ask why the extra work was done so they were figured differently to begin with.</div></div><hr />

And removing the initial aggro, which is the biggest problem.</div></div><hr />

It would have to reduce hate by a large margin, but it would give DoT stacking with SCS3 some usability. Something of note, I was testing a pallt in P1 time the other day and trying to gank agro and such. It took me pox, bane, blood, bane of nife, and chain nukes to get agro, but by that time the mob was below 20% and she got agro right back. Just don't ever stack DoTs with a warrior in the group ;p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And removing the initial aggro, which is the biggest problem.<br />
<br />
Actually with how dots are going higher damage on ticks the initial aggro is less and less of an issue.  Having BA4 and CA and catching a crit tick on bane is actually more aggro than landing bane.  Even poison dots that still have considerable aggro from poison counts are going to see more and more aggro coming from the actual &quot;tick&quot; portion than landing it.  The initial aggro is too high still though, but even stacking disease dots will pull aggro off some tanks with how things are going.<br />
<br />

<br />
I just don't like this idea.  I see a lot of people that want spells and AAs to fix certain things that are simply balance related.  This isn't a problem that takes another dot to fix or another AA &quot;dot casting sub&quot;, etc.  This is a game design issue that should be addressed in a normal patch in my opinion.  DoTs simply generate too much aggro for the damage they do and are generating aggro twice basically (when they land, and then each tick there after).  <br />
<br />
Like was mentioned I think when you land a dot it should do an amount of aggro roughly equal to if it were a nuke with the same base total damage.  Dropping Bane or BoS should be about as much aggro as a strike of solusek.  By having the aggro given on the initial landing of the spell you allow things like focus/AA/SCS to be factored in.  Even this situation isn't totally balanced because if the mob takes 400 damage from your dot and dies you still get the aggro of a 2k dot, but it's still a huge improvement and one I think most would be happy with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One additional factor seems to be something like, How long have you been the thing the mob hates most?<br />
<br />
Common situation, I slow a single mob and get aggro, then the tank quickly takes aggro, with no difficulty.<br />
<br />
Common situation, I AoE slow two mobs, the tank takes one, I offtank the other.  Thirty seconds later the tank turns from the first mob's dead corpse to take the second mob off of me.  In those 30 seconds I have done nothing (almost nothing, if I've Quiescenced myself) to further aggravate the mob:  just patiently letting it hit me instead of the cleric or the casters.  But now, instead of needing 3 or 4 seconds to take aggro, it takes the tank longer, 8 or 10 seconds:  extra time in melee, two casts of a hate spell, two procs, two stuns from a paladin.<br />
<br />
I theorize from this that there is some time factor built in:  the fact that the mob hated me the most for 30 seconds adds some further cumulative hate, so it takes the tank more effort to take aggro off of me.<br />
<br />
If this is correct, then as shaman we take aggro:<br />
<br />
(1) from the initial cast of a damaging spell, for the spell's damage (same as a wizard);<br />
<br />
(2) from every additional tick of damage, for the tick's damage;<br />
<br />
(3) from any amount of time that we were the most hated, for an unknown additional factor.<br />
<br />
A further test would be this two-part experiment.  <br />
<br />
A.  Shaman puts a low level disease dot on a mob that will take about 30 pct of a mob's hp, bringing mob to about ~70 pct health.  Shaman tanks the mob for the two minutes that the dot runs.  Tank then attacks the mob with full melee, no taunt or spells.  <br />
<br />
... A1. If aggro is figured on a per hp of damage basis, the tank would take aggro when he/she has done the same amount of damage as the dot:  mob will be at ~40 pct health.<br />
<br />
... A2. If dot aggro has also a per tick basis, then the tank will bring the mob to ~10 pct health prior to taking aggro.<br />
<br />
... A3. If there is also a time-most-hated factor, then the tank will bring the mob to ~0 pct health prior to taking aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
B.  Wizard nukes a mob for about 30 pct of the mob's hp, bringing the mob to ~70 pct health.  Tank then attacks as before, no taunts or spells, melee only.  <br />
<br />
... B1. If aggro is figured on a per hp of damage basis, the tank would take aggro when he/she has done the same amount of damage as the nuke:  mob will be at ~40 pct health.<br />
<br />
... B2. If there is also a time-most-hated factor, then the tank will bring the mob to ~30 pct health prior to taking aggro.<br />
<br />
I predict we would find case A3 and B2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MasklinnMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Necromancer here (Sissl, our Rep has linked this thread from here (http://necro.eqclasses.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1877&amp;start=30)<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say that Tastian's findings perfectly fit with what most necromancers thought:<br />
I myself didn't know that BA brought extra agro (as a necromancer i already get so much it's not really noticeable), but we thought that DoTs brought initial agro + per-tick agro as well as additional agro from crit ticks (even though the devs stated they can't reproduce that one...)<br />
<br />
It seems that the devs said they'd look into it if we could prove them that the DoTs did indeed bring extra agro on crit ticks. Tastian's post is nice, but maybe not enough in the CA department, and we are currently trying to find a test-bench to assess crit ticks agro.<br />
<br />
Please do check the thread i linked (http://necro.eqclasses.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1877&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0), the sooner we'll be able to prove w/o any possible counter-arguments that CA is broken the sooner we may get that fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, for initial agro:<br />
Poison counters (BoT/BoS) &gt; Curse counters (Horror/Bane) &gt; Disease counters &gt; no counters (shammies don't have any DoT of that kind)<br />
And poison counters have a very high edge over curse counters, which are quite close to disease ones agro wise<br />
<br />

EDIT: oh yeah, and DDs do indeed bring fixed per-spell agron independant of the damage the spell actually does (a DD can be fully or partially resisted, raw, focused or critted it'll bring the same agro)<br />
And it's believed in the necro community that SCS doesn't work at all on ticks agro, and it's unknown wether it works on dots initial agro or not</div></div><hr />

Buried somewhere here on the Crucible is a thread about how the first spell cast on a mob generates 'extra' hate.  <br />
<br />
My memory is a bit fuzzy but I think in your example (AoE slow on inc) it's more relevant than the time-most-hated factor.  The mob sticks on you longer than normal because you were the first person to cast on it.<br />
<br />
A counter test would be to have another player cast a low aggro spell on the mob (malo) and then you slow it, hopefully pulling it to you with 100% hps.  Then run your test.  If I'm wrong, the tank should have the same problems pulling off of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Why the FORK do we have to do all of their damn work?  We provide upgrade ideas for free.  We provide AA suggestions for free.  We provide all the proof in the world that stats don't matter for free.<br />
Now we're gonna prove to them how their own damn code works.  FU SOE code monkeys!<br />
<br />
How freakin easy would it be for a dev to run a char in 'god' mode on a dev/test server and have an 'immediate' window that tracks his variables (programmers know what I mean)?  Jesus they should be able to know EXACTLY how much aggro is getting generated - it's all in the code.<br />
<br />
Ok I feel better. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
you are well recieved, and yes, SCS does not reduce, impede or block Crit Tick aggro, Crit Ticks, and plain DoT Ticks all go under SCS's Radar.<br />
SCS only works for nukes and heals, and DD dots are the worst to use, they have monstrous aggro potential, BoN can beat out BoS if you crit once more than BoS in the length it takes to run them.<br />
<br />
i've been trying to get parses of DoT aggro, but cannot find mobs with high enough Hit points, i used Vadyn once, but i couldn't find him up again after that, so alas i am stuck searching for other mobs.</div></div><hr />

Please do check the thread i linked, the sooner we'll be able to prove w/o any possible counter-arguments that CA is broken the sooner we may get that fixed. <br />

<br />
Ronax -&gt; check the thread, our community rep told us he needed proof because the devs supposedly weren't able (don't say anything about that) to prove that crit dots added agro, this leaves an opening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tastian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This data, parses, logs and more test subjects have all been passed along.  I'm in the middle of doing more parses showing actual aggro breakdown by damage/aggro.  I feel that the ratio just isn't balanced atm and truely worry that with OoW spells it will only get worse.  I'll try to have more numbers by next weekend for everyone, but no guarantees yet.  This is something I am actively working on atm though, so I'll keep ya's updated as this is an issue I feel effects shaman, beastlords, necros, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You have successfully generated the dot agro factor with your testing and it looks to be just under 1:1<br />
ie almost 1 point of dot damage does 1 point of aggro.<br />
<br />
So what we need now is to find the nuke agro factor. <br />
ie how many times does the SK have to cast the hate generating spell to get agro back after a nuke of X damage.<br />
<br />
My guess is that the nuke agro factor will be somewhat less, and will almost certainly prove that the crit portion generates no extra agro. Great work!<br />
<br />
Anyone else get the feeling that the devs are about to get another barrage of &quot;love&quot; from necros and shammys soon?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The usual setup was me pulling a mob and then having the SK pull it off me with a 200 hate spell.  Then I'd do various things until the mob turned, then hit the mob with 200 hate, wait for turn, cast again, and just ping pong aggro back and forth like this keeping track of exaclty what it took to turn the mob each time.<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind when doing tests of this sort is that agro = hate + &quot;bonus hate&quot;, where &quot;bonus hate&quot; is things like sitting etc, and more importantly the position on the rampage list. For example, a successful taunt puts you at the top of the hate table +1. This doesnt necessarily get you agro though since if your position on the ramp list is low, others may still have more agro than you. While hate can be acurately metered, the bonus hate cannot, and as such will allways represent an unknown if you want to try to accurately fix numbers in parses like this. In your case you have pulled, so the agro number the SK generates from one cast of their 200 hate spell is somewhat less than 200.<br />
<br />
Btw, this is the reason why it is important to stay behind the MA on inc, and why the MA has a much easier time holding agro on mobs they have actually pulled or tagged off a puller. Assuming your MA is a warrior of course ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually with how dots are going higher damage on ticks the initial aggro is less and less of an issue.  Having BA4 and CA and catching a crit tick on bane is actually more aggro than landing bane.  Even poison dots that still have considerable aggro from poison counts are going to see more and more aggro coming from the actual &quot;tick&quot; portion than landing it.  The initial aggro is too high still though, but even stacking disease dots will pull aggro off some tanks with how things are going.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I just don't like this idea.  I see a lot of people that want spells and AAs to fix certain things that are simply balance related.  This isn't a problem that takes another dot to fix or another AA &quot;dot casting sub&quot;, etc.  This is a game design issue that should be addressed in a normal patch in my opinion.  DoTs simply generate too much aggro for the damage they do and are generating aggro twice basically (when they land, and then each tick there after).  <br />
<br />
Like was mentioned I think when you land a dot it should do an amount of aggro roughly equal to if it were a nuke with the same base total damage.  Dropping Bane or BoS should be about as much aggro as a strike of solusek.  By having the aggro given on the initial landing of the spell you allow things like focus/AA/SCS to be factored in.  Even this situation isn't totally balanced because if the mob takes 400 damage from your dot and dies you still get the aggro of a 2k dot, but it's still a huge improvement and one I think most would be happy with.<br />
<br />
One issue with this, it gives necros a huge advantage with FD.  They can load the mob up on dots, FD and by completely clear of any additional agro as the ticks from dots would not be generating any agro any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've already tested that and know it.  The actual damage done by a nuke is tied to the spell itself.  Whether the nuke is totally resisted, lands for 23 or crits for 1400 it still generates the same hate in every test I've run.  What I'm trying to do is find a relationship between max base damage of a nuke and its aggro.  That way I can compare the aggro of an X damage nuke againist the aggro of an X damage dot.  The actual aggro so far between X nuke damage and X dot damage is actually pretty close.  Things like poison counters, extra aggro from BA focus, but not from ID focus and extra aggro from crit ticks, but not from crit nukes seem to be what is really skewing the aggro on dots verse nukes.  Been really busy lately and trying to nail numbers down to a much smaller range currently.  Soon as I get some more time I'll throw up the other results I've gotten.</div></div><hr />

My friend who is here on training with me suggested you try the Wizards Graffe forum for information on DD agro.  They should have agro details for DDs you could then compare to your DOT findings.</div></div><hr />

That will probably be a deal breaker.  Any DoT class is going to be hamstrung by the necro's ability to FD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is from simple observation my friend. Not only that, there is a very long thread (20+ pages) somewhere on the TSW about this subject. Agro is NOT the same thing as the hate list. Your position on the rampage list (ie the order of agro) does affect agro when things are close.<br />
<br />
If you dont believe me, pull a mob with slow and have a warrior make a succesful taunt on it. Taunt sets your hate to the hate of the person at the top of the list + 1. The warrior will not get agro after that taunt until they have hit the mob. If you use a low agro attack, like kick, it might be necessary to hit the mob a few times. You can also see this effect at work on mezzed mobs where someone other than the warrior breaks mez after a successful taunt is made. If the chanter is higher on the rampage list for that particular mob than the warrior, it will go for the chanter even though it was successfully taunted (so if you see melee other than the warrior breaking mez, feel free to scream at them for screwing up).<br />
<br />
If you want to help your tank in getting fast agro, make sure you are behind them on inc. Taunting off you is that much harder if you dont.<br />

There *is* a small bonus for *first* to aggro, but that's it.  If you believe otherwise, show the parses.<br />

The rampage list will be constructed in order of agro irrespective of whether a mob ramps or not. True, they dont mention ramp in that thread, but all the tests were conducted using 2 toons and in that case there would only be 2 on the ramp list. There would be no way of tell the difference between the ramp list and &quot;first to agro&quot; bonus, if such I thing even exists. It's reasonable to assume that ramp list is used for that purpose though.<br />
<br />
It would be easy enough to prove or disprove one way or another though. Have one toon agro a mob, followed by a second one, taking care to manage the order of agro. Have the warrior move in and taunt. If the warrior gets agro off the second toon, then there is a single &quot;first to agro bonus&quot;. If the warrior does not get agro, then the &quot;agro bonus&quot; discussed in the thread is in fact the ramp list.</div></div><hr />
