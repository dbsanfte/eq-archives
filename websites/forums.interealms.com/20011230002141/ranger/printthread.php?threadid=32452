<p><b><img src="images/icons/Hmm_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> an Apology</b></p>

<p>My name is Backs Buwahaha, I am a level 54 rogue. As many of you know I have done the unthinkable I scammed rangers out of their epic. My actions have been atrotious and most displeasing and I have been all but kind and caring in these past weeks. I came here to apologize to Tortuga, Temeras, Culgar, Keldoreth, and Vytor. I used you guys, something I have never and will never do again. Im sorry, I say this from the heart some may say I do not have. I am not expecting anything from this except critism. I am sorry.<br />
<br />
                                                         Sincerely,<br />
                                                                    Backs Buwahaha</p>

<p>I certainly hope that this apology is going to be followed up with actions.  Cause if the people you scammed aren't reimbursed then this whole apology is complete BS.  Even then you've now become one of the least liked people on EQ in the face of Rangers.  I certainly hope that you don't like Ranger buffs cause you sure as hell aren't going to be getting them for awhile.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Figured it out Nenaman, your sig pic links to a screenshot on each readers machine.  It will be different for everyone and though it violates the size rules, it doesn't take much bandwidth because it isn't coming across the internet.<br />
<br />
Suggest you post the file you want as your signature somewhere on the net so you can link to it.  Unless you really like confusing us all.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>You know, when I first glanced at his sig pic, I thought I had seen it somewhere before.   The screenshot that I'm getting is the one I took when I dinged lvl 39 and could finally cast  SOW.<br />
<br />
BTW, let's not feed the troll. Instead, comment on what screenshot comes up for Nenaman's sig pic on your comp.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I admit it. When I first saw Nenaman's post on another thread I initially bought it hook, line, and sinker. /sigh .....anyways after a few minutes of the spooks I did a properties on the image, and it all became crystal clear. I still feel like a doofus. BTW "The Others" is a good movie, try and catch it.<br />
<br />
As for Mr. Bwahahaha or whatever his name is....an apology is a start but I think thats the tip of the iceberg considering what you have done to others. You know behind every character there is a real person. Think about it chief. Was it really worth it? For a damned game? Nah I think not.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Most probably because it's screenshot 000064 in the everquest directory. Until you take your 65th screenshot it will be listed as busted. Or you have your everquest files in another directory.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Let me just toss this out there Backs if you come back to read this.  A while ago I gave you the opportunity to end this.  Before you and I made the original agreement I gave you a Blood Point, as an act of good faith.  I have yet to see this weapon back.  I know some of my guildmates have also asked you for this, yet I still have not seen it.  I will admit I have made it one of my objectives, no, lets say life goals, to make sure everyone on the server knows about you and for this I have no regrets.  Today, I saw you in Velks at the zone, to make amends you could have returned the weapon right then and there, which would have made a differance in my mind.  Unfortunatly this didn't happen and I began to spam you like I will until the day you no longer show up on my /friends list.  Instead, you began to /ooc that I had scammed you on the Rogue epic, and everyone in the zone preceeded to laugh at you, and mock you for the obvious lie.  <br />
<br />
So if you truely are sorry like you say you are, seek me out and return the Blood Point.  As you know, I had to borrow this weapon to complete our deal.  This is a debt I still have not repayed.  Because I still retain this debt, our unfortunate dealings are still fresh within my mind.<br />

<p>I posted this on the wrong thread so I decided to copy it here.<br />
<br />
I make it a point to inform my groups that you are not welcome to join when I see in the zone. I also tell them why. There aren't that many places to hunt over 50. Everyone will know what you did before long. I just hope they take my advice and avoid you all together.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Backs there are some actions that are so reprehensible as to be unforgivable.  The fact that you scammed people is atrocious but the fact that you scammed people on something that requires as much work to do makes this totally and completely unforgivable.  Even though I was not taken by your despicable actions, some of my good friends were.  As a result I will forever hold you in contempt and I will be certain to pass the message of your disgusting behavior to anyone that will pause to listen.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Backs:<br />
<br />
These are a few of my thoughts:<br />
<br />
1.  What you did is unforgivable.  If you had scammed me, I would track you to every zone you were in and shout what you had done until VI pulled the plug.<br />
<br />
2.  You will never get beyond this.  You will always be known as "they guy that screwed rangers our of thier epics".  Always, forever, bottom line<br />
<br />
3.  This move has screwed you out of every decent guild on your server.  Period......though admittedly, I don't play on your server, but on Tribunal, I honestly can't think of anyone that would take you in.<br />
<br />
4.  Everyone will have thier eye on you forever regardless of what you do.  That means if you want to sell, buy, trade anything, people are going to be wary and probably less than affable.<br />
<br />
This is my idea for as appropriate a solution as possible.<br />
<br />
1.  You are a 54 rogue?  Give the scams you pulled and your levels, you probably aquired some nice cash and loot.  <br />
<br />
2.  Sell EVERYTHING you can, down to that split paw hide belt that has been in your bank for the last 30 years.  sell them at whatever prices you can get.<br />
<br />
3.  Split that cash equally among the people you screwed.<br />
<br />
4.  An alternative would be ot let the rangers pick through your gear, then sell.<br />
<br />
5.  Delete your character and start from scratch.  You might as well, you're screwed anyway.  If you have truely turned over a new leaf, take your medicine and start over......like those rangers now have to do on their epics.<br />
<br />
By the way, in my eyes you are lower than dirt.  It's people like you that can make this game a pain in the ass rather than a break from the stresses of RL.<br />
<br />
If you have any honor at all, consider the option i have just laid out before you.<br />
<br />
Disgusted,<br />
<br />
