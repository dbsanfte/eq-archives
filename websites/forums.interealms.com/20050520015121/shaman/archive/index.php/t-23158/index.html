<br />
Just got 24 and I know there is a way to &quot;dance&quot; yourself into more mana per tick using a hotkey setup.  As it is now I just stand cast canni (rinse and repeat).  What's the better way?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sit down and watch your mana bar.. when you see the mana tick up, quickly stand and cast canni, then sit back down again. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
This way you get the sitting mana regen + canni.<br />
This is commonly known as &quot;cannidancing.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can make yourself a hotkey<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast # (# being the spell slot you always have Canni memmed in)<br />
/pause 18 <br />
/sit on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just a fyi, you don't need the /sit off line, if you have the autostand on.  And /sit on could just be /sit.  Also play with the timing, depending on your lag you might need to adjust it up or down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The game registers your postion every six seconds and updates your hp/mana accordingly.<br />
<br />
What you want to achieve is to fool the server into thinking you are sitting constantly by timing your standing and casting between each tick.<br />
<br />
So if you wait for a tick, then stand, cast and sit rapidly, the server will believe you have not stood up and thus you get meditation plus cannibalize bonus to your mana.<br />
<br />
Should ofcouse have Regen up unless you have someone with more mana around to heal you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vivitron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you watch your hp instead of your mana you see 2 different movements, one with the mana and then another smaller one. Its the other smaller one that is the real tick for me, and so it is the one I need to be sitting for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can make yourself a hotkey<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast # (# being the spell slot you always have Canni memmed in)<br />
/pause 18 <br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
Just so you know you can also use this setting to get you an extra 2 lines.<br />
<br />
/pause 18, /cast #<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
You no longer need the /sit off or /stand because casting makes you stand up. You can combine /pause 18 and the cast in the same line. Your pause ammount goes first followed by a coma then a space. It will cast the spell then pause the secified ammount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh, forgot to add. If you are on a mount I use this.<br />
<br />
/cast #<br />
/cast #<br />
/cast #<br />
/cast #<br />
<br />
They all do the same thing, try to cast cann. It seems that sometimes cann fizzles a bit to much. I use my shammy as a buff bot at the moement so fizzles take to much of my time so i use this so it tries to cast it 4 times and if you cant cast it in 4 you need some practice ;)<br />
<br />
If it does go off on the first try the other three dont mess up anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rather than make a hotkey to spam canni while on a mount and take up a hotkey button, i'd recommending binding casting the canni spell gem to a key that's convient to use.  I use WASD to move, and i have Canni as spell gem 8, so i bound casting gem 8 to the B key, so i don't have to reach anywhere to actually cast the spell, it's worked rather well for me.</div></div><hr />

The first step is to make a macro for the canni-dance (shown by a few of your fellow shaman) Second is to time the  canibalization correctly. If you are &quot;sitting&quot;  when the tick occurs, EQ will assume that you have been sitting on your butt medding away...  If on the other hand you are standing when the tick occurs then you just wasted a tick.  How do you time it... ?<br />
   place your  cursor on an existing buff and you should see the number of seconds it still has... when the number changes (a tick) use your macro and canibalize and sit down before the next tick. I usually leave the mouse cursor and keep hitting the hotkey until I'm needed to do other things. Of course you should have regen and any regen hp item on to help you get a better mana regen rate.</div></div><hr />
