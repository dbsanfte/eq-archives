<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been looking at starting a new character on my 2nd account, and was wondering if anyone out there plays a Shaman / Necro combo with EQW, and if there are any details you can give me about the difficulty level of playing both in the 60+ level range?  Not really as much raid-wise as just normal fooling around with exp zones and loot / cash areas.  <br />
<br />
Looking forward to your responses, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I only EQW with my duel LCD configuration...can't stand not seeing them all at once unless I am just PLing one.<br />
I did some 2boxing with necro both 60, have necro snare fear and send pet, have shaman drop a couple DoTs, have necro lifetap over time to keep up litch...by the time fear wears off the mob is dead usually...toilers in ME were easy exp at lvl 60 and always dark blue, but not by much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bilei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I play a shammy(level 54) and a necro(level 60) on the same account..wait that's not what you were asking =) I only have one account so 2boxing is not an option for me. But, when playing my necro I very often duo with a shammy. Regen on a necro is like keiX2, if the shammy is running low on mana and can't canni, I can twitch as I usually have so much mana I'm looking for something to throw it at and being able to stack on the dots while fear kiting is really nice. If we have the room to fear kite, I am usually in shock over how fast we kill. If fear kiting isn't an option, the necro pet is a nice expendable tank. With the shammy slowing the mobs and the pets buffed up all nice and shiny, there isn't much need to heal. I usually do patch healing with the reverse tap line necros get if my pet needs healing and tap my health back as necessary. Splitting mobs is a breeze. FD, mini mez, root, harmshield, off tanking are all options. I prefer to duo with shammys over everything except a bard on my necro.<br />
In other words, it's a great duo =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman and Necro is a very viable duo, but playing two casters is a pain.  Most 2-box duos that include a shaman have the main character as a melee, and the shaman as a bot that just slows and heals.  I am, of course, a shaman main, but when I am playing my roommate's SK or any other melee, Jinheim is mainly played in the background.  I just click over to his window at the start of the fight to apply slow, then every now and then to heal.  Too much effort to do dots and nukes, etc...</div></div><hr />
