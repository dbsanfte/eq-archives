<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Reputation is given out by the other members of this board. Anyone can give you a positive or negative bump by clicking on the head next to the edit button.<br />
<br />
If the person giving reputation bumps does not have enough reputation of their own to do so you see the attempt as a grey button, but it has no impact on your reputation. If you see a red, or green bump against your reputation it means the person giving the bump had enough swing to cause a reputation change to you.<br />
<br />
You can view all bumps by clicking on the user cp button at the top of the screen.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Hey Mangler, here are some threads that discusses reputation. <br />

<br />
Basically, someone with influencing rep chooses to click the little &quot;talking head&quot; icon at the bottom of your post and choose to agree or disagree with you. Agreeing with you, raises your reputation, disagreeing with you lowers your reputation. As you gain reputation points, you gain small green boxes under your name.<br />
<br />
You can see if you have received any repuation by clicking the &quot;user cp&quot; button at the top right hand corner of the screen. If you receive a Green bump, you received positive reputation. If you receive a Red bump, you received negative reputation. If you received a Grey bump, you received a bump from someone without the ability to influence reputation. <br />
<br />
All reputation bumps are anonymous, some people choose to sign the comment. If you receive Grey bumps, sometimes it's really hard to know if the bump was supposed to be positive or negative if it isn't accompanied with a comment.<br />
