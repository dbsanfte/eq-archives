<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry long post...<br />
I came back to EQ and shamanism with hopes that the game had become more of an interesting exploration and adventure game than when i left (early PoP). Unfortunately it seems the game is actually worse. Here's a few gripes...<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
Dungeons used to have the potential to be a thrilling tour of the unknown, or unpredictable, with the promise of great rewards. The zones reeked of stories and character. Everybody knew the camps and the names of the mobs. Some of them were classic game experiences... most Kunark, a lot of Velious, and even parts of Luclin. <br />
<br />
Now, once you have done just one LDoN you've pretty much seen it all. Why do they call these things adventures? They should be called races. The focus is on beating the clock, not adventure. Does anyone actually remember the names of mobs in these zones? LDoN dungeons have as much character as an instanced cup of coffeee. You don't EXPLORE LDoN, you ENDURE it.<br />
<br />
GoD has been debated to death, but suffice to say, people still are unwilling to go there, unless they have a perfect, well geared, group containing an ideal mix of chars, and have 4 hours ++ to spend. The risk of many hours wasted time is so great because of the punitive cost of dying. Not because of exp lost, but because of wasted time. <br />
<br />
Also, after having been fed the PoK insta-port and PoT insta-zone, SoE turns on their head and makes you run through multiple dangerous zones in GoD just to get to the place you want to fight. Didn't SoE introduce the PoP conveniences because everyone was sick of 30 min multiple zone runs and 2 hour naked crs?<br />
<br />
Gear<br />
EQ has become so equipment focused, people now pretty much MUST guild and do raid encounters to get reasonable upgrades in a decent space of time. This has lead to a massive schism between the haves and the have nots.<br />
<br />
For players that can't or don't want to join big guilds, the alternative is endless hours of LDoN farming. No adventure, no exploration, just grind points.<br />
<br />
Whereas the bazaar used to be a source of upgrades for players, pretty much any piece of &quot;good&quot; gear is now no drop. As a 65, once you get a few pieces of ornate, there is nothing to aspire to buy. On top of that, the economy is incredibly broken, with vast sums being asked for equipment that in many cases is just not worth buying. East Commonlands and later the bazaar were always interesting to hang out in just to watch what was for sale.<br />
<br />
SoE has focused so much on making EQ a gear driven game, effects you would expect to see as spells or combat abilities, or even dream of having as spells or combat abilities, are put on items. Case in point: shamans have been pleading for new buffs that actually have an impact. What do we get? More stat buffs and the promise finally of a few lowly effects that top end items already have, such as strike through, damage mods, mitigation, avoidance, and which are better.<br />
<br />
Class balance<br />
Clerics are so far ahead of the other priests in healing, you need a ratio of 3 clerics to every other priest to raid. You can get by with less, but why would you? Groups for hard content do not get started without a cleric. Again, you can do harder content without a cleric, but why would you?<br />
<br />
And for hard content, you still need cleric, enchanter, and warrior. As someone said, the trinity can do content at level 65 that the other classes need to be 70 to do. Other classes just can't tank, heal, and deal as much damage as these 3. Even after 5+ years...<br />
<br />
Overall, if you look at the core skills of the 16 classes, possibly half the classes in EQ are essentially downgrades of better templates. If they removed shamans, mages, sks, monks, druids, necros, berserkers from the game, what would you really lose? FD, malos, and twitch? Why not just give these skills to beastlords, enchanters, and clerics, respectively, and make everyone switch over?<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
Even if you spend hours and hours tradeskilling, have skills at GM level, there is almost nothing worthwhile to make unless you want to do long, boring, nonesensical quests that require multiple skills at GM level, and in many cases, drops that you can't get unless you are in the high-end content anyway. I'm a GM alchemist, and have multiple skills at ~200. I get asked to make gate potions, which are useful, but about to be made obsolete in Oow, and occasionally shrink. Why bother? <br />
<br />
Not a Game, it's a Grind<br />
Very few people play EQ from 1-64. They grind these levels so that they can start having fun at 65. I've played 2 classes to 60+, 4 to 50+ and many through the 30s. Frankly, it's a chore. There is very little point to having most of the content in Antonica, Kunark, and Velious. Nobody bothers to go there except for the odd weird expedition for spells or gems or something. Most people level in about 4 or 5 zones.<br />
<br />
Then once you get to 65 you have the joy of grinding AA. And then if you want to raid, you have to grind flags, which is another major timesink. And all the while, there's the carrot of better better gear, zones where loot drops like candy, just ahead. One more flag, one more raid, then we'll be there. <br />
<br />
Anyone who remembers an old bitter poster Eduin, probably remembers him for his vitriol. I remember him for a one of his more impassioned posts where he explained why he played EQ. He wrote he played EQ to do fantastical things in a fantastic environment. Too bad nobody at SoE seems able to understand this or to see beyond the bottom line to the dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice thread I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The failure of LDoN is not the zones it in the TYPE of adventures people take.  How many Assasinate or Rescuehave you done as opposed to slaughter or collects?<br />
<br />
Sure they are easy, mind numbingly easy and thats why people do them over and over and over again.  Try a different type.<br />
<br />
As far as EQ being a time sink...well duh :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Also, after having been fed the PoK insta-port and PoT insta-zone, SoE turns on their head and makes you run through multiple dangerous zones in GoD just to get to the place you want to fight.

<br />
Whats the middle ground between these two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to disagree with your &quot;trinity&quot; comment for hard LDONs...I know a ranger /wave Okxye that tanks a hard LDON much better than most warriors...of course he is seriously geared and AAd....also any good 7k-7k5 buffed tank can do it nicely assuming he has the defensive AAs (LR5 especially). One of my favorite Hard LDONs of all time was 2 wizards, paladin, cleric, ranger, me...the wizards kited adds while the rest of us focused on one....we all died 1-2 times each but it was a blast :D<br />
People that know their classes and know their roles in the games can get together and do a hard LDON and pull it off..you can take the Trinity and still **** up. LDON is a grind that requires commitment for results, yes it does feel like a job sometimes, especially when you reach the 300+ mark it gets especially harsh. But when you look at either going Bazaar gear/ornate or going LDON gear/ornate/LDON hard drops there really is a world of difference.<br />
As far as class balance issues that you listed, there is a certain amount of truth. &quot;Younger&quot; players (Luclin + era) prefer a beastlord for the group slower. They simply grew up in the game with a beastie along for the ride vs a shaman. &quot;Older&quot; players prefer a shaman, even on semi trivial content, they are used to the skills that a good shaman has.<br />
And yeah Flags, LDON points, Evercamps....they are all time sinks, but thats the nature of the beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN dungeons, i agree with you on. they really are more of a race than anything. if you're doing a normal adventure at level 65, there's no drama whatsoever. basically, you go in and grind them out, and most of the fun you have is social. great time to joke around with folks and get to know them. high risk ldons are considerably more fun, imo, because they involve actually playing your character correctly, and just enough of a chance of death that you have to be aware of what's going on at all times. as complaints go, though...well...LDoN was basically a response to the player community. people were saying that as casual players they wanted opportunities to gear up competitively without having to join a big raid guild or do a lot of raiding. soo...viola, there it is. the first part of the solution for casual players. fantastic place to get aa xp, meet and socialize with people, and either gear up or supplement your other gear. i personally am friends with a 9600 hp, 1700 ac Shadowknight who is geared entirely from doing hard ldons and wearing a few tier 1 and 2 PoP raid drops. <br />
<br />
GoD...have to join a raid guild? pfft. i'm in a guild that's working right now on tier 3 raids in PoP--not yet SRT flagged as a guild--and i'm doing work here on my own. organizing groups for trials, xp groups, etc. i'm not uber...i also am geared from tier 1 and 2 raids and ldons for the most part. BUT...there's some nice twists to GoD. first and foremost...in every zone there are random chances for some sweet drops off trash mobs. you go there and xp, and WHAM....jackpot. additionally, i am *glad* they haven't yet put up a book to port accross these zones. they retain as much or more character than the old world zones. awesome story lines, bad @$$ named, whether minis or raid encounters, and talk about exciting! high octane, heavy offense fights! the mobs don't have huge hp pools, but it makes every fight feel like an explosion. either that mob is going down fast, or you are. woooot! additionally, there are some very cool quests attached to the expansion, and the trials and aa themselves are easily worth the cost of it. BUT...IMO, one of the most FUN things about EQ is the chance to form up with a bunch of other people and work as a team to coordinate an effort and take down some Big Nasty Raid Encounter. and this zone DEFINITELY has that to offer. great new styles of raids, awesome events, etc.<br />
<br />
gear as a focus? absolutely. i have no problems whatsoever with EQ being gear oriented as a very large part of the progression. for one thing, making many items no drop means you are having to work for most of them. sure, people can point out examples of doing jack and getting them, but if you're in Time, deep into GoD, etc, you have earned your gear at that point. one way or another, you're spending time and energy aquiring them, and there SHOULD be a big pay off. ldon gear, same thing. whether you're grinding out normals with drop in groups, or hammering out high risk ldons for faster returns, you're earning your gear. additionally, it's awesome to me seeing that i can be standing next to 20 other shams and none of us are geared identically from head to toe. in fact...in most cases there may be 3-4 common pieces, but we will be equipped differently from each other on most slots. i LIKE that. focus effects, for casters, are icing on the cake. lots of fun customizing with them. offensive sham? critical affliction 3 aa, burning affliction 4, extended affliction 4, improved dmg 4, nuke aa's. woot. not the most effective way to utilize a shammy in some cases, but that sure is fun. additionally, i LIKE that at this stage of my character development, i really can't go to the bazaar and upgrade any of my gear. i would MUCH rather go raid for gear than farm pp, and i like the idea that in order to have better gear than me, someone has to have worked at aquiring it. nothing would annoy me more than having some level 55 shammy with a lot of real dollars to spend go buy plat, deck his toon out in better gear than mine, and throw it in my face that he had more hp and ac than me, with more focus effects. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as for having to join a big raid guild, nah. on my server, i'm one of the leaders of a group called AOR (ayonae ro server...ayonae's open raiders), which is a group that helps people by running open raids on PoP flag mobs so that we can backflag folks, get people a kick start on their flagging, etc--and in the process, give repeat raiders chances to win some nice drops. i just became one of the leaders about 3 weeks ago, and in that time have helped people get over 1000 flags and at least 80 items without the help of a raid guild. we have a channel people join, and they go do whatever they want...they keep an eye on the channel, and when a raid is forming for something they want or need, they drop in and get flag or loot. additionally, a lot of them get to meet people who ARE guilded who are backflagging or just going to help, and are often able to find guilds with schedules that work with their own. in some cases, though, we have gotten people SRT flagged without a single flag from their guild...all open raids. not common, mind you--MM, KoS/Saryrn, and Bert are rare runs, but they happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as for the grind...well...no pain, no gain. i, for one, LIKE the grind. i LIKE knowing that i have to work to get where i want to be. all the time i spend doing something that's NOT a major event makes me appreciate the big events that much more. i like going out, hammering out some AA or ldon, doing GoD trials, hanging out whacking minis in BoT, etc. all of those are aspects of the game, but in my honest opinion, they are smaller facets that help you prepare for the bigger deals...the most fun part of EverQuest, by far--raids, and killing named mobs. whether big raid mobs or minis with lots of juice or notoriety (ie...Frenzied Noc Corpsethrasher in Barindu...have heard a few people swearing about him and his crackheadesque rampages), there's very little more satisfying in game than smashing one of these things. that is why i play EQ. you mention doing fantastical things? doesn't get much more fantastic than the idea of fighting Quarm in the Plane of Time, does it? or working your way through the awesome Breakdown in Communications quest (GoD) which takes you through everything from full on raids to mini trials and even busy work, all while following an awesome story line. even the standard Plane of Nightmare Terris Thule raid is a hoot, and the story line for the Saryrn raid string is cool. there are LOTS of fantastical things to do. there are so many story lines and so much detailed and themed content that it almost makes me dizzy. i LOVE this game, and the more i play and discover, the more i love it.<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm a bartender on Pacific Standard Time. i also have a wife and daughter that i spend a lot of time with...if someone with my schedule is able to explore this much and get this much done, there's no reason anyone else can't. it basically comes down to whether you're aggressive and dynamic, or the type of person who sits in a zone with his &quot;LFG&quot; up and waits for people to send him tells, all the while complaining that he can't get groups. make it happen. if you want to do something, get yourself there. i realized a month and a half ago that i had zero flags. none. not even PoJ trials. soo...now i'm almost SRT flagged. because i started doing drop in raids, met some folks, found a guild that had a schedule i could work with, and even took over leading the open raids so i could continue moving things along. GoD trials? i have put together every group i've been with out there myself. sitting and waiting doesn't get you anywhere but frustrated.<br />
<br />
<br />
pick something to do, and do it. it's there waiting to be done, and YES...it really is fantastic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know what you're saying, and it makes sense... but... most people, myself included, don't do LDoN for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
I do LDoNs because I want the points.  If I wanted exp or loot, I wouldn't go near an LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
And because of the poor exp, poor loot (this includes coin drops, which seems to be nonexistent in LDoN anymore), I want to get my LDoN adventure done ASAP.<br />
<br />
Awhile back, when I first started in LDoN, I did a lot of rescue and assassinate missions.  Then, when it got tedious and I found that collect/slaughter was the fastest way to go, I never looked back.<br />
<br />
I want to get in and get out with my 51 adventure points as soon as possible, and collect is usually the solution for me.<br />
<br />
The only way that LDoN is fun for me anymore is to experiment with my group, such as a bard, warrior, 3 rogues, and me, or some kind of group that will try to challenge my best finish times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">... and if they made LDoN exp and monetary loot a bit better, you'd have people more willing to spend more time in them than just &quot;wham, bam, thanks for the points, see ya!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At least the wacky point scale wouldn't feel anywhere near as severe, as the other rewards would make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GoD has been debated to death, but suffice to say, people still are unwilling to go there, unless they have a perfect, well geared, group containing an ideal mix of chars, and have 4 hours ++ to spend.

<br />
I'll be the first to admit this is one reason I don't do much god content. Getting there is a pita, not having an fairly easy way to do CR's is the most annoying thing it the world. I did the 3+ hour cr's back in the old day and I hated it. I don't like wasting hours my time because of an unlucky string of hits or some other misc bad thing happens. I like to be able to get to the zone I want to get to within a few minutes and not have to worry about half the group dying to invis dropping. Getting there and doing CR's are not what I want to be challenging, they just become agravating. <br />
<br />
This isn't coming from someone that wants the fighting to be easy though. I do ldon hards with my paladin friend and monk brother tanking and neither have even 7k hp yet. It is challenging and fun and at the same time I know that I don't have to waste hours if something bad does happen. <br />
<br />
CR's and travel should not take more time then the actual adventuring does.</div></div><hr />

As a class that can lev/sow/invis, KT CRs are not that hard for us. Don't let that keep you from KT, it's a great zone - great exp, great chances for loot.<br />
<br />
Getting to KT takes me about 5 minutes. Quick Spiritstone to Everfrost, run to camp, boom Nedaria, boom Natimbi, lev, sow, invis, 2 minutes to KT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, getting to places usually isn't an issue, its nice to have a good selection of travel spells. Travel is mostly a matter of convienence. The corpse runs are generally the biggest problem though. If we do something like ferubi we'll probably have to stick fairly close to ZI just so we can do a CR. No rogue/necro/sk in the family so anything that requires sos drag or summons on a wipe are pretty much out of the question. <br />
<br />
Also its a matter of access. I've been flagged for EP's since march, never once exp'd there. Not because I don't want to, but because my family isn't flagged. If we can't handle it with our pally friend tanking we don't do it, because we're not telling him he can't group with us so that we can get a warrior. I got the smith rondo flag over the weekend, but my likely hood of finishing the KT flag anytime soon aren't all that great and even if I did wouldn't be able to go becuase I'd be the only one flagged. Until we can beat the trials with a pally (which probably will never happen with the bosses dps) we'll still be exp'n in open zones.</div></div><hr />

Sounds pretty much like what they're doing in EQ2. I don't know that I care for the idea. My class doesn't have to be the absolute best at something. It just has to keep my interest and be functional.<br />
<br />
Not a Game, it's a Grind<br />
Very few people play EQ from 1-64. They grind these levels so that they can start having fun at 65.<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious of course, what's the difference, really? A bigger mob at the end, a bigger production with more people and a bigger payoff is all. It's the same process, only earlier in the game there are many more options for grouping and soloing as well. Really, I think many more people actually &quot;play&quot; it the whole way through than you think. ;)<br />
<br />
I've played 2 classes to 60+, 4 to 50+ and many through the 30s. Frankly, it's a chore. There is very little point to having most of the content in Antonica, Kunark, and Velious. Nobody bothers to go there except for the odd weird expedition for spells or gems or something. Most people level in about 4 or 5 zones.<br />
Well, it's a chore for you beause you obviously play for the end-game content. That's cool. That's what you enjoy the most. Personally, I like it all (I assume I'll like the high end - haven't seen it yet). There are worthy encounters every step of the way if you look for them. I agree that there is a dearth of people in much of the old world content, though. It drives me nuts trying to get a group together to venture out to Split Paw or the like.<br />
<br />
Then once you get to 65 you have the joy of grinding AA. And then if you want to raid, you have to grind flags, which is another major timesink. And all the while, there's the carrot of better better gear, zones where loot drops like candy, just ahead. One more flag, one more raid, then we'll be there. <br />

He wrote he played EQ to do fantastical things in a fantastic environment. Too bad nobody at SoE seems able to understand this or to see beyond the bottom line to the dream.<br />
Some good points, if a bit on the pessimistic side. I honestly believe the fun is still there to be had if you look for it. I even find myself sometimes falling into the popular rut of hitting certain zones like everyone else. Heck, with the zem of PC, it's hard not to. Outside of that though, there's a whole world out there.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping for some better adventuring in your near future. :)</div></div><hr />

GoD...have to join a raid guild? pfft. i'm in a guild that's working right now on tier 3 raids in PoP--not yet SRT flagged as a guild--and i'm doing work here on my own.<br />
<br />
So you are disputing his point about having to be in a raid guild by pointing out that you are in a ... raid guild.  Brilliant.<br />
<br />
one of the most FUN things about EQ is the chance to form up with a bunch of other people and work as a team to coordinate an effort and take down some Big Nasty Raid Encounter.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I too enjoy spending hours of mind-numbing boredom waiting for seventy people to arrive, hitting the MGB button (or manually group buffing if, like me,  you don't have MGB),  then acting like a robot as a small group of people order the rest of the seventy around like some kind of army regiment, then dying, rezzing, rebuffing, repeating, and finally battling with ten of those seventy over who gets uber_loot_04.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, no I don't.<br />
<br />
Not everyone enjoys Everquest for raiding.  Some of us enjoy it for questing and grouping.  I can &quot;form up with a bunch (five) of other people and work as a team to coordinate an effort and take down&quot; interesting and dynamic stuff like named mobs in dungeon.  This used to be what EQ was about.  Heck, before Kunark there were only two raid encounters: Vox and Naggy.  All the rest of the high-end game was camping in LGuk for your FBSS or in SolB for your GEB.  I never had the joy of those camps, but I did spend many hapy hours fighting in 4d/crypt in Sebillis trying to get a JBB.  And my favorite EQ memories come from doing the non-raid parts of my epic or the shawl quest, or just from daring one group excursions in to dangerous zones such as *gasp* The Hole or The Deep.<br />
<br />
Raiding is one part of everquest, which lots of people enjoy; more power to 'em.  But it really pisses me off when raiders act like the world revolves around them, and consider non-raiders to just be lazy or unmotivated.  Just because you don't enjoy massive 70 person encounters doesn't mean you don't deserve challenging, interesting, and rewarding content.  LDoN was a step in the right direction, but its flaws have already been pointed out: it's repetative and even if you do hard LDoNs it requires a huge amount of time to complete a set of armor which is well below that which a raid guild can acquire in one fifth of the time.  Mindlessly following orders along with seventy people in no way makes you a better player than someone who coordinates with only five players (or even one who solos), but one look at the loot tables shows that SOE certainly doesn't agree.<br />
<br />
Uberguilds are about 5% of the server (SOE even stated the new epics will be available only to that percentage).  Non-uber raiders make up a much greater portion, but I doubt they even make up half the population (depending on one's definition of &quot;raider&quot;).  Yet the vast majority of SOE's content is developed for raiders in general and uber-raiders in particular.  By this I don't just mean zones with raid encounters, but also zones (such as many in GoD from what I hear) which only characters who raid the planes can be well equiped enough to handle, and zones such as PoTactics or the Elementals, which have lots of solo and one-group content, but are the private playground of raiders.  OoW claims to only have on locked zone, like Velious.  But unless the majority of the content is targeted towards non-raiders the way Velious (and basically Kunark too if you don't count the HS and Seb keys) was, I'm going to be dissapointed.  I'm not saying there shouldn't be raid  content (Kunrark and Velious both had plenty), but just that raid content should not make up 75% of the expansion the way it does in PoP.<br />
<br />
SOE can make interesting content that is not just mindless grinding, but also isn't raid content.  LDoN proved this.  But they seem to think LDoN was the final solution to group content, when it really should have just been the start.  Hopefully SOE will realize this for OoW or the next expansion.  Or if not, hopefully Blizzard will learn from SOE's mistakes.<br />

<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight:<br />
<br />
1) An Epic I have to guild to obtain (soloed 25-50% of Faern's and 90% of Mystyqe's)<br />
<br />
and not just ANY guild but one that is capable of apparently end-game encounters,<br />
<br />
2) Spells which in all liklihood I'll never see (which would make two expansions in a row)<br />
<br />
3) My OLD Focus effects no longer work as well the instant I hit 66, <br />
<br />
and that's 66 WITHOUT new spells....<br />
<br />
Tell me again why I should buy this expansion other than the &quot;eye-candy&quot; ? <br />
<br />
(And if &quot;eye-candy&quot; = Laglin or Gates - no thanks)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i pointed out that i was in a raiding guild not to dispute a fact, but to point out that it's possible as a casual player to find one that works for you IF that's what you want to do. <br />
<br />
but my raiding guild is now working on mobs i have already beaten with open raids. they aren't blazing a trail for me, they are following where i've already been. that's now how i'm getting ahead, they are just doing things i enjoy doing. my point is that there are lots of ways to accomplish what it is you want to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
soooo...i enjoy raiding, you apparently don't. no problem, i can respect that. if that's not your thing, ok.<br />
<br />
want to do dungeon style events with a chance for a nice drop? GoD trials are just that. now...you can point out that they are costly in terms of time, etc...but didn't those same dungeon crawls in the old content also take lots of time? would you RATHER have the trials not be instanced, and instead of being able to work your way through them with just you and your single group, have to ward off other groups, or wait 18 hours in a camp for a chance at a drop you're after?<br />
<br />
some people are going to complain no matter what. others are going to take something that they are presented with and look for the good things in it. that's my approach to EQ. i love this game because i find things i enjoy, and i go do them. consequently, i am extremely happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
i managed to get Fri-sunday off this week, which was a nice break..friday morning, get up, grab GoD trial group, do one for the flag. do 3 farming runs out there afterwards, get 3 drops for people in the group, including an Earring of the Moon Dancer off a trash mob in a trial for myself. nifty. very good day. go do a hard EF ldon. 105 points, good times bs'ing with friends, Boots of an Aged Mystic. yay, it's been a good day. log off, grab some food, hang out with RL friends and watch Kill Bill vol. 2.<br />
<br />
saturday...trial 2 for the win, another farming run. log to go play pool and hang out with friends.<br />
<br />
sunday...Keeper of Sorrows open raid. WOOOOAAA that's a long one. good times, though. log after, go shoot pool with buddy.<br />
<br />
<br />
good weekend, had a damn good time.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you can't find something you enjoy, you either need a perspective shift or a different game.</div></div><hr />

i believe the focus degradation only apply to spell levels, not the level you are when you cast them.. IE at lvl 70 casting ferine will use your full focuses, but casting a lvl 67 spell will use X% of your current focuses<br />
<br />
so basically.. if youre never going to see OoW spells, then you have nothing to bitch about ;o</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i regret buying ldon. have done 2 adventures in a year, or wheneverit came out, and just cant be arsed to go back; too busy lvling and doin pop stuff to bother.<br />
<br />
thanks to this forum, and the health sceptics here, i decided to NOT buy g.o.d.  and have been much relieved  thati made that decision.<br />
<br />
I am considering buying oow, but wil wait til its been out a month before making the final decision.<br />
<br />
btw is oow set for an oct release or late??</div></div><hr />

That simply isn't true, and you're only looking at the next expansion and not the bigger picture. Try seeing past level 70, for instance, or through the next 3 &quot;planned&quot; expansions.<br />
<br />
Focus effects should be :<br />
<br />
Level I 1-20  20 levels of utility base; easiest levels<br />
Level II 1-44 24 more levels of utility; midlevels<br />
Level III 1-65 21 more levels of utility; lots of rare and no drop foci<br />
Level IV 1-80 15 more levels of utility; almost all no drop, just enough to keep casual players in Foci<br />
<br />
I don't know which is worse: &quot;unbeatable mobs&quot; with &quot;adequate&quot; gear, or unreachable mobs with obsolete gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're in their own little world now.&quot;<br />
