<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I left about 3 months ago due to frustration with SOE's failure to maintain a role for shaman. I have trolled the boards about once per month since to see the status of the game. <br />
<br />
I see some improvements, but it seems that shaman are 16th class citizens in OOW, especially without having at least Nihil from GOD. It also seems that Nihil has not been very attainable for 65/100 shaman with pre-elemental gear--especially since fewer are going to GoD.<br />
<br />
Would my (pretty well played but very modestly equipped) shaman have significant demand now for decent groups seeking experience and equipment?<br />
<br />
Would my shaman be able to do much to add to raiding?<br />
<br />
It seems the answers to these questions for many modestly equipped shaman are still no, and SOE does not want those of us who have left to return.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
(By the way, I played a modest amount of time, and had a great guild. People who had experience with playing with me often sent tells, but werent always available during the time frame I could devote.) <br />
<br />
The most annoying thing of all is SONY's cowardice in communication. Because some troll might say &quot;I don't like that,&quot; they now refuse to communicate to their shaman player base at all. Pathetic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's what you need to know specifically about your question:<br />
<br />
1.  You can dot without wasting mana in OOW<br />
2.  Spells are pretty easy to get<br />
3.  Loot drops are plentiful<br />
4.  Graphics are neat.<br />
5.  Sony is still the same old sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Class is fine and the cry babies seem to be moving away from the boards and or game. <br />
<br />
They dumbed down alot of the GoD content to make it easier. Attunable stuff and customizeable augs make getting focus abilities dependant only on pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think OoW is the best expansion for a while. I'm not sure how it is for the uberguilds and power gamers, but for the casual shaman its very good. Stuff is tough, but not impossible. Casual players can get their spells for level 66, 67, 68 with a competent single group. There are some nice gear drops - kinda comparable with VT that can be done with a smallish force. Some stuff can be soloed, but not all. The new epic quests are great, as are the new epics. <br />
<br />
Having said that, almost every single mob mitigates slow to some extent, and lots of mobs mitigate quite a lot. So, basically, shaman have not been given a huge power boost, if fact, shaman have not changed much woth OoW at all. So if your reason for leaving was specifically the nerfage of the shaman class, then nothing much has changed. If you left becase of general disillusionment with EQ, then the new expansion might be worth a look</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OoW is to casual 60+'s what LoY was to the 40's 50's crowd at the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My concern is not with nerfage per se.<br />
<br />
Instead my primary concern is the lack of an important group role for shaman--are we desired for groups, or are we a tack on when the holy trinity cannot get three dps classes in Omens of War.  <br />
<br />
I actually got quite a few groups. The good players I grouped with were giving me mostly a mercy group. A decent tank, burst healing, enchanter buffs, and dps were what these groups used to plow through content--I could help a little but made little difference. The best groups told me not to waste mana on slows. (Malos, Slow, Qs, Bane, Companion with weapons, casting all the time and cannibalizing as much as possible, I love to mix it up shoulder to shoulder with the main tank.) The mediocre players--I was saving their bacon every other fight. So certainly, I had a lot to contribute to gimp groups.<br />
<br />
I do know that our spell set allows us to cope with a lot of different situations, and shaman can bring quite a bit to the table with any group if things get out of control. I like the character and refuse to roll another for that reason. That is why SONY no longer receives my cash each month.<br />
<br />
In fact, the mitigated slow has been found to be a bit of a waste compared to good burst healing efficiency or good burst dps in fights lasting less than about 10 ticks. (Show me a stats thread if I am wrong in this--this is my recollection from recent threads).<br />
<br />
I just don't want to be a charity case, waiting too long to get groups unless there are folks on with whom I have often grouped. <br />
<br />
I am glad to hear that spell and equipment drops are currently acceptable in OoW. If shaman were generally as helpful to groups as either other priests OR as dps classes, I would return. Seems to me Shaman are still a poor stepchild charity case in the burst heal AND burst dps arenas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From grouping in Wall of Slaughter for two hours with a normal lvl 65-66 group I made 10kpp from selling a Swirling Silk Bracer that was gravy loot (allowed me to buy Quie), Got a new head item called Wallwalker's Helm or something like that, and I got a minor rune and a normal rune plus some nice exp....thats a pretty nice expansion IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oow is a decent expansion, but eq is stil mindless hack and slash; there is a minimal plot line going on in oow, but really the game is run by folk who dont have a proper grip on the concept of rpg. Suppose they think that the market is broadest in the &quot;dumbed down rpg &quot; area as opposed to int and meaningful rpg; admitedly the latter woould be a totally diferent game to even original eq.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
probly better to conc on RL  if u have one. )<br />
<br />
soe make sauron look like the toof fairy !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman is a powerful class, nothing wrong, if you cannot see that, than no, no reason to return.<br />
<br />
Mill the absent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A Millman sighting out of the grey? &lt;blinks&gt;<br />
Sounds like shaman do ok, in oow. I don't have any intentions to come back as of yet unless they make it easier to play for pretty short periods of time solo, I don't see that happen(not disgruntled about it), besides RL stuff is better........... as someone said before... full rendered graphics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chanters and Bards are in an uproar over OoW, while Shaman are having a hay day.  What's not to like?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">imo the role of the shaman has increased with Oow.<br />
<br />
we are more effective and efficient healers. we can be primary healers in groups.<br />
<br />
we can rez people. it's a 0% rez that can be used again 10 minutes after each use. those recieving this rez can then get an experience rez.<br />
<br />
we have a self-only invis that lasts for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
we have an AA ability similar to a druid's SotW that can be MGBed.<br />
<br />
the epic 1.5, which isn't terribly difficult to get, has a clicky group HoT.<br />
<br />
we have buffs that actually make a difference. melee dmg avoidance buff, skill dmg modifier buff and a group form of FA that includes a skill dmg modifier as examples.<br />
<br />
this expansion is the expansion for the shaman if you ask me. if you ever thought about coming back to EQ, now is the time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">shaman are a very powerful class, OoW has made them even better<br />
<br />
i get group tells when im not even LFG, given VS has a very low population but theres still 4 encs 3 bst in /who all 70 lfg<br />
<br />
OoW is a great expansion imo, ive been living in places like Riftseekers, maxed my 69 spells in 2 days there, got 4 70 runes also and its great exp.<br />
<br />
Also OoW raids are very well thought out, some i would say are even better than inktuta scripts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's funny that on different servers the Shaman population is so different.  On Quellious I can do a 66 70 all lfg and 8 peeps are on it and 4 are Shaman.  I've talked with many fellow Shaman and they all say that LFG is a huge issue and way worse than ever before.<br />
<br />
Anyway, should you return?  Well, Shaman rock as we all know in most content. Omens is fine for shammys due to the slightly longer fights and our better omens buff spells, etc.  I like pretty much everthing about the expansion except that - similar to BOT, there are just a few good camp spots in WOS and MPG amd the overwhelming amount of time they are camped 24/7.  Maybe that will change when the uber guilds get done farming, I don't know.<br />
<br />
I am truely disappointed at Sony's decision to change the Dranik Scar instances NPC's to kos.  That decision hurt the casual players immensely - a horrible horrible decision!!!!! So, more trains in WOS and more crowded in MPG.<br />
