<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">None of us are happy about what is happening to the Panther line of spells. We're all in agreement that Sony's lack of communication has always been a problem. After all, they promised to balance us with this spell and have instead nerfed it to near uselessness. Why? We haven't gotten an answer, and if we do it will be a dismissive one-line response from someone who couldn't care less. Therein lies the problem. We still care, because we log in and spend our free time playing this game as Shaman. It's not a job to us, as it is to the developers, and we don't want it to be. This change makes absolutely no sense to us, and the only other time I've seen such a unified uproar from a class was when Sony attempted to make Slay Undead an activated ability that reduced the Paladins tanking ability significantly while active. They roared, things changed.<br />
<br />
I think we can do the same here, but not with Panther.<br />
<br />
A lot has been taken from us over the years, and very little has been given back as compensation. There was never a problem with the slowing classes' slowing abilities. Shaman slowed faster and better because it was our job, so why did the other classes need to have their slows brought up, thus making the already near insignificant disparity between slows altogether more miniscule? Did they do this because with all slowing classes so nearly equal in their ability they can finally up our healing power? If so, great . . . but we should be made aware. As it is, I see this as nothing more than a knowing big brother taking the younger's toys away and dangling them over his head. Maybe there's a new, better toy you can open up and play with after dinner, maybe not. We don't know. We don't know.<br />
<br />
Communication has always been Sony's weakest point with its customers, and it could alleviate a lot of grief and annoyance if they would actually tell us what they're thinking.<br />
<br />
Trust me, we are interested.<br />
<br />
While requesting a fix for the nerf on the Panther/Leopard line will make us happy in the short-term, we should know better by now. Short-term is just that. We need to think about the long-term, and the only long-term fix I see that needs to be addressed is communication. What was the point of the guild summit? The top ten lists? The class representatives? We, as a community, see so little, if anything, come from that. (That is not to say I do not appreciate all of Grimbear's work. I do, very much so, but Sony tells him very little and does even less.)<br />
<br />
My plea isn't for a fix to Panther. You know what? Leave it the way it is. Bend this spell over and do horribly unmentionable things to its horribly unmentionable areas, but in return give us customer service, become a part of our communities, communicate with us openly, ignore the trolls, flamebait tossers and ninnies and be our friends, not our enemies as so many of you appear to be. And you know why we harbor this animosity toward you and don't trust you? We don't know what you're thinking, and we can only see the end result of your work.<br />
<br />
Until then,<br />

My subscription runs out in June. That's my own, personal, deadline for seeing some actual community relations and customer service. I'll still play with my guild on raid nights (because they're amazing people and I care about them all dearly), and help out those who need me there for epics and such on offnights, but other than that I am on EQ strike. I can't give you my money if you can't tell me what you're doing and why, at the bare minimum. I won't accept that from any other company, and I certainly won't accept it from Sony.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For grammar. I'm sure I missed something else, but the point remains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will simply modify my play style to where I was before the Maw line was released. One less person playing doesn't make a difference to them. the best we can do is make a formal petition to SOE regarding the issue.<br />
<br />
if the spell stands as it is, it will just be another spell that goes into my spellbook for collection's sake. it will never be used, and the minimal amount of work that went into the spell will not be worth anything.<br />
<br />
I simply suggest that the matter be addressed professionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is not about SoPanther. It's about Sony's doing things without any rationale, never explaining it to us, and our sitting here taking it.<br />
<br />
THAT is what needs to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What floors me is how they handled this. I completely agree, this is type of costumer service will drive players away no question. People playing log on expecting the ability to perform certain fuctions, take it away those functions in this manner you take away the motivation to log on.<br />
<br />
First SONY tells everyone we are &quot;fixing&quot; the pet proc rate. Thats acceptable, its fixing an external issue regardling how the proc worked once it was already cast on something else. <br />
<br />
Now all of a sudden, this &quot;fix&quot; turns into a nerf at the last moment. At least be out front about it from the start. Don't hide behind your &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
No, this spell is not super unbalanced as it is. It's a huge mana drain, it prevents you from doing other important things when you are constantly keeping it up, it has a terribly short duration. Plus it was TESTED prior to release which leads me to assume it was intended to be as it was on release. What is great about this spell is it gives shaman something to do on raid mobs. Prior to this spell it was, after the mob is slowed (IF it can slowed) your designated down to spot healer, crappy nuker. Panther gives you another option, at the cost of giving up your spot healing while your running around casting it. This is balanced, trade one ability for another. The duration and dependence on OTHER players to be there to do the dps, makes this spell so great this is why all players enjoy it. Not to mention it seperates the buff bots from the real players.<br />
<br />
If this is not what you intended with this spell SONY, just flat out tell us nerf it to uselessness and end it at that, if not stand up and say we are glad we made the right choice with this spell line and we support it. But, please don't change the spell to appease the handfull of complainers who don't cast it, don't play a shaman, at the determent of an entire community who supports and see's its value, weakness and have fun playing with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the &quot;Take a Stand&quot; podium.  <br />
<br />
There are currently 601 shaman serverwide, who have in excess of 6350 hps unbuffed and are at level 69 or above. (Today's EQ Rankings)<br />
<br />
From this I can draw a conclusion that all of these accounts at least have purchased expansions through OoW and are actively playing.  Even if bots, they are still in groups grinding to achieve this level, hps, aa's, etc.<br />
<br />
And all are paying accounts.<br />
<br />
Trolling these boards as I do (only posted 50+ times in two years), I see the same names over and over .. with a huge loss of many in the past year.<br />
<br />
My point?  We should be sweating blood over this issue.  This board should be imploding from the shaman class on how to address the leo/pan spell line. <br />
<br />
No matter your stand ... now is the time to verbalize it.  Give Chotoi, Blazz, MacNair, Bethiana, Samanna, GrimBear, and the hand full of others I cannot remember, the benefit of your knowledge and the support of the shaman class as a whole to go and get this travesty corrected.<br />
<br />
And as an aside, I would suggest that if we can get new shaman to post, no matter what they say, let them say it in peace.  Degrading remarks like &quot;get your head out of your azz&quot;, or anything else trite that can be thought up, be left unsaid.<br />
<br />
Even a small comment like &quot;I do not like this nerf to the leo/pan line&quot;, with a vote on the three current polls will only help.  Better if you can back with why, and maybe one small idea you have had tossing in your brain, may lead to a break-through idea.<br />
<br />
I do not like where SoE is going with this spell line, but I am not one of the shaman that can parse logs, calculate formulas.  <br />
<br />
I only have an inate feeling for my shaman, her capabilities and her failings.  I just &quot;know&quot; what I can handle in most encounters.  Like I know this nerf is bad in ways I cannot fathom.<br />

That being said, Beth is right. This isnt really about the nerf. Its about being told time and time again that we are part of the &quot;community&quot; and then the minute we get the SLIGHTEST bit comfy, they whack us down a peg, without even so much as a &quot;How does this sound . . .&quot; anywhere. <br />
<br />
I realize that you cant really let the players RUN the game, but player input HAS to be taken into account in any decision of this magnitude. This was a minor change, say a 0 recast to a 5 second recast, this was a MAJOR nerf, done totally behind our backs. <br />
<br />

I have always been proud of my accomplishments.  Even if I hated loggin on to go LFG for hours, I loved logging on for raiding.  That was all I logged on for for about a year...was to raid.  When I got leopard(then panther), it changed everything.  I was getting asked for groups before I had a chance to say 'HI!' in guild chat.  I was being asked for groups constantly when online and it felt good.  I was making appointments for grouping it seemed.  the spirit of leopard and panther line was like a giant steak being thrown to a sadly neglected and hugry dog.  Now SoE is trying to take that steak back and give you a chew toy and expects us to roll over and like it.  I posted on live boards and I intend to /feedback everyday.  If this change goes live...It very well could be the first and last thing to ever make me push the end billing button.  I actually enjoyed the game again outside of raiding for the first time in a long time and now I can't go back to the way it was before.  I can't go back to LFG for hours or soloing just to get those last AA for something...I can't do it now that I have tasted the good life for the first time in a long time.  I love my guild with all my iksar heart and wouldn't ever want to hurt them....but if I dont enjoy the game anymore, what's the point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, to a point, I agree. I'm not asking people to cancel their accounts. I cancelled mine because Sony is going to notice a spike of cancellations in regards to their patch message. I'm asking us to come together while we're all completely unified and make a stand. Right now if Sony ignores us they're only hurting themselves. A lot of us are upset, and while we're upset we can use our anger and frustration to do something a lot more positive than complaining - I think we can make changes.<br />
<br />
Maybe *I* am being optimistic, but I'm tired of being asked to shut up, sit down, and take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Blazz -Folks, lets not start cancelling accouns YET. The nerfs havent gone live, and I am willing to wager they will bow down to the pressure and put a MUCH smaller re-cast on the spell.  <br />
<br />
I guaranty this is exactly what they plan to do.  Well, they can blow any change to the recast delay out their collective wahzoo, in my lowly humble opinion, along with any further nonsense yada about how they know we love this spell and their plans to expand upon it's line because we are so happy.<br />
<br />
For years we have put up with bait and switch, the release of expansions with awesome spells, items, zones and exp only to see one or two months of &quot;getting what you've actually paid for&quot; and barely enough time to /duck out of the way of the nerf bat as it swings down upon our collective heads.  It's such a common practice from SoE that it's expected by the player base and it glares at us in it's fine print every time we log in or purchase a box from them.<br />
<br />
No one can tell me the Dev's didn't thoroughly test this spell, discuss it, re-test it, and discuss it some more before rolling it out with DoN.  I might be able to believe that the pet proc rate was undiscovered in testing but you'd have to be a pure noob not to put this baby on your doggy and any passing beastlord pet right away.  But, I am also not naive enough to believe it didn't go live better than they intended to allow and with the full knowledge that a nerf would come within a few months.<br />
<br />
They put the spell / items / zones / missions / etc in the game &quot;pre-nerf&quot; to push any customer hold-outs into buying the expansion because we hear immediately from other players how it's &quot;absolutely awesome&quot;.  Expansion after expansion of the same thing and we still don't realize it, nor do we ever see any kind of compensation for losing the value of the game we just bought in it's original state.  I, for one, would very much like to get more than 2 months of usefulness out of an expansion's spells.   Well, maybe some of us have realized it as they've gotten tired of it and gone off to other company's mmorpgs.<br />
<br />
Threatening to quit and cancelling didn't immediately help the monk community when the infamous ac nerf hit them.  But these are indeed different times in the market and there are a lot of angry shaman right now, so it's not exactly the brightest business move to ignore them and make changes without so much as a detailed, honest, forthright explanation as to *** the reasoning is behind it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Glauri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I am absolutely furious with myself for being so attached to the shaman class that I don't want to play any other. And I have watched for years as SoE has stolen from us our potential; has lied to us outright; and has &quot;mitigated&quot; the truth.<br />
<br />
I have played other games, almost always as a shaman if that class exists. I came back to EQ1 to be with my friends. But I feel that with the changes SoE has in mind for my class, I will soon be nothing more than a useless toon -- good at absolutely nothing. Others slow (for all practical purposes) just as well, and can add dps. Other hybrid classes can heal far better than I can, and are getting even better heals. We all know how broken alchemy is, and has always been. And what bright spot is on the horizon for shamen? NOTHING.<br />
<br />
I have never been this down before. I truly wish that since it is apparently SoE's intention to eliminate the class, that they just had the balls to come out and tell us to /reroll.<br />
