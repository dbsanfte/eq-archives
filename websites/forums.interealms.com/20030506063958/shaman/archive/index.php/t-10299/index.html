<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kongwu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Slightly silly question, but ive been trying to search for a 1h blunt with the luclin &quot;hammer of thor&quot;-look ( can't really think of a better discription )<br />
<br />
well anyways, was wondering if someone had any idea's of a decent weapon with this look that's droppable but doesn't cost a ton of pp or a no drop one that a duo (60 sham / 60 ranger ) can get.... ( what i mean with decent is about the same ratio or so as epic )<br />
<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
