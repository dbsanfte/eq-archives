Do I really need it?  It sounds very useful.<br />

How much does it sell for on your servers?  I've never seen it for sale in the bazaar, so I have no idea what's a reasonable price for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I paid 8K and an old cloak of the maelstorm I had lying around on a twink for mine.  It was *WAY* too much to pay for a spell, but I figured with the PoP it would be difficult to persuade guildmembers to hit Sraa anytime soon.  Since I purchased PE, we've actually run into the Mystic 3 times on the way to various PoP boss mob destinations, all three times he's dropped Group Acumen.  I'm wondering if PE is now his rare drop?<br />
<br />
In any case, although it was too much to pay for a spell and I get really aggravated having to buff a raid group of 70 people with it, I love the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Primal essence is a pain in the ass, seriously.<br />
<br />
I pray for the day all melee in my guild have Primal weaps.<br />
<br />
It's a shame that my Group PE hammer isn't other group Targetable. Normally I just click that to do myself and my group.<br />
<br />
Though these days I only get tells for PE from the odd char or two so it ain't so bad.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
What's fun though is casting PE on shamans who don't have it (especially when they are being bombarded with /tells for it!!). <br />
They love that sh1t.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glori I'm curious,  PE is only 20/20/20/20 correct?   Isn't Avatar 60 to all?  Why would you want to use a level 50 or so spell when you most likely have access to a level 60 spell that is much better?<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes you are:<br />
<br />
PE = no reagent<br />
PE = 100 mana<br />

<br />
Avatar = emerald (13pp)<br />
Avatar = 325 mana<br />
Avatar = 180s recast time<br />
Avatar = 3s cast time<br />
<br />
I can do my whole raid melee in the time I can cast 1 avatar.  That's why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ah, bonus!<br />
<br />
I so gotta finish my cudgel ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Big difference between PE and Avatar...<br />
<br />
PE has STA, Avatar has not... :P 20sta = 120 extra hp for a warrior at lvl 60, or about - its 60 extra hp for a shaman at lvl 60, or 1hp per lvl if you want...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't forget duration of the spells.  Avatar lasts 6 minutes, while Primal Essence lasts 63 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have seen PE for sale only twice on my server and both times it was going for 20K+.  Far easier to go camp it, but good luck finding people who still want to spend time in Ssra.  Since PoP came out that zone has been empty.<br />
<br />
PE is very useful and the group version is really nice because it is mana free.  It no longer stacks with VoB and will not stack with Billy, Avatar, or Carnage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
I have Avatar.  Don't have or expect to get PE any time soon. :(<br />
<br />
The entire time I've had Avatar scribed, I've cast it ONCE.<br />
That was on a Faydedar battle when we were worried about our numbers, since we were going in very lean w/ DPS and healers.<br />
<br />
I went to cast on the MA right before the pull, and found to my chagrin that I had to wait 3 minutes before even casting the damn thing.  I hit the tank about 3 sec before we spawned the lizard.  (Thank goodness for last minute positioning delays!)<br />
<br />
He liked it alot, but I didn't waste an emerald on anyone else.  Didn't have time to even if I'd wanted too. :p<br />
<br />
I don't carry emeralds around.  I just happened to have some in inventory since I'd just worked Jewelcraft up for the 7th Prayer Shawl Quest.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to cast Avatar very much.  If they upped the duration to 60min or more, then it might be worth the expense and casting delays.  But not for a palty 6 minute buff.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I cast Primal Avatar on melee all the time when exping.<br />
I normally manage to keep it on two of them if I am on the ball and recast soon as it refreshes.<br />
<br />
Even before I scored a ST key and got the componentless version I'd chew through stacks of emeralds avataring my rogue when I duel-comped him.<br />
10 to 20 percent more DPS was worth it IMO.<br />
<br />
Besides, rogues are all ATK whores :)<br />
It's like melee crack!! $$ /drools</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love PE.  I got VERY lucky getting it in trade from someone who had a friend in a guild that does Ssra a lot and had been given a copy for the shaman alt that he doesn't play much anymore.  Like I said, VERY lucky.<br />
<br />
But I've found it's wonderful because nobody expect you to have it.  People in pickups expect to all be simultaneously hasted the instant you join the group, but PE is a pleasant surprise.  As for guildies, they've learned that the best way to avoid getting any shaman buffs is to pester the shamans for buffs, so I just dish it out as I'm able.  No problem.<br />
<br />
I'm not 60 yet and have found Avatar harder to buy than Torpor and Malo combined, so it's good news for me that it won't be all that critical.<br />
<br />
My only gripe about PE is that my monks report that it doesn't stack with their epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not elites that drop insignias it's the nameds at port down to emperor, there's a circle of level 60 snakes (Imperial Guards) that hits for like 400ish, they are PH's for the nameds, the nameds are somewhat lower level 55ish I seem to recall, but WAY undercons - let me say that again WAY WAY undercons. The nameds always drops insignia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Agree to Shumm.. They are not nice.. Might consider atleast 2-3 groups before going there to take these nameds for insignia down..

PE is not no drop, I bought mine in the bazaar.  (Group Acumen is also not no drop, a guildie gave me my copy).  I believe the spells are lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have never ever seen one for sale on Torv. I'd pay a lot for this. My chances of looting it myself are about 0.<br />

Really wish I did have it though, I'd love this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aye. Never ever seen it for sale.<br />
<br />
But now that torpor is bought, I may try saving up and yodeling around for it on /auction. <br />
<br />
We do plan on getting rings, but Ssra is heavily camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">To the person asking where it dropped, if you look at the map of 2nd floor Ssra there's a 0,0 marked on it. Mystics spawn in the big room with a tube leading up just underneath that. <br />
<br />
On the first floor, take the right side door when you get to the first big room from the zone line. That corridor will take you up to the 2nd floor. We usually set up camp right outside that room on the second floor, at the T intersection. No roamers or close spawns so it's a safe place to pull to. You need a key from a commander on the 2nd floor to get in to the mystic room though. <br />
<br />
The reason you don't see PE or group acumen for sale all that often is because it's a pretty rough camp. One type of mob there (elite guards, not all that common) isn't slowable and hit's for about 450 so you need a real tank and a cleric to keep him alive. You also tend to  get multiples per pull so an enchanter (dunno if a bard can mez there) is pretty much required. My last trip there we did it with a 65sk, 61 shaman druid cleric enchanter, 59 paladin and it was pretty easy. Don't think we could have done it with the 59 pally tanking though. <br />
<br />
PE seems to be the common drop, in 4 trips there I've probably seen a dozen PE and 3 acumen drop.</div></div><hr />

That is 10 K more than my Enchanter Buddy paid for KEI.  KEI will eventually turn a profit.  I doubt I would even get any PP if I cast this spell.  It looks like a very nice buff but in no way would I pay more than 10 K for it.</div></div><hr />
