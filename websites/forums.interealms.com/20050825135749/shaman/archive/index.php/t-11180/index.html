<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I have been experiencing a lot of comp freezes when starting EQ for the last 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
Some days it happens 3 times in a row when logging in and I have to hardware reebot each time.<br />
<br />
It will go smoothly till I choose the character I want to log in and can freeze anywhere between the character zoning into the game or withing 10 seconds of zoning in.<br />
<br />
So far in the last couple of days I have not had it yet! (crosses fingers, eyes, and wutever else that can be crossed)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, maybe tis not somwething if only me and you are getting it . Just so odd that me and my GF have the exact same issue and they started at the exact same time.<br />
<br />
ahh well , hoping till get better when LoY comes out , otherwise have ot get hands dirty =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the contrary, my system is more stable now than it was for a long time after Luclin came out ...<br />
<br />
Blame Microsoft, it always works for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Friend got a lots of problem after installing DirectX 9<br />
if it help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our chanter has been going LD all the time.... luckily for some reason he never gets bugged like i do and he always gets back on inside of like 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Typically when either of my guys go LD it will tell me for 5 minutes that i'm still online.  When he goes LD it kicks him straight to desktop and he can jump back on immediately.<br />
<br />
He isnt the kind of person to take this stuff quietly so he has had more petitions, emails, phone calls to anyone that might possibly be the reason for this problem.<br />
<br />
Hope they get this smoothed out soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tend to go LD and crash to the desktop alot in the last month or so. But can get right back on, almost never get &quot;active character&quot;<br />
<br />
The LD seems to be router issues somewhere though...both my systems LD at the same time.<br />
<br />
The desktop crashes happen when I zone...my group doesn't have a clue I am LD though...it just looks like I took 3 minutes to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have 2 pretty decent machines and most of the time when I crash, its when Ive been in a raid (intense on the memory I guess) and am zoning (like being rezed back in).  I am always able to log back in immediately.  My wife and I have 4 machines at home and all seem to behave similarly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Most Zone crashes are due to Custom UI's .. I had this problem and I can't say it cut out 100% of it .. but it cut out about 99% of it .. very rarely do I crash to desktop .. <br />
<br />
Could be partially DirectX9 too though, but I also can't live without my CustomUI .. just the playerinfo window that shows percentages instead of just a black line.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmm  dx9 seems to be a common issue here. I did recently install dx9 on bolth machines , but didnt have the problem right away , perhaps if i uninstall dx9 and find dx8 and install that , it could take care of it . I didnt notice any wonderful enchancement from the upgrade anyway.   Thnx for the feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll try it over the weekend and see what I can see .. It never crashed with DX 8.1 and XP .. but I put Windows 2000 and DX 9.1 hoping for stability .. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My wifes secondary computer has been consitently crashing out to desktop since last patch. It was previously probably our most stable one.<br />
<br />
running XP Pro, DX 8.1, and standard UI</div></div><hr />
