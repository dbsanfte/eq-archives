<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blaykz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone in /gu suggested a picture program to me a while back that was amazing, it converted pictures from bmp to jpg and back and forth and was perfect for what I needed it for, But I had to reload and lost the program. I  completly forgot the name, anyone happen to remember the program or know or one like it? thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the program you are looking for is IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.com/). I could be wrong tho :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tarora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if ya got the cash...adobe photoshop 7.0 can do that and about a billion other things...rather spendy tho...i love the prog an was well worth the money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blaykz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Irfanview looks nice, Im gonna download and try that, Its not the exact program I was using but it looks like it will work just as good if not way better =)<br />

I think a friend has adobe, I may have to Borrow it from him and give it a shot, Not sure why I never thought of thought before heheh<br />
<br />
Thank you for suggestions, Mainly I was needing to shrink and convert images to lower the filesizes .. (free websites and limited bandwith sucks!)</div></div><hr />
