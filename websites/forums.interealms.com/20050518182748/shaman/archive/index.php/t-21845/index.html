<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Black Cavern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I just nuked my Ranger of three years because at high levels I found him useless. I felt like he was dead weight on Raids and was tired<br />
of getting few invites to hunt.<br />
So, without doing research (mistake) I thought about what may be a next fun class, I MADE A SHAMAN! ACK!<br />
Now I start hearing how Shaman are nerfed at the higher levels and now I'm desperate. Not that again.  :mad: He just made 12 after maybe a few hours for three days so it's not too late to hit the delete key. <br />
What really got me going was a conversation between a highly capable 65 Shaman in my guild and another guy. These two I respect immensely for their game savy and expertise. The 65 Shammy has almost quit playing from lack of content for his class.<br />
<br />
Sooo, please help here. I like to melee, and nuke. I would like to be useful to a Raid. I also like to solo. So where do I go from here?<br />
Suggestions are appreciated. <br />

Maybe a new game? Any suggestions? I like EQ format so EQ2?<br />

make a warrior or cleric or enchanter, all heavily needed for raids, they are the holy trio.<br />
you can't tank anything without a warr, you can't heal anything worth a damn without a druid, you can't crowd control like a enchanter.<br />
those are the best classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WoW Mage? Illusion/Empathy controller in City of Heroes? hehe<br />
<br />
I'd suggest beastlord, cleric, or chanter. If you have any friends w hgh level characters, talk to them extensively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">or you could not listen to what they are saying and chose what class you want to play.  I'm not sure exactly where you thought your rangers went wrong, but I've never had any problems or heard of any problems with them.  I'm sure it's much to the same demise as how some of the shaman feel about their own class (IE the two posters above me) and that there are some problems, but it's not as bad as it seems.  Pick and chose a class that you are comfortable with and what you want to do in the game.  I personally love slowing mobs and have no problems giving buffs to anyone who wants them.  Sometimes if I feel like I want a little bit of meleeing done, I'll pull out the beastlord or bot a ranger or rogue with my shaman.  Whatever you really like to do, pick that class and decide.  In the end game, the cleric and warrior is the most sought after class, and both of them seem to be high on turnover rate (well... cleric def not as bad for warr).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally wouldnt stop playing a shaman even if they took away everything I hold dear about them. I like shaman. I'm with Vals on this one, experirment with the classes and eventually you'll find one that just fits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play a 65 ranger and a 65 shammy, I don't have alot of trouble getting guild groups with my ranger, and I bot my shammy sometimes when hes needed. I find the ranger alot more funa nd alot more needed than the shaman. I provide significant dps, some semi useful buffs and generally don't have to mash the canni button all night to amount to anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Echo the advice given above.  If you want end game content, it's all about War/Clr/Enc.  End of story.  No other class contributes - especially NOT shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Echo the advice given above.  If you want end game content, it's all about War/Clr/Enc.  End of story.  No other class contributes - especially NOT shaman.<br />
<br />
Have to disagree here. Clerics are needed for single group and raid content, and lots of them. Three warriors are sufficient for most raid content. Some group content in GoD really works better with a warrior, but is being re-tuned. An enchanter works really well in group content. Three enchanters can usually cover a raid. <br />
<br />
By far the most important aspect of raids is sustained dps. Rangers are just about tops, if not the best in that they can sustain excellent ranged or close damage without going out of mana. Rangers are also useful in LDoN and quests and useful in most groups. Rangers seem to stack pretty well. <br />
<br />
A well played shaman can do quite a bit, but really is not that welcome in GoD trials. Since enchanter dps with a charmed pet is so overpowered, all dps classes must feel a little useless in GoD. But, other classes are much worse, and Gates design will destroy the game if they stick with it. <br />
<br />
A shaman is versatile and a lot of fun and by the time you get him to 65+200aas I imagine there will be a well defined role for them even in top end content.  Rangers rock, and are great everywhere but chanter dps god trials. Even there snare and root can save a group if the chanter pet needs to be brought under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wizard is one of the more heavily desired raiders, as well.  Dps is crucial in many fights.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What the hell is this &quot;wut&quot; I keep seeing people type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I play a lot of toons.  65 shaman, 65 monk, 61 ranger, and 56 wizard are my highest, all non-PLd.  As much dogging and bashing of the shaman class that I hear, my shaman is still my main toon.  He's the one I break out when my guild needs power or when I'm in a weaker group and we need a toon to put us over the top.  I know that sounds funny to say because most folks thinks shamans are worthless, but I guess I can put it down for ya like this, at least in reference to xp groups (which makes up 95% of my play-time):<br />
<br />
If I'm playing my monk in a group and the ****e hits the fan ---  there's nothing I can do except attack attack attack and when I'm the last one alive --- I FD.  The monk is awesome as hell when things are going great and smooth, but can't do much when things get pressure-packed.<br />
<br />
If I'm playing my ranger in a group and the ****e hits the fan, I have a few utilities at my disposal (root and snare), but again it's almost the same as the monk --- attack attack attack and when I'm the last one standing --- DIE!  Ranger-gate.  Rangers are a fun class, but again lack the ability to shine when the **** hits the fan.'<br />
<br />
If I'm playing my wizard in a group and the ****e hits the fan --- uh, hope to hell nothing agros me while I'm nuking everything down... snare and root in a weak attempt at ghetto-CC, and when I'm the last one alive --- DIE (if gate doesn't channel).  The wizard does have the alternate ability to evac the group, which can be nice, but if yer deep in a dungeon it means ya gotta work your way all the way back.  Not that big a deal in PoP since corpses pop at GY in a few mins anyway.<br />
<br />
If I'm playing my shaman in a group and the ****e hits the fan --- we got a fuggin' chance!  I can guarantee you that when I'm playing my shaman and I'm in a guild group, that group is a helluva lot more confident when things go haywire.  We may not live every time, but at least there's a chance.<br />
<br />
For instance, last night --- in a guild group in my favorite stomping grounds, Crypt of Decay (I love dungeons).  2 shamans as healers and that's it.  We got 2 tanks though.  We're messin' around in the rats area.  There's a good amount of wanderers in this area, and if yer not careful the respawn will get ya, too.<br />
<br />
Started a fight with a single mob, but we'd eventually win the fight having taken down 6-7 mobs in succession, with 2-3 in camp at all times.  The other shaman died on the first mob when a 2nd mob added from behind and tore him a new butthole!<br />
<br />
So 7 mobs (3 in camp at the moment, but 4 more would add a few mins later), 5 of us.  A monk, pally, warrior, wizard, and shaman.  We're not elemental, either...  we're lucky to have some ornate and LDoN armor.  We lived.  The shaman kept all of them slowed, and was throwing heals like mad, chain-Quiescing everyone, canni'ing.  If you were to take away anyone of those other 4 classes, we still woulda had a chance.  Take away the shaman and the fight woulda been over very quickly, with us on a CR.  No other &quot;healing&quot; class coulda pulled that off, due to shaman slow and just-good-enough healing.  I know that the healing doesn't cut the mustard on raids, but in those thrilling &quot;oh-my-God-we-got-5-mobs-that-hit-for-500-on-us-and-only-a-shaman-as-a-healer&quot; dungeon moments, it can work.  And it's fun as hell (at least for me).<br />
<br />
I like adrenaline, and I love the rush of having the odds against me... the shaman is the character that enables me to defeat those odds the best.  I'm running to a camp in a Tier-2 zone, and a mob sees invis --- the ranger, monk, and wizard are gonna retreat real quick.... but the shaman turns around, says &quot;did you just hit me?&quot; and proceeds to straight up tank/solo the mob.  Loot the corpse and carry on like nothing happened.<br />
<br />
The shaman class is strange... it's not a glamorous class with lots of eye-candy and it does lack DPS which is oh-so-important... but they add a tremendous amount of survivability to a group if played correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You need to consider which content you are in also, not just your level.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a great class... pre-GoD/PoP. The Shaman class starts to erode once in upper tier PoP and is definitley eroded in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I kinda agree.  I've been successful in every phase of the game, even through the lower and middle tiers of PoP, where I can be the main healer through Tier-3 zones (Tactics/BoT/HoH, whichever tier that is, I think 3)...  but I doubt I could pull that off in higher-tier PoP and even moreso not in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Look I dont wanna rain on your parade or anything, but compare apples to apples. Substitute a cleric and chanter for your 2 shaman and see the outcome.<br />
All youve proved is that you barely survived an encounter  with 2 shaman that would have been totally trivial with an enchanter and cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Read it closer, Tewdogs.  It was only 1 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I read it fine, 1 shaman died because there was no cc and no fast heals. None of the group would have died if it was a cleric and chanter. That was my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tewdogs, the point you missed was ... HOW FUN THE ENCOUNTER WAS. As a shaman. For a shaman. So get off the &quot;if you had&quot; bandwagon. They didn't. They had 2 shaman. Not the first group to not have either a cleric or an enchnanter ... or both.<br />
<br />
Frankly, given the same scenario, lets say the add that killed the shaman would of attacked the cleric or the enchanter. If the enchanter, it is likely - as likely as the shaman dieing - that the chanter and/or the cleric would of died faster. In your scenario, you need that cleric and you need that enchanter. Both. In the story, a shaman dies and the next one played dual roles as CC and healer while still doing primary role of slower.<br />
<br />
Geeze, as frustrating as I get with the real problems, posts like your just torque me off for carrying the whining and bemoaning of the class too damn far.<br />

Advice: play what you want. If your goal it reach the end game and have everyone want and need you then make friends who are not part of the limited mentality of the cookie cutter roles and techniques in EQ. Or better yet, play what you like and make your niche as best you can. Every class can do lots more than is generally known about the class and defined only by the best players of that class. Be that person - skilled and knowledgable - and the rest falls into place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I stopped short because he said he wanted to melee.  I was going to suggest a necro till he specified.  I've been blown away by what necros can do for a long time now.  And you can either solo for great experience with them or add a whole lot to a group, depending on what you're into that day.<br />
<br />
For melees, I've played both a monk and a SK from between extensively to regularly.  Both are really great fun, and FD is by far one of the most powerful and useful-on-a-daily-basis type spells.  Both these toons are tremendous fun. <br />
<br />
Monks are great pullers, and their FD can't be interrupted.  It's far more reliable than the SK version, and they can use AA to get it far better still.  Mine's an iksar, and with a fungi on him, at 60 he regens very quickly.  It's very cool to be able to go answer the phone and come back and find that not only did your toon not get killed while you were away, but he's now at full health! :) <br />
<br />
SK's can do small nukes, but what makes them better is that SK's have their own spell line that lets them regen mana at a rate even better than KEI!  Pretty hot stuff.  Especially when you add in FD and the ability to tank, and even a pet, which has strategic uses even beyond his DPS ability and is often not given the credit he deserves for his contribution to the SK package.  <br />
<br />
When I duo my shaman and SK, I have FOUR toons to CC with -- two pets and two real toons.  Combined with roots from the shaman, snares from the SK, and VP pushing mobs around, I have a fairly decent arsenal of ways to keep mobs where I want them for a guy with only two toons.<br />
<br />
But whether solo or not, the SK is having problems in GoD content these days, as even fully time-equipped SK's, even the best on their servers, are getting regularly wiped out there.  They just are not sufficient tanks.  Sony, in its ignorant wisdom, is now looking at balancing some of GoD for pally tanks, but pallies have much more survivability than SK's. <br />
<br />
So as much as I love SK's, they're buyer beware for now.  The dunces at Sony have not been kind to them.<br />
<br />
P.S. -- check out the insta-cast invis on the Circlet of Shadow(not shadowS) that SK's can wear.  You can click it right in the face of mobs and not have them see you!  Combined with FD and also ITU(invisible to undead) and levitate(bobbing corpse), the SK is a fantastic toon for running around scary places and exploring with -- to me one of the most fun things in the game.  There's a lot more to EQ than you normally see as a shaman.<br />
<br />
That's another reason for choosing a monk, too.  You get to see so much and be so active.  It's a wonderful change of pace from the shaman routine of managing the crowd of players and the crowd of mobs back at home base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually Grafsha the point was he was comparing classes against each other when the sh1t hits the fan in a discussion about which class to play.<br />
None of the other classes he mentioned (monk,ranger,wizard) are CC or healers, nor can they get snap agro. A shaman is better than these classes when the sh1t hits the fan? well , duh.<br />
I never suggested the encounter was boring, I suggested he compare apples with apples ie CC and healer with CC and healer.<br />
A single add is just as likely to kill someone in the group when you have a cleric and a chanter? get a grip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you want to melee while still being cool in the end game... make a rogue or a BST. Warriors aren't terrible either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tewdogs still doesn't get it.<br />
<br />
The point is, TD, that the group faced adversity and one shaman was able to keep them alive.  Not a cleric and a chanter --- one shaman.  It was a challenge, it was fun, everyone afterwards was like &quot;daaaaayum.&quot;  That was my point.  And the group's success was completely owed to the abilities of the shaman.  I coulda had a chanter and cleric, which constitutes the majority of boring grind no-suspense groups, but we didn't have that.  We had 2 shamans, 1 died immediately, and 5 of us looked around, saw that we had only 1 shaman left to support us and assumed an ensuing death to the whole party... instead we were victorious.  Not many classes can pull that off.  Not saying it's impossible, but my point was that a shaman adds a dimension of survivability to any dangerous encounter that is perhaps greater than what other classes can provide.  If you dispute that, then fine, but I'm not looking for a comparison of a shaman vs. a clr/enc combo.  In this situation, 1 shaman effectively replaced a cleric and enchanter.  The first shaman died when an add popped up behind him and it was a quick death...  it woulda wiped out a chanter or cleric, also.  The pally rezzed the shaman back in after the fight, and we continued on like nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
I know that most folks had a lot of negativity towards the shaman class, and it makes me uncomfortable to even talk positively about them, but I can't help it.  I've had positive experiences with mine, and I think I have a right to share that.  Of course it was met be negativity, but I've come to expect that.  I think the shaman class could use some help, but it's not the end of the world like most of this forum thinks.</div></div><hr />

Whatever you do, do not make a Monk.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because they're not as &quot;powerful&quot;?  Who cares?  Play what you relate to and have fun with.  You'll find your niches.  Unless you're of the mindset that &quot;power&quot; and uberness is everything.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I got a monk, I can tell you he's impressive.  He'll get more impressive as he keeps advancing.  Sure, monks are not as utilitarian as shamans or druids, but there's not doubting their ability to do damage and do some impressive pulling.  My guild (a smaller guild of 20 online or so) won't even attempt a high risk LDoN without having my monk in the group because that's the only way they win is when he pulls (we lack high-level bards, and my monk is the only regularly played one).  There really is a place for a monk in this game if you keep yer eyes open.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying &quot;play a monk&quot;; just saying don't discredit a monk because they're perceived to be less uber than today's enchanters, necros or bards, etc...  If you like the concept of a monk, have fun with it --- by all means, play a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">speaking from an end game point of view, the classes that seem to be in the highest demand, the most useful and consequently the most fun are the specialty classes, or more specifically the classes that are the best in the game at one specific application.<br />
<br />
warriors are the best tanks in raid, farm or exp situations in the end game because of their disciplines, superior avoidance/mitigation tables, and excellent agro control (in the &quot;end game&quot;).<br />
<br />
clerics are, at almost any point of the game, hands down the best healers.<br />
<br />
enchanters are the masters of crowd control and have the most useful/necessary buffs.<br />
<br />
rogues and wizards are the masters of damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
after those five classes, i'd say bards and shaman are the next two most desirable/useful classes because of their general utility and enhancement of the above classes' performance (bards with mana regen, overhaste, attack enhancement, run speed enhancement, etc; shaman with a decent hitpoint buff, backup haste, good slows, backup heals and FA.)  bards are, in my experience, more useful and fun than shaman but more physically demanding to play well.<br />
<br />
<br />
i think any of those seven classes would be fun and interesting.  if you want to be able to solo, pick an enchanter, bard, shaman or wizard.  if you want to be needed and stack well on raids, pick a rogue, wizard or cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
those are just my general ideas, of course.  the other classes have their own merits to be sure.  to reiterate what a few posters wrote above, you should pick a class and race combination that strikes you as interesting and fun, and may hold a bit of roleplay amusement for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Poguk , the original poster is looking for a better character. You compare 3 dps classes vs a shaman. Your criteria is &quot;the Sh1t hits the fan&quot;<br />
I say its a poor comparison when shaman clearly have more options available in this situation than a class whos strength is dps. <br />
When using the criteria &quot;the sh1t hits the fan&quot; , why not compare yourself to some classes who also have strengths in this area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started a class (shaman) to play to have fun with.  I had fun... until a few months ago when I ran a few trials.  I made a shaman when I read the cool things about them in the manual.<br />
<br />
I'm not having fun anymore.  I *almost* regret my decision... it is most likely the fond memories that keep that thought at bay most days.<br />
<br />
Problem is, most people's arguments go something like, &quot;Well, we might not be the BEST, but if you work hard enough, and make use of your skills, you can do well!&quot;  Sad thing is, if a CLERIC worked hard enough, and made good use of his skills, he could do well... to a level far beyond us... and by well, I mean contribution the the effectiveness of a group.  You see a fair amount of lazy clerics who suck because they can squeak by like that on such a class.<br />
<br />
You can play to have fun, sure, but when you reach content that you cannot even join a group with more often than not, in your current class, and when in one you are so busy stressing out over peppering your group with tiny heals until the cleric arrives, and shoots off a few, stresslessly... well... most people would stop having fun at that point, no?<br />
<br />
But in the end, I believe it's a choice you have to make.  If you do not enjoy playing one of the holy trinity, you must make due with another class.  Just embrace non - endgame content, as that is where you will have your fun.<br />
<br />
Yes, the shaman has more options, but at endgame, its all about being the best at something.  You say how much you can heal or what you can do in a certain situation, and it generally impresses people far less than a Warrior showing off his insane buffed HP/AC.<br />

SOE has called in the mothership, and the aliens have come... they have done this to cram the challenge back into the game, to give us all a taste of the old days.  It's not working... they've made it so difficult to compensate for the effectiveness of today's gear that they've isolated the classes that are not the best at what they do, or who are so marginally the &quot;best&quot; that it doesn't matter (first statement was in reference to non-trinity classes, second in reference to shaman as slowers).<br />
<br />
But, despite all my doomsday speech, there are good people out in EQ, and the good people will make up for what the less cultured, more statistically inclined ubers lack, and give you groupage, company, and the respect your skill with what tools you are given deserves.  So pick a class, suit up, and have fun!  Just make sure you are actually having fun, or the ---GAME--- isn't worth playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason you're enjoying your Monk is because there are no alternatives. Outside of LDoN Hard, where once you reach a certain level of play you're no longer needed, you're a pointless waste of healing power.<br />
<br />
Unless you plan on being in an environment where you are the only available option, just don't. Shaman may complain that &quot;slow isn't enough anymore&quot; but people still need slow. Monks have nothing. DPS? Get a Rogue, Ranger, Necro, Mage, Wizard, BST or even a Warrior. All superior choices. The three other &quot;FD&quot; classes (bards, necros, SKs) offer other vastly superior abilities.<br />
<br />
But that's okay! It's all cool. I can still have loads of fun pulling LDoN Hard and PoWater when there's no Bards on.</div></div><hr />
