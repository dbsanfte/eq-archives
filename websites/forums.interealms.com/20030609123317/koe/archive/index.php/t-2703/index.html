<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ Traders (http://www.eqtraders.com) has good info on baking and most other trade skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, I just came across that site. Very good list, now I can start cooking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK another question, where do I find the different sauces, chocolates, vinegars.. etc... I found the spices, reg sauce, frosting in Thurg already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQTraders also lists where you can buy supplies for all the tradeskills. You can buy the various spices/garnish/vinegar, but you have to make chocolate...and chocolate requires brownie parts :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkcast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If there is one thing Orges know how to do...that would be eat :) If thurgardin isn't your cup of tea, you could always venture to Ogguk and ferrot. In town there are several vendors that sell a many different cooking supplies (even bat wings for bat wing crunchies..yummy) and if you go out the town gate follow the path and take a left (at the first split) and follow it around there is a merchant (Burb or something like that) who sell frosting, suases, and tons of other cooking supplies.<br />
       There is a nice private kitchen that hardly ever has anyone in it that isn't that hard to find. If you go to Clurg's bar and head towards were the leather and metal armour is sold there is a passage way ( about half way between the 2 places) that leads to the kitchen were the oven is. Just keep in mind Nekky, ogguck residents love Inkies, weather they are cooking with suases or covered in them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the info, I will check out those places. I am not kos in either city.</div></div><hr />
