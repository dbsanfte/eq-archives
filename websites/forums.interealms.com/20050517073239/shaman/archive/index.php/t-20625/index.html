<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dr. Schambaugh, of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Engineering, Final Exam question for May of 1997. Dr. Schambaugh is known for asking questions such as, &quot;why do airplanes fly?&quot; on his final exams. His one and only final exam question in May 1997 for his Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer II class was: &quot;Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;First, We postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. <br />
<br />
Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, then you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially.<br />
<br />
Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. Two options exist:<br />
<br />
If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. <br />
<br />
If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. <br />
<br />
So which is it? If we accept the quote given to me by Theresa Manyan during Freshman year, &quot;that it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep with you&quot; and take into account the fact that I still have NOT succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then Option 2 cannot be true...Thus, hell is exothermic.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always loved that one :)   Actually had a couple professors give questions of this ilk as extra credit on exams seeking out similar funny answers, and I always find that humor gets more points than accuracy ever will :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh reminds me of an undergrad Physics class that I was in waaayyyy back in the day...was 1991 and I was in a tad bit over my head, taking physics that was using claculus base vs algebraic base (hint, if your not all that hot at calculus, dont do that)....I was totally stumped on a question (something to do with friction table calculations) and had no clue as to where to go with the math,  so I just drew a giant chicken...got 5 points :D and passed the test heheh...I later on went to be a teacher for that same professors labs in my junior/senior years heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i haven't laughed so hard in a long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">test</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We addressed this on our boards a while back, and came to the following :rolleyes::<br />
<br />
Subject addressed: Hell is exothermic as proven in previous statement.<br />
<br />
If we accept the given stipulus of the above debate and agree that the two resulting events are as presented, then the closing statement put forward by the candidate cannot be a plausible case for elimination and summary assumption. <br />
<br />
The candidate quite clearly states his continuing non-copulation with Ms Banyan, and this state is neither of a fixed term nor does he indicate a likely end. Thus, #2 cannot be disregarded as it requires a finite cessation of it's validity in order to do so. <br />
<br />
Had Ms Banyan succumbed to the young and virulent lust obviously being nurtured by the candidate, #2 would be factually conclusive and accepted, but only because we would have reached a finite conclusion; that of the completion of Ms Banyan's aged statement. <br />
<br />
Given the facts as presented, and adopting the arguments and conditions put forward, no valid case has been presented to indicate that Hell is either going to freeze over or indeed break loose. As such, I implore the jury to find that Hell is not guilty and use the power of the judicial system to the ends for which it was meant - to protect the innocent and provide a better place for us all to live. <br />
<br />
The defence rests.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was the last we heard of it.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find it interesting that this was supposed to be a test question on an exam in 1997. The reason is that it was being passed around as an example of a Masters in Mechanical Engineering exam question when I was in Engineering school in 1979.<br />
<br />
It is a nice question and idea, but I doubt any Professor has ever asked it. I am now a Professor and certainly haven't asked it or heard of any other Professor asking it.</div></div><hr />
