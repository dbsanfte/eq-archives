<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What is the absolute easiest tradeskill to raise while using the least amount of pp?<br />
<br />
Brewing or possibly Pottery.  Both easy and cheap to raise to the 170-180 range.  Not sure beyond that.  Check out eqtraders.com to double check.  Oh fletching is pretty easy and cheap too...just not sure how long it stays that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Define easy.<br />
<br />
Brewing is cheap. I think I spent less then 500pp to get to 248. I think there is a brew barrel in Hallas where you do not have to leave the room to raise it to 248 (after you have done the water/grub combine to 122??). I think they made casks stack now which would help a LOT. <br />
<br />
The bad thing about this is that after 122?? I did hero brew. It is a 9 item combine. I had a streak of 300+ combines witout a skillup.<br />
<br />
All in all it is a few hours worth of mindles clicking.<br />

i assume you just want a grandmaster trophy for the wr bag <br />
<br />
do brewing, or jc <br />
<br />
brewing is cheaper till 250, but jc is easy with only 2 items per combine.  instead of the mini hero brew and its nine item combines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd personally say Jewelcraft is the cheapest and easiest.<br />

You can buy all the components from a vendor. Two item combines all the way to 250, and you can sell the items back losing relatively little when compared to the other tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now in terms of most cheapest and (more) useful tradeskill, baking would be my bet... make some easy enduring/miraculous meals for yourself...<br />
<br />
If you want to start making money, you'll need 250 in any skill you choose.  The easiest skill (and again more useful then fishing) to do that in would be brewing.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the carpel tunnel syndrome club!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Jewelcraft is not the cheapest, but when your requirements factor in the combination of cheapest AND easiest, it has it hands down over brewing.<br />
<br />
I have 250 skill in both, so trust me I know of what I speak. Minotaur hero brews ARE THE MOST EVIL THING IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The tradeoff usually seems to be easy vs. rewarding.  The easiest tradeskill is fishing, which ultimately allows you to...do nothing.  The best balance between &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;rewarding&quot; seems to be baking, in my opinion.  You can ALWAYS use food, and you can make some VERY nice food.  You can also farm the items you need while hunting in high end zones (like BoT or Halls Of Honor).  The skill costs next to nothing to get to 190; after that you are looking at farming components or doing the UNREAL PAIN of Halas 10lb Meat Pies to get to 226.  From 226 onward it is pretty much strictly items obtained through hunting.  I'm not aware of any store-bought-only recipes to raise your baking after 226.  Still, comapred to the hell that is pottery or blacksmithing, baking will seem a joy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If your just looking at pure pp cost brewing is going to be by far the easiest up to the gm level (ie max skill modified). It's store bought all the way up to 248. The essence combine mentioned already (water/grub) is rediculously easy. After that skull ale is cheap and easy but requires a cyclopse skull. I've frequently seen them for sale in the bazaar for 10-50pp tho. After that you have a couple options including going straight to Mino hero brews. Yes stacking casks would make things a bit easier but it's gonna be a pain.<br />
<br />
JC can actually be cheaper than brewing since it's actually possible to make a profit doing it. The catch is that you have to be an enchanter and be willing to imbue ALL your combines. For stuff up to gold this isn't too bad but once you get to plat it really starts to be a limiting factor. Since this is a shaman board I'll assume that isn't an option.<br />
<br />
Pottery is relatively cheap and can be store bought up to 199 but past that it stops being cheap. It is possible to make money skilling up if you can take time to sell all your combines in the bazaar. Personally I did upto 230 on stuff i just threw away. After that I started doing star ruby steins and golden idols of tunare and have gotten up to 241 skill now and made a profit doing it. But you won't get threw quickly since you may take several days or more to sell the results from one batch of steins or idols.<br />
<br />
You don't say why your looking to do a tradeskill but if your just looking to make a trophy for a bag just save yourself sometime and buy a tink bag or a halfling bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you just want a GM bag, do alchemy.  It is going to cost about what?  10k to get to 200?  It isn't overly expensive, and the combines are all 2 or 3 ingredients.  On top of that, you do not even need to move.  Park yourself in front of the alchemy vendor with a lot of PP and you can get to 200 in a few hours.<br />
<br />
Completely storebought ingredients, low number of items per combine, fairly cheap.  On top of that, it is unique to your class and can be handy at times, despite what many people on these boards say.  It might not be the best ability in the game, but it is still a tool that no other class gets.<br />
<br />
In your original post, though, you did not say how high you wanted to raise the skill.  I got fletching to 188 in like 4 hours, and the pp cost was so low I didn't even notice it.  There is a hut in FV where everything is sold, and you can buy it without moving.<br />
<br />
JC takes about 2-3k to get to the 180ish range, if I recall correctly from my shawl quest.  It is very easy to get to that point, but starts to get more expensive from there.<br />
<br />
As for brewing... It has been said many times in this thread already, but minotaur hero brews really suck.  I bought enough materials for 300 combines, did the combines, and my skill only went form 188-191.  After that, I just said screw it, drank it all, and gave up.  9 component combines really really suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Brewing in three (somewhat easy) steps:<br />
<br />
1.  Go to POK.  Purchase a bunch of fishing grubs off Caden, the gnome near the halfling bank.  Then purchase an equal amount of water -- can be purchased right by the brew barrels.  Combine 1 fishing grub plus 1 flask water in the brew barrel, makes fetid essence.  Trivial level:  122.<br />
<br />
2.  Go to EFP, there is a building near the forge that sells elven wine, gnomish spirits, dwarven ale, and mead.  Purchase a stack of each of these, plus a stack of casks, and use the brew barrel right nearby to combine one of each of these to make Faydwer shakers.  Trivial level: 188.  (I prefer this spot if you're not KOS because everything is sooo convenient!)<br />
<br />
3.  Pick any town that has standard brewing supplies.  You're making minotaur hero brews now -- each attempt takes 3 malt, 1 yeast, 2 flasks water, 2 short beers and a cask.  Trivial level:  248.  Since casks stack now, these aren't so bad -- people whine a lot about making these but they obviously haven't done high end smithing or tailoring!<br />
<br />
If you have decent wisdom, you should be able to knock out 248 brewing in an afternoon, for a fraction of the cost you'd spend on *any* other trade skill (except for maybe baking, if you foraged all your ingredients).  And you don't have to farm/forage/kill a darn thing, this is by far the easiest skill to GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Agreed with the brewing sucks =P  First skill I gm'd.  Still, for the money, you can't beat the cheapness.<br />
<br />
Baking is really good too, but you have to do mostly farming of stuff.  If you skillup from 200 to 226 doing HMP's, and 226 to 250 doing MTP's, you WILL make money (a good bit of it) by selling everything off (it'll take a month or 2).  2nd skill I gm'd.<br />
<br />
Pottery isn't bad to 199, but sucks from there.  I'm up to 230 now, and it's getting pretty expensive.  You can do a lot of vendor only combines (with an enchanter to enchant), but it'll cost you.<br />
<br />
JC is easy, all storebought, small trivial increases, so you succeed more often.  AFAIK, there are no gaps in the trivials for jc &gt; 5 points.  This will be #4 for me.<br />
<br />
Fletching is cake to 200, you probably won't even notice any cash spent.  From 200 - 250, it's probably more expensive than the previous 4 combined.  I'll be working on this after JC.<br />
<br />
Smithing - Don't even think about it.  A rough estimate at doing 188 - 250 on storebought combines is about 300k.  Farming stuff reduces cost, but it's mind-numbingly boring, and a lot of the things you need are rare.  Got mine to 180 before the nerf, and have only gotten to 183 since then.  And up till 188 is easy.<br />
<br />
Tailoring - Ditto.  You could blow 500k plat going from 158 to 250 on tailoring with ease.  Farming stuff reduces the cost, but a lot of it is stupidly rare drops.  Sitting at 175 now, and trying to find anything to occupy my time so I don't have to work on it =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy (as defined by me) - least amount components, least farming, and least subcombines.<br />
<br />
I would like to work at a GM level in at least just one.  A distraction from the grind.  I have about 45 in baking right now and 56 in tailoring.  I don't want to go the fletching, tailoring, or smithing route, that I know.  I am just going to get tailoring to about 100.<br />
<br />
So far it sounds like brewing is the cheapest while jc is the easiest with it being all store bought and only 2 components.<br />
<br />
Also how does the picture change when you take into consideration the items you can sell at a higher level to recoup some of your costs?<br />
<br />
Also someone mentioned getting alchemy to 200.  Is that when it is considered GM level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Alchemy maxes at 200, at level 64. It's level based, so I wouldn't recommend it to you as your skill of choice. You only can raise it 5 points per level from level 25, until level 64 when you can max it out at 200.<br />
<br />
For alchemy:<br />
Max skill = (level - 24) * 5<br />
<br />
I'd go with what most people say, and suggest brewing. Mino hero brews are cheap and straightforward, but get painful after a while. Whoever thought of 9 item combines ought to be sat down and made to get to 250 brewing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have found that if you have an enchanter enchant all your combines, then vendors are a little nicer to you, really helps with me trying to build up JC for my shawl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless things have changed dramatically very recently, it was a lot more expensive than that for me to get it to 189 so far, seems like I last blew 3-5k just getting around the last 10-15 points, estimating it would be another 3-5k to max it at 200.  I know I blew 10k several times before raising up the skill at lower levels (and that was after they halved the ingredient prices).<br />
<br />
Im glad Ive done it so far and will eventually get it maxed at 200, just dont think you can do it for anything close to 10k, you go through a lot of stat potions (and other worthless potions) to raise and I doubt you could sell them for what they cost to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JC.  No question.  It requires PoP farming to make profitable stuff, and the markets are hideously depressed now, but they exist.  <br />
<br />
Brewing has 1 salable component (planar blood brew) and 3 maybes (grobb meat, qeynos tea and kaladim constitutionals) - you can sell them but margins are heinous, undercutters are everywhere and since you can get to 250 easily and the components are storebought there's no barrier to entry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Easy (as defined by me) - least amount components, least farming, and least subcombines.<br />
<br />
I would say Baking is the easiest and cheapest, and most useful if you aren't looking to make a lot of money out of this.<br />
<br />
Easiest route (imo)<br />
Bear sandwich - Bear meat, bread (Trivial 41)<br />
Beer braised bear - bear meat, short beer, spices (Trivial 68)<br />
Fillet of Bear/Lion - Bear/Lion meat, filleting knife (Trivial 143) Make equal portions of each, keep for later.<br />
Bear/Lion fillet in cream - bear/lion fillet, creamy fennel sauce (Trivial 152) Keep for later.<br />
<br />
From here I'd recommend buying Centi Meat/Toes or Gnoll Parts from NPC vendors or players in Bazaar.  These will take you to 188 (191 on Gnoll).<br />
<br />
Now go back and get all those Fillets in Cream you made skilling up on, go get a few Mammoth/Wolf meats and make Fillets in Cream (each meat makes 10) and make some Halas 10 lb Meat Pies (226 Trivial)<br />
<br />
Misty thicket picnic baskets till 250.<br />
<br />
With the new share bank slots it is much easier to do MTP's, just make up a bunch of the sub combines and store them on mules and move as needed.  The sub items multiply in yields very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Board crash seems to have eaten my reply but JC is the last thing I would do if you want to make money. A normal player just can't compeate with a JCM enchanter. Any usable JC is going to require some access to an enchanter in some form or another to enchant metals, make mana vials and possibly imbue diamonds.<br />
<br />
Brewing and baking at least have constant resale since people consume food and there's no real advantage for anyone other than a small one for foragers but most foraged items are redily availble in the bazaar pretty cheap. Not gonna make alot per item with baking or brewing but it can add up over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">aruman, do we play the same game?<br />
<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
I went from 200 to 250 in JC for about 1.2k, and in oh.... an hour and a half or so.<br />
<br />
Brewing is cheap, but no way is it easy. The heck with 9 component combines... way too many clicks.</div></div><hr />
