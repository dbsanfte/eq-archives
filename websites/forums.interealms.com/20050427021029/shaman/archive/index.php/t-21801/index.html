<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shammy is lvl 52, and her Alchemy skill is maxxed according to her lvl. I tend to dual box with my 53 monk when I go places. Where do I go for the fastest lvling? Currently they are in Dulak.<br />
I have kids so LDON is highly unlikely.</div></div><hr />

You might want to post this in the hunting grounds forum...<br />
<br />
At level 51/52 range, I'd say either hunt in tier 1 POP zones if you can get a group, or if you just want to duel comp, go to Kunark dungeons or Velious to work on faction and xp at the same time.<br />
<br />
My 52 bard is currently rocking Natimbi for xp, but I'm doing charm tricks. Since you have slow, you can probably suvive there. The mobs have fairly high dps, but have low hps compared to some other zones.<br />
<br />
If you can, look into doing LDON. I've never done ldon with anything but my level 61+ characters, but I hear my guildmates raving about doing ldon for xp with their sup 50 characters.<br />

The only issue over tier one zones are,  hardly anyone invites me when Im there.  As much as i like the idea of Tier one zones, its hard to get groups there period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always say this. I really liked Velks. I think this place gives better exp then tier 1 pop. Dulak is ok. I think they nerfed the drop rate for gems though. I believe City of mist is the hot spot for that lvl too, you can get your epic pieces too.</div></div><hr />
