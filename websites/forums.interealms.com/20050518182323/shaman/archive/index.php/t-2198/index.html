<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went down and soloed Taskmaster Vezhkah and ill be the first to admit I cheated.  I had a mag focus ring, Aego and Koa.  Also one of the observers cast a damge shield on for 56 sec b4 i clicked it off.<br />
<br />
But I never got below 1.5k or so and I was using pox to kill it faster so Im pretty sure I can kill it without Aego or Koa.  And the mag ring doesnt really matter much already have quickbuff 3 so torpor pretty easy to channel thru.<br />
<br />
Ill start round 2 tomrrow and see how it is real deal no non shaman buffs or mage focus junk but Im fairly confident a shaman can take this guy straight up.<br />
<br />
Fight only took about 22 min and the dude hits for 410 max, I tried b4 with just epic and pet and I got it to about 30 percent in about 22 min, b4 my guildies got bored and waxed him heh.<br />
<br />
Also after tanking this guy, thou I was skeptical about that shaman who said he soled Seblite Protector at first, I fully beilive that Protector is soloable and that he did in fact kill it now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see how damage shields are cheating when you could in theory stack Aegis of Bathezid, Damage shield potion and Brambleskin all by yourself for a 59 pt damage shield.</div></div><hr />
