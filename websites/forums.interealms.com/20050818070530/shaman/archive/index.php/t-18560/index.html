Look up our slow spells, (drowsy, tagar's, togor's, and turgur's).  They enable us to help our own.  And if mob can't be rooted, it probably can't be snared either.  <br />
<br />
There are lots of ways now to get around not having sow.  There's sow potions, jboots (clickable sow), and the aa run3.  Don't let that hold you back from the necro community :) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Small thing... if a mob is immune to changes in speed, that means both root and snare.  If root breaks, its typically easier for a chain class to reroot than if a snare breaks a robe class resnaring.</div></div><hr />

It's taken you, what, a week to figure out which class you'd rather play? Time you could have spent trying each one and seeing what you liked better...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shamans get this wonderful ability called SLOW.  Slow actually slows time itself to 25% of its normal rate, so if root breaks you have 4X as long to recast root, and it takes the mob 4X as long to reach you than if it wasn't slowed.  This is definately a much better ability than snare.<br />
<br />
btw, that was sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Shamans do not need snare.  If a mob becomes unrooted, we can do one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) run away until we have enough distance to recast root.  This is easier for us than a necro because we have sow.<br />
<br />
2) just let the mob hit you a few times and channel a root, then back up.  This is easy for a shaman to do, since we mitigate damage much better than a robed caster, and the mob is SLOWED (see above).<br />
<br />
Another thing you can do is just stand far enough away from the mob that you have enough time to cast root before it reaches you.<br />
<br />
One final thing of note:  All but our highest dots break root due to a DD component, so root isn't a very viable way of soloing.  I am assuming that you are primarily interested in soloing?  If I am correct, then you should pick necro because they have all the tools you will need to do it well from level 1 to 65.  About the sow thing, in another thread you were asking about some of the more expensive horses, so I am guessing you have a bit of plat.  If that is the case, you can easily afford mass quantities of sow potions (1k will buy you enough sow potions to keep yourself sowed for 3 days straight).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a note, jboots are more like clickable rs3, being 35% (rs3 being 30% I believe or 33% I can't remember), whereas SoW is 55% max (at lvl 50). <br />
<br />
/shrug jboots are ok, but my alts level fast enough usually that its a waste of time to camp AC to do the mq. I just give them bottled sow and get rs3 at 51 asap.</div></div><hr />

Really though don't start a shaman if you just want sow, start a druid if you want sow and snare, we are meant to take a beating. <br />

I have nothing against necro's I love necro's. I think having a necro and a shaman in a group is pretty powerfull..</div></div><hr />

News to me.  I guess I'd better give back a few levels.<br />
<br />
The non-DD dots sure are CONVENIENT, but so is KEI - convenient, but not required.  I soloed golems in PoV with no snare and no DD-less dots except my epic.  Sure, it broke root, but I just stood at extreme distance and, if necessary, took a round or two of hits.</div></div><hr />

I think the only time I worried about tanking IN TEH FACE with my shaman was when I was soloing in Elemental Planes, PoFire.  Yea, root breaks there, you can't take a round or two from the Magma's, at least I could not.  But in all honesty, I was more worried about Invis lasting long enough to run to my solo spot.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Any shaman worth their salt (or maybe herbs considering the class) isn't afraid to have root break (unless the mob can kill you in a round or two). It IS why we have defense at 200 (if you don't have defense at 200 by 50, you're not working hard enough). It IS why we are chain class. It IS why we have defense AA's. All because we do get hit &amp; shouldn't whine about it (unless the group we're with is a bunch of pansies and we're going to die because of it). I have purposefully 3x Slowed mobs to get agro off casters and onto me, so being scared root is breaking is nothing big. We're not Enchanters who can die even quicker than rangers if their mezz breaks and they can't remezz fast enough, we're shaman. Suck it up!! :) If root breaks, reroot, don't scream like a ranger!! If you were SMART to begin with, after the first root you slowed it, so some pansie mob breaking root and coming after you with a vengeance isn't that scarey anyways. So what we don't get snare...it's for wussies!! We take a hit and keep on ticking! We're better than Timex even!</div></div><hr />

You know what he meant it is completely inefficient to reroot mobs constantly after almost every redot. Specially with the dots you are using must take you a long time to kill a pov golem.. I don't mean to be rude but with what you are saying sounds like 20+ minutes a kill for 7% xp.. that's not viable to me.</div></div><hr />

And Dam, I though root was to be used to turn the mob on me so the rogue can kill it for me  :D Guess I be the crazy shaman.  If it can be slowed it be dead.  If not well just take me little longer.  <br />
<br />
*Note: And yes for those mobs that one round you well heck we can not have all the fun. And some us shaman have snare just easier to just make sure they dont break root.</div></div><hr />

I have NO idea what you are talking about.  Using Epic DoT, Bane of Nife, and Pox of Bertox, I killed POV golems in about 7-8 minutes at 62-63.  Typically when the first slow wore off they were in flee mode or close to it.   Add a minute or two afterwards for med time and it's still 8-10 minutes for 7% AAXP, which wasn't bad at the time.<br />
<br />
Sure, root broke, but like I said, apply the dot from max cast range and you can run and reroot before they catch up to you most times.  And if not... stand and tank until you channel a root, Torpor afterwards.<br />
<br />
As far as root being inefficient... HUH?  I'm using the level 14 root at a cost of 30 mana.  Who cares how often you refresh a 30-mana spell?<br />
<br />
Nowadays at 65 with Blood of Saryrn, Breath of Ultor, Canni 5, Quiescence... I'll add in a Pox of Bertoxx, Ancient: Scourge of Nife and/or Bane of Nife if I get in a hurry, regardless of the root breaks.  I can kill one in about 5 minutes and end at 80+ mana, for an AA about every 1:30.  This is still better solo experience than anywhere else that I know of pre-elemental.</div></div><hr />

Start a Troll, put all points into WIS, then get your WIS to 255  with twink gear. Make sure to keep your HP and AC low in favor of WIS, since you don't need root anymore! Then get the snare necklace, so you can DD Kite, and say &quot;I am the BIG GREEN DRUID! I AM PRETTY!&quot;</div></div><hr />
