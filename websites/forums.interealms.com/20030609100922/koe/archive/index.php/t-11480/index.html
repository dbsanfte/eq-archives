Just an FYI, I'm a 56 druid that LOVES to mass kill.  If you've got a pressing need for a tradeskill item and don't wanna pay fer it in bazaar, I'm open to help.  All you gotta do is run around, gather up all the mobs ya need, bring them to me and I can kill them all with a spell, maybe two  :D   Hughhill and I went to Owlbear city in hollowshade a couple weeks ago and mass farmed.  He'd bring them and I'd AE them.  So far, my record is 102 mobs killed in one pull  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey I'd love to come down and mass kill with yah you I need smithing stuff because I wanna get my smithing up and Twilight Sea is the bomb for that. I'd love to hook up and xp some time, I don't duo with druids much. I also plan on k33lin rockhoppers because I need to get tailoring drops to get my tailoring up high enough for the coldain shawls. So let's hook up sime time, mass keelin/xp/having fun.<br />

WOOTAGE! I think you have me beat -- I love Scintillation - 630 DMG, point-blank AoE, unlimited targets, but I can't get enough aggro to come close to 102 at a pop. 49 Fire and I had a field day in the Warrens, killing 400 to 600 Kobold an hour and we occasionally still terrorize the Commonlands looking for cat and bear pelts. Just got Dyzil's Deafening Decoy and have to see if I can come close to that amazing number. <br />

Hmmm... <br />
...wish I was a Wizzy -- Gravity Flux cracks me up when I see a huge pile of gobbies falling out of the sky.<br />

 <br />
I'll look you up next time I'm on for a bit Sorathis, and I also would like paineel faction.  was trying to do mass kobolds  on my own, but 22 was my limit, otherwise i'd get hit too much to get the spell off, that's why i prefer a tank of some sort come along to be the decoy and gather while i med and rub my hands together in a schemeing way....<br />
 <br />
Also, rockhoppers were dark blue at 51ish, I don't have an AE that can mass kill them....YET... :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey could you by any chance collect-a-nuke some Greyhoppers for me? Greyhopper Hides will get my tailoring all the way up to 95. Low Quality Hopper Hides which also drops off of them can be used for leather padding for my smithing. These are the weenie level like 25-30 mobs in Merus Seru, should be able to mass kill em pretty easy. If you need me to do the pulling and collect, I can take the hits while you nuke em.</div></div><hr />
