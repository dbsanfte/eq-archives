<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just vaguely thinking of it at this stage.<br />
<br />
Both monk and sham are level 54 and intention would be to PL 3rd character...(with sham)<br />
<br />
Currently leaning towards necro or mage as want someting that does not need too much extra effort or gear but has additional skills (eg. decent pet tank). BL possibly but overlap sham maybe too much...<br />
<br />
Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'd vote paladin.<br />
<br />
1) keeps aggro so shm doesnt get beat, and monk gets backside damage, avoiding ripostes etc<br />
<br />
2) helps with healing<br />
<br />
3) interupts chealers !<br />
<br />
4) unique buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Valgoth may have a better perspective, but even with a Mage your Monk is going to tank better.<br />
<br />
You need the other class to bring something to the table you don't have.<br />
<br />
And that's group escapability, snare and nukes.<br />
<br />
Wizard or dr00d.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really have no opinion on &quot;which is better&quot;. I just play what's fun for me at the time.<br />
  Never cared for full casters, so mage is out.<br />
  Played a Paladin a long time ago, retired him, (sort of like walking through a field of dog poop, once you get through to the other side and get all the poop scraped off your shoes, you don't turn around and walk back through it :)), so won't be playing one of those again.<br />
  LOVE toys, dual wield, and the ability to stay in the fray as much as I can (lotsa HP's/AC)<br />
For me it was obvious....a Warrior. When I got him up enough in levels where healing with the Shaman and Druid was no longer efficient I started my Cleric to play on my 4th box.<br />
<br />
Now, post 50 I'm seeing it take too long to kill things with the Warrior (when I'm 4 boxing), so unless my wife starts playing more I'll relocate her machine and start playing her Rogue along side my others. :)<br />
<br />
Granted, I'm sort of in a mini burn out stage again (exp grinding Cleric from level 1 to 45 in 3 days played), so that won't happen until I really start playing again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally, I'd say Paladin or SK before the Healing Agro Nerf<br />
<br />
With pally having a slight edge.  The idea being get a better tank<br />
and shaman can handle heals and slows.  <br />
<br />
With new agro, that might be touchy.  Not sure in tier2+ shaman wouldnt get agro from healing alone after slow.  So you might want a 2nd healer.    In which case Id say druid.<br />
<br />
Go one of two ways basically.<br />
a) Get better tank<br />
b) resign the fact the monk is the tank, and get a 2nd healer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no chance in hell a monk can hold aggro over a shaman. maybe if the shaman never heals or dots after slow. go with a paladin, thats the backup healer, aggro control and tank. at 65, paladins heal SO much better than shaman its sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno, I group with monks all the time, now and in the past that can hold agro off me.   I may slow and take a single round, but they get it right back.   Poison dots, same story but usually np.<br />
<br />
Paladin is a good choice, but I think ranger, druid, wizard are worth looking into as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 54 if the shaman throws in a poison dot he gets and keeps aggro. So the usual tactic is to slow &amp; JBB (maybe disease dot too) and buff/heal monk as needed. Neither has epic and most likely never will (unguilded).<br />
<br />
Paladin sounds a good choice but I'm not convinced a 3rd box is worth the extra time and money. (ie. 2nd box was great but is 3rd box also great or just slightly better?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If I would go for a 3rd char with a shaman and a monk to tri-box, I would say another pure caster if you want minimal management.  Running 2 tanks is just too busy.  You will want to keep both positioned and manage agro so you'll have to heal only one char.  That being said, I would go for a necro.  Just hotkey /pet attack, dot1, dot2, then sit.. Necros get rez and summon corpse as well so going to a dungeon will not be too risky.  Necro if you want minimal management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Paladin or SK... what they bring to the party is much more valuable than any other class I can think of.  Personally I 2-Box a monk with my shaman and a Paladin friend joins a lot... works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since many of the best exp areas are in dungons...<br />
I have to say SK, mainly for snare, and secondly for ability to tank well, keep agro.<br />
<br />
With 2 classes that can FD...even while playin 3 there is only 1 that has to run for zone if things go bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With a monk and shaman 3rd member should be either a snarer or a chanter.  My personal choice would be chanter because charm is the best spell by far in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong.  I 3-box PoS giants and I can Malo, Turgur, Insideous Decay, Breath of U, Pox of B and Epic all within 1 min of the giant being in camp. <br />
<br />
I never pull aggro on my shaman bot doing this.<br />
<br />
I'm a monk.</div></div><hr />
