<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the success rate for a level 55 Shaman to land Malosi / Turgur's in Tier 2 zones?  (PoV / PoS)<br />
<br />
What about if the mobs are enchanter magic resist debuffed first (let's say Wind of Tashanian (reduce MR by 40))?<br />
<br />
I think my boyfriend (64 Ranger) thinks I can do anything.  LOL  I just think it will not go well.  :D  I like to have as much information up front as possible.<br />
<br />
As always, thank you for the comments.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went to storms at 56 with a guild group and prior to heading up there (I was the only shaman) we talked about slows and the prospect of it being too much for me. The group decided to give it a shot and our backup plan was to head to pon to grind if that failed (Nice of them as they are all high 60's and I was 56).<br />
<br />
Anyway, we hit the desert in storms and started picking off trash (storms/cacti/snakes/etc.) and were really surprised that it became a damn good grind session. I would malosi on incoming and slow. Most times it hit first time, max amount of attempts was 3 (hit on the third attempt).<br />
<br />
One thing to be ready for is that you will be summoned. The sickening crunch still makes my stomach drop, particularly when you look and see 500hp gone in one melee round, but it just makes life interesting.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun. It doesn't hurt to try, although I wouldn't recommend starting on the giants, they might not take too kindly to your efforts. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoV/PoS are ok as long as you avoid PoStorms giants, you'll need to place more emphasis on using and landing Malosi before slowing though, a resist followed by agro at your level will very likely be fatal.<br />
<br />
You won't be as efficient as a 60+ shaman with malosini/malo, but you'll get the job done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I first went to Storms at 55, duoing with a 65 mage. She'd hit them with Malosinia (70pt debuf) and my slow was never resisted.<br />
<br />
If, as you hint, Tash is available, hit them with that first. I don't know if you will need Maolsi after that, but it usually has no trouble landing after Tash. I've almost never had slow resisted after landing Malosi (in tier 2).<br />
<br />
At 57, the Golelms in the wasteland of Valor seldom resisted my slow after the enchanter hit them with Tash. I only used Malosi if slow was resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Storms mobs are in general a bit lower level (more 55-60 than 60+), excepting the giant camps.  You'd have a reasonable chance there.  In PoV most all mobs are 61 - 63, and your chances of slowing those w/ just tash is gonna be ... interesting =)  I'd make sure to land malosi before trying to slow in PoV, especially if you're out in the wastes without a really good agro tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The thing to remember is...<br />
<br />
   THERE IS A GRAVEYARD.  THERE IS NO NEED TO TRAIN ANYONE.<br />
<br />
You'll do ok and get great experience up until the first wipe, then spend time recovering and do great again.  If you have a smart group with some high levels you will probably do much better than in the Tier 1 zones.  An all-50's group or a dumb one will lose more XP to CR's than it's worth.<br />
<br />
Definately Malosi everything before you attempt slow.  Malosi has much lower aggro than slow.  Your BF probably has ranger epics, which means he can get a procc'd slow in there to tide you over until you can land yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you have a chanter there, he can also help out with slows so I think it would be doable.  If you don't have someone to debuff, bring a sturdy tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since they changed the entry requirements to get into some of the tier 2 places, most folks insist on inviting higher level folks to their groups. Getting a group even at 63 was a pain. Resists hurt... alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If theres a high lvl enc then why not let them slow /shrug<br />
<br />
55-59 is a tad low for that zone think you should go to pov castle the xp would be better for you there anway</div></div><hr />
