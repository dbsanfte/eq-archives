<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does the shaman usually haste in an experience group with a bard but no chanter?  From poking around the bard sites, it seems their main group haste does not stack with shaman/chanter haste, and does not reach 45% (i.e., better than alacrity) until the Bard is level 54.  So is it the custom for the shaman to haste unless the bard is 54 or over?<br />
<br />
The bard seems to have some stackable hastes (+15%) which they could also add on top of ours, but the question is who does the main haste normally.<br />
<br />
Would be interested to hear from folks who have grouped with Bards alot; I haven't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, bard haste does not really stack with ench/shaman haste. The icons do stack, but bard haste songs also have other components, like str/dex/agi. The stat part stacks, but I don't think the haste part does. If you cast haste, then the bard plays haste song, they will stack. But if haste song is up, usually your haste won't take hold over it. I think bard haste is better. So, I'd have the bard play haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually jing, if you cast haste after a bard has haste song up, it'll still stick. they never stack tho.<br />
<br />
never.<br />
<br />
just the icons stack really, the highest haste gets used, and the stat buffs from the bard song</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only exception is the Epic and that is not in our case..<br />
<br />
Every time I get a request for haste with a Bladin' Bard I just laugh and tell them to give the Bard a dex buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
I LUFF bards.. makes my job SO much easier..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bards highest haste song is 45%, so it all depends on how much mana you got to justify hasting a group for the 5% haste.<br />
<br />
If the bard has epic, then his haste is 55% and you can unmem yours. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if the bards pretone skill raises their haste song %, I know it does not effect their slows and a few other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: sorry was thinking in level 60 mind. With Celerity being 50% haste cast by shaman.<br />
<br />
At 51, in a full group, I would haste, still though, if mana was some what low, easier for the bard to twist in a haste song and let you heal and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what I understand the high level Luclin bard songs, such as Warsong of the Vah Shir do stack with our haste, supposedly  these songs even allow you to exceed the haste cap.  Other songs, such as villia's chorus of celerity, don't even though you can get 2 icons up if you celerity the player without the bard yet singing his haste song.  If the bard has epic though, there is definitely no need to haste, as our haste spells don't stack with the haste from the epic proc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if bard has epic then let them haste, otherwise yours is better (im pretty sure)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even if shaman haste (alacrity in my case) is a few % better than the bard song, it's an annoying buff o maintain due to the very short duration. So whenever I'm grouped with my bard friend, I ask her to sing haste. We usually have a melee heavy group (4 melees, bard, shaman sometimes) so buffing them all is enough work anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like our haste are nearly egal ,i prefer to haste ,because they can play another song instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will buff haste unless the bard has their epic.  I refuse to haste with an epic bard, its too much of a pain in the ass.  Other than that, I prefer to use Celerity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">there are two luclin songs that stack with spell haste. They can use either of those when a shaman or chanter is giving melee haste. *according to Verant* those two spells bard songs let you exceed the melee haste cap. <br />
<br />
As to whether I haste with a bard in the group it depends on if I am the only healer in group or not. Also as a few have posted there isn't a point hasting with an epic bard - just make sure your bard has hos or focus to help proc it. The less stuff they &quot;have&quot; to twist the more options they have for enhancing your party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i don't know if i get your point here.this question seems to me equal to &quot;do you sow your bard?their selo's don't stack with sow&quot;<br />
<br />
same ans. to this question i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My experience with bard hasting comes from grouping with one as my Paladin. I was trying to decide whether to use my self-only haste (25%) or the bard song haste (30%). I opted to go for the bard haste and save myself some mana. <br />
<br />
This was great for the majority of the fighting. Unfortunately, I found that on a bad pull, when you really wanted the haste, the bard would be busy with crowd control and you would be left without haste.<br />
<br />
So, if the bard is expected to be doing crowd control, I would recommend casting your haste on the tanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bards have 4 haste stacking songs that will stack with other spell/song/icon hastes:<br />
<br />
Melody of Ervaj - level 50, 5% Haste<br />
<br />
Battlecry of the Vah Shir - level 52, 15% stacking haste (increases haste cap)<br />
<br />
Composition of Ervaj - level 60, 10% Haste; 17 AC<br />
<br />
Warsong of the Vah Shir - level 60, 25% stacking haste (increases haste cap)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What I was seeking in my original post is whether there is a &quot;customary rule&quot; that players are expected to know without discussing it--like when a chanter joins the group, the shaman stops being responsible for hastes.  Or that the shaman will slow the mob, not the chanter.  Or that if you have a cleric, they will cover AC buffs rather than the shaman.  One of the cool things about grouping at later levels is that players are expected to know these things without any discussion of their roles.<br />
<br />
What I am getting from these responses is that there is no &quot;customary&quot; rule re whether bard or shaman should haste in typical group setting with no chanter, unless the bard has epic in which case bard definitely hastes.  Guess I need to talk to the bard about it in each situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think that is correct Roxanne.  The bards have several haste songs, some of which are better than our haste spell, and some of which stack with our haste spell.<br />
<br />
Melody of Ervaj (5%) and Composition of Ervaj (15%) stack with Any other haste, BUT they do not raise the haste cap.<br />
<br />
Luclin songs -- Battle Cry of the Vah Shir is a 15%, and Warsong of the Vah Shir is 25%.  These songs stack with any kind of haste, including the Ervag songs, and they will exceed the haste cap by the percentages given.  <br />
 <br />
Battle Cry is level 52<br />
Melody is 50<br />
Composition and Warsong are both level 60.  <br />
<br />
In the non stacking haste department, Epic proc (Dance of the Blades) is 55% haste.<br />
<br />
Non Stacking Haste Songs:  <br />
<br />
Villa's Chorus of Celerity is 45% haste -- level 54 song.  This does not stack.<br />
<br />
McVaxius's Rousing Rondo is 21% haste, but is also 41 str, 27 atk, and a 15 point damage shield (without an instrument).  This is a level 57 -- Will often be sung because of the other effects.<br />
<br />
Verses of Victory is 30% haste, 59 str, 59 agi, and 41 AC (no instrument).  This is a level 50 song. <br />
<br />
Please not that all of the haste numbers are consistant, regardless of the level of the bard.  All of the other stat benefits are those enjoyed by a level 60 Warbler, with Instrument Mastery 2 cause thats the table me roommate left out on her desk.  =P<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
You should make the call based on:<br />
<br />
1.   Your mana supply -- if you are primary healer in the group, let the bard take over all hasting duties.  <br />
<br />
2.  The ferocity of the encounters -- bear in mind that bards and shaman often work together on crowd control -- mezzing, slowing, and root parking.  But if your bard is mezzing, they are not singing haste.<br />
<br />
3.  What other songs the bard could be singing instead.  <br />
<br />
4.  The haste items worn by melee.<br />
<br />
We usually rely on the Epic proc, the bard sings Warsong to bump it up a bit, and works in Rondo if the Epic hasn't procced yet.  If she gets tied up in crowd control, after I have everything slowed, I'll sit down, mem celerity, and deliver.  <br />
<br />
In a pick-up group situation, discussing it with the bard as you go is the best plan.  Be flexible -- the answer may change based on what you expect the puller to bring back.  <br />
<br />
There is no standard rule because bards have so many songs that they have significantly more lattitude in how they play the game.<br />
