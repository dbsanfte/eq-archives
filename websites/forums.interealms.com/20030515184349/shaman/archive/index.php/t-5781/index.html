<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you need a rogue to get past the locked door.  So whenever you round up that rogue, ask them - chances are they will be able to tell you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another option is to duel a chanter to grav flux you up.  I didn't say it was a GOOD option!  But it's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, once you enter the castle area in the back of the zone you go on the back right side up a walk way.  You will come to a door that enters into a room with another door straight ahead and one on the top right side of the room.  Do not enter that door.  There is a false wall to the right of the first door you see.  This false wall will put you on the walkway which is close to the goo house with the super goo in it.  Infact to see the walk way I am talking about go on the right side of the zone next to the super goo house and look up.  You will see the walkway I am talking about.  I never noticed it until the day I went up there.  <br />
I know it sounds a little confusig but once you get in there its easy to figure out.</div></div><hr />
