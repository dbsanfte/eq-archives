<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jelro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I got some stupid questions for you experts :)<br />
<br />
I would like to start a Shaman but I really don't know which race to pick up. As everyone, I would like to be as efficient as possible, both in group and in solo, from level 1 to level 60.<br />
<br />
I understand there is 2 kind of Shaman : the Caster one (high WIS, low STR/STA) and the Fighter one (low WIS, high STR/STA).<br />
<br />
Is the low STR/STA of the Caster Shaman a handicap when soloing big mobs?<br />
<br />
Is the low WIS of the Fighter Shaman a handicap when buffing everyone in a group?<br />
<br />
I would like to play an Ogre (because they are ugly and because I never played one) but I would like to know if this choice is viable at higher levels. If not my second choice would be an Vah Shir (for the same reason) or an Iksar (because of Regen).<br />
<br />
Could you please give me some advice?<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use the search button<br />
<br />
But, you'll mostly find, play what race you want. Orge, they are rare, 2nd rarest to iksar if you ask me. Vah Shir is, sure, they are a furry barbarian. I would go for orge, that would be my choise if i started over, part for look, part for higher sta and wis then trolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In the end game race is irrelevant. Ogre is a good choice, Troll is a good choice, If you're gonna be a Barb be a female ( o Y o )<br />
Woo Ha ! Got you all in check ! <br />
<br />
Vah Shir are furry Barbs who get safe fall, sneak and eat twice as fast. No slam but they infravision<br />
Iksar are rare but are a very good choice, unless you want to use a JBB. <br />
Pick a race you think is cool............period !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogers are da best.  Period.  <br />
<br />
Only racial ability (of the shaman races) you can't get on a piece of gear is unstunnability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How 'bout a tail ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Ogers are da best. Period.  <br />
They sure are O-G-R-E-S are da best ! Dey so smart, dey smell real bad, and dem have a bad booty itch !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always rank:<br />
Ogres..we drop dead sexsy!, stun, unstunable from front(melee)<br />
Lizzie: best newbie area bar none,regen, tail, + to ac<br />
Trolls: Just after lizzie because of the damn - to FR<br />
Barbs/Kittie Kats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No shaman race is hands down better than the others. Play which race you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stormrazor: It's Oger.   It's my one concession to roleplaying.  I don't enjoy trying to riddle through entire paragraphs of misspelled words, so I don't inflict it on others. :)  Besides, we're smarter than Trolls. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing but love for my fellow Ogres, Ogurs, Ohgurs, Ogers - what ever we call ourselves :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How 'bout a tail ?<br />
Yeah, coz THATS useful.<br />
<br />
All a tail does is make you look like a little kid who's about to wet themselves with that silly squatting position.<br />
<br />
If you HAVE to have a tail make a Kitty. Who needs extra regen when you can run through North Ro without taking falling damage! Oh, and Sneak is the only other ability you can't get on gear, and can be seriously hardcore at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Who needs extra regen when you can run through North Ro without taking falling damage!  <br />
<br />
I'll take regen over safe fall any day of the week, cast levitate and there you go ...North Ro problem solved !!!! <br />
<br />
Yeah, coz THATS useful.  <br />
<br />
If you're a Kitty and haven't discovered how to USE your tail properly then I feel bad for all the Pu$$y$ walking around Shar Val. ;) <br />
<br />
Sneak sounds useful though.......<br />
Not enough to make me give up Storm, the scalypimp of Cabilis !! <br />
<br />
&quot;It's Thursday night and ain't a damn thing funny, b@tch betta have my money !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
All jokes aside, pick a race you think is cool, in the end game race is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would rate Kitty as #1 shaman race.<br />
<br />
Jbb+Sneak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll take regen over safe fall any day of the week, cast levitate and there you go ...North Ro problem solved !!!!<br />
Only if you're 51! Before that you need bat wings!<br />
<br />
I don't even know where to FIND bat wings in Kunark...!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Batwings can be found on a merchant outside of Cabilis, I believe in LOIO. I buy stacks upon stacks of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is a vendor outside the LOIO entrance that sells them, there is also a vendor outside the FOB entrance that sells them. I usually have at least 4-5 stacks of them on me at all times, seeing as how I spend most of my time in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why levitate?<br />
<br />
It'll be regened back by the time you hit the zone line.<br />
<br />
As for only racial ability you can't get with gear?<br />
<br />
/forage<br />
<br />
*flex*<br />
*tail swish*<br />
<br />
I've said it before, I'll say it now. If you have to ask, YOU ARE NOT WORTHY of being an iksar. Go make a barbarian or a cat or something.<br />
