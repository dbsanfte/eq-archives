<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 3 and loving the quests but having a heck of a time with them.  I am totally broke because I have no drop quest items and can't afford to buy a container.  I have boought no spells.  Any ideas on how to get some money AND complete my quests?  What else should I be looking to do as a lvl 3 Shammie?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Newbie lvls are really terrible balance wise when you compare it to the later lvls. Its really just a formality before you can really have some fun.<br />
<br />
Basically what you want to do is kill enough stuff and save enough money so you can buy a back pack. The backpack will let you hold more stuff while you kill for longer periods of time. Continue this process and before you know it, you might have advanced to a more interesting stage of your life. <br />
<br />
Newbie quests are really intestesting and fun to do, I always do a few when i start a new character, but really, they outright suck. Other than the fun value of being able to do a neat quest, they are not worth doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're carrying 8 no drop quest items?  What?  And more importantly, why?  Stop by the bank, and deposit them.  There you go, more room.  What race are you, where are you hunting?  You start with 2 spells, and a weapon.  You should be able to get to level 5 in an hour, without even working hard.  Kill everything you find, loot everything you kill, sell everything you loot.  Early spells are not expensive, and you can easily obtain them with the cash you get from the loot (particularly in Halas, I don't know about the rest of the Shammy noob zones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What race you are helps too... I think Everfrost is one of the best newbie zones, and you can make decent money as you go.<br />
<br />
Standard advice to newbies:<br />
Don't pester higher levels... nobody likes beggers, and some play tricks that end up getting you killed.  However, feel free to (politely) ask advice - not many mind that.<br />
<br />
Loot everything.  Sell it to merchants.<br />
<br />
If you're a barb, save up for a sewing kit and start using those ruined bear &amp; wolf pelts to make your own Patchwork armor.  Also, once you get a bit of Tailoring skill, you can make better money selling the finished armor to merchants - even over the cost of patterns.<br />
<br />
Also, watch for quests - you can usually make some good cash or get items (for your level) as rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a Vah Shir newb lvl 4 now with about 8 silver.  I have completed 2 of my newbie quests and have my shuield and cloak.  I am having trouble with my 3rd.  I can't get the brewing right for the sweetwater.  I can't afford to buiy my spells yet and I'm still using a club.  At this rate, I'll be levl 6 before I can buy 3 spells.  But I'm having fun doing the quests, though its frustrating to combine ingredienys and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Anyone know quick way to make gold in Shar Vahl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a Vah'Shir, start talking to the merchants. There are several who will give you a 4 or 6 slot container to do a quest for them in if you hand them your Acryilia Slate (the thing you got for doing the citizenship quest).<br />
<br />
That should give you a headstart on the container situation.<br />
<br />
As far as money is concerned...<br />
<br />
The newbie area down in the pit around the town is very poor in terms of cash and sellable items. I guess they figured that 99% of all Vah'Shir would be heavily twinked alts.....<br />
<br />
Shadeweaver's Thicket is a little better. Hint - the Rockhoppers drop hides. The High Quality hides can be used by a high skill tailor to make 10 slot backpacks and as such can be sold to them for a moderate amount of money (by the standards of an untwinked newbie at least). Enough to buy a few of your level 1 and/or 5 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh, tis VERY hard for a young Vah Shir to make money.  Soooo many of the drops, particularly in the &quot;pit&quot; are no drop quest items.  Things get better when you ding lv. 5 and go to Shadeweavers.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend going to www.allakhazam.com and reading up on Shadeweaver Thicket armor quests.  You can do armor quests in Shadeweavers, from lv. 5-12, that will give you a decent set of newbie armor.<br />
<br />
I might skip some of the Shaman quests in Shar Val for the moment.  I did them when I was a newbie cat but only because I had twinked my character with 300 pp.  You have to invest a good amount of pp, at least 100-150, to get your brewing and pottery up to high enough levels to get anywhere.  If you are that broke, you are better off saving your cash for spells, not brewing items.<br />
<br />
As soon as you ding lv. 8 or 9, you can hunt in the entrance to Paludal Caverns, go there!!!!!!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HQ Rockhopper hides can be sold for as much as 30pp but I suspect the price might have gone down some.  It's good to hear that you're not out there begging &quot;Plz give me lewt&quot; but there are creative and fun ways that will earn you some money or items from players.<br />
<br />
Personally, any time I find someone who is an honest newbie to the game, I usually send them on some personal quests for me and reward them for their time.  My usual offer is I'll buy their first 5 levels worth of spells.  Try /auctioning in the zone a personal assistant for hire.  Offer to run errands for them.  Be creative and roleplay it up a bit.  I don't know what drops in the area but in Everfrost I got my skill up in tailoring by making silk threads &amp; silk swatches.  There have been a number of times I've heard people hiring newbies to just simply do the tedium of combining silk into swatches.  If there are enough supplies around to get your skill into the low 20s for tailoring, blacksmithing or anything similar, try to raise them up and offer your services.  When I was working on blacksmithing I would of loved to pay someone else to keep me supplied in metal bits while I was doing harder combines.<br />
<br />
These are just some suggestions on how you can help other players and in turn, they can help you with either cash, equipment and in-game tips.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can relate to the money problem when starting as a cat.<br />
<br />
Currently lvl 15, and I have only two lvl 14 spells, and maybe 3 of my lvl 9 spells.<br />
<br />
The loot (as far as I have seen) in this area is either worthless or NO DROP. The quest items are also NO DROP. Meaning that a lot of the loot is worthless (money wise). There is also not enough higher lvl players to sell bone, silk and pelts, wich is how I suported myself as a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Beeing a none twink in this area is HARD. Add to this the good xp in the caves, and you outlevel your money REAL quick.<br />
<br />
I don't know what I would have done if I didn't manage to sell a HQ pelt for 30pp. I would still be using my lvl 5 spells at lvl 15.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At level 3 you should probably be able to do the whiptail poison gland quest.  Kill all the whiptail scorpions you can find in the pit and loot the poison glands (they are no drop and not stackable).  Then take them to Spiritist Ragnar in the building beside the bank with the candle on it.  Turn them in for some coin and padded armor.  If you get armor you don't need, sell it.  This is how I got money to buy all my 1-9 spells.  Not hard at all, just takes a little time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thx for the great info!   too bad I destroyed two scorpion sacks to make place for the rockhopper hides, doh!  I'm going to do the whiptail scorps and then maybe the garbage quest for the sack.  Question: should I do the frost claw quest, keepp using my club or buy a better weapon?<br />
<br />
Asegai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well the frost claw quest gets you a shield as far as I know.  I'd definitely wait to buy a better weapon until you have some spells.   I got a full set of padded armor, the friendship ring, the Dharr's lure, and all my 1-5 spells, then I moved over to the thicket.  I would definitely do the garbage collector quest if you don't have a bag, though, it's really easy.<br />
<br />
There's a quest for a better weapon, but I'm not sure it is activated.  I haven't done it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">have you tried fishing?<br />
<br />
fishing baitsells for coppers<br />
fishing rod sells for 2 gold<br />
<br />
fish sells for silver(remember to sell everything you pull out of you water)<br />
<br />
by a rod as soon as you have over 2 gold and buy as much bait as you can and then fish fish fish<br />
As your fishing skill gets better you will be catching fish more and more and making more coin.<br />
<br />
If you put the time into fishing at your level you will be able to buy all of your sells and it's also a very cheap way to get food too.<br />
<br />
later on in your levels when mobs are droping plat you can start working on baking and start making food with your fish :)<br />
<br />
or just keep eating them raw<br />
<br />
and jez stop stilling your beer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There seems to be a fair amount of good quests in the area (still don't understand how you get the money though since most quest rewards are no drop). My problem with them is that the drops needed are usually so rare that you end up hunting greens to get the drops. The armor quests (don't remember name, but armor gives added hp) is in the wrong order too. When you have managed to do the second piece, the third piece is from green mobs. I have only done a few quests (5-10), but I have yest to receive anything worth money. Some of them have actually lost me some money :(<br />
<br />
It is a great place for xp though. 1-4 in pit. 4-9 in thicket (doing armor quests) and 9+ in Paludar(sp?) caves. The good xp only adds to my frustration about the money though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No Drop quest items?  That's a little rare at that level....  As for containers, you can start quests that you don't intend to finish, but have bags associated with it (such as goblin beads).  Quests aren't the end-all for a young shammy, so don't waste your time with them unless you're sure the reward is worth it.  Such as, many mid-level shammy's spends weeks getting their Totemic Armor done, only to realise that most of it's crap.  The only piece that I ever even cared to wear was the helm.<br />
<br />
At the level that you need to be for most of our low to mid level quests, you can get better armor/weaps elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">final:<br />
No Drop quest items are extremely common in the area he is talking about:  ie the pit under Shar Vhal.  And Shadeweavers Thicket has tons as well.<br />
<br />
many mid-level shammy's spends weeks getting their Totemic Armor done, only to realise that most of it's crap.<br />
true, but many mid-level shamans spend weeks getting their Totemic Armor done, only to be extremly happy that they quested for it, instead of buying Rygorr (which they could never camp/loot at their level) at the local BazaarMart.  <br />
<br />
True Crap armor for the amount of work required:  Hate armor and Thurgadin Quest armor.  That's the crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whiptail poison gland quest is the one that is the moneymaker (well, moneymaker for that level).  The poison glands are no drop, but the padded armor you get is droppable.  It isn't great armor, but it sells for 1-5 gold depending on your faction (and your faction goes up fast donig this quest also).  That's how I made the money for all my spells.  As far as killing greens for quest drops...heh, get used to it:(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm lvl 5 now with 10 gold and a bag!  The whiptail/armor quest is the best!  I am now trying to decid what to do next and what spells to buy.  I am thinking that sicken is the most important, but I don't see it at the vendor.  Is it not where the trainers are?  I plan to farm whiptails for a little then go to the thicket and do the claw quest or the garbage one, or the armor quest there.  Thx for all the great info.<br />
