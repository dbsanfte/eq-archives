<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for an effective strategy on raids to split up the duties of our debuff classes.  Primarily on raids where we pull multiple targets continually.<br />
<br />
Method 1:  Each shaman is assigned one spell. One on slow, one on malos, etc..  I have found that I really despise that method.  The cast times on Malos and Turgurs are long, and if 6 mobs come into camp, the one shaman on slow is just sitting their waiting for it to refresh. <br />
<br />
Method 2:  Each shaman picks a target at random and full debuffs it himself.  This seems to be what most raids end up like.  Works ok sometimes, but often, we'll pick the same target, and precious time is wasted.<br />
<br />
Method 3:  (never tried it, but am thinking about it).  Debuffers are assigned to tanks.  The tanks need to figure out who is responsible for offtanking.   Two shaman are for MA/SA, then each addition bst, shaman, or enc is assigned to an offtank.  These people have three assist keys.  If their third assist has a mob, they debuff that mob first, then backup the shaman supporting the ma/sa.<br />
<br />
I don't know.  I think 3 would work well, but its a lot of organizing.  We now have all debuffers (mostly) using a separate channel, which seems to work well.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Always gone with #2 on trash and #1 on nameds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi there !<br />
My guild allways uses number 2 as well . All of us shaman have an &quot;Im on %t&quot; Hotkey and once a mob is called its that shamans responsibility too Debuff that mob .<br />
On named mobs however we tend too just spam all debuffs ASAP .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, if you ge tthe mark targets Leader AA, then you can set up a much nicer method of handling mobs, but barring that...<br />
<br />
<br />
  We normally utilize calls in channel of &quot;Malos casting on %T in 3.8 (or whatever their time is) seconds&quot;  Then assign a slower to assist that person and cast turgur about 1.5 second later.  Slow hits just after Malos and typically lands.  The Malos caster begins to cast turgur immediately after malos, and if he sees a call that Turgur landed he ducks out of it and moves on to malo the next.<br />
<br />
  Split shaman up into teams of 2 like this, doubt you will often have more than 2 teams anyway) but one is assigned to the MA's target (identified by target ring or simply the first one to show up on F8) and the other team starts with the next mob to show up on Cycle NPC hotkey.<br />
<br />
  It's also best for the Malos caster to keep Malo AND malos up so that there is no need for a recast time on his end.<br />
<br />
   Since getting Balance, I have remove myself from this normal setup and just whip out a little Nihil action on everything incoming, but when we are shortstaffed (2 of us) I will Nihil one, then assist and Turgur the one just Malos'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does no one else do stuff like call  &quot;right&quot;  &quot;left&quot;  &quot;front&quot;  &quot;back&quot;  in the shaman channel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have two teams.  If we have only one shaman per team, then one shaman IS the team.  We call out our debuffs in a debuffer channel, along with all the other debuffers -- bards, chanters, mages, druids, shamans.<br />
<br />
The first team assists the main tank, or whoever takes over if the main tank dies.  The second team is on adds, hopefully picking the unmezzables first.<br />
<br />
A team consists of one guy doing malos and the other doing slow.  <br />
<br />
That way, the main tank's mob is almost always slowed very quickly, and if nobody sees a slow message being hotkeyed out, they know they had better stop slowing adds or just fooling around somewhere and stop the main tank's mob immediately.<br />
<br />
So teams 1 and 2 have a possible four people in them, all combined.<br />
<br />
Extra guys slow extra adds, do malosinia if needed.  Some like to do cripple -- fine.  Everyone uses their best judgment to do their job the best they know how.  Guys who are laggy are never put into the first team, or guys who say they feel off or tired that day.  <br />
<br />
As an officer, I am often busy either taking names for who wants in on loot, dealing with dropping hope stones and fragments, looking up DKP, shuffling groups around so they stay balanced, etc.  So I slow when I can, but combining my other duties with my frequent lagginess, I try to make it so the raid doesn't rely much on my slow/malos.  <br />
<br />
We set up druids to do ro(not the DOT one), eci, er I think one more, spacing just now; mages do malosinia, and at least one bard to HOS the main mob and one the adds.  Everyone hits their hotkeys when their job is done so we all know where we're at except for chanters, since they're sometimes too busy with mezzing to tash, so they come into and out of the loop at their own discretion.  <br />
<br />
It's a bit confusing to get used to, and most people don't like getting used to it, much less setting it up for their class or other people's classes.  It's so much different than what people are used to when they just do regular groups.  But it promotes order and discipline and reminds people that we are all supposed to not be AFK and working together; that in itself makes the system worthwhile even if there were no conceivable benefits as far as the actual debuffing, to my mind.  You're much less likely to AFK or play like a dope when everyone's watching you and waiting for your hotkey to be on the right mobs at the right time.<br />
<br />
We do it the same way on every mob we can get to, trash or not.<br />
<br />
I find varying your approach on this kind of thing mob by mob can only lead to confusion and arguments and people finding some way to justify slacking off or screwing up.  Just do it, do it right, and do it all the time, and everything will be fine, nobody will say or think you're not doing your job or get resentful or put on airs.<br />
<br />
It's helpful to prevent the psychological &quot;star system&quot; that so many people want to become the focal point of -- you know, slowing and debuffing and generally doing things almost at random or very capriciously, leading people to dread their next tantrum, lack of initiative, or, bout of AFK fever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We do Gloriana if we have more than one inc. Its mainly a free for all on trash with one shaman on malos the rest doing slow on named. We have a shaman channel where rebuffs are called so we dont rebuff the same person. We don't need a rigid system to keep us all in line. There is a large amount of trust that we all know what we are doing and are not slacking off. If someone doesn't feel on the ball they just don't raid that night. Its a system that is flexable for those times when a large amount of folks die we know everythings covered without having to say anything. Folks just keep debuffing while others rebuff without having to be told. <br />
<br />
I luff my guild   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildarea Deathwitch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I find it easiest to have every shaman make 3 hotkeys.<br />
<br />
One = ;(whatever your channel name is Malos on &lt; %t (target) &gt; in 5 seconds (or less for BoR and spell haste<br />
Have it cast malos 2 times with a pause 3 in between each cast, in case of fizzle/lag<br />
<br />
So mine looks like:<br />
; Malos will land on ~&gt; %t &lt;~ in 3.8 seconds<br />
/cast 1<br />
/pause 3<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
This hotkey serves to tell the other shaman what mob you are casting on, whoever hits this hotkey first, casts, and if someone also hit thiers, they duck out and hit the slow spell.  Key thing is all mobs are to be malosed before they are slowed, to cut down on resists and shaman agro.<br />
<br />
The next hotkey tells if a mob is slowed, and in my guild we put it in both the raid, and channel.<br />
<br />
Mine looks like this:<br />
<br />
; ~&gt; %t &lt;~ is PARTIALLY slowed.<br />
/rs ~&gt; %t &lt;~ is PARTIALLY slowed.  (alternate /rs for ;2 when my guild does PoTime, so instead of spamming raid, i spam our sections raid channel for p1 and p2.)<br />
<br />
I never understood why one of the shaman wanted to say if a mob is partially slowed or not, since 90 % of the mobs in Elemental+ are partial, with most of the exeptions being during Fennin script and PoTime.  Only way for this to really work is to make 4 slow hotkeys, one for each type of slow, partial, mostly, slightly, and full.  I don't know about most shaman, but my hotkey page already has too much stuff on it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as soon as malos lands that shaman hits thier slow spell gem, casts slow and if it hits, check to see if another shaman has already said it was slowed, if they did, then you dont say anything, if they did not then they hit the next hotkey and YOU hit this one, stating that Target is now slowed.<br />
<br />
The last hotkey is for a resisted slow.  My guilds healers rule, so this has not really been needed, but the theory is that if slow is bounced, the shaman would take agro, and be tanking a very hard hitting mob.  So in turn, the other shaman would be healing this shaman at the same time they are trying to slow the mob.<br />
<br />
Looks like this:<br />
<br />
; Slow was resisted by ~&gt; %t &lt;~<br />
/em tried to slow ~&gt; %t &lt;~ but was resisted<br />
<br />
The /em is to let other people know that slow was resisted without adding more to raid spam.<br />
<br />
Since we statred to use this system, shaman don't die as much, mobs are slowed faster, and it provides more healing power to the raid, since after all present mobs are slowed, we switch to assist healing.  For me I use two assist keys, one is to assist the main agro, and another is just a plain assist key, to assist whoever my target is.  So I hit they MA assist key then hit my heal assist key to find a target to heal, works well when agro is bounceing all over the place.<br />
<br />
System works well for us, but its not for everyone, key is to reduce spam in raid say and still communicate with other debuffers on what is going on.  Chanters keep tash in channel and only have messages for what is mezzed in raid say, shaman keep everything but slow messages in channel.<br />
<br />
Shaman in my guild dont cripple or cast malosinia.  The few of us that have clicky neck from VT use that when we can, but for the most part, we leave those jobs to the chanters and magicians.  We do this in part because of the high mana cost of slow and malos, and the long cast/recast times associated with our spells.  The other part is neither mages nor chanters can cast heal, while we can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we know multiple are about to be pulled like that then sure (hohb etc) but most of the time it's just a pile of mobs. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tend to use your 'method 3', assign shaman to each tank. Also build 'self sufficient' groups around this principle, each tank/offtank has dedicated healer slower etc<br />
<br />
This works well for a lot of elemental raiding where you are clearing mobs in batches ie: earth/air rings most trash is pulled in batches and offtanked, also you get a lot of splits ie: 4 tough mobs that NEED slowing fast beating on the raid, if each is assigned to tank/slower combo you'll lose a lot less people in the first 10-20secs of a fight rather than picking/calling random mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">sometimes, on trash our shaman each pick a tank and debuff that tanks mobs...if we get more than 3 at a time, we all debuff the adds.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS on named raid mobs, we have 1 person malos and the rest try to slow.<br />
<br />
to be honest 90% of the time we don't get more than 3 mobs at a time, and i just tell the shaman to go ahead and act as if you are the lone shaman on the raid...(sometimes i am actually the only shaman on EP level raids, sometimes we have 4 shaman.)  lettting everyone malos/slow everything keeps people busy and lets them feel importaint. (we use this approch with trivial stuff.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have hotkeys for the Main, Second, and Third.<br />

etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">we have an interesting method. basically 1 shaman is assigned to each debuff. one on malos, one on slow, one on cripple. then since we have 5-6 shaman at each raid, 1-2 are in a chanter grp, and 1-2 are assigned ninja duties. basically what that consists of is covering slow/malos/cripple on mobs that may not have it yet. these people dont' announce in /rs or debuff channel, they basically just make sure everything is under control. i find it works exceptionally well, that way the raid thinks we're one huge organized grp with only 1 person calling debuffs for each debuff, when in reality there's 2-3 people slowing/malosing different targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We have around 3-4 shaman at any given raid.  I assign malos and slow to each, and only cripple boss mobs.  The others are on back up and buffs.<br />
<br />
It works well enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does no one else do stuff like call  &quot;right&quot;  &quot;left&quot;  &quot;front&quot;  &quot;back&quot;  in the shaman channel?<br />
<br />
<br />
We do that in p1 trials if we happen to have 2 shaman in the same trial, but most of the time (except on critical nameds) we just race to see who can ninja-slow it first =P<br />
<br />
Most of the potime gods we split duties (mostly for adds) but for Ikkinz and EP we pick a target to debuff and call it in the debuff channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">pretty much do what Wilarea does;<br />
<br />
2 Shammies on MA's target:<br />
  Shammy #1 Casts Malos on inc, and announces it in debuff channle <br />
  Shammy#2 counts 1.5 sec-ish depending on spell haste on #1, and then starts to cast Turgur's<br />
  Shammy #1 at this time is also casting slow incase #2 gets resist.<br />
**Whoever gets slow to land first calls it in debuff and usualy an /emote or /say %t is slowed so others know too.<br />
<br />
The MAs mob is slowed by like 98% usually so shammy #1 and #2 are now helping with the adds.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:  we usualy only have like 3 shammies on a raid, 4 is a good night when we fighting a God.<br />
<br />
Shammy #3 is malos=&gt; slow all the trash mobs that he/she can while MA is being taken care of.  <br />
  On the adds we malos and slow our targets, none of this shammy does this that shammy does that.  (oh-yeah....we tend to reslow everything at least 1 time, ninja style just to make sure..its not like our mana is really usefull for anything else on the trash part of raids.)<br />
<br />
When everything in camp is slowed for sure, we then assist in either patch heals, keeping our group alive (esspecially if a nasty AE or something), RGCing if its needed, RCing if thats needed, or if everything is undercontrol, we simply nuke with our pathetic lil nukes till the mobs dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We have up to 8 shaman on raids.  We have 2 people do debuffs and all slow.   Never had any complaints and we all have massive mana pool so its no biggie.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we have make the most Jr Shaman ( IE app)  do all the work and we try to take aggro  from the Maintank but thats when we are really bored :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess it depends what we're raiding and how many shaman we have.<br />
<br />
Quite often I don't find slowing trash mobs is particularly effective. In those cases we generally say each shaman to themselves, and we'll announce in channel what mobs we've slowed.<br />
<br />
If mobs tend to be single but steady pulls, and hit hard, then I quite like to split malos/turgurs between shaman. This allows very fast slows but with multiple pulls it doesn't work so well.<br />
<br />
For multiple really tough mobs, e.g. Sol Ro tower doing Dresolik, we'll assign a shaman to each tank. That shaman then assists their tank and fully debuffs. If there aren't enough slowers you can get beastlords to help, and shaman can double back to support the beastlord once their first mob is done. Doing this on trash clearing though means you are now doubly reliant on the offtanks picking up mobs first. I don't think this is a good idea unless you really know they are on the ball.<br />
<br />
Boss mobs, we'll generally pre-assign someone for the unresistable debuff (malos or MD) and everyone else will try to land the resistable ones (slow/cripple etc)<br />
<br />
Overall my general opinion is that it really doesn't make any significant difference. So long as trash dies fast, offtanks and chanters are on the ball and nobodies off afk, people don't tend to die clearing trash on raids very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">FCFS on Malos, duck out if you called it 2nd+ (unless you think the other person might be interrupted somehow).  Then it's FFA on Slowsticks.<br />
<br />
Sometimes there's coordinating which mob you got, other times not.<br />
<br />
I use Balance of the Nihil to check if Turgur's has landed on a mob, if I'm not sure.... about the only thing it's good for really (Your spell did not take hold).<br />
<br />
Mages do sinia in our guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We usually have two 65 shaman on raids, myself and another shaman. She casts malos, and macros it to the raid ... I follow right behind with slow and macro it to the raid. We've gotten so good that most mobs are slowed by the time they hit 97%. We do have Mages casting Malosinia, but normally on a raid set up the puller, MT and the two shaman run at the front of the raid, and the mages are usually back further in the group. They debuff when they get to the mob. If I need a chanter's Tash, I pull a chanter to the front with me.<br />
<br />
Our hotkeys are simple: <br />
/rs MALOSED: %T.<br />
/rs TASHED: %T.<br />
/rs SLOWED: %T.<br />
<br />
Short, sweet, and to the point. No funky symbols or arrows. Captitals stand out in the raid spam very well. Perhaps someday I'll be able to train the mages ... :p<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about partial slows, so I get to use the same macro whether it's magic, disease, full or mitigated. All the tanks know is they're getting beat less, lol. If we're on a boss mob that mitigates the slow, I'll let the tank know in a quick tell.<br />
<br />
My guild doesn't use a shaman channel or debuff channel -- at least, we've not had a raid that demands one yet. We set up a shaman channel briefly in the (rare) event more than 2 of us show up. We spend two minutes, max, assigning buffs and debuff/slow duties. The channel is dissolved, and we go on our merry way. If no more than us two shaman show up, we know which buffs we've got, and cast them.<br />
<br />
If we're working in a situation with one mob and a few adds mezzed, one shaman will malos and slow the MT's mob, while the other works through the mezzed ones, debuffing and slowing. It's pretty rare that we go FFA on slow.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Generally we work out who will malos and who will slow the FIRST mob into the camp, but the others are FFA. I generally say &quot;%t's mob is SLOWED&quot; where %T is an add tank. Malos, slow, assist the mob, heal whoever its hitting, tell the others its slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">With 3 shaman on raid (was about the norm in my guild until I took my recent break).<br />
<br />
One shaman assigned to malos<br />
One shaman assigned to slow<br />
One shaman assigned to jump in to help with malos or slow if many adds or to jump in if a shaman dies or needs a break. Also handles rebuffs. <br />
<br />
1st shaman should have both malos and malo memmed so they can get the mobs debuffed quickly.<br />
<br />
2nd shaman should have a /assist 1st shaman hotkey so they know what mob they are currently debuffing and can get them targeted quickly. Debuffs/slows called in shaman channel. Malos call should be a &quot;casting&quot; call not a landed call. Slowing shaman can time it so their slow lands almost immediately after malo(s) lands. After they slow the mob they reassist 1st shaman to pick up the next mob they are debuffing and so forth. Slowing shaman should have a &quot;%t resisting slow&quot; message for shaman channel. When 3rd shaman sees that they should jump in to help get it slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks all.  Lots of good ideas.  I'll have to check with out shaman and see if all of them have malo and malos.  Having both memmed, good idea.  I'm not sure if anyone was doing that.  <br />
<br />
I also like having the malos message say &quot;now casting malos on %t&quot; rather than a message saying it landed.  Going to bring that up and see what everyone thinks about that idea.<br />
<br />
Depending on the number of shaman online during the raid, I liked the idea of assisting each other, so you have shamans paired as a malos/slow team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you do move over to calling Malos ahead of time (my preffered method) then remember that it is impractical in some areas.  If you are in water.. probably gonna be interrupted.  If the mob has a stun or knockback/up AE.. prolly gonna be interrupted.   Cases like that go with calls when Malos lands tends to be best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In my guild we use option #1.<br />
<br />
We also have pullers announce the mobs, then have Shaman malos call as follows:  Casting Malos on %T (to help the others to wait for it to land),  then %T has been malosed.  <br />
<br />
We also have back-up slowers in case of a resist. <br />
<br />
Seems to work well for my group, but don't have everyone into the EP's yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Many nights I am the only shaman on for raids...but when there are 2+ of us, we use Option #3.  One shaman to assist the MA, one to assist the SA.  I like the idea of simultaneously slowing 2 mobs at once.  <br />
<br />
For more than 2 mobs, we call out in shaman channel &quot;3rd slowed&quot;, &quot;add slowed&quot;, or something similar, or I'll /assist the mob after slowing and identify who's tanking it, and call out in shaman channel, OffTank_02's mob slowed.  Quite often we see the add before the offtanks do, and get to tank it ourselves for a bit =P  As I'm sure most of you do, if there is a mob in camp, I slow it, regardless of whether there is a tank on it yet or not.  I'd rather get the agro than a chanter or cleric.<br />
<br />
We are pretty disciplined about calling debuffs; my GL is a stickler for only wanting to know what debuff has actually hit, not what is being cast.</div></div><hr />
