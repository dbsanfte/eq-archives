I'm not a good farmer, never have been. In fact I hate farming, I think it's cheap... maybe I should think of it in an RP sense... hunting the animals to make your trade... I guess I just miss mining in UO and chopping trees.<br />
<br />
So I'm sure I'll get a million replies from itchyban, but anyone else, please fill in the 411. I'm putting down the best places I know to farm, please correct me or provide better places if you know of better.<br />

Plat Farming - Trivial 250<br />
Want to farm stuff I can sell to vendors like gems and weapons and armour and stuff. Best place I know of is Temple of Frozen Shadow, level 1. Almost everything drops a weapon that sells from 5pp to 12pp and the gnomes are near by. I dunno maybe farming some place that drops gems might be earier, less down time selling and stuff. I'll especially need a lot of emeralds anyhow for my smithing for vials of clear mana.</div></div><hr />

If you want a plat farm place then try to get the ice giants in everfrost right outside the entrance to Lady Vox's lair. They give exp up past 55, drop anywhere from 15 to 65 pp and fine steel weapons. There are 3 spawn points, the first two and best camp to get are in there own little rooms at the gate you can sigle pull them np, then futher in is another one that guards the entrace/zone as well. I camped these for quite a few lvls once gnomes went green and made a pretty penny.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with the ice giant post as it is a very lazy and profitable spot but i have to say that if i had known about the wyverns in CS i would have been there instead.  <br />
 <br />
Wyverns are better exp and with a combination of gems that sell for 45pp and skins that sell to tailors for as much as they are willing to pay, it is a better spot in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Julliette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont think you can solo at your lvl but Plane Of Justice Mauvian Hall supposedly alot of diamonds drop.  Ive seen about 5 drop a round per hall clearing with a group.  But i soloed 4 and none dropped.  But exp is really good so id do that with a friend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deneve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the gimling caves in grimling forest and tenn. mtns have lots of regular acrylia drops, if you can get a 65 wiz and 65 chanter along with a puller you can kill 100+ grimlings at a time in the forest, per pull we normally got 1 stack of pieces and about 20 various other unstackable pieces/blocks...fast respawn too, if you have the mana for it you can almost chain pull trains of 100+ mobs each.  there is one drawbrack though, if either the chanter or wiz goofs up you all die in seconds...even though the grimlings only hit for about 30....if there are 100+ of them hitting you at once it all adds up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No need to do pottery farming anymore. <br />
 <br />
There is a new recipie that works well, casserole dish. The pattern is only available in one place (Jagged Pines). It is a very cheap way to skill up in pottery without having to deal with the need for skins. I think the trivial on it is like 198 or so..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aren't I KoS in Jagged Pine? LOL I love being KoS everywhere, makes tradeskills that much more entertaining...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You may be, but nothing to stop you from sending in a gimp or having someone else buy the sketches for you. They stack and they don't cost much.</div></div><hr />
