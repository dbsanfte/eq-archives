<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">why do we wiff, hit for crap, ,and then hit for a ton?<br />
<br />
random number generator?  or other game function?<br />
<br />
i have a theory.<br />
<br />
and the best part of my theory,  is as far as i can tell, there is no real way to test it.<br />
<br />
basically, the theory is that mobs have a sweet spot based on location to them, that produces the maximum damage.  and that different classes have different relative numbers based on the location of them to the &quot;sweet spot&quot;<br />
<br />
also, part of the theory, is that as the pet spatial location is regulated by the game; it does far better than us because it works off a warrior setting instead of a shaman setting; for melee damage.<br />
<br />
ok, lets try and explain this.  mobs come in different sizes (lengths) and i believe that to be an in game value.   <br />
<br />
whereas a pure melee can hit for maximum in side of a wide range of distances to the target, the shaman has to be at optimum distance for optimum damage.<br />
<br />
further explaination.  gnolls are a short distance front to back.  it is easier for shaman to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; and melee for max damage.<br />
<br />
giant sonic wolves, for example, are long front to back, and while they might be able to hit you, you are getting the out of range message.<br />
<br />
i believe this 'value' to be not really associated with the graphic of the mob.  i think it is a number assigned by Verant and then compared to the class number of the player.  ie, a SK and a shaman standing at the same point relative to the mobs 'sweet spot' will do different damage unless they are both at the optimum.  i think of course that the SK has a greater optimum range than the shaman.<br />
<br />
meaning that he can still hit for optimum if he is a bit closer or a bit farther away.  shaman have to get it just right to hit for the most damage.<br />
<br />
if i am correct, shaman would not need an increase in skill caps to do better melee damage; just a change in their modifier (location to the sweet spot)<br />
<br />
if i am correct, shaman are on a melee chart similar to pure casters, and there are other melee charts for hybrids and pure melees.  we just have better weapons than pure casters, so that our hits out of the &quot;sweet spot&quot; still do measurable damage.<br />
<br />
well, it was a thought.  after 4 hrs soloing i could not come up with a better explaination of why sometimes i hit for 4, and sometimes i hit for 104 on the same mob.  i think the reason pure melee hit for more consistently; is that their modifier to the sweet spot is far better than ours.<br />
<br />
and i do not believe that the &quot;modifier&quot; is a simple value of three.  &quot;one&quot; for casters, &quot;two&quot; for hybrids and &quot;three&quot; for melee.<br />
<br />
i believe that verant could make our melee slightly measureably better (for god sakes, make it better than a JBB) without having to reconfigure the game, just adjusting our modifier a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're thinking about this way too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pure melee hit with more consistency for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  They have a damage bonus (minimum hit).  While this doesn't tighten the range of values they can hit for, it does bring them closer to each other percentage-wise.<br />
<br />
2)  Think of it in terms of 20 sided-dice.  The higher your atk value, the worse roll you can get and still do ok damage.  For example, my monk has 52 more offense and 52 more 1HB skill than my shaman.  Think of this as effectively giving him a +5 to every damage roll he makes.  So while a shaman rolls and just gets whatever they roll (supposing a 1 gets me a min hit of one damage, and a 20 gets me a max hit of 84 damage, with my spear of fate), my monk rolls a 1, he actually gets a 6, he rolls a 15 or higher, and he hits for max.<br />
<br />
3)  Try this:  get a beastlord to cast ferocity on you, and a shaman to cast ferine avatar on you, a ranger to cast spirit of the predator and strength of tunare, an enchanter to cast speed of vallon, a bard to sing warsong of zek, and cap your strength (should put you at somewhere around 1600ish atk?  /shrug).  Now start attacking.  You should notice that you hit more often, and for a higher average damage.  By adding all those +atk buffs, you are getting yourself into the range of a melee's atk value (and a well-buffed or well-equipped one, at that), and you'll notice a huge difference.<br />
<br />
EverQuest doesn't check for your distance from a mob to determine how much damage you do, of that I guarantee you.  It's just your atk value versus the mob's AC.  The only difference between melee and caster/priests in this regard is that melees are going to have higher atk values due to their higher skill caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should notice that you hit more often, and for a higher average damage.<br />
<br />
You're half correct:<br />
<br />
Whether you hit or miss depends on your weapon skill.<br />
<br />
A higher attack rating will increase your average damager per hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're half correct:<br />

<br />
I believe it all comes down to ATK vs. AC also.<br />
<br />
I've always had my weapon skills maxed, but when my ATK was higer from buffs my misses would go down. I'm not sure how it works for other classes, but 1 skill in a weapon skill is equal to +4 ATK. 1 skill in offense is equal +1 to ATK. <br />
<br />
I will give you this though. We don't know for sure if there is another check that is performed on weapon skills when calculating a miss. We do know this however:<br />
<br />
higher ATK = less misses<br />
higher weapon skill = higher ATK<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Known issue, z-axis effects melee. Missing all of a sudden all of the time?<br />
<br />
Changing z-axis fixes this. (Bacially just nudge to the side or back.) It's z-axis in relation to the mob, not the actual hard number you see in /loc. Mobs cheat, in case you did not know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">by this theory, could it be useful to bid on vengence items or anythign that has a attack buff on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass Wolvesbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are 100% wrong.  Your distance from the mob and spatial relation to the mob play no part in how much you hit for.<br />
<br />
The reason you suck is because your offense and melee skills cap lower than pure melee, and your have no damage bonus.  Check out the 25 point difference between a paladin and a warrior for sheer DPS sometime...and then think that the difference between you and them is 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">its true, your theory isn't the case.<br />
<br />
however.<br />
<br />
The &quot;random number generator&quot; that computers use is not really random. If you spend enough time around a program that involves random number you can begin to see paterns. Does anyone here play Warcraft 3? If not, there are 4 available races (its an RTS game) to choose from. If you dont want to manually select one you can choose &quot;random&quot;.<br />
<br />
I played on this &quot;random&quot; setting (which supposedly had an even, 25% chance for each race of being drawn when a game was started) for eleven games, and all eleven games I drew the same race. I took those numbers to the calculator and discovered the chance of that happening, if it were truely random numbers, was less than .00002%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">However, a higher attack rating will not affect your maximum damage hit.  My max hit was the same from skill in 1HB of 110 to 200.  <br />
<br />
Higher attack rating means increased chance to hit, and increased chance to hit harder.  Mobs have innate AC as well, which you must have sufficient attack rating to overcome in order to hit them well.  Snakes in ssra have some of the highest AC of any mobs in EQ.  A shaman without major attack buffs will whiff continuously.  Paladins have problems here too, as do SKs.  Rangers and rogues have higher attack ratings on average, and thus connect better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As far as range goes - all objects in the game have a bounding box for the object to be rendered .  If you're standing within the mobs bounding box, you can hit it.  If you're outside the bounding box, you can't.<br />
<br />
That's the reason they had to take the Megalodon out of Lake Rathe.  It's graphic was such that the mobs bounding box extended onto the shore in some places, so players in certain places could attack the Meg from the shore and the mob wasn't able to fight back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think a part of the reason that with attk buffs you appear to hit more often is because not all misses seen are misses.<br />
<br />
First there is a check for contact, did you hit the mob or not.  Then there is a check for damage vs AC deciding how much mob is hit for.  Sometimes the AC overpowers the damage and you hit for 0 this ends up being shown as a miss.  So with higher attck you get less misses because the 0s that show up as misses are being boosted up.<br />
<br />
Just a theory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">actully as my wep skills went up so did my max damage. to where the following formula works most of the times in finding out what my max is.<br />
<br />
DMG x 4 + 1 - 5 ( for 1HB perice )<br />
DMG x 4 + 1 - 10 ( for 2HB )<br />
<br />
these are with 200 skill around 150 skill or a little less i was hitting for a multiplier of 3 instead of 4. I firmly belive that IF thay would up our skill lvls our MAX hit would chance from a 4 multiplerer to a 5. <br />
<br />
I have a brother with a SK and even with a greater damage wep with more str and about equal attack rateings ( from buffs i had he did not ) he STILL hit for more then i could MAX. only difrence here is the offence and wep skill. now that i have picked up a bone of bertoxx my MAX hit that i have seen is 226, but my brother with a slighly lower damage wep is hitting in the 300's round about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another example is on the beach in gunthak. The higher level skellies have much higher ac than most mobs in the zone and I'll whiff quite a bit more on them than other mobs. Contrasted with a zombie on the beach that has considerably lower ac. I own the zombies pretty good with my 870 ATK (self buffed) with very few misses.<br />
<br />
I'm an advocate of high STR/AC in the earlier levels, then HPs/STA after you got defense maxed.<br />

<br />
Yup, just let the tank build aggro and then start attacking from behind. You will hit more and do more damage back there.<br />
<br />
Not really what you meant, but just in case new players are looking at this its a nice thing to know.</div></div><hr />
