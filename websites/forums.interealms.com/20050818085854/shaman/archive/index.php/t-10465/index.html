<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been away for about 6 months ( i think, well it was about a month after SoL came out).<br />
<br />
I gave up because I was getting frustrated with the game, and I was having money problems.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm back now, and I was wondering, whats new? is the game any better with the new expansion? and has it made any other high end places like seb emptier? :)<br />
<br />
Will I have trouble in game now that I have been away for a while, as i remember when I left my equipment was crap ( lvl 57 and my best piece for ikky BP), so, is it even worse than it was?<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">also, is there any way for me to move to antonious bayle, preferably with all my gear intact, as I live in the UK but im on ECI, and I have no time to stay up all night to go raiding :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I don't know about chaning servers, but if they would do a swap, I would gladly switch with you.  I'm on AB and I have the same problem with the uber guilds being on a different time zone than me (I live in Tampa, Florida).  <br />
<br />
Anyways, what you will find about the economy nowadays is that good stuff can be bought for cheap by using the bazaar.  You can find decent items in there by typing once you enter the zone (and getting to a location in the zone that you will not have alot of lag and are out of the way of the entry and exit areas) by typing /bazaar.  From here you can do a search for almost anything.  I'm assuming that with you being lvl 57, that you at least have a little bit of money...say even 2k, that you can use to get yourself some decent upgrades for some areas you might be short in.  I know that for say, your hands, you can get the Leaf Scale Gloves, that are running around 100pp on AB right now, since everyone and their mom has looted a pair and wants to sell it (including me).  There are really decent gloves for your lvl and will do nice until you can get some Coldain Skin gloves, or whatever else you get ahold of.<br />
<br />
The point is that the bazaar feature will help tremendously with getting a lot better items quickly.  Just remember though to watch out for those auctioning off an item for really cheap, when it turns out that it's only being thought of as cheap cause someone else is selling it for higher than what the normal price usually is.  Also, keep an eye out for those people that are attemping to drive the price of an item up by doubling it's price.  Sometimes when people aren't familiar with an item's price, they will just look up who is selling it currently, and then lower their price by a little bit, thereby making it seem like the item is worth much more than it really is.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you and hope it all works out for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uber guilds usually play durring non peak hours that way they get the mobs when everyone else is asleep or at work.<br />
<br />
Most us servers have at least 2 euro guilds that raid euro time.  <br />
<br />
To switch servers it cost $50 and you lose all money and items.  Unless you are going to stormhammer then i think you can move chars for free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can move to SH for a month then move to any server you want after that I beleive. This is with all your gear too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for the info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They will move you back to your original server after you cancel the legends subscription, unless you manage to pull a fast one on the gm that moves you.<br />
<br />
You can however move droppable gear from one server to another using legends without any problem unless its very special things like manastones and such.</div></div><hr />
