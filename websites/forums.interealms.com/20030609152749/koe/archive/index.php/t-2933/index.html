<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK my target is yet to be determined, BUT my list, in order of priority, is:<br />
<br />
Fear<br />
Kael<br />
Dragon Necropolis<br />
<br />
The target will, of course, depend on what is camped.<br />
<br />
Delharen is heading to Hate and have offered to run a joint raid, however I am leary of us having a large force and lagging their existing raid out... Therefore Hate is likely NOT the prime target. If only a few people make it, then perhaps we will see about joining them, but if not, we will go there in the VERY NEAR future. If you planned on attending Delharen's raid, please attend and enjoy :)<br />
<br />
This is somewhat short notice, so if we don't get a necessary force together, such is life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time : Noon Eastern (9:00 am Pacific)<br />
Meeting place: Wiz spire in West Commons<br />
Levels: 46 and up (ideally 46-55 but I'm easy :p ) KOE, petitioners, and friends are all welcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additional information: What this is, is the first in a series of raids to &quot;season&quot; some of our newer/lower level people. Some of our lower level people have limited exposure to Planar/larger scale raids. This is intended to be an opportunity for us to gain some experience in this area and to upgrade some equipment :)<br />
<br />
Please be considerate of your casters and bring a few extra peridots for clerics and Chanters.<br />
<br />
You may commence signing up now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd love to go to any of these places.  I am especially looking forward to Hate...as may be witnessed by my lack of *any* purple armor, I have yet to go to the Plane of Hate.<br />
<br />
So sign me up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WOOT I've gone to hate a few times, but I had to leave early the second time, and of course then a few apothic pieces dropped and rotted. bah.<br />
I'm so glad I finally will be able to go on a planar raid with you guys.  I'm definitely signed up, but beware that I might be late.<br />
Put me on a possibles list because I have church until 12 Eastern, which is when it starts, and we may go out to eat afterwards.  Looking at it again I probably won't be able to go though :(  But I will log off at the spires hoping to find you guys delayed or something :)</div></div><hr />

I'll make sure to get with Kindonini so she can rescue me from Thurgadin and drop me at the meeting point well in advance :)</div></div><hr />

I'm pleased and surprised at the response this short notice has gotten and hope to get back in time to join you in progress. If Not, I'll see you on the next one.</div></div><hr />
