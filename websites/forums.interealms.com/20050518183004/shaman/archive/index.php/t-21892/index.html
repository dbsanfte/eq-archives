<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help<br />

<br />
Buffs are only one part of many issues we currently face, but I'd like to use this thread to focus on our current buffs, and analysis of how effective they are. We can then use this evidence to support requests for changes with the OOW spell line-ups if they are shown to be relatively insignificant. If anybody has data to add to the content below please please do add it to what exists.<br />
<br />
I'll kick things off by looking at dexterity. Melees love to max out their dex to increase proc rates, but how much does it really help? Some of this appears in another thread but I thought it may be more useful to seperate buffs out from the other issues. Apologies for repeating myself.<br />
<br />
Dexterity<br />
Increases proc rate, afaik that's all it does.<br />
<br />
Notes &amp; Assumptions<br />
<br />
- Assumes no WA skill<br />
- Assumes having two procs (one from aug) still gives the same ppm - evidence suggests it is slightly lowered, perhaps due to 2 procs not being able to trigger at the same time<br />
- Assumes 20% of procs are resisted. This is vary variable depending on the proc and the mob<br />
- Assumes 2 procs on each weapon for 100DD and 150DD. Many players will have non-dps or indirect DPS procs too (debuffs, dots etc) which may benefit less from an improved proc rate.<br />
- Assumes standard proc-rate weapons (some weapons have modified proc rates)<br />
<br />
From the Steel Warrior forums (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5644), these are the parsed ppm for a default weapon (no proc rate modifier) without any AAs such as WA.<br />
<br />
<br />
For mainhand weapons:<br />
305 DEX - 2.0 ppm<br />
205 DEX - 1.5 ppm<br />
105 DEX - 1.0 ppm<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the average procs on a weapon at the higher end of the game might be a 150pt aug + 100pt base. So 250dmg per proc. That's probably being generous. Then factor in a resist rate, I'm guessing here but lets say 20%. Again I think that's being generous. DPS from procs is then:<br />
<br />
305 dex: (2ppm main + 1ppm off) x 250dmg x 80% non-resisted = 600/minute = 10dps<br />
<br />
205 dex: (1.5+.75) x 250 x 80% = 450/minute = 7.5dps<br />
<br />
Dexterity Conclusion<br />
Buffing dex by 100 points from 205 up to 305 increases the base proc rate from a total (main and off-hand) of 2.25ppm to 3ppm. This all translates to a 2.5dps difference with the assumed DD procs and resist rates. <br />
<br />
100 dex = 2.5 DPS given the (rather generous) assumptions above.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested if people have more accurate figures on proc resist rates on EP/GoD content, and also on typical procs on main and off hand weapons. I suspect the reality would give lower dps figures than mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I posted above about dexterity. I now come to look at agility.<br />
<br />
Agility<br />
So what does it do? Well, agility adds to your damage avoidance part of your AC. For every 3-6 points of agility you'll see one more point of raw AC. What you can't see, is what difference this makes to your avoidance.<br />
<br />
The parses<br />
Rather than copy it all, I refer you to the excellent parsing and analysis over on our hybrid's class forums - The Beastlords' Den (http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1944&amp;highlight=agility)<br />
<br />
Notes and Assumptions<br />
The parses were only done against a level 63 druid; its assumed the calculations are the same for other mobs<br />
The parses are only done in the range 90-200 or so. Thus, it doesn't show the big kink at 75 agi, nor does it examine effects on agi up in the 280-300 range. <br />
As AC increase from agi reduces over 200 agi, so it is assumed the avoidance factor would too.<br />
<br />
The Conclusions<br />
Raising Agility by 100pts from around 100 to 200 yeilds ~3% increase in avoidance<br />
<br />
Raising agility from 200-300 yields diminishing returns (not quantified), guessed to be about 1-2%.<br />
<br />
To quote the guy that did the parsing:<br />
<br />
Assuming therefore that these equations scale properly over the whole range of possible AGI values, there's no reason to expect the benefits of AGI to continue above 200, since you get diminishing returns to your listed AC from AGI above 200. As it is, a 3% increase in avoidance for a 100 AGI increase is a joke anyway, SOE might as well remove the stat completely and reduce the CPU load of having to calculate its effect<br />
<br />
100 agi (from 200-&gt;300) yields ~1-2% increase in avoidance. A 100 increase below 200 yields ~3% increase in avoidance<br />
<br />
Not a very significant return really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly I refer you to Shabura's thead (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21891) looking at strength.<br />
<br />
Will try to add more later...</div></div><hr />
