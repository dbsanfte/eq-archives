<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been seriously thinking about working up another shaman, of a different race, and, not being the richest shaman on the server, am quite capable of doing some fairly decent twinking.<br />
<br />
Currently have 1/2 the quest components for the Totemic helm (the bear pelt) but an interesting thought/problem may have arisen...<br />
<br />
Does the lizard chamois still drop since the revamp of CT?  I cannot see your average low/mid level shaman even considering this piece of armor if so, and if not, well, they have killed at least one part of a quest.<br />
<br />
Input/information requested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They spawn outside of the actual CT zone, along with most of the old CT mobs.  I don't know exactly where b/c I am very very very angry at the totemic helm quest and never completed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got tired of trying to get the bear.  I found better (or as good IMHO).  Olthorc (sp) cap!!!!  Also the Nightshade Wreath from Mistmoore has excellent wis, no ac :(.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the mobs spawn on or near the mini-pyramids outside cazic.  From what I have heard, the spawns are close together and tough to split - but I have not investigated this myself so I could be mistaken.</div></div><hr />
