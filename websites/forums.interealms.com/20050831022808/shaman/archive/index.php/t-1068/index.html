Not even a peep?  Was that it?  or are they all too busy working on EQ2 and planes of power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would prefer they take a while than to throw possible solutions at the problem and exacerbate it even more. As for PoP and EQ2 don't ya think they have different groups assigned for this, especially EQ2. It'll happen when it happens and not a moment before. While there are some things I wish worked better, we are in pretty good shape for the most part (IMHO) and at risk for some serious screwing up in the effort to balance us.  Be careful what you ask for, lest you get it ...</div></div><hr />

I found myself thinking -- what if a mob like this (tough, but not exactly top-tier difficulty) were to drop an earring that increased the damage shaman dots do by 41%.  How is that different that a melee getting 41% haste?<br />
<br />
So I am also wondering about the caster balancing.<br />

<br />
It's different in that the Shaman would still be limited by mana, while the hasted melee damage is unlimited. Maybe that earring should be more like 60%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">could be argued that the melee is limited by HP's. The challenge is how do you quantify a class as a whole in comparison to others.  That is no simple answer and  a whole lot of grey area depending on your perspective to the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The point of the argument is this:<br />
<br />
Caster loot sucks.  There is no item in the game that comes close to a 41% haste item for any caster.<br />
<br />
Is there a single shaman usable item in the game you would not trade for an item with a 41% damage improvement on your dots?<br />
<br />
Maybe the epic.<br />
Maybe the JBB.  (as an Iksar I wouldn't know, don't wanna turn that rock over just now)<br />
<br />
What do these items have in common?  They materially increase our combat effectiveness.  Sure a 55 AC +100 HP +slew of uber stats item trivially increases our combat effectiveness... the key word here is &quot;TRIVIALLY&quot;.  Nothing like 41%.<br />
<br />
If Pox did 2900 instead of 2000 damage and bane did 2200 instead of 1650 with such an item .. well damn that would be uber -- but its no different that taking a 40 DPS melee character, and turning him into a 56 DPS melee character by adding one item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The mana limitation is far more severe than the hp limitation. Complete heal is far more efficient than a necro mana pump plus all the clarity in the world. There is NO caster item comparable to that earing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">strange how everyone (not just on this board) immediately goes to the DPS as the measuring stick. As a caster we give up some of this to compensate for our other skills, thus DPS is not a true measure of balance (IMHO).  Shamans can kill mobs some classes can't, we can't take a beating like warriors, class x is better at xp soloing, ...  <br />
<br />
If they wanted a system where everthing was equal they would have created a single class for us to play.  People get totally tweaked over this issue for some reason.  I have played my shaman from lvl 1 all the way up to 60 over a couple year period.  I enjoy the class immensely, we aren't horribly screwed in any specific area. we are a jack of all trades.  Raid dmg output is the biggest complaint i tend to see. We aren't a dmg class we are a support class. I could blather on but I really should be working right now anyhow.<br />
<br />
Define yourself, don't let your class define you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For me, EQ is entertainment.  It is about fun.  Sure some grinds are boring, some raids tedious.  In general though, it is fun.<br />
<br />
Krytog's argument for the statis quo is an interesting counterpoint.  for me that point of view is &quot;anti-fun&quot;.  I sincerely believe that when the Warrior who looted the earring clipped it to his virtual ear the real person felt a rush -- like &quot;Hey, I got something cool, I'm better at XXX than I was before&quot;.<br />
<br />
My point is this:  FOR SHAMAN there is no such item that is realistically capable of making us significantly better at XXX than we were before.<br />
<br />
Define XXX however you want:<br />
<br />
1.)  No category of items (JBB, epic excepted) that improve out DPS.<br />
2.)  No category of items that improve our slow spells percentage<br />
3.)  No items that increase the amount of STR given on a buff from 55 to 62 or whatever<br />
4.)  No category of items that 'automatically tash' the mob so our spells stick faster/more frequently<br />
5.)  Etc<br />
<br />
YES we are a support class.  DPS is an easy way to make a comparison, but the fact that our primary role is not DPS DOES NOT invalidate the fact that in terms of equipment it boils down things that are not 'core' strengths of shaman -- ie, I can tank a little better (certainly necessary, but not our primary or even secondary role) or Mana pool depth -- I'll grant that mana pool depth is nice, but any Cann V shaman will not be the mana-limiting factor for any group or raid.<br />
<br />
My point is this:  There are no items in the game for shaman that can make us 41% better at our role, no matter what you define that role to be (DPS, Buffs, debuffs, etc).  I think in the name of FUN having equipment upgrades that actually DO SOMETHING for shaman in particular and casters in general is long over due and would be widely welcomed.<br />
<br />
I recognize that making casters materially better at their roles (however you define them) may result in an untuned game.  For that VI has nobody to blame but themselves.<br />
<br />
Another way to state the same argument:  For non-Aoe encounters, the 'third shaman' on a raid (responsible for buffs not debuffs) can do the job materially as well NUDE as a pimped out, equipped shaman.  The third warrior on a raid that shows up Nude gets sent home -- his equipment DOES something for him.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.<br />

<br />
I think that is the wrong approach. The role of support classes is to make the other classes better so there should be NO item or combination of items in the game that negates the need for any support class. <br />
<br />
For example, a high end monk with Epic, fungi, jboots, and various other items that cast utility spells has almost NO need for a group except for raid situation. <br />
<br />
The converse of that would be a suite of caster items that add double attack, increase %weapon skill, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always thought that maybe they could make a caster focus item that was actually a focus item. <br />
<br />
It would either work with a school of magic (divination, abjuration, alteration, etc..) or it could work so that it would lower the resist rate check of the spell. Even says in the spdat file how the spell works. Item A reduces the resist check by 10% or hell Item B reduces the resist check rate of all alteration based spells while reducing the mana cost by 5%. <br />
<br />
We know that they can do it (read: Mage focus items) it's just a matter of them implementing said items that drop off of mobs. <br />
Voila, caster balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another option would be to revamp specialization to be more effective and more consistent. For example allow your primary spec to go to 252 and offer a consistent and decisive impact on mana consumption and fizzle rates. Allow your other schools to go to 150~200 once you reach a certain level and again impact mana consumption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think addressing mana pool depth (either by consumption or +x mana items) can be equated with caster balancing.  This might work for classes that go oom pursuing core class functions (Wizards, for example) but for shaman it's dubious.<br />
<br />
In an XP group I never goo oom as it is -- bard or chanter mana regen + cann IV + Cann V + torpor... sure I could throw nukes more often, but addressing mana consumption doesn't really make a shaman better at any of his core roles (Buff, Debuff).<br />
<br />
The 41% haste example again:  Make shaman 41% better at what they are supposed to do.  An Earring that makes turgurs into an 84% slow.  A bracer that makes Malo go to -65 on all resists instead of -45.  A necklace that makes focus give 550 HP, str, dex, and +50 ATK.  Or an item that makes bane do 41% more damage.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure we'll never see it.  But in my mind giving shaman loot with effects such as that is the equivalent of a warrior looting a 41% haste item.  Increasing my mana pool depth so I can do the things I do MORE often (which don't really stack in our core competencies anyway) is not the answer.<br />
<br />
-Isazo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pre-Torpor/Cann 5, I'd say the Fungi Tunic adds that much<br />
Just by increasing your mana pool that much.<br />
<br />
But at 60, your right.  There is nothing close EQ wise for Shaman.<br />
<br />
This is why people always point to &quot;spells&quot; as Items.  However, I will NEVER make this comparison.  <br />
<br />
Melees get more Damage as they level as thier offensive skills &amp; disciplines go up.  <br />
<br />
Casters do not.  There is no difference in 255 Conjurer casting something than the 201 excepting fizzle rates, and even that effect is miniscule.<br />
<br />
You'd have to make Dots &amp; Spells more effective with higher casting skills.  Just like a weapon is more effective with higher offensive skills.  <br />
<br />
Then you could cap the Casting Skills at like 220.  Giving you &quot;30 points&quot; in item caps. <br />
<br />
And so a Str Buff, adds more str with higher skills.<br />
A Heal, heals more with higher skills.  etc<br />
<br />
The only items that are closely comparable to Haste, and Weapon Damage Increases, are Focus Items, and FT.  <br />
<br />
And to the Shaman, FT is not as needed because we already have such a powerful mana tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you look at the most desirable melee items in the game, how are made desirable? Verant took the most useful spells in the game and added them to items. regen items, flowing thought items, haste items, full suites of kunark armor with spells, etc. They balanced melee buy giving the cream of the crop of caster abilities. Heck melee classes even get some minor disciplines prior to 51. <br />
<br />
Casters, otoh, got squat except for some flowing thought items.</div></div><hr />
