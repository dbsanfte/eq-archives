<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is running into a problem now that we are POtime enabled.<br />
Seems that everytime that we beat a boss and move to a new zone the lurkers come out of the woodwork, and now are pushing our numbers well beyond the 72 allowed by POTime.<br />
<br />
We are a DKP guild and this is causing alot of stir because everyone wants POTime loot and the old schoolers that saved up points &quot;back in the day&quot; and went MIA are all now sniffing around and wanting to be included in the 72 person format.<br />
<br />
The officers cant in good stead tell them to FOAD because they helped build the guild from way back, and if they allow them first access to POTime, the newer members ( that we needed alot cause the olders bailed till we got to Rathe) are wanting in because they were actively involved in pushing us through the encounters before Time....<br />
<br />
Another problem is the loot. Its been proposed by some that each member be allowed only one loot per Tier for the duration of the stay in Time....<br />
<br />
This causes me a great deal of difficulty because I passed on eplanes Guants, Helm, Wrist, and Earings specifically to be able to loot the really good items in POTime. Ive built up my points while we farmed eplanes for the last 4 months.... Im currently 4th in the guild/1st shaman by some 300 points/1st wis caster by 150 points/1st chain wearer by 50points.<br />
<br />
My plan since we used to do VT was to get Helm,Earring,wrist, and TA from Tier 4... now It may be that my entire strategy will be voided because lower DKP people want in on loots that I have sacrificed for.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong everyone should get the good stuff.... But as a member of this guild for over 3 years... seeing people 6 months into guild bitch and moan and put pressure on leaders to basically nerf the High DKP people makes me sick to my stomach.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that has ideas on a fair way to do loot in Potime in a DKP system?<br />
<br />
Tks for listening it helps to vent some..... any help would be very useful</div></div><hr />

<br />
DKP log should log your raid attendance, we don't let people under 30% raid attendance in past 30 days to get loot to stop that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">people gone for more than a month or 2 at a time should be put on point hold untill they are back and raiding full time for a month or 2 months...that will clear that garbage up fast =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, at least it sounds like you are not suffering from instance issues and get something to spawn past Phase 1. :p<br />
<br />
We have been toying with the idea of not letting players that go inactive come back in and start making purchases right away.  They would have to go through a trial phase to get access to previously earned DKP.  <br />
<br />
If you are a high DKP player with a good attendance %, you really are in a position of power over people coming in below you and have nothing to worry about.  Items that will bring most others to a DKP balance of zero will just eat a fraction of your points.  Since you all earn DKP at the same rate and assuming there is no cap on your balance, you will never have to worry about not getting an item unless you go on a spending spree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild awards loots, but uses a DKP like points system as the primary factor in deciding a loot award.  Only the previous 90 days of participation are used to calculate points for loot to prevent people from hoarding points. Anyone with 20% or lower attendance over 90 days is only eligible for &quot;rot&quot; loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had thought that my passing on eplanes stuff had put me into a position of power.... I have a 93% raid attendence over the last 30 60 and 90 days... and over 800 points... so yes I thought I was in a position of power to get some nice gear...<br />
<br />
Thats the problem.... The lowers and newer peeps are making a push to restrict looting for everyone ..... Our guild isnt your basic ubber guild were we follow the guidelines set in stone.<br />
<br />
A example is that when we broke into eplanes they set a rider on the loot policy that you could only loot one piece of eplanes armor 1 time a week.<br />
<br />
While this definetly helped spread the loot out and kept most happy... its now being used as a sort of precedent to handicap us high DKP people from getting what we have waited on for months of farming.<br />
<br />
Is there no middle ground where the high DKP people can get what they have been waiting on and the lowers still get geared enough to survive is the question I guess im asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my guild if you drop below 70% attendence you become a trial member again.  Go below 50 and you get deguilded.  Harsh?  Perhaps, but it for the most part stops slackers from getting anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds like your loot system is in need of revision.  You have a system that allows and even encourages people to hoard there points and not raid unless your doing uber stuff.  <br />
<br />
The system my guild uses has specific design rules to prevent this type of behaviour.  Loot Scores are determinied by multiple factors, including total raid level (75% attendence = full, 50-75% is less), loot drops on raids, and attending a raid (which is seperate from loot).  So the more you raid, the higher score you get.  If you have a raid level of 0 for more then a week, you start loosing points (so go afk for a month and all your points wont be around, just some).  The other thing that my guilds system does is encourges people to spend there points to prevent hoarding.  There are 4 bid lvls (rot, decent, good, uber)  Now bidding rot, decent, or good takes a set amount of points off your total.  But bidding uber will normally take between a minimum 20 points and all your points away (and you can go neg if you have less then 20; and unless you have 120ish+ points, you will use them all on Uber item).  The net result is everybody has loot from the current level.  Only a few people have in excess of 50 points, and they are saving on specific items (elem pants (we have 2 in a dozen god kills)).  The other result is new people in the guild have gotten elemental loot very fast because every one accepts they the system is design so a few people cannot get most the loot.<br />
<br />
We are also a guild that understand people have real lives and may be able to raid only a few times a week.  You raid less, you accumulate points at a slower rate then those who raid more.  You will get loot, just not as fast.  Deguilding people becuase they have a real life even though they have shown long time loyalty to the guild is not only harsh and unfair, but mean and impersonal also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stopping people from getting more than 1 loot per phase isn't a good answer.  Limiting your Quarm loot to 2 per member is a good idea I think.  It stops those people from just snagging up every quarm loot while no one else gets any.  Installing a raid % average is a great idea.  My guild uses a 40% over the last month in order for you to grab any non rotting gear over another member.  <br />
<br />
Another thing that they need to look at is the cases that I'm in right now.  Currently, I'm at the bottom almost of my guilds dkp list.  This was done cause I joined the guild just before we started trying to kill the rathe.  When I got into the guild, my gear was lacking, and as a result, I needed every upgrade that I could get.  So, 16 or so loots later, I'm at the top of our shamans in hps, even though I'm at the bottom in dkp.  I don't think that this is punishing people like me, who weren't in the guild until recently.  I got upgrades when I could and needed.  I personally wouldn't have thought that it was right if someone over me in dkp couldn't have looted something cause he already has an item from that phase.  When GoD comes out, the top end stuff is gong to need your guild to be in massive Time+ gear, so you'll be farming it for a while.  You will need all the upgrades that you can get.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you look at my guilds dkp roster, you'll see some interesting things.  First, you'll see the people like me who are fairly new to the guild at the bottom in the negatives.  You'll see a majority of the people near +70.. and then you'll see about 10 people who are just huge amounts above everyone else.  They are the people like you who have been raiding with the guild for a very long time, and just don't need the upgrades as much.  Believe me, once you start to see the stuff in time dropping, the high dkp people will start to fall back down to the ground.<br />
<br />
Summarize:  install a raid average that they need to maintain over a 30 - 60 day period in order to bid on anything, and maybe install a 2 loot per member Quarm loot policy so that everyone has a chance to gain from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most guilds on my server get over 100 people on during Time nights, then maybe 60-70 when it's not their turn in Time.  It's pretty normal to see a 25-30% jump in attendance on Time nights.<br />
<br />
My guild disallows getting Time loot if you don't attend at least 50% of non-Time raids between rotation turns (unless you have a believable excuse).<br />
<br />
Just wait until you kill Quarm once or twice.  A good 10% will feel the &quot;I beat EQ&quot; joy and quit.  Though GoD may make them stick around a while.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Also the officers toyed with the idea of making your 30-day attendance percentage modify your bid, if the attendance was below a certain percent (66% would have been the cut-off).  Basically, if you have a buttload of dkp saved up and you only logged in to raid Time, you'd have to bid more to get an item than someone who has higher than 66% attendance for the last 30 days.<br />
<br />
Example: If you had 50% 30-day attendance and an item for 100 points minimum dropped and if the high bid was 150 by another player, you'd have to bid over 300 to outbid.<br />
<br />
Something like that would kill dkp hoggers who only log in for Time.<br />
<br />
Some guilds &quot;renormalize&quot; their members dkp each month or so, to stop people from building up too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild doesn't deguild people who don't/can't play. If they come back though they are required to attend at least 50% of raids for a month or 2 to get taken off the inactive list. While on inactive list they cannot loot just like an app.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've hated open bid systems with a passion ever since someone in my old guild just bumped the bid price up to make me burn DKP while he had no intention of getting the item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hoarding HP items just to pass someone on the EQ-dickswinger list is wrong Valv.<br />
And how am I suppose to keep in ahead when I can not get more Quarm loots?<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to being serious.<br />
We use a system like most who posted here where you need to have a certain attendance over the last 30 days to be able to loot an item.<br />
When it is rotting (that is after recruits get to state they want it) it is open for everyone (including twinks)<br />
<br />
That seems the best system to prevent people with tons of Points from just logging in at 11 for Quarm and walking away with 2 items while not contributing to the raids the rest of the week.</div></div><hr />
