<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and a group of friends have been farming the ikkinz trials for 15 hours a day, every day this last week.<br />
<br />
We spent a long time working out a strategy for trial 1, but finnaly got one, and it works very well.  <br />
<br />
Group setup is <br />
shaman<br />
enchanter<br />
cleric<br />
warrior <br />
Monk<br />
ranger<br />
<br />
We are not time flagged, but have kill fennin and xegony.   All have been play for 4+ years and know their abilites well.  The warrior can box a paladin if needed, the enchanter can box a cleric if needed.  I am by far the worst equipped and AA'd in the group.<br />
<br />
The boss on trial 2 is just not working out for us though.  We have only had an opportuntity to do this boss 2 times, because its impossible to get our corpses back and its easier to just let the trial reset.  We have tested a couple strategies, but we are comming up very very short. <br />
<br />
I could really use some advice.<br />
<br />
If you want I'll post what we have already tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Colal,<br />
<br />
I finally succeeded at this trial last Sunday after many failed attempts.<br />
<br />
Our final set up: warrior, warrior, cleric, cleric, rogue, shaman.<br />
<br />
With the rogue pulling, we never had any difficulties splitting the boss room. Basically, we cleared it, ran in and killed the little guys in the boss room while the bosses AEd. We did them in waves (some of them have tough DSs).<br />
<br />
Then, we cleared the room again. The warriors did some sort of discpline/focus stuff (I'll have to get specifics from the warriors). Since we killed all the little dudes, the bosses were both at 12% hitpoints.<br />
<br />
We killed one boss, then the other boss immediately. It was a TOUGH fight. I slowed and then assist healed like crazy. I also sent in pets and Spirit Call pets for extra damage. (I didn't try any other damage, too busy healing). RGC removes the nasty Vexing Mordania (sp?) curse.<br />
<br />
After all that, we got a lousy 50 endurance aug.<br />
<br />
Wish me luck on 3...going to try it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gloriana's description is about what we did. When my guild got groups threw ikkinz 1-3 so we could start raiding there we where about were you are at now. Elemental flagged and geared and had killed xegony and fennin. At that gear level those trials where not easy thats for sure. Not sure how much the changes have effected it tho.<br />
<br />
We found trial 1 difficult and at first just farmed PA for rings. After we were comfortable with that we started towards DD. First time we killed him we ended up just barely doing it and wiped to the wussy guy that spawns after him. After that we did manage to do the trial successfuly several times.<br />
<br />
We didn't use quite the same group as gloriana but the idea was simular. We had warrior, cleric, shaman, druid monk and wizzy for our group and had a few others outside for buffs, enchanter bst etc. We cleared in with that and had a second warrior waiting outside. Once we had cleared to the named and killed off most of the worshipers we brought in the second warrior in place of the monk.<br />
<br />
One warrior tanked one guy with the cleric healing him while the other 4 of us took out the other one. Me and the druid healed the tank while the wizzy blew him to peices. We then went over and finished the other one. It was a pretty loaded group for us (me, one of the warriors and the wizzy are officers and the druid and cleric are top attenders and top geared) but we got threw. At that level of gear if your trying to tank both you really do need to load the group with 2 big heavy warriors. <br />
<br />
Haven't personally tried it but have read reports that they are leashed and you can use that to avoid tanking both at once. Engage the far one and have someone dot/debuff the close one and run out into the hall. They run out warp and then reaggro to the dot/debuff. Repeate whole time your killing first. Sounds possible but haven't personally tried it.<br />
<br />
Now a days if we went back to do it i'm pretty sure we could do it with most of our hybrids tanking them but we've gotten a couple months of ikkinz/time raiding behind us now and our average tank has probably passed up where our best warrior was then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We tried the leash thing during our first Sunday of failures, we could never get it to work. There was also a &quot;theory&quot; that if you could push one mob far enough to be out of LOS of the second mob, the second mob would leash back and not re-engage. We also could never get that to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the last trial I need for KodTaz BiC. When I went a while back our group setup was cleric warrior shaman ranger druid rogue. The ranger WS'd the other boss while the rogue disc burned the first boss. The druid and I spammed the ranger when WS dropped but he died and the second boss wiped us. We got the first boss to 0% too. Im fairly sure we could trade the ranger for a war/sk/pal and win next time, but the hardest part about it is getting people to come to ikkinz 2. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are in a similar position progression-wise to our guild colal, and we beat all 3 ikk trials last month.<br />
<br />
For trial 8 our group that won was same as glori, war x2, shaman, clericx2, rogue. Both our warriors had low to mid 8k unbuffed, and 450 aa's each. The rogue is our guildleader so well geared, one of the clerics had 400aa and highest DKp cleric etc, other cleric was a 200aa bot in pre raid EP/GoD stuff.<br />
<br />
We couldnt do the 'leash kite' reliably (had a bard in instead of one warrior for an attempt), so just used 2 tanks in the end. Was bloody close, the low aa cleric ran out of mana after the first priest dropped, but we managed to get second priest to 0% before both tanks dropped, then I 'kited' it with dog burn till I died then rogue finished it on riposte disc ;)<br />
<br />
Oh and for the high DS servant mobs, just solo em down with PoF style dottage while group kills the others ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When we did it a while back, we couldnt get the leashed thing to work either. In the end we used a single warrior to tank both, with a cleric and a senond healer, with the remainder of the group on dps (monk, BL, SK). The initial engagement was done with riposte discs, using the monk to open, and then AE taunting with my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We finally beat Ikkinz2 last night after about 8 solid hours of trying. We tried the whole line of sight and not aggroing 2nd over and over and over and couldn't get it to work. So finally what we did was had a chanter chain tashing the left mob from the door(leashing) while we charged the right. We burned the right then had the chanter run and zone out. Then engaged 2nd. Wish we would of just stuck with this strat to start with because it worked so much easier. Group make-up was:<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
Warrior<br />
Enchanter<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
We got a crappy 50 endurance aug too =\ After you figure out a solid strat the trials seem so easy that you should of never wiped the first time to start. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Group was Cleric (7k+ mana), Druid (7k+ mana), Shaman (me 6k mana), 11k Warrior, Magician (with all spells + AA), Enchanter (7k+ mana).<br />
<br />
We are pretty well equipped, and to do this we have the enchanter chain tash. Last time I did this though, the whole encounter was bugged and the priests summoned right away. No chance we could've won that. But the other times that we've won, just burn one down, tash the other, keeping it aggroed, then burn other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the advice.  We will start working on this again today, and hopefully get a little farther.  I'll let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even though these are single group things, you know these trials are for progression?  Giving out strategies for them defeats the purpose of the game.  General tips are fine, but the only hard part for these trials is the final boss(es).  Well, getting into the trial zone without dying can be hard too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Even though these are single group things, you know these trials are for progression? Giving out strategies for them defeats the purpose of the game. <br />
<br />
Because all strats in EQ are top secret and nobody can see right?  :p  I was simply saying what worked for us thru trial and error. There were guildies that tried our strat and wiped horribly, so you never know who it will work for. They posted asking for help and people helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll apologize ahead of time, because my info is going to be dated--I did this trial before the revamp.  (Back when it was REALLY freaking hard.)<br />
<br />
The strat we finally ended up using also used the tether.  Take in a high hp warrior (not even sure if defensive works anymore now--might lose agro like the tipt trial).  We'd go with a warrior, cleric, druid, and 3 dps (or 2 dps and shaman).  Druid has to have GoD heals.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we'd send in the tank, and let him use furious discipline.  Chain heal the tank with long distance heals from outside the room (Sylvan infusion does most of the healing this fight, as it's 200 range.  Cleric's only have supernal remedy that's 200).  Daluda's works well too, as it's 200 range and actually 100hp more than cleric SR.<br />
<br />
Make sure to chain from the middle of the hall IN THE DOORWAY.  If you don't the tethered (but unengaged) mob will warp onto healers for a quick smackdown, then warp back.  If you heal from the doorway in the middle of the hall, they run at you and don't warp--giving the tether time to jerk them back.<br />
<br />
Heal agro will keep the 2nd occupied.  After about 5-10 seconds send in your dps and burn the first one down.<br />
<br />
If you need to med after the first, have someone stun/tash/whatever to keep agro on the 2nd one so it won't rez the first.<br />
<br />
Engage as quickly as you can and kill the second.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how hard these are now--I hear they're at least partially slowable now, so this trial is probably a ton easier.  The original version was brutal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Like Chutoi, I also did this trial way back when it was much more difficult.  Unlike him, my group strat was of the 2 tank 2 cleric type.  We used War Monk Cle Cle Rog Shm and engaged both mobs at the same time.  We burned down the one that the monk was tanking then turned to the other and it was actually fairly easy.  I will admit though that we were very well equipped with PoTime gear and that makes a huge difference.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That's the same general idea that I posted about a long time ago Chutoi after having finally beat it a few times.  I know that I explained it to Glori a few times in tells, but I suck at explaining things.. so that might account for some of it too :(<br />
<br />
I've defeated all the trials as the backup healer, however I have yet to do them since the very last change (the one that was supposed to make them pal/sk tankable and the one that made the final named slowable) so I have no clue what has been changed.  I think that maybe I'll have to try to do them again soon.. cause I know at least Lenine was able to easily kill the very first named in one of the trials 4 boxing it with sham/cler/war/rog.. so it can't be that hard anymore :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The named in all 3 trials are now slowable. I'm pretty sure our warrior used defensive in 2 and 3 but not sure about 1. So yes, they probably are alot easier now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>JaeredMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Completed the 2nd Trial last week with a group of:<br />
<br />
Warrior (10.5k hps)<br />
Cleric (6500 mana, all GoD spells)<br />
Druid (6300 mana, all GoD spells)<br />
Monk (xeg wraps, sem)<br />
Ranger (coirnav hammer, emp sword)<br />
Shaman (6200 mana, no GoD heal)<br />
<br />
No clarity, shaman haste, no BSS.<br />
<br />
We found that the trial was significantly easier if you don't wipe the first attempt.  We wiped the first time on the 2nd named mainly due to mana issues, but finally won on about the 6th attempt afterwards.  The primary reason the first attempt is best is because you can setup so that you only have to fight them 1 at a time.  If you wipe the first time you have to take your chances with leashing the 2nd priest or dealing with it adding in at some point.<br />
<br />
For the first attempt we went in and killed all the adds around each priest, except 1 in the corner of the room out of line of sight of the doorway (as long as it's not the mob behind each priest directly in front of the doorwary it's fine).  We then went out of the room to med back up to kill the last add and priests.  Then the entire group moved into the first priest's room and setup in corner near the last add out of line of sight of the doorway.  We killed the last mob and the warrior riposted/defensive the priest.  No one was allowed to move out in front of the doorway into LoS of the 2nd priest.  By doing this the 2nd priest never aggroed.  When the first priest was dead the warrior led the way into the 2nd room where we wiped with the 2nd priest at 4% because the healers were lom from spam healing on the first priest.<br />
<br />
The next few attempts after we CR'd were bad mainly because we couldn't get into the 1st priests room without aggroing the other over.  What ended up working was leaving the cleric+druid outside the room in the doorway and having the rest of the group run into the 1st priests room and setting up in the corner furthest from the 2nd priest out of LoS of the doorway.  The 2nd priest still aggroed but leashing kicked in and kept it out of the room for most of the fight.  This time we had the cleric chain CH on the MA with me bridging the CH (if it wasn't bridged CH is 1-2 seconds too slow) so we wouldn't have a mana issue on the 2nd priest.  This worked well until right before the 1st priest died the 2nd priest aggroed into the room, I slowed it right off and died but the rest of the group was able to kill it.<br />
<br />
So what we learned was:<br />
1) First attempt is the best chance to deal with the encounter on your terms.<br />
2) Setup out of line of sight of the 2nd priest.<br />
3) Once slowed it's better to use CH with a bridge heal rather than spam heals.<br />
4) Even though the priests start at 12% health, they have alot hps.<br />
5) Healers outside the room out of line of sight of the priests is good.<br />
<br />
Of all the trials this was the most annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok first of all thanks for the tips.   Basically we didn't realise that you could fight one without the other agroing.  So thanks that helped a lot.<br />
<br />
I am 100% positive we can kill this boss<br />
and I know exactly how to do it.  We almost did it but 3 of the members went link dead towards the end and we lost. <br />
<br />
I am so bloody frustrated right now its hard to describe.  We have been retrying this over and over and over.  The damn encounter changes.   Half the time the mobs dont summon.  Some of the time only one will summon, other times they both summon, making it impossible to win as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned the summoning was a bug.   Can anyone tell me if this is a bug, or if it is just random, or if there is some method to it?  IE emp ssrae who gets more powerful the longer you wait to engage him?<br />
<br />
If there is some secret to why sometimes they summon but you dont want to give your info away then just say there is a method to it and I'll figure it out.<br />
<br />
But right now I am seriously thinking about saying to hell with this, because when you get a trial where both bosses summon, you can't even retry if you loose and half the time you cant even get your corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">beat this last night, we sent the monk in first with whirlwind and he managed to get the left priest in the NW corner out of LoS of the other one and the other didn't agro. we charged after him and killed it, then killed the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did trial 2 again last night for the first time since we beat it ages ago. Originally (in pre-nerf IK) we used 2 clerics, a warrior (me), and SK, a monk and a BL. At that time I tanked both, locking agro with riposte discs (the monks and mine) and then switching targets periodically to maintain agro (you lose it on the 2nd one if you dont). It is still a feasible strat I would think.<br />
<br />
Last nights run was with a warrior (me), a cleric, a shaman, a bard, a chanter and an SK. We lost the first attempt when the shaman fired off nihil the moment the nameds went live, and got his ass kicked for the trouble :D. We then regrouped and took a another shot at it. Since engaging two live nameds at once is difficult (placing/timing is a bitch) we worked out a way to get the tethering working for us and won. It dropped the END aug though :(. I can confirm two things: (1) they are slowable; and (2) you can use defensive discs on them (unlike trial 1).<br />
<br />
You can use defensive in trial 3 post-nerf as well if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just wanted to say thanks for the advice you guys were willing to give me.   We won the event finally.<br />
<br />
Basically what we did was set it up to where the last guard killed was in the north room.   <br />
<br />
We stayed in the NW corner to make sure we were out of LOS from mob 2.   We had a pally use his stun abilites to push the mob in so our monk and pally could hit the mob.   The cleric used CH and I spamed Tnargs (dont have daludas yet).  <br />
<br />
When first boss was dead the monk pulled the other mob and we killed it.  I went linkdead though right as the first mob was dying, and didnt get to slow or heal on the second mob.  The paladin had to use 4 charges on his soulfire, but we killed the mob.<br />
<br />
We tried all day to figure out what decides if the bosses can summon or not.   We thought at first it was dependant on how fast it took you to kill the guards, or the order you killed them in.   We were unable to determine any pattern though, so I am considering it random.<br />
<br />
A few things I learned from this.<br />
<br />
1.  Mobs who may or may not summon really really suck.  Especially if there is no way to retry the event on a fail.<br />
<br />
2.  You don't need to be time+ geared to do this.  <br />
<br />
3.  You don't need to bring 2 tanks and 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
4.  A shamans healing abilites really really need to be upgraded. (having a druid instead of me would have made all the trials tons easier).<br />
<br />
5.  Healing AA's are the win!<br />
<br />
Group setup was<br />
<br />
65 (2boxed alt) war (boxed by the paladin)<br />
65 shaman <br />
65 enchanter<br />
65 (2boxed alt) clr (boxed by the enchanter)<br />
65 monk<br />
65 paladin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Summoning should be a bug. From what I know, one priest will rez the other priest, and only after 2 rezzes do the mobs start summoning.</div></div><hr />
