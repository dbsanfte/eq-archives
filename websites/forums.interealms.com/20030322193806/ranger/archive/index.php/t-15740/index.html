<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spidaaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im stuck at level 43, i have slightly below average equipment and i am looking mostly to solo, i have grouped in DL, didnt like it, tiger raptoras are now mostly LB, JP nis far to laggy, looking for any suggestions at all, looking mostly for exp loot is only a bonus, thanks in advance...............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I am/have been in your position and heres my advice:<br />
<br />
43-45 hunt Zelinaks in Dawnshroud Peaks, in about 2 hours there last night I got 3.5 yellows<br />
<br />
45-55 Jaggedpine Forest (note: only hunt Griffs, and snakes)<br />
<br />
DSP just has an insane number of mobs and JPF has like 10 ppl at most in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Streaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">43 fear kite mamoths in EW or do kodiaks in GD ------- here is a hint for fear kiteing kodiacks at the caves. you pull one of them out and there is a path that they will follow when the hit the edge of the small cliff they will get stuck in a cycle where they will constantly pop back in front of you while feared. so you wont have to move much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just a side note: I have been to DL twice now. First time I got in a bad group and we were not able to chain pull whatsoever = crap XP. Second time I started a group, 3 rangers a monk a chanter and a warrior. We mowed through mobs so fast they couldn't do a dent into us. Later a ranger left and we got a cleric then WHAM lay on the XP!!</div></div><hr />

At 43 DSP Zels should still be excellent exp. The thing about this zone is only the Lightcrawlers can be a pain, but still go down quick and isn't that hard to deal with...<br />
<br />
You can also try Bloodgills. I didn't have exceptional gear when i started these at 45, I only suggest you do it with a KEI if u don't have nice regen. They have little hp, and don't hit too hard, plus you will get swimming up as well.<br />
<br />
Another spot I came across recently, was in Twilight Sea. Get a port or if you feel your invis will hold, run through Fungus Grove. Once u take Portal into TS, hit track and try a sea turtle.<br />
<br />
There is a island with elementals, pull them to there if u don't like kiting in water.... this works pretty good, cuz you don't get agro from the elementals. These also have little hp and don't hit too hard. =)</div></div><hr />
