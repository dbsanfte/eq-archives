<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Two Group Planetside Raid<br />
Where: WC Druid ring.<br />
When: 9:00 PM Eastern, Thursday, Decmber 20 <br />
Level Range: Post 50<br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Two Groups.  The target is as yet undetermined.  I will choose a target to provide an appropriate challange for the force I get.  Thoughts at the moment include Dragon Necropolis, Chardock, Sebilis - Juggs/Reets, any of the Original Release Planes.  We'll see.  I'll announce a final target when I see who signups.  If you have any faction issues (e.g., Chardock questers), make them know in your post.</div></div><hr />

**Edit: I have my seb key but only the spear for HS I still need the fang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's on my calendar.  I'll be there.<br />
<br />
My only faction issues are that the Freeport Militia hates me.  Of course, I hate them too so it works out.  :D<br />

Well I might be out later on. We will see maybe i can crash the raid if someone has to leave early. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, looking over the force, I think Chardok looks like a fun place to go.  I heard in the wind that a certain scaley Necro just might need a drop from there for some minor quest he has been working on too.  :)  14 folks signed up with 2-3 being maybes, so lets just all meet outside Chardok at 9:00PM.  I see some have listed they might be a bit late, which is fine.  I might be about 20-30 mins late myself, since work just hit me with something I need to get out tonight.  If a group of you get there, feel free to pop in and hunt the zone out.  Once we get a force capable of going in, we will.  See you tonight.  For those that need escorting, don't worry.  The original post said WC druid ring, and that is also a perfectly fine place to go.  I will hit that first when I get on, in case some folks want to wait from there.</div></div><hr />
