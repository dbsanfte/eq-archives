<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Folks, <br />
<br />
Made level 65 a couple of weeks ago and am working on getting to Canni V. Must say that at 65 the Shaman class is great fun to play and with the AA possiblities open up which I had never ever thought of :)<br />
<br />
Currently I am unguilded but begining to think about finding one (on Brell)  to become part of a greater player base. Been asked a few times lately if I was Sol Ro flagged and had to say no.... so my question's are:<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the flag progression in Pop?<br />
What's required to get through each flag?<br />
<br />
Any tips on finding a good guild ?<br />
<br />
Persop, the Happy 65 Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Here is a great thread that tells you what to expect after you kill each mob.  Each time you visit the seer after killing such and such flag mob, it will tell you what you are missing in terms of pre-flags or whatever.<br />

My suggestion to get a good guild is to go around taking a look at each guilds webpages and finding one that feels right for you.  Remember with GoD out right now, alot of guilds might have to decrease their size a bit, and there won't be the quick influx of loot that there was a few months ago (till people figure out what to expect in god or where to get the loot at).  I would specifically talk to a shaman or two in each one of the guilds and determine what they might expect out of you.  If you have never raided before, then I would at least take along look around the crucible, searching for topics on raiding shaman.  There used to be a nice thread on what our job is but I cannot locate it at this time.<br />
<br />
Last question would be to ask yourself what you expect out of the guild.  Do you want one that's going to be raiding alot?  Do you want one that's pretty casual?  Next question would be to ask yourself at what point of the game are you shooting for being at?  Right now, my guild is done basically with time.  I'm sure here and there we may go back, but you gotta realize for that all of our new recruits, they aren't going to be getting the loot that our recruits of a month ago got.  The new ones will be getting the new god gear, and we won't take the time and effort to get them through all the elemental gods and into Time now.  So, ask yourself if you want a guild that's around VT stage, elemental stage, time stage, or GoD stage.<br />
<br />
Eventually the new no-drop loot will start flowing in God.  Until then, it could be a good solid month or more before we see anything that might resemble an upgrade (i'm talking for those in time gear).  This will prob be your best bet if joining a guild like mine (finished farming time) to get some gear.</div></div><hr />
