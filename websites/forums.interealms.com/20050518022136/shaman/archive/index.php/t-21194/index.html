<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this has been posted, but it was buried on page 3 of another thread.  Thought all would like to see it.  Ryan responding last night on EQLive to some posts about the upgrade to Nihil:<br />
<br />
&quot;The change to Nihil is a preliminary response to the concerns that shaman have voiced over high end gates related content.  This changes should give shaman a clear edge in their ability to quickly slow an NPC.  In the immediately future, there are some tuning changes planned for gates that I expect to have a measurable effect on shaman's abilities to fulfill their roles of slower, and secondary healer.  After these changes are applied, tested, and reviewed we will reevaluate shaman concerns, as well as class balance as a whole. <br />

You are not being ignored.&quot;<br />

We were bad healers in the old days?<br />
<br />
Pre-Kunark we were slightly worse healers than Clerics and during Kunark we were on par probably just because efficiency somewhat mattered still back then while today it's all about HPS. In relation, I'd say we were better healers in the old days than we are now.<br />
<br />
Same goes for buffing imo. Given that stats never made a huge difference, but back in the old days when I would strength or stamina it had an effect on people. Regen had more importance, Sow wasn't trivial and could save lives(hell it was the most important spell for a long time).<br />
Resists mattered.<br />
<br />
Today I buff for 544 HPs essentially. The rest is useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do you remember when our best heal was Superior Healing, and that originally was a 53 spell? And paladins got that at 57 anyway.<br />
<br />
Back in those days, druid healing and shaman healing was identical until level 60 when we got Torpor and they got Nature's Touch. Oh, and we got regen spells one spell level earlier than they did, but they got pack regen. Our heal spells were also 10% penalized, so they didn't do the full amount (remember Greater Healing healing for 270hp?).<br />
<br />
A cleric could complete heal, and it was always complete, because people didn't have that many HP. A buffed level 60 tank would be sitting around 3500, I recall, but a cleric could heal that in one shot anyway. They hated Torpor, lower attack speed meant losing agro, so we would be healing for 583 a shot. 6 heals for full health.<br />
<br />
Compare that with now, a buffed tank sitting at 10k hp. Healing for 1550 is about the same proportion. Though now, we get healing focus and AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was never 60 in the Kunark era (my ranger was first to 60, and that was in Velious), but I remember being a group healer with Greater Healing from 29 to 51. It was pretty sucky - not just &quot;slightly worse&quot; than a cleric, I'd say significantly worse. Remember, Greater Healing heals 300 hp, Superior Healing heals 583 - with a cleric's 5% heal bonus that's about double what a shaman or druid will heal with Greater. Complete Healing heals more HP than a tank will ever see at that level. Cleric heal over times only started in Velious with Celestial Healing btw, but they did get group heals too, which were more used back then.<br />
<br />
Oh, and everyone complained about having to heal the ranger all the time. I heard one comment in the Kunark era, &quot;I'd rather have 5 people in the group than 6 if one is a ranger&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here I agree. Not everyone's stat capped, but most of my guild are. I only get asked for sta or agi very occasionally. People ask for billy for the atk, they only need the speed if they're pulling. I do get asked for FA, mostly by monks and rogues.<br />
<br />
The only other important buff I get is haste, and an enchanter buff bot parked outside can provide that in a lot of cases. Talisman of Alacrity needs to be 60% haste though, I don't understand why they went back to the idea of group buffs being lesser than single target ones, after fixing all the group Kunark spells a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

      Right ,right ,but well GH was sufficient in kurnak also . Remember in this period , every healer had difficult time. Mana regen was so weak ,CH not so efficient. Well druid ,shaman and cleric were able to main healer.<br />
<br />
      It's not the case now . Now only clerics can be main healer. Also you have mentioned the worst period for shaman . 53-59 were not easy for us during kurnak / velious.</div></div><hr />

Our heal spells were also 10% penalized, so they didn't do the full amount (remember Greater Healing healing for 270hp?).<br />
You mean those days when regeneration made a noticeable difference? When Torpor was sufficient to keep a tank up? When people actually ran out of mana? When Superior healing actually filled people's health bar to a degree, not just slightly slowed it's descent?<br />
<br />
Yep, those were the days when shaman were probably overpowered, arguably the best healer and best DPS class and when clerics got groups because of ressurrection.<br />
<br />
And you argue we were poor healers back then? We had trouble getting all of our spells. But with a full spellbook a Kunark era shaman was one of, if not the most powerful class at the time, in a few areas possibly outdone by a necromancer, enchanter or epic magician.<br />
<br />
A cleric could complete heal, and it was always complete, because people didn't have that many HP. A buffed level 60 tank would be sitting around 3500, I recall, but a cleric could heal that in one shot anyway.

<br />
Compare that with now, a buffed tank sitting at 10k hp. Healing for 1550 is about the same proportion. Though now, we get healing focus and AA.<br />
Of course we could just torpor outselves, be a better tank overall then the warrior thanks to torpor and still do other stuff - that is if torpor really took aggro away from the tank. I only had that problem when I was busy outdamaging everyone but rogues and monks.<br />
<br />
As to Complete Heal: Nowadays complete heal easily heals 5 or 6K per cast, without much risk to the tank, for 400 mana. Back then it healed 3K, with tons of risk, for the same 400 mana. In the meantime mana regeneration for clerics increased at the very least by a factor of three. Our mana regeneration did not nearly increase as much.<br />
<br />
Also MOBs now hit much much much harder then back in Kunark. You know, Torpor used to make tanks health go up while they were tanking, not only in Kunark but all through Velious and Luclin too.<br />
<br />
Add to that slow mitigation and compare 20 second fights to fights lasting at least a minute, compare static fights or slow crawls to steady movement - I can not think of a single aspect of healing were we got relatively larger increases then any other class.<br />
<br />
I was never 60 in the Kunark era (my ranger was first to 60, and that was in Velious), but I remember being a group healer with Greater Healing from 29 to 51.<br />
So you are comparing a midlevel shaman back when you mainly played your ranger to shaman endgame healing today? While it is not surprising that you get skewed results I do wonder how you can actually think shaman healed worse back then then they do today.<br />
<br />
It was pretty sucky - not just &quot;slightly worse&quot; than a cleric, I'd say significantly worse. Remember, Greater Healing heals 300 hp, Superior Healing heals 583 - with a cleric's 5% heal bonus that's about double what a shaman or druid will heal with Greater. Complete Healing heals more HP than a tank will ever see at that level. Cleric heal over times only started in Velious with Celestial Healing btw, but they did get group heals too, which were more used back then.<br />
Ok, so in your own words: Disregarding Torpor (which makes a huge impact) shaman used to heal half as fast as clerics. Thanks to mana regeneration we healed probably two to three times as much as clerics over time, not factoring in slow.<br />
<br />
Today we heal about 10 times worse over a short period of time and two or three times worse over time, even factoring in slow, Cannibalisation and Quiescence. Of course the &quot;over time&quot; bit can pretty much disregarded in this case because shaman healing is not actually sufficient to keep a group alive.<br />
<br />
I wish I could go back to healing half as fast as a cleric or to having regeneration spells actually matter, or to have time to cannibalize, or to having my slows land for full or to having Torpor actually heal, or to getting a group for my overall healing abilities. Back in Kunark the game was probably no better then it is today. Different, broke in other areas, but not better. But shaman certainly did heal a lot better then they do today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The days of Superior Healing are the same days as those of Torpor. It were the days of Kunark and Druids didn't have Nature's Touch at 60 back then. <br />
Healing a tank in one shot wasn't needed back then, because mobs weren't killing a 4k HP tank in 3 swings. Torpor was nice AND mana efficient, which back then, was actually important.<br />
<br />
All in all the Shaman was a great healer back then, even with the drawbacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was never 60 in the Kunark era (my ranger was first to 60, and that was in Velious), but I remember being a group healer with Greater Healing from 29 to 51.

Cleric heal over times only started in Velious with Celestial Healing btw, but they did get group heals too, which were more used back then.<br />
<br />
Healing per second had not the importance it has today back then, so while the Cleric could heal big chunks of damage faster, healers had not to spend their whole time healing tanks, so that efficient heals mattered more for exp groups. On a side note, Celestial was introduced during Kunark, 4 or so weeks after Torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2005.  One positive fix every 6 months.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow you know I almost forgot that at the very peak of our overpoweredness, many Shaman could not get a full spell book.  Shaman paid a VERY high price for that power.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that a full set of Kunark era spells would have cost near half a million plat.  <br />
<br />
This is a point that is rarely pointed out.  Shaman have already PAID for our overpoweredness by the rarity of our 57-60th level spell and the cost that was created by the rarity.  I still only have Focus of the Spirit because it was easier for me to get to 65 and those spells than it was to get the 60th level ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">See, as a Shaman that has been playing for all this time and experiencing Kunark first hand(I had all my Kunark spells 5 weeks into Kunark) I disagree with so many Shamans that have already accepted that we were overpowered during Kunark.<br />
<br />
There were 2 classes during Kunark that you could define a power house in a groupsetting. Shaman and Enchanters. <br />
Shamans were seriously handicapped on raids however(Kunark was the era of incredibly resisty raid mobs a la Trakanon, Venril Sathir, Veeshan's Peak or even the outdoor dragons with powerful AEs, thus the introduction of lure nukes), on which Shamans couldn't land a single offensive spell(we still can't on most of these mobs today) and were often only good for malo and limited support healing for the Cleric in the group.<br />
<br />
Back then the Shaman already paid for his, undoubtedly, &quot;overpoweredness&quot; in daily exp groups. All in all Shamans were balanced.<br />
<br />
Just a reminder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With torpor ,without shaman were only a good and interresting member.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I will stick to my guns on the buffing issue.  The meaningful buffs you can cast now are: hit points, 60% haste, regeneration, sow, decent resists, and a ****load of attack.  Back then the meaningful buffs you could cast were: hit points, 40% haste, regeneration, sow and decent resists.  Ability scores have always meant jack in this game.<br />
<br />
As for healing, I was actually talking about pre-Kunark, when all we had were greater heal and regeneration.  You are right that we were excellent healers in late Kunark, but then again during late Kunark/early Velious the class was simply overpowered.  You are also right that the key to our rise and fall is efficiency.  The shaman class is all about efficiency.  Pre-PoP, Everquest was all about efficiency.  PoP was a transitional phase, and now with GoD efficiency is simply irrelevant to Everquest.  So are we.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really Uggok.  Avatar was a level 60 spell in Kunark.  Although it cost an emerald to cast and lasted only 6 min (no focus effects in those days), it was still a powerful, though situational spell.  And don't discount Voice of the Berzerker, the self buff that really mattered.  I used it a lot when I first got it.  Also, hit points, str, and sta made much more impact on the game in Kunark then they do now.<br />
<br />
But I think it's irrelevant what we did then as opposed to now.  We all agree that the bottom line is shamans need big time fixing, and not just in Gates of Discord.</div></div><hr />

If you are doing FA that's probably ALL you are doing, especially if you're keeping it on more than 1 person.<br />
<br />
I'd rather do something that required actual thought.<br />
<br />
Anyone can box/bot a FA Shaman.  Really.  They can.  I'd prefer to do something that required me to analyze the situation, assess the spells at my disposal and take action based upon those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>DBullneck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why does everyone bitch about FA?  It gives me something to do between Fo7 and Boar casts.<br />
<br />
Continual innundation of requests for a spell gem that is usually grey'd out?  <br />
<br />
Trying to &quot;stay on top&quot; of a timer to maximize utilization, falling behind and picking up a queue of melee &quot;waiting for their dose.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Getting requests for FA when the clerics are still trying to med, and you know if you cast it won't last to see the start of the next fight.<br />
<br />
FA requests from clerics, because it really grinds you that they actually do more melee DPS than you.<br />
<br />
Knowing that Fo7 and that stupid grey'd out gem is the only thing you bring to the high end game that can't be handled by another class who has a viable role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You're still casting many of the same buffs as before, but I'd argue that the value of those buffs has gone down the last 3 or 4 expansions.  Sure, Fo7 has more HPs than HoS, but tanks now have three times as many hitpoints as they used to (casters have even more due to the proliferation of high HP caster items) and Fo7 isn't 3x more powerful than HoS, so the relative increase in HPs and thus their importance has gone down.<br />
<br />
Similarly, when mobs used to hit for 80-120 DPS and when many casters had less than 100 hps total, regeneration could significantly heal people.  These days when mobs hit for 800 DPS and casters commonly have 5K hps buffed, a 35 hp / tick buff is insignificant to anyone but a necromancer.</div></div><hr />

Only time its really worth it is when you are dealing with some sort of weak AoE hit.  Saves you from having to deal with patch heals on your casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-Kunark we were slightly worse healers than Clerics and during Kunark we were on par probably just because efficiency somewhat mattered still back then while today it's all about HPS. In relation, I'd say we were better healers in the old days than we are now.<br />

blast from the past GZ hisself:<br />

Why would one play a cleric when druids and shaman are so much more diverse in addition to healing nearly as well? <br />
<br />
Druids and Shamans don’t heal nearly as well as the Cleric does – at least, not past mid levels.  At low levels Clerics, Druids and Shamans all heal similar amounts of HP – the Cleric’s bonus is that she heals about 15% more HP the other two Priest classes.  The Cleric’s advantage is also that she gets her Healing spells sooner.  Past mid-level, the Cleric gets Superior Healing and Complete Healing.  This leaves the Druid and Shaman far behind on the healing curve – there is no class in EQ better suited to Healing than the Cleric.<br />

this guy did more to make EQ unique than clover and brad combined imo.  he's the one who originally delineated the lines for casting classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">the archmage's comments right before kunark launched.  imagine being naked and lvl 50 with no AAs.  that's what playing a cleric with the best guy was like... you had like 2-3 CH in you max and it took you about 7 minutes to med up one more CH sitting down IIRC<br />
<br />
of course back then poison dot could single shot a high level mob and dog dog helped a TON when kiting guards or PVP.  further, melee damage from a shaman with a barbarian spiritists hammer or blued was no joke either... can't recall if this was pre scourge nerf but I suspect not.<br />
