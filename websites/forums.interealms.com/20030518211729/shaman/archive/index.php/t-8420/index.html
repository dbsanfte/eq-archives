<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Copper25</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any tips or advice from anyone who had obtained them already?  Looking for the stables and I am not sure if I found them.  Do the reports drop off of only the mobs near the zone line?  Any help appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To get to the stables:<br />
<br />
Go into the zone, and over the bridge to the gate. Open the gate, go through and left. You'll arrive in a large(ish) courtyard. There will be a passage on your left, this leads back towards the entrance (but isn't a way out, it leads to the balconies that you can see from the bridge). There will be another passage aheaad of you (leading south). This leads to the stables.<br />
<br />
Alternatively look at http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Student's Log (report #6) only drops from Spectral Courier in the stables area -- he's not always up, so you have to keep clearing the stables, and he doesn't always drop it.<br />
<br />
The other 5 reports drop randomly from every mob in the zone.<br />
<br />
If you don't have any reports yet, concentrate on getting Student's Log first, and you'll end up acquiring some or all of the other reports while you're at it.</div></div><hr />
