<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after reading some posts im bored and would like a good decision, i would prefer to discuss relgion but from the other posts i read that doesnt go over well.  So i came up with this...should not offend anyone and be a good discussion at the same time.<br />
<br />
The  question is do we ever really know anything?<br />
<br />
Before we can decided if we know anything, we need to establish what it means to &quot;know&quot; something.<br />
<br />
1st to know something it must be true, ie you can know its raining outside, then walk outside and it turns out its a sunny day.  You really didnt know it was raining then.<br />
<br />
2nd you must believe what you know.  You can say its raining outside, but if you dont believe it then you dont really have knowledge of it, you are just making something up.<br />
<br />
There are a couple more conditions that i cant remember right now but those two are suffiencient for my cause.<br />
<br />
The next part alot of people disagree with but they are wrong.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to tell if you are dreaming?  When you are in a dream do you know you are.  People will say &quot;sure if im flying then i know im dreaming, if im fighting monsters then i know im dreaming&quot; while i dont agree that you are ill grant you that. <br />
<br />
Now have you ever had a dream where you woke up and were like &quot;whoa! that was just a dream! crazy&quot; i know i have.  They can be mundane, just waking up and going about my normal routine dreams  or crazy nightmarish dreams...but ive woken up from both and been like &quot;phew that was just a dream&quot; or &quot;oh ok that was just a dream&quot;.  I will assume that everyone has had one of those type of dreams in their lifetime. Just one. Thats all i need.<br />
<br />
Now when you are dreaming, what do you know? Perhaps you know that you are on a sandy beach with a hot date.  But is this true? No.  Your really in your bed, or on your couch, or at your desk or where ever you really are.  If its not true, then its really not knowledge.  So when your dreaming you cant know anything.<br />
<br />
Now if when your dreaming you cant know anything, and you cant tell if your dreaming or not, how can you be sure if you ever really know anything.<br />
<br />
People will say no i know im not dreaming right now, i just know.  How can you be sure you wont wake up in a second and be like &quot;whoa that was just a dream&quot;.<br />
<br />
You cant be.<br />
<br />
You cant be postive you know anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much the dream argument, from Descartes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Along the lines of your question, how do you &quot;know&quot; that you actually exist?  Can you not be the construct of someone else's active imagination or vivid dream?  Sorta like the Socrate's Cavern principle.</div></div><hr />

Who wants to know, and who are you asking?<br />

(For the later poster, the cave was Plato's, not Socrates'.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a mathematician. Mathematicians know a lot of things, and don't worry about whether its raining outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In one sense it all comes down to faith.  Faith that the world your living in is the world in which you belong.<br />
<br />
But once faith is established that certain things (in this case &quot;reality&quot;) is true then you can work from those confines on to other assumptions and finally knowledge.<br />
<br />
NOTE: when using &quot;World&quot; it can be applied as the word &quot;Universe&quot; in most circumstances... &quot;World&quot; is not just the &quot;planet&quot; we live on but rather the entire &quot;reality&quot; we are discussing.<br />
<br />
I assume through faith that the world I operate in has certain laws and as such will behave a certain way.  These are primarily refered to as scientific laws and behave the same way under the same conditions each time.<br />
<br />
My inner mind or imagination where dreams are kept and created is another world unto itself with a different set of laws often which are changable to some extant by partly my own will.<br />
<br />
Outside this world is a third world I assume through faith exists that would be the domain of God or some people refer to it as the spiritual world.<br />
<br />
Within each world I do &quot;know&quot; things that are true and apply to those worlds in each instance.  For instance I know in this reality that there is some force acting on me to hold me to the ground.  I assume its gravity and that the working scientific model for gravity is an accurate depiction of this force.<br />
<br />
In my dreams the rules can be a bit more chaotic though in many cases I have direct control over them.  In most dreams I can tell I am dreaming.  I've trained myself to look for things that indicate that I'm dreaming through reading various studies on dreamers.  For instance most dreamers can not read while in the dream world.  It is possible to have one particular key phrase be seen but books and signs are often at best symbolic pictograms of thoughts we have.  If I start seeing these in my dream that is a pretty good tip off.<br />
<br />
Secondly abnormal movement.  In dreams it is common for dreamers to experience sweeping scene changes OR to see other people move from place to place in times that are simply improbable.  Again these are signs that I pick up when I'm dreaming.  Interestingly enough it doesn't take me long to figure out that I'm dreaming and therefore can often take control of the dream and bend and twist it to my desires.  I rarely have nightmares mainly due to the fact that as soon as I realize I'm having one I'm able to take control of it and stop whatever is scaring me.<br />
<br />
The rare time I do have a nightmare its less of a dream and more of a nighttime memory coming to the surface.  Since the memory is an actual event recorded in my mind it plays the same each time and therefore I do not control it.<br />
<br />
The spiritual world also has certain laws about it in most cases well beyond my control but I cannot discuss them here since religion is banned.  But in the case of philosophy you rarely can seperate ones religious views from their working philosphical views.  In the case of most philosophically aware Christians the premise which everything else is built upon is based on a faith in God and His orderly will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boils down to the question &quot;Is perception reality?&quot;  Which is the simplest way of asking if you can trust your 5 or 6 or 7 or more senses.  There is no true absolute answer to this question, the answer that comes the closest is &quot;sometimes.&quot;  There are at least thousands more answers, perhaps millions.<br />
<br />
Of them all, the one I like the most is &quot;No, but its the closest you're going to get.&quot;<br />
<br />
When getting long winded, which I usually do, I'll add many modifiers.  Such as:<br />
<br />
If you always question everything, you have no time to do anything. <br />
Go with your gut instinct, if you're right you're right, if you're wrong you're wrong.  Everybody is wrong sometime. <br />
If everything is illusion, does it matter if you take time to enjoy it?<br />
We don''t have the technology to create holodecks, the safeties are not on, and if you jump off the bridge, shouting end program will not help.<br />
See that brick wall, punch it.  Do you know if it is there now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to Jorana's question how do can one know that they exist.<br />
<br />
I think therefore i am.<br />
<br />
I know im thinking, by merely pondering wheather i exist i am thinking, and to be thinking, i must exist, in some form.  I may not exist as a human, perhaps im simply a soul, or perhaps im a different type of creature, but i do exist in some form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venture</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think therefore i am.<br />
<br />
<br />
What if you only think you're thinking?<br />
<br />
Maybe you're some kind of a construct playing out a pre-written script, with no animus at all.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're just part of the scenery.<br />
<br />
This kind of solipsism is totally useless, and is largely responsible for turning the practice of philosophy from a respected profession to a laughing stock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laliana Tucckerr</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, self reflection is something I have yet to make the characters in my dreams do.  Yes, I've learned hwo to take control of them too.  sometimes they get carried away, and i wake up thinging something happened when it really didn't and it was just a dream.  There have been other times when i got up and performed actions in real life that i was doign in my dreams.  Sometimes I can read everything, sometimes I can read nothign and it feels like I need better glasses and I can't keep my eyes open.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, because you're not having any actual thoughts, just a bunch of sensations being played like a MP3.<br />
<br />
Then there's always the quote (from Einstein?  Churchill?  can't remember): &quot;Many men believe they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was a philosophy student; I've seen this argument before, ad nauseum.  It's nonsensical solipsism, and the best reply to it is &quot;thus do I refute Berkelely&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking certain things for granted such as the current universe many things can be proved mathematically.  If you have run the proof yourself for something then you can be said to know it.<br />
<br />
Depending on how firm your grasp on reality is, you may or may not know anything else.  For instance, I know that the god of teriyaki wields an enormous okonomiyaki spatula but I'm notoriously reality impaired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wwen Valimar</div><div class="date">04-14-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well being awake and just dreaming have a very different feeling. I know I am awake now (if only barely) because a dream has a sort of surreal feeling to It. But while dreaming I won't know any of the events were just figments of my imagination until I wake up in a cold sweat cause the orange just took a bite out of my finger. Occasionally while dreaming I can say that I deffinitely got the feeling that I was in fact dreaming. But that sort of thing is pretty rare. I have read how people can control what they dreaming, but I don't have any personal experiance with that sort of thing so I can't really vouch for its validity... I thought I was working up to some point but I think I just kinda trailed off... Ah well its sunday. Too much thinking on the weekend is bad for you.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to add that the great thing about is dream, at least when events are going your way or its just a cool dream, is that you don't know its not really happening. Unlike any daydreaming one may do while in class or at work, where you are just escaping reality for a moment during the day. So its a bit more satisfying to wake up from a good dream. But I digress... Unforetuneately I never really have good dreams. They are usually just strange. Go figure. :D</div></div><hr />

Does anybody really care</div></div><hr />
