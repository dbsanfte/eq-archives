<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is anecdotal but it seems to me, at least on Xev the numbers (of people) seem to be down. I'll use Bazaar as an example.<br />
<br />
Normally on a Friday or Saturday you can't get a spot. 550 people is the norm.  Last night 428 people at midnight, and tonight, 375 at 0030 (1230 am).<br />
<br />
This is just one zone I realize, but I was suprised both nights to find a spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, server population is definitely down.  A lot of other class boards have already had threads like this.  I don't think a huge number of people have cancelled yet but a ton of people just aren't playing nearly as much.  I'm in an EP guild that is non-manditory raiding so we're feeling the hurt.  We've had about 6 people actually cancel their accounts and probably 40 people go from raiding 5 nights a week to once or twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">exam times for lots of people, a few new games launching too, and nice weather is here.  We've seen numbers drop a bit spring-summer every year in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drinnar hit the nail on the head. Exams, Lineage 2 and City of Heros went live this week, and nice weather will get people away from their computers for a bit. <br />
<br />
Those gone because of exams will return next week when exams are over. If Lineage 2 and City of Heros don't keep people's attention, they will return in a few weeks. The nice weather will keep the attention of the people who aren't around for that reason. You might see them in the fall. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a lot of new content coming out and I think EQ Burn Out has set in. I’ve not played in about three weeks, my RL friends seem to still be plugging along playing but not as much as they use too. <br />
<br />
I’ve been playing UT2004 and I’m waiting to sign up for EQII Beta tomorrow (Monday, May 3rd). I’m sure quite a few people are considering Lineage II, WoW, not to mention UT2004, Half-Life II, Doom II, City of Hero's just to name a few. <br />
<br />
This will be a great summer for gamers, a bit of a wait and see for game designers so as to see what’s hot and what’s not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Xev was once listed about 2/3 the way down the list when ranking the servers by population.  Now it is usually about 1/3 of the way down.<br />
<br />
That alone precludes any real conclusions about server populations in general.  Maybe players from Xev are moving to other servers.  Maybe other servers are growing faster than Xev.  Maybe the Xev population is leaving faster than other servers. However, I can also say that the population of Xev appears to me to be down somewhat compaired to what is was just a few months ago. Whether they are moving to other servers or just simply leaving the game I do not know.<br />
<br />
FV, on the other hand, seems to be more popular than ever.  Maybe the Xev players have moved there.  That's where I now go to hide from the raid demands.</div></div><hr />

     You can't move characters to and from FV, otherwise I would have moved my rotting 57 druid from FV to Brell already.  That being said, from what I have seen on my server a lot of the high-enders have left.  We had 1-2 Time guilds actively recruiting for the month of April and a few elemental guilds who I think are still actively recruiting.  A lot of guys are just getting burned out with the game.  While GoD offers new raid content and new loot, it still seems to be shrouded in the unknown.  PoP, I think, was more of a linear expansion.  When I opened the PoP expansion I already had a good idea on what had to be done to get from point A to point D.  GoD doesn't seem to be like that, and I think it might be due to &quot;storyline?&quot;.  Dunno, but coming from a few friends who are currently at that point of the game, there doesn't seem to be a real desire to go to GoD outside of loot opportunities.</div></div><hr />
