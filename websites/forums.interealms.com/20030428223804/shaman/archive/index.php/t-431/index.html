<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fiddling around with the original alchemy herbs sold in Shar Vahl, i noticed that you can sell back the single potions for only a plat or two difference in price. This was making vampiric spirit potions, herb cost ~27pp. Potion sold back for ~26pp to an ally vendor in SH.<br />
<br />
The catch? Well, you will have to spend a lot of time hunting the dropped items needed. But, it could also be cheaper to go farm some vendors for items like lightstones and toes as you would only lose about 8-9pp on the deal instead of the full cost minus ~10% if you are powerskilling.<br />

Here's a link to the EQTraders website where they have original alchemy recipes:<br />
