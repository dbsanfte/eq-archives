At L 61, it looks like Rangers get not 1 new spell.  Every spell is just a copy of  other class's lower level spells.<br />

Am I missing something, or does this suck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nalyn</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, while we don't get any big spell upgrades at 61, we do get a few useful ones, annul is nice for pulling because more often than not you get all a given npc's buff with one cast.  Exile summoned is our biggest nuke vs summoned, and with the hybrid spell haste, its cast time goes WAY down.  Counteract poison/disease kinda does suck, never really had a use for either besides removing tash after we'd killed a chanter mob.  The resist spell is nice, at least as far as I'm concerned, ever had a raid where you get to fight an ae mob, with no druid?<br />
<br />
From what I've heard and read, our level 62 spells are MUCH nicer than our lvl 61's.</div></div><hr />
