<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought maybe it would make sense to have SoE just take the Beastlord pets, turn the alpha value down a tad (making them transparent) and viola each race has a unique spirit pet with no real extra overhead.<br />

Does this make sense, or do people like having just the same spirit dog model?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want a unique pet for each race make a beastlord...if you're a shaman you get a semi transparant wolf.  Instead of asking them to waste time on inane stuff like this, why not ask them to make things like rabid bear more useful.</div></div><hr />

Completely changing the function of an AA is no small task.  You have to come up with the idea, code it, balance it, test it, recode it, etc...<br />
<br />
However, you could probably knock out new models for our pets in about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Little changes like this that just make the game a little cooler is something that I wish SOE would do more.  It is like particle effects on items.  Do you really need it?  No, but they are still pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, SOE hardly ever does anything like this.  I'd say the odds of getting rabid bear revamped, ever are about 1%.  New pet models I would give a 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">who said anything about revamping anything? i said more useful which could mean anything (like lowering refresh which is the only real thing i've supported)<br />
and they WONT do the pet thing because of global memory..i'm sure the faded pet and other both require a seperate entry.  Also, frogs would get what pet? so there's even more to put forth as far as effort goes..i give new pet models a .000001% chance and changing rabid bear for the better (duration) that 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I miss the original doggy model which was a solid light blue with a white underbelly. Making it transparent does make sense since it's a doggy summoned from the spirit world but I still have nostalgia for the original model.</div></div><hr />

Bit of a difference there.  No ghosted scale wolf for me, but thanks.  I like the one I have and even miss the old one sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zybann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The thing about the beastlord pet is that it is slave to his master not a summoned creature from an alternate plane.  <br />
Shaman pet is a spirit from the netherworld, summoned in the form of a wolf.<br />
Mage pet is an elemental summoned from the elemental planes<br />
Necromancer pet is an undead servant summoned from death itself<br />
Beast lord although it is a spell, its true intention was for him to be master of the beast, therego the name. So in truth, the creature isnt summoned at all, it is a creature of this plane, and has succombed to the Beastlord, as his servant.<br />
So as far as it being transparent, it shouldnt be, because it is an animal, no different than the other creatures of Norrath.<br />

<br />
Exactly. This is why Beastlord pets were initially a skill they acquired at level 9 and not a spell. Originally, Beastlords would summon a level 1 pet and buff it with the &quot;Spirit of &lt;Insert Funky Name Here&gt;&quot;. Now, the Spirit line just summons their pet of the appropriate level.<br />

<br />
Well, this is SoE, so the process is a bit different.  They came up with an idea, almost finish coding it, implement it, bring servers down to patch it, over balance it, reimplement it, then nerf it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The code already exists for rabid bear, and it would take very little to rebalance it.  Increasing atk a little, decreasing recast time, increasing duration should take very little recoding if it was coded properly in the first place.  Slap it on the test server for a week or so, and viola, you've got a quick fix.  I seriously doubt it would take much to make the current form of the ability useful.<br />
<br />
Now if you wanted to change RB along the lines some have suggested in other threads, yes, there would be much more effort required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hardly ever use pet i probably wouldnt notice.  How bout they fix my bears droopy lip?<br />
<br />
Not that it matters but i second Jinheims idea about more particle effects.  I would go further and say I want more unique looking weapons and shields, armors.  Nothing like getting loots in Vex Thal that look like that rusty mace Orc_Pawn25141 dropped in EC.  Or Time loots that look the same as the stuff you were getting in Tier 1 zones.  I think it would just add to the specialness of having access to those zones, kinda a badge of honor, like the epic was back when so few had it.  Would also add to the uniqueness of characters, instead of every shaman from equally flagged or powered guilds (and sometimes not!) all looking exactly the same pretty much except for the dye on their armors.</div></div><hr />

Shaman receive their first summon pet spell at level 34.  <br />

<br />
All the summon pet spells are purchased from in WK.<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion is used by pet classes to shrink their pets, it's pretty stupid for shaman since we already have, well, shrink.<br />
<br />
We also receive Summon Companion at level 44, this will allow us to call an already summoned (and non aggro) to our side if they get lost.<br />
