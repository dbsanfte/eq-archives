<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mekil, the Ro Cauldron is Lore, MM granite is no drop - also, the combined Fairy Dusts no drop and lore.<br />
<br />
So for every bar of Ronium, you need to go to Temple of Sol Ro for the container, go to Kaladim to combine fairy dusts for Soil of Underfoot - then combine in the container for one bar of Ronium. Get new pouch of Soil, go to Sol Ro for Container, combine for one bar of Ronium. Get new container, go to Kaladim, get...<br />
<br />
I HATE RONIUM!<br />
<br />
But if you have any questions, feel free to ask me in game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh I feel your pain Drolgin...:)...This was required for the Ivy Etched Boots quest (just one bar mind you)...Of course that was back when smithing was required to make the ronium...<br />
<br />
And of course Rangers can't just run about killing Fairies as Fairie faction was required for the Raincaller Quest...<br />
<br />
I ended up doing Ro Armour a lot for friends once it got out that I knew how to make Ronium...</div></div><hr />
