<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search and didn't find the answer to my question.<br />
<br />
After lugging around rusties for too long, I finally thought, I wonder if I can hand a pet a no-drop weapon?  I'm thinking no, but if you can, please let me know.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about that little newbie quest in Halas that yields a crappy neck item that summons a no-rent no-drop hammer.  That would soooo rock for the doggie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I asked that question on this board about 6 months ago.  The answer to my questions was that pets cannot accept no-drop items.  It may look like they do, but they don't.  I wish we could see them taking the weapon, so we had a better idea, but then again, they have have paws and not hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does not work. Neck item was tested and no luck im afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never tried it myself cause I was told it wouldn't work.. but I'm thinknig about trying it with a primal 1h blunt that I got on me one of these days ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tested it with a couple easy to get nodrop weaps, ages ago.  Didn't see the damage type Goner did change to reflect the weapon I tried to give him.  He kept biting, when he should have been crushing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Neck item was tested and no luck im afraid<br />
<br />
only one reason to do this quest and to use the item and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'm still so mad about it... :confused: <br />
<br />
Until something works we are all carrying crap weapons like sheeps. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kome_battle_shm,<br />
     I dunno about that, I did the quest at level 5, and I thought the weapon was great at the time.  It also gave a little light (which was a god send).  Unless your a twinky (Twink), it is a nice little quest, that get you out and exploring the area for the fisrt time.  Blackburrow scared the He** outta me (sigh, I kinda miss those days)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">:rolleyes: <br />
Not a twink, done the quest in 1999 , and it was already an useless quest except for the light good point...  ;) <br />
Anyway in 2003 I'm waiting a bit more of it, a least for my pet.  :p</div></div><hr />
