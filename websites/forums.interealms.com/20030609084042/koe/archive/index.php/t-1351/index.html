<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bumping to reflect update, and b/c I heard one of these spells mentioned in /gu last night.  Folks, please consider guildmates before selling spells/gems on the open market.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bumping a 2nd time since this had dropped off the 30-day list :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know I have seen form of the hunter drop in the last week. Maybe in VL or Chardok. Sorry can't remember and I didn't loot it or you would have it.<br />
<br />
Also I'd be happy to go hunting with you Timbo. Perhaps we can go to NE corner of Skyfire with anyone else looking for spells. I don't have any plans for tonight. Also the lvl 60 wurms there drop spells too and the named.</div></div><hr />

I would LOVE a chance to goto skyfire and thump on  names spawns. <br />
<br />
I need to mez one in there for my epic quest so that would be an added bonus<br />
<br />
Faelia Goldenwing - Skyfire (1550, -1000)<br />
<br />
                               <br />
<br />
Enchanted Sapphire <br />
                                        <br />
<br />
She's a tiny Chromodrac. Skyfire is exactly like Trakanons Teeth. Consider Faelia to be the Skyfire version of the Froglok Forager/Hunter spawns. With a<br />
druid/ranger you can pull the funky spawns and eventually you will get her. All of these spawn near the Burning Woods zone and people who camp that area see her<br />
dozens of times a day. Mobs there will agro her and kill her soon after she pops. <br />
<br />
Please let me know when you are going and count me in:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I could go tonight. We would need at least a healer so if Timbo can come we can kill 2 birds with one stone. Well we don't NEED a healer but sure makes it safer and more fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok count me in. I'll be online tonight prob by 6pm  eastern. It would also be nice to have some more TTU(trademarked from turtle raid from an unknown source) <br />
<br />
Mish<br />
<br />
btw TTU was explained to be Treehugger Tracking Units</div></div><hr />
