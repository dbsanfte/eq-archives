<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone have found some good quests that result in stuff special for shamans ?<br />
<br />
If you did can you post the start NPC, city and reward ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest going to Greystone and seeing the Armorer there.  Do a quest for him to collect 10 snake scales in the caves and you get a good noob weapon for any class.  I am at work right now and don't have all of the info handy, but the sword I use right now is the reward from that quest <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very cool! Thanks for the tip. Where did you get the quest for your Chainmail Tunic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's the warrior tunic that you get when you choose your class and defeat the task associated.  no doubt the other classes all have something similar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh cool! I'm working on my class quest now.<br />
<br />
I can't wait if my Shaman Tunic is anything remotely similar to that Chainmail. (Minus the AC etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You wont have much luck finding any chain like items (in terms of AC) until around level 20 I Believe. My shaman was 17 in beta and I didnt have the skill to wear chain armor yet- I asked in the priest channel and im pretty sure they said level 20.<br />
<br />
As far as just chain 'looks' go, I found something in Qeynos for my dr00d but I dont recall the name..ill try to remember. There was no chain appearance tunic for my shaman in qeynos that I could find however (up to that point)<br />
<br />
Dont give up =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You raise a good question.<br />
<br />
How do you raise &quot;Skill&quot; in things like Chain armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You raise a good question.<br />
<br />
How do you raise &quot;Skill&quot; in things like Chain armor?<br />
<br />
Stuff like Chain Armor you acquire the skill at a certain level and then it goes up every level. Its how they put the level limit on items so you cant supertwink a level 1, etc. Some weapon skills you also get at certain levels.<br />
<br />
Other skills you have from the beginning and you work up as you use them (swimming, crushing, slashing, etc)</div></div><hr />
