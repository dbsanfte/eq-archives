<br />
i have LoY, but i have no idea how to get there?  i know there is a book in stonebrunt, but i don't know where the zone in is, or how to get to the beach in gunthak, which is my destination.<br />
<br />
anybody have some up to date maps?  the ones in game seem to only show me what's at my elevation, rather than the entire zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">howler, there is a &quot;Height&quot; button on the interactive map. Click it so that it is not down. That will get rid of the elevation issue. Also, go to maps.eq-toolbox.com and download a whole set of new maps. They are helpful.<br />
<br />
From stonebrunt you need to run south to the waters edge and then turn left and run along the cliff until you see a boat. Run onto the boat and click on the doors. That will zone you into Gunthark. Use levitation before you make the run from the book so you don't need to worry about running off the cliff.<br />
<br />
Get a port to Stonebrunt, the run is kinda long from pok. Take the pok book to toxxulia forest, then run to Paineel, then the warrens, then stonebrunt. A druid port is often much quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, I can't count the number of times I was supposed to meet someone in Gunthak, but they didn't want to spend all that time running through the Warrens. They would insist they could get a port quicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okee, meet ya there.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okee, at the LightHouse. Where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I found a druid, I'll be there as soon as he ports me.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the druid or wizard isn't in my group and in port range right then, I aint gonna wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea it is a bit of a pain, I'll throw a ooc for a port to SB up there wait bout 30 seconds if I get no response then I go running to the tox book. If someone can port you now, ok good great, if you have to wait longer then that it's not too terribly tough to run through the warrens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once you learn the route, the warrens is quick and easy.  Total run time about 6 min or so from PoK to Gunthak.  A port is more trouble than its worth now that I know the route.<br />
<br />
Be sure to kill the two skellies guarding the zone into Paineel to restock up on a couple pet weaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh and when taking the book to Tox Forest make sure you grab the right one.  There are attually TWO books in Tox forest one near Painel and One near Eurdin.  Needless to say you want to take the one to Painel that is located in POK on the Evil side int the far back corner.  Other wise you have run across the zone to get to painel which will take you a min or two longer if it really matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is there a book in SB? If so where, and where does it go to?  I've always run through the warrens or paid for a port when I was in a real rush. <br />
<br />
If anyone knows of this book and where you can port to it from please post.</div></div><hr />
