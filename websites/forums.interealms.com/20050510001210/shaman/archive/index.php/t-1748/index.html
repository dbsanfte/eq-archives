<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fearoffire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am having trouble decicing which of these to play.  Currently I have a lvl 14 necro, lvl 12 shaman and lvl 9 beastlord.  I love them all but I need to focus on one so I can actually get to the high lvls hehe:D  So I was wondering what your guys thoughts are.  I want a fun enjoyable class but powerful.  Any help is welcome thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello fearofffire, <br />
<br />
<br />
        First question i have to ask is long term. Do you have any idea if your planning on wanting to do highend raid stuff? Alot of grouping or soloing? I ask becuase all 3 classes are pretty powerful from what i gather. I dont know about the BL so much but have exp with the other 2. Necros are great for soloing but they dont get asked to group very easily. I personally dont see why but alot of time that can be the case. In Dungeons a pet class also might have a harder time getting a group due to all the bad pathing. Which leads me to a shaman. You can group or solo both easily as you get higher in lvls and shaman are also wanted on raids. Necros can be boring i think on raids get asked to give mana to the clerics alot and not a real defined role. Beastlords i think are kinda in a quandry in raid situations also since they use lower version of shaman buffs they arent buffing alot (with a few exceptions of their own type buff that stacks) <br />
<br />
    Actually let me say this , hard to give advice without knowing what you want out of eq. <br />
<br />
    Shaman i think will be easier to group or solo all the way up. Thier power takes a bit to kick in though and can be slow and increase steadily after maybe lvl 24 up to being uber later in life.     <br />
<br />
   Necros power proably kicks in maybe a little sooner and carries nicely to at least the 50's and probably up to 60. They however tend to be shunned from groups sometimes and soloing all the time can get boring. <br />
<br />
  I gather BL's can solo up just fine and do the exp group thing ok but not sure of their place in raids. Bl's power tends to flux as they lvl i think. What i mean is when they get a new pet at lvl 22 the mobs they are facing they tend to probably be powerful. But as they hit 28 , 29 before a new pet at 30 maybe slows down a bit and so on as they lvl up. <br />
<br />
 Well done writing a book here maybe someone with more exp with the BL can help ya out and maybe give the same info in a condensed version lol. Good luck and any of the 3 classes you mention can be fun and powerful like you want. <br />
 &quot;edited forget to add my choice =P&quot;<br />
Course out of those 3 i have played em all some and shaman is my pick having a blast with mine<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fearoffire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to solo a lot due to the amount of time I am allowed hehe.  Thats the reason for a good soloing class.  I've heard that shamans/necros are some of the best soloing classes.  Seriously I enjoy both.  Its like choosing between chocolate chip icecream or rocky road hehe tuff.  I want to do damage but yet still be a fun class to play ya know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Briarbear Spiritmonger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my opinion i think a shaman is much more versitile.  They can solo well and if you would ever want to group you would never really have a hard time finding one.  Out of all my time playing both of these characters i like my shaman the best but i dont have lucin so i cant say anything about the BL. Choose what you will enjoy though because their both fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on raids our necro's hotkey is &quot;mana dumping to cleric /T%&quot;<br />
<br />
but solo they are great - and they make a great duo with a shaman, too.<br />
<br />
BL - got to outdamage the pet to be a good solo class.  not sure about how well they do that all the time (mine is level 10 - I have to damage the mob some before i drag it ot the warder)<br />
<br />
shaman - I love it - what can I say ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm in the same predicament as you, I don't know much about BL's so I won't comment of them. I have both a Necro (my first toon) and a Shaman. I will say that Necros can deal damage over time and quite frankly scare the crap out of me. I hate fighting them with any class, even ones several levels lower than me. They are pretty much a solo class and have a difficult time grouping, and at the high end game they aren't much more than mana batteries on raids. <br />
But for the primary soloist like myself Necro was a good class, and  can be low maintenance. As they don't require heavy armor, great melee weapons, etc, etc, etc. As mana is their lifeblood load up on mana/int and away ya go. The problem with pure casters is they rely on spells almost completely. I hated that, I like more options.<br />
I personally got sick of getting resists/pet dying and me getting the snot kicked out of me with a necro. So I switched to my Shaman, and I'm having much more fun with my Shammy than my necro. If I get some resists its not that big a deal I can melee a bit plus heal myself if I get in a pinch. I can group and solo and if I decide I want to become a &quot;raiding&quot; player I can do that with the Shaman. I personally like both classes, Necros are awesome but I like the Shaman more because I feel I can do more with my Shaman. I can group, solo, dungeon, non-dungeon, raid, I can do it all with the Shaman. <br />
I guess its all a matter of what you want to do as a player. Soloing exclusively can get boring that's what you'll be doing mostly with the Necro, the Shaman can do it all.<br />
That's my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before taking a break from Eq, I played a lvl 52 necro.<br />
<br />
They're exactly right.  All I did on raids was mana dump to clerics/enchanters/etc.<br />
<br />
I rarely got invited to group and if I did, it was only because I had friends hunting there.  Solo'ing 100% of the time became boring very quickly.<br />
<br />
I also played a shaman, such as yourself.  But for the first 34 levels, I found it very tough.  Once you get the pet, everything changes.  Unfortunately I let my account go right as I reached lvl 34 with my shaman, so I didn't get a whole lot of time to play around with him,but I did get to play with the doggie :) <br />
<br />
This time around though, I will be playing a shaman exclusively.  I believe my frustration with EQ came from solo'ing all the time, so this time around I'm going to try grouping much more.  And what better class to group with than a shaman :) <br />
<br />
Ask yourself these 2 questions. <br />
<br />
Do you like soloing?(necro)<br />
Do you like grouping?(shaman)<br />
<br />
Because I guarantee you, when asking yourself whether or not you want to play a shaman or a necro, it will all boil down to those 2 questions.  It stinks, but those are the facts.<br />
<br />
Good luck with either choice.</div></div><hr />

Necro is the most versitile out of the 3;  charm, mez, heal, souped up mana regen, pet, Feign Death, snare, Fear and the best dots in the game. Also makes for a great group character but you won't get many pickup groups because people are afraid of the soloing shaman who never learned how to group and a lot of people just don't realize how powerful a well-played necro is. Sucks as a raid class though. Doesn't need expensive equipment to do well. <br />
<br />
Shaman - You won't solo as easily as a necro unless you have a lot of money to spend on equipment, but still solo's well. Much easier to find a group. Sucks on a big raid unless you're one of the highest 2 or 3 shaman there, not nearly as bad as a necro though. <br />
<br />
BST - solos well, deals good damage in groups, all about dealing damage but I don't really know the class. I've never grouped with one at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if its your first char a BL might be great because its easy as hell to level w/ crap equip.  Hell i know a 50 bl who wore rawhide armour to lvl 35, and solod the whole time.<br />
<br />
BLs have crap raid abilities, because most raids are pet free, but they can solo amazingly well as you can have you and warder eating up the mob, and if you are hurting, step back and heal while warder tanks, easy stuff.<br />
<br />
Necros are great after lvl 12, but dont expect to outdamage your pet much before that, and BOOOOORING high levels<br />
<br />
shammys can do it all basicly, solo better then anyone 50+, and amazingly well after 34, but we come into ourprimes very late...49 is our greatest solo level(plague/ebolt).<br />

im not 'quite' there yet...dont play enough :(.  how noticeable was the increase in soloing power was it when you got our little puppy? 30-33 quite frankly suck...and i want to know how much i am actually suffering for =p lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Look, most of these guys are saying shamans can solo like champs 50plus meaning that with JBB/Fungi/Epic more or less. If you start from scratch, and are facing a lot of solotime then I presume you won't be able to gather big wealths or join raiding guilds etc to get such items. Without any of these items, shamans will be out soloed by necro/bst.<br />
<br />
If you really gonna face tons of solo and the above is true, I would advice necro/beast lord (would propably go BL myself, but that's just personal preference) ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had no problems soloing my shaman 40-50 with no JBB/Funci/Epic.  I have a JBB now at 53 and it makes a difference, but it's mostly a difference in downtime.  I don't think the equipment is make or break.<br />
<br />
Besides, a JBB is not that hard to get (at least on my server) if you just sell lots of SOW potions and save your cash for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lvl 30 to 33 sucked as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Yes..it's a world of difference starting at 34.  The dog, as weak as he might be, is definately helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seriously,<br />
Everyone thinks shaman and they think JBB and epic - some of us don't have that equip...  A totally untwinked shaman is very tough to solo pre 34.  With doggy it gets better but both my necro and my mage outsoloed the crap out of my shaman.  However, the nice thing about shaman is that they can wear chain, so you can actually twink them ala warroir style and prettymuch melee your way to lvl 24ish.  24 to 34 is still tough though.  Unless you have uber gear, you're just not keeping up with the damage to kill mobs.  34 gets decent and seems to be getting better as I level (currently 46)  <br />
<br />
My mage and my necro both were far better soloers than my shaman.  But for clarification:  necros and mages solo FASTER (which means leveling quicker), but shamans solo EASIER (as in you can take more than your fair share of hits).  <br />
<br />
Soloing does get pretty darn boring post 50 so I'd reccomend AGAINST playing a necro - play a shaman instead.  You can solo if you need to, and when you get the time to play for a couple of hours, you can easily find a good group.<br />
<br />
But as the first replier said &quot;what answer did you expect from a bunch of Shamans&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
Kongar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Post 50, I'd take a good necro over a good wizzie/mage in a heartbeat...maybe you all need to get some play time with decent necros?<br />
<br />
Back to topic, do NOT make a beastlord as your main. They're a class that slapped in for fun value mostly-nice alts, but bad mains. <br />
<br />
If you see yourself soloing most often, go with necro. If you want to group more, or do both pretty easily, go shaman.</div></div><hr />
