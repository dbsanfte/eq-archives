<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">only worth going for fabled or for quest mobs.  Has a low zem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Used to camp Hand room and Warlord room back in my low 40s, until I could get into PoP. KC was Train City back on Terris, but had lots of pickup action. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The horror stories were from yesteryear...ie. when it the zone for lvl 45+ when Kunark was the only expansion.  It was nothing more than train central, /shout screaming matches, FD monks on the bridge, lvl 50 noobs, and &quot;interesting&quot; pathing.  Now that the zone is almost always empty it can be a very fun zone to be in - of course with the Fabled spawns - I'm sure there's more folks back in there now...<br />
<br />
As spiritsofding says - there's a low zem.  Yet amazingly enough some people don't always concern themselves with monitoring the exp bar after every pull - shocking I know...<br />
If you're on a run to lvl 65 - definitely avoid this zone - its not for you. <br />
<br />
The dungeon can be very fun and at times difficult.  The basement can yield some excellent steady easy kills providing you can break it...thats the exciting part.  The hands and Drolvarg warlord can be fun too...very tricky if you're soloing though.<br />
<br />
Caster mobs are in ghost form...all dogs/skelies are melee types.  It's an outdoor zone - so you can use your horse/sow.<br />
<br />
Until you get a feel for the place - I would start with the Captain or one of the Courtyards.  If you're mowing through this stuff then head in deeper...<br />
