<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 41 currently and would really like some good exp. I play on the offtime on my server so maybe bloodgills would be the best way to go. <br />
<br />
I am looking for some tips on how to take them out. I know there are 12 spawns and they spawn underwater, that is about it. Do I need to use EB? At what lvl can I take these guys efficiently? How do I get to them? What do they drop, I would assume the standard loio loot. Whatever I missed.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gonna be reasonably hard. At 41, im thinking 2x2 spawns will be your limit, if you can even manage that. Not ragging on you of course, but they can still be fairly tough. In your situation, i think the best way would be to go to ill omen, find your way around the lake until you find the big goblin ruins (filled with soothsayers warriors etc), and make a pet down near the little peninsular leading out into the lake. (i think there is a fallen pillar near there. it's a bit hazy) Sow and lev yourself, then run out to the platform thing that has an astral projection on it. bout 100 feet before you get to the platform, head into the water, swim straight down, then keep slowly moving up to the underwater side of the platform. eventually you will see a goblin sitting down there. <br />
<br />
He is looking straight at another goblin, but you might not be able to see him yet. Root that one. If it sticks, cool. turn around, swim to the surface, and run a little way back to the beach. after you have gone a little ways, turn around and see if you have a goblin on your tail, swimming near the surface. if you have, cool, hightail it to the beach. Get ready to slow him, sick dog on him when he get's outa the water, slow him, VoS him and start whacking on him. or poking him.<br />
<br />
The goblin you rooted should still be sitting back there. Root will wear off, but he won't add cause you have gone out of lazy agro range. Once you have killed the one you are killing, med a bit then go out and get the other one. you will only have to approach him, he will still be very agro on you and with a larger agro range. stay on top of the water, then get ready to run when he hits you.<br />
<br />
Kill him. The spawn time on these guys are 13 min, so use your own judgement to decide whether you can repeat the process with the other platform you will see to your right out in the lake.<br />
<br />
If you can kill them all, it becomes a question of whether you want to fight underwater or on land. I personally chose underwater, cause i wanted to get swimming up. But now you have broken the spawn so it isnt that difficult. <br />
<br />
I didnt kill em til 44, and I found i needed my big DD, cause I was VERY ghetto equipped back then. With your 780 unbuffed ac, you might be able to tank em pretty well, so at this point, my advice to you is give it a go =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanksm havent updated yet, but just hit 42 about 30 min ago, and I have 832 ac unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunted in nurga from 40 til 44-45 ish.<br />
hunt slaves til 44 then go kill spiders on other side of zone til 45 i believe.<br />
<br />
their are 3 pairs of slaves that random spawn as iksar, goblin or burnyai(sp?), the iksar drop iksar blood which can be used for iksar cultural armor if you have good smithing and is good armor, or maybe even sell it to fellow iksars.  the slaves can be singled most of the time as some face away from each other or use the line of sight pull technique.  the goblin slaves are mages and have pets and they are the hardest, pull them by rooting pet.<br />
<br />
there is a big open room which is a good spot to pull and park pet on back wall as pathing is bad there.  once you get the spawn down u can pull the goblin before he gets a pet and own.<br />
i went to loio bloodgills after nurga but up to u.:)  I agree with smylee to pull to the fallen pillar opposite side of 4p with pet chillin there and make sure to keep pet backoff key on first page unless u want to fight in water which i find to be annoying due to interupts.</div></div><hr />
