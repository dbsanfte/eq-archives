<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have been doing tech support for a little over 2 years now, and as anyone knows that amount of time in tech support is more than enough to drive anyone crazy.  My problem is other than highschool I have no formal education.  (Other than a few basic college courses.)  Though I have been doing it for over 2 years this is the third company I have done it with.  (The last two went out of business.)<br />
<br />
So each time I get to a good spot with the company I work for they seem to go under and I have to start over at a new one.  At this point I am sick of tech support but what else can I do?  I would really like to get out of the tech field, but need a job paying at least 12 dollars an hour.<br />
<br />
Now here is the real kicker.  I currently work for the University of Phoenix.  I have been here about 8 months and will soon be eligible for free schooling.  Meaning if I stay here I can get free schooling.  However that means I must stay here doing tech support.  It also means I have to select from one of their degrees.  They have several management degrees, IT, education, law enforcement and nursing.  None of these particularly appeal to me as I would really like to do something in graphic design or some form of art.  <br />
<br />
Would it be dumb to give up free schooling, yes.  Do I want any of the degrees, or for that matter want to stay here the length of time it will take me to finish one, NO!  So what advice do you have for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I'm going to assume by University of Phoenix you do not mean a University local to you in Phoenix with the full run of academic disciplines, but instead mean the national diploma mill that actually makes you do some the work (good thing), but in an accelerated manner.<br />
<br />
Stay there, the UoP Diploma is accepted as a valid college degree by nearly all employers.  It doesn't matter what the degree is in, what matters is that you have the degree.  Sound lame, yes it is, but what the employers look at is whether or not you got the sheepskin.  Then they look at what certificates you have on top of it.  As you are going through UoP's program you can always be picking up internet courses or catching a arts/graphics class or three at the local JC.<br />
<br />
Get the free schooling.  When the economy is in a slump the best place to be is in school.  Its starting to turn around but no guarantees that we are going into another big boom time.  My guess is UoP is going to be around for awhile yet.  Your job should be secure.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeryn</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow flashback!  I spent the last half of the 90s working for internet providers which would grow, go public, get bought out, and have the new management come and lay everyone off.  I'm now working in the calm harbor of the University of Tennessee, which I tell myself is in no danger of being acquired any time soon :D<br />
<br />
Absolutely man, stay right where you're at.  Maybe not even necessarily the University of Phoenix, but at a school.  If you want to get out of the tech field, working somewhere that you can get a decent paycheck, *and* take courses for free can't be beat.  I know UT has a human resources website that lists openings at the university and updates it weekly, and there are generally a hundred jobs or so with varying skill requirements.  I bet there's something similar near you.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yup, here's an example from ASU (assuming Tempe is a viable option):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually,<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't know, University of Phoenix is a nationwide private university. They have a rather limited range of academic specialties. They are an adult education university - you have to be 25 to enroll, I believe.<br />
<br />
That's where I'm getting my MBA. I graduate in seven weeks. It's been an interesting ride, but the accellerated courses are kind of like drinking from a firehose sometimes.<br />
<br />
My advice would be:<br />
<br />
Get an education. It's amazing the doors that will open up for you just by having a bachelor's degree, no matter what it is in. A lot of times the traditional school is too hard for working adults, which is what makes UoP so nice. You have class one night a week, and a meeting with your learning team one other time during the week. It's a lot more convenient than a lot of schools.<br />
I know in Denver they offer a BS in Information Technology. While that might not be EXACTLY what you're looking for, it would sure be a step to getting out of tech support, and making a real carreer.<br />
<br />
You might also look into other adult education courses in your area. Once I had enrolled at UoP, I found out there are literally a dozen different programs in the Denver area. They ususally are good about helping with financial aid, so it can't hurt to try. A few thousand dollars in student loans can be well worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J'horra</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if I do it all I have to pay for is books (1/2 price) and administration fees, (80 bucks here and there).  I guess I should just stay here and get a degree, I just hate the thought of staying here that long in tech support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like you know what you want to do already.  You wouldn't be happy studying business or IT, and you know what you are interested in.  Given that, and assuming you're really committed to working in the graphic art field, I have to disagree with the idea of staying at UoP and getting a degree in a field you're not interested in. <br />
<br />
I say pursue your dreams - if you're going to spend the time to GET a degree, then make it a degree that means something to you.  It will require sacrifices and no, it's not the easiest route, but if what you really want in life is to pursue graphic art, then do it and don't try to force yourself into a mold you're not comfortable with.  Really, what happens when you get a degree in business; you move into another type of office job, still not doing what you want to do, still having to find time to juggle what's now a more demanding job while you go to school, and now facing another 2-4 years of your life not doing what you really want to be doing.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I'd find out about graphic art programs in your area.  If you can go to school during your off-hours, then stay in your current job and do it.  If your job conflicts with your schooling schedule, then find one that fits your needs.  If money's an issue, just remember there are a lot of financial aide and scholarship programs.<br />
<br />
Don't &quot;settle&quot; . . . go out and get what you really want.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I humbly disagree Sionach.  I really wish he could, but I think its impractical for him.<br />
<br />
Its a nice ideal following the dream, but the bottom line is the bottom line.  Right now he has an opportunity to make himself more employable through the place he is at with almost negligble cost to himself.  At the same time he can be following his dreams on the side.  <br />
<br />
If he wanders off to follow the dream full time, to go to a University that offers precisely the program he thinks he wants, then he becomes a starving student competing with the fresh out of high school kids whose parents are paying the way and have the resources to follow their dreams without trying to hold down a job and make the bills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure how old you are or if you have any responsibilitys like kids or a wife but If you don't just apply to the schools you want to get into, into the progams you want.<br />
<br />
Spending a 5 years on a degree is nothing compared to the longterm gains.  I hated school but I did it so I could do what I wanted and its all paying off now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, too, would disagree, Sionach.<br />
<br />
You see, my dream two years ago was to get a doctorate in mathematics. However it was completely impractical for me. Instead, I enrolled at The University of Phoenix to get an MBA in Technology Management. Every business that uses mathematicians also need people who understand how business works. My goal was to make myself marketable to companies like Hughes Electronics that then have good education benefit programs to help me get my masters or doctorate in mathematics.<br />
<br />
What I have found over the past two years is that I have learned a lot of things I would not have been exposed to on my initially chosen path. I've found my direction, and my future carreer, and it's NOT where I originally thought it was. If your focus on your dreams is too narrow, you might end up with a degree you don't want, and you're back at square one. My father got a masters degree in computer science in 1979. Do you think what he learned in those courses has any application today? None at all. <br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with studying what's convenient. The important part is getting the degree, you can flavor it with additional courses and training, but without that BA or BS, you're a step behind. Get whatever degree you can, and take a certification course at a local tech school for web design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethereal</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have to agree with Micheall.<br />
<br />
I have a brother who decided to follow his 'dream'. The thing is, he seemed to do it blindly, and without reguards to how following his dream affects everyone around him.<br />
<br />
He currently owes my parents over 30,000 in bills he cannot pay. He is trying to get a failing buisness off the ground, and has sacrificed any amount of stability in his life for the 'dream' of doing what he 'wants' to do, rather than what it takes to survive. Add a wife and toddler to the mix and I'd have to say he's made some bad descisions. Descisions, for which, they are suffering.<br />
<br />
I am currently working in the IT industry. I spent 2-3 horrible years in Tech support, while keeping an eye open for other opportunities. I moved into IT, and supported a local Calling Center network, eventually becoming a supervisor. I hated that job.<br />
<br />
I kept my eyes open, and now have a contract job working for the government that I at least don't hate. Not my dream job, but a large step up from my previous job. Each step has come from hard work, and vigilance, whether I disliked what I was doing or not. It was almost amazing when I got this job, as I was just becoming a stepfather of 6, and was offered this job at just the right time to be able to support the family.<br />
<br />
From seeing what has happened to my brother, and my own experiences in life, I've observed one thing. Work, hard work, whether enjoyed or not, is never unrewarding or not worth the effort. Somehow, someway, that work will benefit you.<br />
<br />
Look at your situation. Try to figure out how your choice will affect those around you. Then look at your goals and what is important to you. It is ok to chase after a dream, just be careful. Your not the only one affected by your choices, those around you are affected as well.</div></div><hr />
