<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well here we go. I have a 47 Iksar Shaman on Brell, born on April 29th, 2001. Whats that you say? Over a year old and only 47? True. But I took about 4 months break. <br />
<br />
Well the thing is, when I go back to school in Sept I'm not gunna get to play very much, because of my junior year in high school. This is my most important year, so I gotta atleast TRY =P. And on top of that, I share the comp with a younger sister who just sits and talks on AOL. So this is what it looks like - finish schoolwork/homework by 4pm, then 6 hours until I hit the sack @ 10pm for exactly 8 hours of sleep (which isnt enough). But within those 6 hours, ill be using it for 3max, cause the sister and I share. And take into consideration, why would I wanna waste my whole day online? Well livin' in the suburbs doesn't give me many options to go places without begging for a ride. AND I'll probably have a part time job after school.<br />
<br />
No time for EQ I guess. Its hard to be a casual player too, 'cause if ya group with a casual player you'll notice they've been like level 40 for 4 months, and have been playing EQ for 3 years and are on their first char. I just can't see myself playing once a week, whats the point. <br />
<br />
So I figure I should just stop playing EQ as of now, because whats the point? <br />
<br />
I guess this is rather a post to vent and write my problem down.<br />
<br />
But - what do you think I should do? Just bag EQ? or try and find time to play? 3hours a day split up just ain't makin it easy. Well yea, I could solo. I could always play a Necromancer and just solo when I get online. <br />
<br />
/Sigh - I wish I was done with school.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh- 3 hours a day?  If I played 3 hours a day I'd consider myself hard-core.  :)<br />
<br />
If I play 10 hours in a week it's a good week... it all depends what you're looking to get out of EQ.  If your overriding goal is to get uber, then you might as well quit.  If you want to explore new places, just hang out, do a little solo'ing and a little grouping, and be content with your slow relative progression, then casual play can be a fun thing.<br />
<br />
Bigguss is level 52, and I started him in May.  That's May of 1999 --  with under 60 days played, including my long-forgotten 12-hour tunnel-rat days... {shudder}.  Still having fun, so still playing.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I've got some bad news for ya... things don't get easier after school.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first question you should ask yourself is &quot;Why do I play?&quot;<br />
<br />
You are asking if you should just quit, thats kinda silly..why are you playing?  If you aren't playing because you enjoy the game, then why are you playing? Because you think the high end is more fun? <br />
<br />
I mean, I don't go to a Solitaire message board and ask if I should quit, since they outlawed it at work.  If I like playing, I'll play it when i can, and when I can't or get tired of it, I'll just quit :p.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the time you can play; when it becomes a burden, drop it and look at porn during your computer time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mmmmm... porn  :cool:</div></div><hr />

My kids don't know how good they have it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i seem to finding myself doing /q out of no where..grouped or not - i just /q cause sometimes i get so bored when soloing, or im just not having fun...but when im not in game, THATS when i wanna play.<br />
<br />
its kinda complicated - when im not playing i imagine myself having tons of fun in EQ, but then when I find myself in Lake, soloing blood gills, doing /who all friends with no names appearing, not having a cool guild or friends to play with i usually just /q and read the boards. after reading the boards i get excited and log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I hear you... I do that sometimes, too (not while grouped, though, hehe.)  Sometimes it seems like the boards, the thinking about game mechanics and gear upgrades, the analysis, that all of that is more fun than the actual grinding that the game itself often becomes.  And while there are definitely benefits to levelling, the grinding itself just gets more and more slow.<br />
<br />
That's probably the biggest reason why it's taken me so long to level- I don't often find myself playing for more than a few hours at a time.  I remember twinking my brother with full crafted and a wurmslayer when he hit level 10 (a big deal back then, wurmies were pretty new- I traded a Jade Reaver for that one- bah!)  Now he's level 60 with 50 AA points and the leader of a decent sized guild, while I'm still puttering around at 52 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1420).<br />
<br />
Not sure if I can offer any advice, but if I were to try it would be:  &quot;Figure out what you like and spend your time on that.&quot;  For me: boards are fun, game mechanics are fun, acting as &quot;guild guru&quot; is fun, hopping on for a few hours every now and then is fun.  Raids generally suck, as do long solo sessions, and most group sessions (but with the right group it's a lot of fun.)   Tradeskills?  Gah!  You couldn't pay me enough!<br />

Beginning to tinker with the Neverwinter Nights world builder- that has enough meat to it to be potentially interesting.  :)</div></div><hr />
