<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So does our pet have a class?  I would assume that its a warrior, since I don't see it doing monk things or casting spells, but then does this mean that it can only use weapons that are warrior usable?  Has anyone tried giving dog/dog int caster only daggers or anything?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree it's a warrior, but didn't I read somewhere that our pet can use Serrated Bone Dirk (a rogue only weapon)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pets are not PC's<br />
the Warrior status seems to say more about their skill set (i.e. no FD, backstab, spell casting) than about any restrictions on weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I understand it the pet can use weapons that are WAR and race of ALL or NONE.<br />
<br />
Dogdog does not backstab, so he's not a rogue.  If he can use a rogue-only weapon I'll have to revise my theory. Can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dog can use any 1hs/1hb/1hp  that is not no drop. Class has no restriction to him. However his abilites and &quot;design&quot; is that of the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks litgruv, that's exactly what I wanted to hear :) /em runs to Bazaar to buy enchanter and necro only weapons with fun procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think weapons are all flagged either pet-useable or non-pet useable.  Of course, our pets can't use nodrop weapons - he can't use a Ruk'Gus sticker either though.  He also can DW two lore weapons, you just have to give him one, then loot the other &amp; give it to him ;)  They dont' follow the same rules as PCs, but generally they'll equip most non-nodrop 1h weapons.</div></div><hr />
