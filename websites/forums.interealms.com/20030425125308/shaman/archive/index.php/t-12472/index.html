<br />
was just at the gym watching this on the TV, is a ton of Iraqis, and they happy as hell. They were beating the crap out of this statue.<br />
<br />
<br />
woot, wonder what all them stinking evil crunchies and France thinks now, ya, looks like the Iraqis really don't want us their huh.<br />
<br />
Dumb bastards, I pee on all of them.<br />
<br />
Go USA, slaughter jawas!!  I mean Feydeen or republican  guard!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill the happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The left wing in America has lost all credibility. Hell, I'm not sure they're even RELEVANT at this point.<br />
<br />
Look, freedom of speech is a wonderful thing. But as natalie manes and peter arnett found out, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from accountability or responsibility. Hell in arnett's case there IS a case for providing &quot; aid and comfort to the enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fraco-philes are out to lunch. france has painted themselves into a corner diplomatically. Enjoy the freeze out. Ya feks.<br />
<br />
Back to the left wing. In their shrill screeches that this war was &quot;immoral, unwanted and illegal,&quot; somebody forgot to tell: George Bush, the Iraqi's and about 44 other countries.<br />
<br />
American's have been accused of possessing a &quot; short memory.&quot; Don't be betting the brie farm that we're gonna forget french perfidery, and other &quot; ally &quot; backstabbing at the un.  LONG after the majority of shooting has stopped, we're STILL gonna be flipping a lot of countries off.<br />
<br />
Hey Mill, did ya see where the US told: Syria, N. Korea, and Iran....&quot; take notice of what happened in Iraq?&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha, woot. Man, I gotta pursue that age waiver, I think at age 31 I could still get in the military if knee passed physical. Had the end of my femur replaced with cadaver bone, I can run and do everything fine, but man do I hurt afterwards, cartilage pretty much gone.<br />
<br />
Green Beret Mill, just like old man, would be billy.<br />
<br />
Pipe dream :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The age limit as you found out is 34. Now, if you are hell bent on Special Forces, I advise to limit the running but concentrate on roadmarching.  Get a nice pack from the local military surplus store. ADJUST IT, add padding as need be so it is comfortable (relatively) on your back and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Next you need a good pair of boots. BREAK THEM IN before heading out. Some use the shower method, some just saddle soap and walk around in them for an hour or so a day for a couple of weeks. I advise doing yardwork in them for a couple of weekends.<br />
<br />
Now put 35 pounds of gear in your adjusted and comfortable ruck. RE-adjust.  Now go for a nice 2 mile stroll. Figure out (trust me it's easy) the 'hot spots' on your feet.  OOPS - did I forget to mention socks?<br />
<br />
AVOID like a haitian transvestite prostitute who shares needles white socks. You want a second layer touching your feet while the outer layer 'wicks' or draws away the sweat. Some use powder on their feet, I always used a spray anti-persperant on my feet.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
