<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Veksar is now in the test server. Is a Kunark dungeon and is plenty of yellow con mobs for a 60+ player. I want to know if the monsters in this zone are droping any rare old-kunark spells.<br />
<br />
Could be Veksar the new zone to farm torpor?<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

God could you picture that? The balls it would take to tell the playerbase &quot;Hey, remember that dungeon that was supposed to come with Kunark when you all bought it? Yeah we finally got it too work but you still cant have it, only stormhammer can&quot;<br />
<br />
Man I would be upset</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cazic-Thule was redone as an antonica-world zone, and I don't think I've ever seen any spells drop there.  I'd imagine Veksar follows the same rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If veksar is half the zone that CT is, I would still be very happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just hope that it's not an underwater dungeon.  While very interesting for RP'ing purposes, I just find that WAY too annoying (ala Kedge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Umm you missed the point. Cazic Thule doesnt have spell drops because its in the original EQ world. Veksar is located in Ill omen which is located in KUNARK.. hence it should drop kunark spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Veksar is located in Ill omen which is located in KUNARK.. hence it should drop kunark spells.<br />
<br />
That's the point.<br />
<br />
Veksar will be a Kunark dungeon and will have lvl 60 monsters that would drop lvl 60 Kunark spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't see how it couldn't be an underwater dungeon, it is at the bottom of a lake after all.  My guess is that the reason they didn't release it during Kunark was because of people's hatred of kedge, and so they didn't want to release a buggy water zone.  Hopefully they will use the techniques they learned making Siren's Grotto and Plane of Water (not that I've ever been there, but I imagine its pretty wet), and make a zone that is playable (like CT, yay!) and not like Kedge, but still underwater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Veskar is not an underwater zone, it's a dungeon along the lines of Sebilis, only higher level (deep mobs are at least 62). Mobhunter posted an article on this recently, check that out for some screenies and a link to a brief impression of the zone. People may actually have reason to go back to Kunark post-60 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">People may actually have reason to go back to Kunark post-60 now.<br />
Doubt it will have the insane ZEMs of PoP zones.  They did that to force PoP purchase and usage for exp, and they won't take that back, trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Veskar is an underwater zone... the zone line has been in the game since Kunark went live, there is a cave at the bottom of the big Lake in Lake of Ill Omen that leads to it<br />
<br />
Verant has said that Veskar will be an underwater zone where the deepwater goblins live...  Its even on the map that came from Kunark<br />
<br />
The reason it wasn't released is because the pathing was horrible, and they just recently got around to fixing it I believe (or maybe a whole reworking of the zone)<br />
<br />
I'm sure Veskar is a dungeon as well... but its an underwater dungeon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't get my hopes up.<br />
<br />
Previously, level 58+ mobs in kunark could drop spells from the rare spell loot table. malo, sunstrike, etc.<br />
<br />
If you remember, back when they released those mobs that drop bands of the arisen cultist, they were level 58+, and didn't drop spells.  I imagine SoE will do the same thing with veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Veksar isn't underwater, though the entrance and a couple areas are, about 95% of the zone has &quot;Air&quot; so to speak.  The layout looks similar to a cross between CoM and Sebilis. It's sort of a city in a square area, with a lot of scenery that seb had. There's lots of neat plants and things growing all over the place too, giving it a great &quot;forgotten&quot; look. Hopefully it won't dissappoint :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You paid for Veskar when you bought kunark, they just never delivered until now. No reason legends should get it first because of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you didn't.  Veksar was never sold as part of Kunark, it was listed as a possible zone they would expand on in the future.  Now they're finally doing it.  If it was broke and you couldn't actually zone in for all these years, then you'd have a point, but it never has been in the game, so you can't say you purchased it.</div></div><hr />

Im pretty sure that it was promised with Kunark, and im gonna do some digging to find it written too. I remember when RoK came out and everyone was pissed off about that zone being broken. I think that its a real cheap thing to do to make a zone for a payed expansion, put it on the map, set up everything for it and then scrap it cause of pathing and now when they finally get enough ambition to fix it, only give it to Legends players.<br />
<br />
Im not sure but couldnt people even zone into there on the first live day of Kunark? At the very least, read to manual that came with the Kunark expansion disks. Not the one that came out with EQ Gold or some other package, I mean the one that came with Kunark way back when it was first released and it lists Veksar as available zone. Guess they sent them to print before they got lazy.<br />
<br />
Off to research</div></div><hr />

I've got that manual and will look into it when I get home then post my findings, unless someone here beats me to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Veksar will probably be another 45-60 zone. As if Seb, Velks and The Hole weren't empty enough as it is. EQ needs more ACCESSSABLE high-end content, not more places to grind in your 50's or farm as a 65. <br />
<br />
Glad I got all the flags I need. <br />
<br />
I wonder what the key quest will be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1.) New zones go to Stormhammer before they go to rest of production servers.  Part of the lure to pay 5 a month.<br />
<br />
2.) Never was it said that ONLY Stormhammer would get this zone.  They specifically say when that occurs, such as with Marauder's Mire.<br />
<br />
3.) I don't remember Veksar being listed as a zone, but just on the map much like Lake Nerius, The Nest and several other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, I have read through the kunark manual (Most importently the History of Kunark text) Veskar is not mentioned ANYWHERE in it... Sorry folks<br />
<br />
LOL, in the Kunark manual it actually advices you to train people!<br />
<br />
If you so decide that retreating is your best option, look for the safest excape route. Sometimes, you can run over to other players in the area, and someone will help attack the monster of taunt him away. Or, a spell caster might conveniently cast a spell in your direction, intentinally or unintentonally - if you run within range of an area spell, it affects you, too.<br />
<br />
So acording to VI &quot;Train wizzards&quot; I knew it :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could any shaman playing in the test server confirm or deny if any Kunark spells are dropping inside the Veksar dungeon?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To comment on any specific loot drops before it goes live is premature.  As an example, as you are going through, checking things out someone says &quot;oops that shouldn't drop here, that could use some hps, blah that's suppose to be no drop&quot; and so forth.<br />
<br />
But, that's just my personal opinion I'm sure that's a minority opinion to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I sure as hell hope it's not an underwater zone...what a great way to turn 98% of the player base off before it's even released. Kedge Keep, the original underwater zone, was some of the best XP in game pre-Kunark and pretty much no one ever hunted there aside from raiding Phinny. Siren's Grotto is the same way, people only ever farm nameds or gems for velious armor quests there. Fighting underwater, while a cool idea, was poorly implemented in EQ. It's simply too much of a hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Man THAT ain't no lie. <br />
<br />
Underwater fighting sucks out loud. <br />
<br />
Veksar, like LoY will be just another farming ground for 65ers, while people still grind in DL like a bunch of lemmings. <br />
<br />
Don't worry, I won't hike the prices of the new loot in the first few days too high....*barf*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">When are they going to fill in that extra zone line in the desert of ro?</div></div><hr />
