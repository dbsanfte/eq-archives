<br />
An old lady goes to a used car lot to purchase a new car.<br />
<br />
The young salesman is surprised by how easily he sells her a car and feels somewhat guilty.  Since he can't think of any extras he could give her, he asks the lady, &quot;Ma'am is there anything else I could do for you today?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lady thinks for a minute and replies (with a huge smile), &quot;Well, my friend said that if you buy a car from here, you get screwed.&quot;</div></div><hr />

When he has everyones attention he takes off his pants and puts his entire family jewels inside the crocodiles jaws.<br />
The crocs jaws crash shut, but just before he gets castrated he whacks it on the top of the head with a beer bottle and presto! its jaws spring open and he extracts his privates.<br />
As the applause dies down he says to the crowd &quot;I will give 100 bucks to whoever comes up here and repeats this feat&quot;<br />
There is dead silence but finally an old woman stands up at the back of the room.<br />
Amidst the ensuing laughter he says &quot;I don't think youre capable of doing this challenge gran&quot; <br />
&quot;Well I'll give it a try&quot; says she, &quot;just make sure you dont hit me too hard on the head with that bottle&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Puzzled, the bartender says &quot;No, we don't have any grapes&quot;.<br />
<br />
The next day the duck walks back into the bar, goes up to the bartender and says &quot;You got any grapes?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Again, slightly frustrated by the duck, the bartender says &quot;NO, we don't have any grapes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next day the duck walks into the bar, goes to the bartender and asks again &quot;You got any grapes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The bartender replies &quot;NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY GRAPES!  I didn't have any yesterday, or the day before.  I don't have any today!  If you walk in here again and ask for grapes I'm gonna nail your webbed feet to the floor!  Now get lost!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next day same duck walks in and asks &quot;You got any nails?&quot;<br />
<br />
This new questions puzzles the bartender and he says &quot;No, I don't have any nails.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the duck says &quot;You got any grapes?&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So there are these 3 engineers traveling from in equrope to a conferance.  After getting on the train, they are seated next to 3 businessmen.  <br />
<br />
One of the enginners looks at the businessmen, and asks &quot;So how many tickets do you guys have?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the businessmen responds, &quot;Well we have 3 tickets, one for each person.  Why how many do you 3 people have?&quot;<br />
<br />
The engineer responds &quot;We only have 1 ticket&quot;.<br />
<br />
The businessman says &quot;Well there are 3 of you, how will 1 ticket work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The engineer just responds &quot;We have our ways&quot;.<br />
<br />
So the announcement is made that the conductor will come collect tickets.  The engineers get up, and pile into a bathroom. <br />
<br />
The conductor walks around, collects the 3 businessmen's tickets.  And then knocks on the bathroom door, a hand comes out, gives him the ticket, and the conductor moves on.<br />
<br />
The engineers wait a bit then come out.<br />
<br />
So after the conferance on the engineer's way back, the same engineers see the businessmen, and ask the same question, &quot;How many tickets do you have?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The businessman responds &quot;We only have 1 this time.  How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The enginneer responcs &quot;This time we don't have any.&quot;<br />
<br />
The businessman asks &quot;I saw how you did it with 1 ticket, but how can you manage w/o a ticket this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The engineer just responds &quot;We have our ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the announcement is made that the conductor will collect tickets, and both groups get out and go to a bathroom.<br />
<br />
One of the engineer's gets out and knocks on the bathroom dorr that the businessman are in and says &quot;Ticket please&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A business analyst, a hardware guy, and a programmer are driving to a meeting. Their journey takes them over some steep mountains. When they get over the top and are heading down the other side the brakes fail. After hitting a few crash barriers they manage to bring the car to a halt and get out. Amazingly none of them is injured and they confer as to what they should do.<br />
<br />
The business analyst says &quot;We should examine what caused the brakes to fail and redesign them with extra safety features.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hardware guy replies &quot;No that would take too long and is not proven to work. I've got some tools in the car I can strip the brakes down and fix them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The programmer says &quot;Wait a minute guys, before we do anything I think we should push it back up the hill and see if it happens again.&quot;<br />

The bartender says &quot;sorry, we dont serve ropes here&quot;<br />

Dissapointed, the rope gets up and leaves the bar. Once outside the rope stops a man thats walking by and asks him &quot;excuse me sir, would you mind doing me a favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man says &quot;sure&quot;, so the rope asks him: &quot;will you pick me up and tie a knot in the middle of me, then separate the strands of the rope on each side all the way up to the knot&quot;<br />
<br />
The man does as he was asked. The rope thanks him then goes back into the bar, sits down and orders another drink.<br />
<br />
The bartender says: &quot;Hey arent you the rope that was just in here a minute ago?&quot;<br />

The duck says, &quot;I think I'll have the grapes.&quot; &quot;Well, I'm sorry sir, but this is a bar, we don't serve grapes here. Now, I'll let you look a bit longer and wave when you know what you want.&quot; <br />
