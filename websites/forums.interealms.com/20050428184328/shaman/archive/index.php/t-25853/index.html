World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.2.3 (2005-02-15) <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
PvP Duels <br />
Dueling across factions remains intact in the patch, in consideration <br />
of players' desires to duel members of the opposing faction. <br />
<br />
*This is a minor patch to address localization issues discovered <br />
during the European beta test. These changes affect localized text <br />
strings for French and German versions of the game only, and players <br />
in other regions will not see any changes to the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
- World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.2.2 (2005-02-15) <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin <br />
Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was <br />
increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active. <br />
This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that <br />
was unintended. The tooltip for the spell displays the intent of <br />
the spell: <br />
<br />
&quot;Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader, granting additional <br />
attack power. The Paladin also attacks faster, but deals less damage <br />
with each attack.&quot; <br />
<br />
The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only <br />
result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in <br />
attack speed. We understand this is a significant decrease in the <br />
power of this spell, but was a necessary bug fix to ensure both <br />
overall game balance and the viability of different Paladin Seals. <br />
<br />
<br />
Localization <br />
- Various text strings and audio have been corrected for the French and <br />
German versions of the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Macs <br />
- Fixed a bug that incorrectly enabled the vertex animation shader <br />
option on some GPU's that do not support it. This bug was causing <br />
player character models in-game and in the character selection screen <br />
to appear invisible or distorted. The fix should benefit users with <br />
NVIDIA GeForce 2MX or 4MX GPU's and ATI Radeon 7000/7500 GPU's. It <br />
should no longer be necessary to manually turn off the vertex <br />
animation feature on these systems - it should now be off and <br />
disabled automatically. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes <br />
- Group loot has been fixed to work as originally intended. It will now <br />
work exactly like round robin does, with the exception that when an <br />
item of threshold level or above drops, it will use the auto-rolling <br />
system. (Prior to this fix, when in group loot mode, the round robin <br />
system was only being used for items (all players could loot coins), <br />
which was rather confusing). <br />
- Fixed a group loot permission bug that was telling players they did <br />
not have permission to loot. <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to freeze when scrolling <br />
through auctions in the Auction House. <br />
- Murlocs play the drown animation when they die underwater now. <br />
- Onyxia correctly hovers instead of standing in midair. <br />
- You can target vocal emotes again. <br />
- Pets and summoned creatures attacking enemies will now tap the <br />
enemies for their owners. <br />
- Fixed a bug with Troll Shamans and the Berserk ability. Troll Shamans <br />
can only go Berserk when they are in the wounded state. <br />
- Rogues now correctly gain Lockpicking skill from items picked in the <br />
trade window. <br />
- Quests that require you to follow/escort an NPC will only complete <br />
when you arrive at the designated area. <br />
- Horde and Alliance members cannot duel with each other regardless of <br />
realm type. <br />
- Herbs and mineral nodes will remain active if they are not fully <br />
emptied. <br />
- Fixed a bug that was giving higher damage-per-second (DPS) to <br />
Steelarrow Crossbow and Blackcrow than was intended. <br />
- Sell prices on Hypnotic Blade, Illusionary Rod, Mantle of Doan, and <br />
Robe of Doan have been lowered. <br />
- Players who have completed the quest to summon Kirtonos may now <br />
obtain the Blood of Innocents from Doctor Theolen Krastinov. <br />
- The tooltip for the Warrior's Intercept ability has been updated to <br />
reflect the proper rage cost. Using Intercept now requires 10 rage, <br />
not 15 rage. The tooltip now accurately reflects that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

How does that seal change affect pallies? I am a seal moron, I still do nto understand them.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what i gather the seal went bugged in Dec. The attack boost on it was suppose to give extra dps. <br />
<br />
   For some reason they made this a tricky seal in that it makes you swing faster. But while you are swinging faster your hit damage goes down.  I assume negating the extra speed. So in that 30 seconds you swing more again I assume to hit more for aggro?? <br />
<br />
 Regardless of why the bug made the damage NOT scale down. So you were getting an attack boost from the seal and the full speed attack. Its says in the notes it was scaling up but I dont know about that. I just felt that maintained the damage over the 30 seconds<br />
<br />
So in essense SOC is suppose to 40 haste with + attack and diminishing weapon damage returns as the 30 seconds ticked. What ended up bugging is it stopped lowering the damage on hits. It became pure haste + attack and no loss of damage. <br />
<br />
Someone please correct me if i am wrong. That's what i gather from alot of reading. Plus i have no idea how bad this will be. Not real sure how much damage is suppose to lower compared to what it was doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Pally seal gives a percentage of haste and a higher attack rating at the cost of lower damage hits.  It is supposed to up dps but not by too much. <br />
<br />
The old version was giving haste, attack and higher damage hits.<br />
<br />
They fixed it so that the damage per hit is lowered to where it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not even worried about it yet. But to some people the wow world is ending for them today as we speak. I'll see if they get it to where it should be. <br />
<br />
See eq has a side effect on wow. Couple/few patches ago they were suppose to do this. It didnt happen but i logged in to a palidan loudly quitting his char because of the neft and the stealth nerf. People see eq stealth nerfs and over nerfs in every shadow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with Paladins is they are very reliant on melee weaponry unless fighting Undead or specced to get Consecration or Holy Shock, both of which are mana hogs. <br />
<br />
My 58.99 Paladin can MISS 50% of the time when fighting MOBs. He is maxxed in weapon skill (I am Sword and Board) but I have had runs of eight misses (Or a bug where a MOB LOH apparently went into perma-dodge, 15 misses / evades in a row).<br />
<br />
If you're going to lower the DPS boost from Crusader significantly, then there should be a counter on the hit table.<br />
<br />
Paladins who went 2H specialty won't feel as big of a bite (I imagine, could be wrong), but I am now going to have to focus on green and Undead until 60.<br />
<br />
At which time the Hunter and Priest get lubbin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't played my paladin yet post-nerf.  His kill time using Fist of Stone (awesome paladin 1 hander out of MR) was at 30-35 seconds against undead.  Against non-undead it was in the neighborhood of 40-45 secs. This is against even cons and pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
Post nerf I anticipate my kill times going to 40-45 against undead and 55-60 against non-undead.  If you've ever played paladin you know that you get to push all of 3 buttons over the course of 30-60 seconds and watching paint dry isn't much better.<br />
<br />
Because of this my paladin is now relegated to instance MT duty, I will not so much as step out of IF unless it's to do an instance as he cannot solo effectively.  The rogue I just rolled on the other hand... oy vey, so much fun.  It takes longer to loot/skin than it does to kill- now we're talking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rogues do kill quite quickly indeed. We are limited at the upper levels though, when mobs really start hitting hard. <br />
<br />
I need to go out and fight some pallies, doubt will notice much of a difference, we will see.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DPS loss appears to be about 15-20% a hit. <br />
<br />
What irks me is, instead of focusing on things that didn't work (Seal of Wisdom for example), they go ahead and nerf a class.  This is VERY Sony-esque to me and combined with Blizzards FUBARING the Euro release really makes me wonder if their upper management team has it all together.<br />
<br />
Combining said nerf with my server's (Silverlag) continuing hiccups, I have to question their priorities. Server transfers are LONG overdue.<br />
<br />
Dunno. I enjoy the game immensely - when I can play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Faern,<br />
<br />
respect you tons, but you must admit, something is wrong when so many people play one class, and dammit, it is really, really hard to beat a pally.<br />
<br />
Our guild shamans can go down pretty quick if jumped, pallies, no way, live, live, live.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I think I just have envy, some pally the other night, was getting beat on by 6 people, shielded, and hearthed, and even laughed at us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Reasons why paladins needed to be nerfed:<br />
<br />
-I've personally seen a paladin *soloing* elite mobs *higher* level than he was.  This dwarven paladin was out on his own hunting the elite ogres in Alterac Mountains.  He was level 38 at the time.  He was taking on 39 ogre and doing just fine.  My mage has difficulty killing elites that are 4 levels below her.  My shaman has difficulty killing elites that are 3-4 levels below.<br />
<br />
-One of my guildies watched a paladin run into a pack of *four* mobs that were all 1-2 levels higher than the paladin was, and kill them all.  My mage is capable of killing groups of mobs, but not equal level mobs.  I can AE 4 mobs that are 2-3 levels below me, but I have to blow a healing potions, and use my mana gem, and even then it's a tossup as to whether I'll die due to a few good hits.  My shaman can do 3 equal level mobs at once, sometimes.<br />
<br />
That kind of power level is too much.  I'm glad paladins are cut down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Play a Paladin then if you think they're so overpowered.  And nerfing Paladins doesn't allow you to kill any better.  <br />
<br />
Tell ya what - nerf Crusader into the ground (I've already found a viable PvE replacement that allows me about the same amount of downtime (Kill slower but end up with more mana and health)).  Hell, take the spell away.<br />
<br />
But lower the recast on Consecration and Holy Shock. And change the mana / damage ratio.<br />
<br />
Look, if I wanted to play a crappy healer who could do some damage I would've rolled up a Shadow Spec Priest.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to play a poor melee who could do a little healing I would've rolled up a Warrior with Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Paladins now are at the bottom of the barrel DPS wise. The lone exception is fighting undead. Guess I'll be doing a lot of Runecloth farming when I hit 60.<br />
<br />
When a 58 Mage kills over twice as fast as a 59 and 57 Paladin - no whining.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Play a Paladin then if you think they're so overpowered.<br />
I don't want to play an overpowered character.  What's the fun in that?  The power of my mage and shaman seem quite fine, and I'm happy with how they are.<br />
<br />
And nerfing Paladins doesn't allow you to kill any better.  <br />
Nope.  But it keeps you from being overpowered.<br />
<br />
Tell ya what - nerf Crusader into the ground (I've already found a viable PvE replacement that allows me about the same amount of downtime (Kill slower but end up with more mana and health)).  Hell, take the spell away.<br />
Exactly.  Kill slower.  That's the point of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Look, if I wanted to play a crappy healer who could do some damage I would've rolled up a Shadow Spec Priest.<br />
Ya, cuz those cloth classes can tank wonderfully.   :rolleyes: The paladin is a tank.  They take little damage.  They pass up DPS to be able to cast heals and some nice buff.  If you were meant to deal phat damage, you'd be a rogue in platemail.  Ya.  That would be balanced.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If I wanted to play a poor melee who could do a little healing I would've rolled up a Warrior with Alchemy.  Oh no.  The priest is taking damage!  Quick, open a trade window with me so I can give you this healing potion and thus you will be HEALED!<br />
It doesn't quite work that way.  Playing a paladin means &quot;playing a poor melee who can do a little healing and take little damage&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paladins now are at the bottom of the barrel DPS wise.<br />
Right where they should be.<br />
Someone has to be at the bottom.  Who do you think should do less damage output than a plate class capable of healing as well?<br />
Rogues are all about dps.<br />
Shaman have crappier armor, but more dps as a tradeoff.<br />
Warlocks are a dps class without any real armor.<br />
Mages are a dps class without any real armor.<br />
Hunters are a dps class with minimal spells but halfway decent armor.<br />
Warriors take little damage, and to make up for no spells, they do more dps than paladins.<br />
Priests have no real armor.  They have the best heals, and very good dps to make up for this.<br />
Who exactly are paladins supposed to beat in terms of DPS?<br />
Someone has to be best at dps, someone worst.  If everyone was exactly equal, then what's the point of even having classes in the first place?<br />
<br />
When a 58 Mage kills over twice as fast as a 59 and 57 Paladin - no whining.  :p<br />
When a paladin tanks 3 mobs at once when my mage can't tank a single mob - no whining :p<br />
Great revelation there.  A pure dps class kills single targets faster than you.  A lot of good that does in an instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah thats what so frustrating about this type of discussion. <br />
<br />
My extra way to do damage blows right through my mana. I can heal someone okie for a short time. I can live through some mobs my lvl and chop down an elite that was my lvl while i was lvling up. <br />
<br />
But thats what they do. Live. I had no tools to deal with this adds and one way to  burst damage to kill them. But if i need mana to heal not going to beable to cast much of my ae talent. I Just lived.......and swung and healed. <br />
<br />
Regardless of what the fix today did. ( i havent played yet) I'll still keep playing my palidan. Just worry that if we had issues with aggro and our damage was lower tier WITH the bug hows it going to be with the fix?<br />
<br />
See when I llived through 4 mobs people go wow that is overpowerd. I go whew that took forever and I dont want to exp like that because its not efficient or very quick. When i come to an exp area and its totally decimated by one person I dont hold it agaisnt them because thats their thing. <br />
<br />
Sorry Don't want to turn this into a messy debate. Just trying to show things weren't as great as people were thinking they were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okie so Ive finally been able to play post patch. <br />
<br />
Damage is down by quite a bit. Which was the point. I'm not agaisnt making sure everyone is balance. I hope they didnt do to much. The seal feels wrong to me right now. I wont get into detail unless someone wants to know. <br />
<br />
Just remember this if you see a palidan killing a mob of higher lvl I'm killing it even slower now. Normal mobs I kill slower than you But I CAN kill some tougher mobs is what I CAN DO. <br />
<br />
In pvp palidans arent going to be easier to kill. Just even less likely to Kill you. <br />
<br />
I really try not to be defensive but I get so hear so much flack sometimes about my class its almost impossible not too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm happy with how they are<br />
<br />
No you weren't. Hence your joy at the nerfing of another class.<br />
<br />
But it keeps you from being overpowered<br />
<br />
Here we will have to agree to disagree. This reminds me of the Monk discussion.  Paladins did what they were supposed to do - outlast MOBs. They traded off burst DPS for high AC and the ability to buff and heal.<br />
<br />
Exactly. Kill slower. That's the point of the whole thing<br />
<br />
Really? Paladins were killing fast? That's news to me.<br />
<br />
Yesterday a level 53 elite, green to my by SIX levels forced me to run. Now there may have been some randomness to it - but he basically ran me out of mana. <br />
<br />
powah.<br />
<br />
Ya, cuz those cloth classes can tank wonderfully<br />
<br />
They're not supposed to tank. <br />
<br />
Rogues are all about dps.<br />
Shaman have crappier armor, but more dps as a tradeoff.<br />
Warlocks are a dps class without any real armor.<br />
Mages are a dps class without any real armor.<br />
Hunters are a dps class with minimal spells but halfway decent armor<br />
<br />
Umm can't Shaman wear Mail at level 40 just like a Hunter? So why is one &quot;crappier&quot; and one &quot;halfway decent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh and it's not like Paladins were AT the bottom of the barrel DPS wise.<br />
<br />
Now they're UNDER the barrel.<br />
<br />
This nerf was unecessary except for those who: a) had never played a Paladin, or b) felt that (however perverse) that nerfing another class made them happier or somehow improved their lot in the game I suppose.<br />
<br />
Paladins kill slower than ever - YOU WIN !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No you weren't. Hence your joy at the nerfing of another class.<br />
Thanks for telling me what my emotions are.<br />
I'm apparently not capable of figuring them out myself...<br />
Retard.<br />
I'm happy with how the classes are relative to each other.<br />
When you are happy with the state of 8 out of 9 classes, you aren't just looking for a nerf for the hell of it to that 9th one.<br />
Though with your replies to this thread, it's giving me a warm fuzzy feeling knowing you are having so many problems with your toon.<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Guys, chill out.  I can't believe how people who used to be civil in one online game are becoming rabid dogs in another.  It's wrong.<br />
<br />
Paladins are where they should be now IMHO, there has to be a trade off for having the highest surviveability skillset in the game.  If that trade off is DPS, then count yourselves balanced.  With the huge aggro on heals, surviveability is a good thing.  If it's not what you signed up for, then there are other classes to play.  Personally, as a shaman I traded off some DPS for surviveability in my gear selection so that I don't get insta ganked while fishing or farting around.  I don't have near the surviveability of a paladin, but my DPS is higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ran into &quot;chris&quot; the retard 60 pally last night in TM. Go figure, burned through a life, shield, heal, almost burned through another, shield, by this time I am hurt, I go to bandage, bam, jumped and killed. The guy didn't eve move, he didn't have to, hit a couple buttons and wait.<br />
<br />
I should not be able to kill pallies willy nilly, no, but man they need some tuning to make sure people have to be actually awake to kick ass. Took me probably 30 seconds, and all I did was annoy the pally while he was probably calmy chatting in guild to get backup.<br />
<br />
<br />
How long would a shaman last under those circumstances? 10-15 seconds tops. Now remember there are more paladins that anyone else, accounting for realm restriction.<br />
<br />
Blah, no problem with nerfs at all, plate wearing, invunerable healer? Just silly.<br />
<br />
The best is when they shield and hearth, and laugh, surrounded by 5 people trying to kill them. Watched a 58 pally run through TM with tons of guards on him, totally invunerable, pulled them all away, took a while too, he never got a scratch, what horde class can do that?<br />
<br />
I still do not buy into the lowest dps crap either. I still get hit, and hit hard. I get hit for 400-450 and stuff, return a hit for 150-200 tops on their wonderful plate armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My 2h'er does 120-190 damage. How soft should I hit with it? <br />
<br />
I dont damage is most peoples problem with pallies anyway. Its the full invun shields. See mill I dont see this problem as much because I'm not pvp server and I hardly use my shielding in regular combat. <br />
<br />
But the problem is its always tied to our escability.<br />
<br />
Rogues can vanish and sprint. Shaman Can wolf form and run (provided that cast through or get the improved). Druids can shapechange and run, hunters can FD or SOC and hope they dont get stunned. Mages can what blink and polymorp and run. Crap like that. <br />
<br />
Pallies cant fight on their horse and cant cast them to run so part of our defense running at normal speed is to Divine shield or Blessing. <br />
<br />
Anywho I also read people say pallies shouldnt be able to heal while shielded. I dont know about that. Maybe in pvp that shield shouldnt just mitigate damage instead of full block. Heck maybe even PVE shouldnt be a full block. But if you take to much away will ruin the class. How fun would it to pvp and Have no shielding , no range , no run ablity and not be able to stop anyone from running?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Reasons why paladins needed to be nerfed:<br />
<br />
-I've personally seen a paladin *soloing* elite mobs *higher* level than he was.<br />
Then hunters need to be nerfed next, because they can do this as well and in 1/4 the time.  But let me get this straight: first you complain that paladin dps is too high, now you're complaining that his tanking ability is too high because he can stand there against a single melee all day long taking a beating and surviving? Which is it?<br />
<br />
One of my guildies watched a paladin run into a pack of *four* mobs that were all 1-2 levels higher than the paladin was, and kill them all.<br />
Unless you can supply a video of this he's lying. I have extremely good gear for my level and I could not do this unless they were severe undercons.  If he were prot/holy spec'd he could last a long time, but he wouldn't be able to do any damage. If he's dps spec'd he could kill them faster, but he'd take a severe beating.  A 2 pull is no problem for a pally due to shields/healing but more than that and you better have a potion handy and a lot of luck.<br />
<br />
That kind of power level is too much.  I'm glad paladins are cut down.<br />
Now that the nerf train is rolling I expect to see rogues and shaman raped next, which sucks because I rerolled to rogue.  For solo/group PVE rogues are a god class.  They are simply unstoppable.  They do not die and they take less damage wearing AH leather than my paladin does wearing full blue instance plate- because they kill in 1/3 to 1/4 of the time.  Hard to get hurt when the mob only gets 4-6 swings at you. And after we wipe hard in an instance who survived- our pallies? Nope, the vanished rogue.  I willl trade you my shields for vanish- fair enough?<br />
<br />
As usual the PVE game is ruined due to PVP complaining.  The silver lining for me is that paladin is still a great tank class in instanced group PVE. They were beyond horrible solo PVE prenerf, now they are unplayable.</div></div><hr />

That sounds to me like a reason for rogues to be nerfed. Let's see, they can insta-gank cloth classes, slaughter warriors toe to toe (which makes absolutely zero sense), kill chain classes with ease and can burn through a paladin's 2-3 lives in less time than the paladin can burn through one of yours.  Rogues = god class, which is good because I'm playing a rogue now. :)  <br />
<br />
Please, nerf paladins some more- just pretend that every single night elf you see isn't a rogue. Shhhhhh....<br />
<br />
Now remember there are more paladins that anyone else, accounting for realm restriction.<br />
I can't wait to see your source for this.  Prior to L40 this may even be true, but by 50 all you see are rogues, rogues, hunters and rogues, with the occasional warrior thrown in as well (prolly on an alt from his rogue).  This is Alliance of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blah, no problem with nerfs at all, plate wearing, invunerable healer? Just silly.<br />
Hey, here's some trivia for ya.  I'm the MT for our crew as a paladin.  What do you think happens if I decide to shield and heal while in an instance?  You obviously know all about paladins- tell me what happens when I as a MT throw up my shields when grouped?<br />
<br />
I still do not buy into the lowest dps crap either. I still get hit, and hit hard. I get hit for 400-450 and stuff, return a hit for 150-200 tops on their wonderful plate armor.<br />
Large hits != dps (damage per second).  A large two handed weapon will hit harder than a dagger on a per swing basis, but not over time.  And the dps increase of 2h over 1h 50+ is negligible, such that most paladins I know run 1h + shield for the added mitigation.  Yay, using a 2 hander my even con kill time drops to 40 secs from 45 with 1 hander.<br />
<br />
So how long does it take a rogue to solo an even con? I already know the answer- which is why I'm now a rogue when not instance MT. Highest dps in game, lowest downtime. Easy decision, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">izmalis,<br />
perhaps you should try a rogue at high levels? See how long I can tank a level 60 elite, I dare ya. You are the main friggin tank? Nice, horde only gets one main tank, and they suck like your other main tank.<br />
<br />
there are a ton of rogues and hunters, yes, divide number in half, and compare to paladins then.<br />
<br />
insta gank cloth? Only if you an ambush artist, in which case you cannot defeat a warrior or paladin. Also, a well played mage is pretty much impossible to kill Blink out of stun, poly, explode.<br />
<br />
A crappy, stupid paladin is still a powerful force to be reckoned with, a stupid player of any other class is fodder. 12000 hp plate wearers are just tough.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you are main tank, why the hell would you heal yourself?<br />

why the heck wouldnt you? at least sometimes. <br />
<br />
In pve if its a big pull healing makes aggro and takes pressure off the &quot;healer&quot;. If you shield in that you'll get the healer killed. The shielding is more solo and pvp issue. But again it ties in with a pallies escape ability that most classes get.</div></div><hr />

It's precisely because of my crew's high level rogue (L52 or 53, I forget) that I decided to switch. On Princess in Mauradon he was the only survivor and he tanked her, sans heals, as long as our paladin offtank after I went down.  Avoidance on rogues is off the charts with all that agility gear and better or the same defensive talents as paladins. I will trade you my entire protection talent tree for the +5% dodge talent rogues get. My entire tree. Think about that.<br />
<br />
See how long I can tank a level 60 elite, I dare ya.<br />
Long enough to feint or vanish is my guess.<br />
<br />
insta gank cloth?<br />
I only go off what my friends who play on PVP servers tell me, trying to entice me to join them. Oh, care to guess what class they play? Correct- rogue.<br />
<br />
If you were in beta you'll realize the delicious irony of mages having invisibility removed because of how unbalanced it was to have a high dps class able to go invisible. Does it ring a bell?<br />
<br />
Oh, if you are main tank, why the hell would you heal yourself?<br />
Because the priest was already flattened when my garbage aggro seal couldn't keep aggro on me after the priest laid the greater heal.<br />
<br />

That's the point, I never will. PVE until I delete the game.<br />
<br />
And btw, I do not under any circumstances want rogues nerfed. I want them buffed. I want to be able to earn gold/exp by the truckload so i can outfit my other toons eventually. I also want to have fun, and rogues deliver that in spades.</div></div><hr />

then somone is an idiot, evade lasts 15 seconds. Shields last longer. No reason a pally should go down before the rogue. Dodge chance is high, but not that high. I am at around 22%. Also that is my stinking damage mitigation. What is a pallies, 45-50%?<br />

they either lie, ambush hurt casters, not face any decent ones. A good mage will almost never lose, ever. A priest is a terror, I have a huge advantage with fear trinket, but they still can do amazing things. Warlocks, I must admit, are gimp, can be a pain with succy bus though. ya, we can gank, but to me, that isn't real fun.<br />
<br />
<br />

be thankful you can tank at all, without a warrior, there is no group for horde. Healer not using his fade and other aggro reducing talents?<br />
<br />

<br />
then yes, rogues are very good. Apples and oranges here though man, pve is nothing compared to pvp. If I was pve I could care less about balance, it just does not matter. Rogue a fun, fast class, absolutely, but even in pve, when you get into BRD and up, things change. You will not be tanking as a rogue, or you waste people's mana. You offer damage only, and must control it carefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's all good man, you a good peep, I just think you need to keep an open mind still, pvp changes everything, and high level critters change things too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yesterday a level 53 elite, green to my by SIX levels forced me to run. Now there may have been some randomness to it - but he basically ran me out of mana.<br />
Today, at level 50, I was killing some elites outside the Maraudon instance, going for my trinket.<br />
I can barely kill level 42 elites.  Most of the time I need to use a healing potions and my mana gem.  Otherwise I have to run too, and that's *EIGHT* levels below me.  Can't wait to get to level 60 and have to run from grey elites 10+ levels below me.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Damage output, damage prevention through armor, and spell versatility/utility need to be balanced against each other.<br />
Generally the higher the damage, the lower the armor.<br />
But in a 1 on 1 fight player vs mob, IMO each class should be able to kill the same targets using whatever tricks and tools they have available.<br />
Paladins have huge armor, and they have huge utility from their spells (buffs and heals and immortality).<br />
Of course that has to be countered by low damage output.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for your answer on who should do less damage output than paladins...</div></div><hr />

After reading a druid thread where level 60's say they're averaging 60 dps in cat form.... Somehow I have trouble believing any other class when they say they're the bottom of the barrel dps wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Unless you can supply a video of this he's lying. I have extremely good gear for my level and I could not do this unless they were severe undercons.  If he were prot/holy spec'd he could last a long time, but he wouldn't be able to do any damage. If he's dps spec'd he could kill them faster, but he'd take a severe beating.  A 2 pull is no problem for a pally due to shields/healing but more than that and you better have a potion handy and a lot of luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally did this with my own paladin, many times.  I didn't get all four at once- they added one at a time over the course of a few seconds, but at one point all four were alive and kicking (one nearly dead, the other three wounded thanks to consecration + dynamite).<br />
<br />
Of course it took all my tricks (maybe even LOH, I don't have that good of a memory).  My paladin had great gear (notice I say had, because my paladin now lives in the limbo that is a cancelled account: due to unresolved lag issues and boredom).<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that my 47 paladin was truly a god of pve pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
In contrast to my paladin, my 52 priest could barely kill elites 10 levels lower.<br />
<br />
I doubt the nerf of seal of the crusader changed the fact that my paladin could kill (most) equal level elites.  The fights will just take longer is all.  I also have a feeling that I could come up with a different build to nearly match the dps he had prior to tuesday.  That is, I could if I hadn't cancelled my account last month due to server instability.<br />
<br />
Good luck to those who continue to play; I hope they fix your servers soon.<br />
<br />
*edit in after reading ssti's post*<br />
Druids probably are the lowest DPS class in the game.  I would like to point out that SOMEONE has to be the lowest, or everyone has to be the same.  However, 60dps at 60 seems pretty suspect to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">then somone is an idiot, evade lasts 15 seconds. Shields last longer.<br />
The best paladin shield, self only, lasts 12 seconds- at L50.  The shield spell that works on others lasts 10 seconds- at L38. When do you get evasion again? Also, with shield up I have just lost aggro and someone else is receiving the ass kicking- it is no aid whatsoever in tanking. I'd trade my shield other for evasion in a second.<br />
<br />
No reason a pally should go down before the rogue. Dodge chance is high, but not that high. I am at around 22%. Also that is my stinking damage mitigation. What is a pallies, 45-50%?<br />
He didn't go down- he vanished when he got low. The offtank paladin shielded, healed, then the rest of us ghosts stood around watching him die. He did get to live an additional 12 seconds though- impressive.<br />
<br />
they either lie, ambush hurt casters, not face any decent ones.<br />
I honestly do not know for sure either way- I'm just repeating what they tell me trying to entice me to go PVP.<br />
<br />
<br />

We have same problem on Alliance, but it's w/ priests.  Fade works for crap at high levels.  We started noticing this already in Mauradon.  We're going back for the first time post nerf tonight. I'm morbidly curious to see how often the priest is going to be tanking given that my aggro seal works for crap and I can no longer hold aggro thru dps because that got nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
then yes, rogues are very good. Apples and oranges here though man, pve is nothing compared to pvp.<br />
I could not agree with you more- which is why it is so flat out infuriating to see the paladin class weakened in PVE where it was already really, really boring and weak.<br />

I just picked up a berserker helm (SM - Herod boss on the armoury instance) for when I hit 40.  Looks are kinda disapointing as my current headgear looks awesome (black/purple brimmed hat that flops slightly on the sides).  I look like Black Angus the killer pimp and I love it.<br />
<br />
Some of the totems are pretty situational, but in PvP if your shaman are not laying down totems, then all they are doing is flashy AE damage that one lvl 60 warlock can do.  Shaman should be purging and dropping totems, then laying the smackdown in melee and shocks depending on the opponent.  Druids, warlocks, pallys, and mages need to get purged as their buffs and shields are tough.  Using totems to negate rogue vanish, snare melees, soak up hostile spells, counter sleep, stoneskin totems to buffer damage or in group PvP laying down windfury totems make a HUGE difference.  A rogue dropping poisen (only using poisen on off hand) on the main hand weapon only will be able to use windfury and the DPS is freaking sick and evil.  Any fight I ignored my totems, I either died, ran, or made the fight closer than it needed to be.  When dueling/PvPing rogues drop loads of totems, even useless ones.  If the rogue isn't educated on shaman totems, most are not, then they will go to town on the totems and blow valuable combo points and if they ignore them you can use stuff like searing totems to counter rogue vanish and earthbound to snare. I have the biggest problems with straffing rogues.  I have to use Frost shock on them and find a way to get a dot on them.  Warstomp really seems to piss them off :).</div></div><hr />

I read this post and felt bad for you for all of 6 seconds, then a thought hit me that made me smile.  I'll share the thought with you, but I'm sure it won't make you smile.  One word, diversity.  Taking 4 healers into an instance at higher levels shouldn't work.  Taking 4 shaman might work, but it's doubtfull.  Shaman can't main tank effectively at that level and the only way to effectively heal a shaman tank would be two restore specced shaman trading heals on an enhancement specced shaman.  The last shaman would have to off tank and try to do DPS.  Again, would likely take a shaman with strong enhancement and elemental specs.  In short, the group would be better off dropping a couple shaman and dragging out 2 of any other class to fill roles.<br />
<br />
I feel this is comparable to EQ in the sense that you need certain roles filled effectively to complete certain missions.  I don't think it's nearly as bad as EQ as clerics need only apply as healers in much of the really challenging content.  Instances are tougher, so it stands to reason that this type of challenge would require more DPS. Sounds to me like the paladin class is balanced.  I know it sucks, but I think it's better for the game in the long run.  Keep in mind, it wasn't a nerf, they corrected a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Ya.  My bad.  Across both my alliance side and horde side guilds, we have a druid that's level 40+ out of the 30 or so toons we have of that level.<br />
<br />
I understand where you are coming from...our guild has 27 members above 40.  Half of them are Hunters (7) or Paladins (6).  We have 2 Warriors, 2 Priests and 1 Druid.  <br />
<br />
<br />

Druids can do one or the other, but not both, and their rez is less useful.<br />
<br />
It seems like this is &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.  Paladins crowded out the Warriors and Priests until there weren't anymore, thus making a Paladin necessary.  Something you see in the real world all the time.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I read this post and felt bad for you for all of 6 seconds, then a thought hit me that made me smile.

I'd agree with you if healing were a paladin's primary role, but it's not.  Paladins stack very well.  We have 3 auras and 3 blessings running at any given time and on huge pulls we have 3 AE's going off, which dps wise works out to be close to that of a single mage AEing.  On something like UM it worked stupendously because you can offtank self-sufficiently and the priest can concentrate on dps (we have shadow priest of course) or just healing the MT.<br />
<br />
Making paladin dps so low that it takes you 45-60 secs to kill an even con in solo PVE means that you will not hold aggro, period.  You will also not be able to solo effectively- a claim the developers previously made for every class. I remember in beta when priests couldn't solo for crap and all the idiots were saying &quot;but you're a healer, you're a group class&quot; and the developers introduced the now kickass shadow line of spells.  <br />
<br />
Again, if the across the board dps nerf is a bug this change will not bother me as it will not reduce our effectiveness that much.  Our two offtank paladins use nice 2 handers with seal of command anyways.  I ran crusader or fury (aggro), but found crusader held better aggro (sadly).  Now I'll just run fury and pray for the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instances are tougher, so it stands to reason that this type of challenge would require more DPS. Sounds to me like the paladin class is balanced.  I know it sucks, but I think it's better for the game in the long run.  Keep in mind, it wasn't a nerf, they corrected a bug.<br />
So long as the only change made was to crusader, it is livable (but still stupid).  If you watch the boards, however, you'll see that paladin dps for all seals or even unsealed was reduced on the order of 20%+.  That kills the class.<br />
<br />
And we won't have diversity, now we'll just have dps.<br />
Paladin (possibly Warrior fury spec'd if paladin is not fixed)<br />
Rogue<br />
Rogue<br />
Hunter<br />
Shadow Priest<br />
<br />
How's that for diversity? Dps &gt; all.</div></div><hr />

We didn't miss the memo, we happen to agree.  I realize the futility of explaining something as emotional and dynamic as class balance on a message board but let me try anyways.<br />

For solo PVE there is a minimum level of dps and interaction to make soloing fun and rewarding. Paladins 40+ were already hurting in this department such that my crew paladins stopped soloing because it was just too painful.  We pretty much just did blue exp in instances, which remained fun.  If the across the board dps hit remains, not just the reduction in one seal, the class is ruined in solo PVE.  Taking a full minute to kill an even con is not fun, particularly when there's nothing to do during that time to make it interesting.  It is about as much fun as watching yourself drink for 45 secs as a mage every few fights.<br />
<br />
Group PVE it's a little different.  If you play a paladin and always have a group, having no dps probably will not matter.  If you don't have a crew or guild to back you up, get used to leveling at 1/3 to 1/4 the pace of everyone else and not getting group invites.<br />
<br />
WoW is facing its first major post launch test of class balance and is in the process of destroying a hybrid class, which I predicted months ago.  Specialization always wins because it's the benchmark developers use to balance things.  Warrior, priest, mage and rogue are the only classes over time that will remain viable- you read it here first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Today, at level 50, I was killing some elites outside the Maraudon instance, going for my trinket.<br />
I can barely kill level 42 elites.  Most of the time I need to use a healing potions and my mana gem.  Otherwise I have to run too, and that's *EIGHT* levels below me.  Can't wait to get to level 60 and have to run from grey elites 10+ levels below me.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Damage output, damage prevention through armor, and spell versatility/utility need to be balanced against each other.<br />
Generally the higher the damage, the lower the armor.<br />
But in a 1 on 1 fight player vs mob, IMO each class should be able to kill the same targets using whatever tricks and tools they have available.<br />
Paladins have huge armor, and they have huge utility from their spells (buffs and heals and immortality).<br />
Of course that has to be countered by low damage output.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for your answer on who should do less damage output than paladins...<br />
<br />
Juujuu is one point I dont agree with. Now I'm not saying things are perfect with what mobs pallies can kill vs everyone else. But I dont agree all classes should be able to kill the same mobs. IF all anyone could do is kill the same mobs than you only need people to play the class that can kill the fastest. Wow has plenty of places to exp with easy pulls were toughness means nothing. So if all a pally can do is live and they keep nerfing them its going to be like dry humping. Mr rogue what do you do? I kill **** quick! Ms Mage what do you do? I kill **** quick. Mr Pally what do you do now? I live! <br />
<br />
Again Dont put words into my mouth. I'm not saying a pally should be able to kill anything they want at anytime and that bug made their dps higher than it should be. That translated into some killing speed that shouldnt of been there. But only killing the same mobs with dps dropped down now would be tedious as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">One comment and one question from me...<br />
<br />
A pally in our guild said he was basically just another healer, and I replied that we needed more healers anyways.  :)<br />
<br />
Was this a fix or a nerf?  Didn't Blizzard fix the spell by making it do what the description always said it should do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">It was a fix that to me that feels screwed up. The spell doesnt feel like it gives any attack like its suppose too. Soon as i click it my damage instantly goes down. The idea of the seal is it gives 200 attack(at 60) so the front of damage should come up and than drop through the 30 seconds. But it just drops than scales down. So instead of being Back to where it should be it feels beyond. This i'm pretty sure of. <br />
<br />
People are also saying there was a drop in normal non buff dps also. I'm not feeling that with my other seals.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  IF the other seals of a paladin were bugged, it should get fixed.  <br />

I look forward to the day where the paladin will hang back and heal while the druid tanks.  Bwhwhahahahahah!!  (/cough /cough /hack) Bhwhahwaha!</div></div><hr />

So far the issue with the non-crusader drop in dps appears to be from +atk not being correctly added to dps under certain circumstances (certain talent builds).  So blessing of might, seal of crusader and +str buffs (e.g. kings) aren't adding any dps.  If you run blessing of wisdom and seal of righteousness you probably wouldn't notice the difference if this is true since you're not using any +atk buffs.  <br />
<br />
I have not logged in to verify this as my paladin is perma parked in IF as a blacksmith bot in between crew night instance runs.  I couldn't handle the tedious boredom of soloing prenerf, now I can't even imagine wasting my time.<br />
<br />
To put this in perspective: my rogue without blue exp is earning exp faster killing even cons or +1 mobs than my paladin does on similar mobs with blue exp.  And my paladin has excellent gear while my rogue has AH garbage.  Judging by my crew rogue's experiences, once I start dropping the blue instance gear on my rogue it will be a bloodbath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Making paladin dps so low that it takes you 45-60 secs to kill an even con in solo PVE means that you will not hold aggro, period. You will also not be able to solo effectively- a claim the developers previously made for every class. <br />
I agree that pallies need a method of holding aggro better, but not sure how that would infringe on warriors.  That said, it's still viable to solo for a paladin, just not as quick as it might be for other classes.  NOTE: the following sentence is totally an attempt, not necessarly a good one, but none the less an attempt at humour: Some people might actually like the lower stress of the paladin and enjoy watching TV, grabbing a coffee, or grabbing a quick nap following auto attack ...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to re-look this.  I don't mind being at the bottom of the barrel DPS wise - but I do need to do SOME damage.<br />
<br />
Hit 60 today.  :o  Trotted off to IF to purchase new spells and play the AH game.<br />
<br />
One thing Blizz could do is offer a one-time free respec to all Paladins.  Another is lower the cooldown time of Consecration and Holy Shock. A third is to move the 1H talent so it doesn't require 20 points or so in a field. (Contrary to 2H which requires 5 or 10 iirc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Great point, Faern.  Talent respec can make some huge differences.  I think the one-time free is a great idea for any class that they make this significant of a change to.<br />

I just wanted to jump in and ask about Tarthug's comment &quot;Shaman can't main tank effectively at that level&quot;...<br />
<br />
I'm 44 atm, but have found that I tank very very well with full enhancement spec.  It wasn't hard to get 3000 ac at all, and while I'm not about to tank major bosses, I'm as good a tank as our warrior when he's not in defense stance (so long as he doesn't have a shield equipped).<br />
<br />
I'm regularly suprised at how well WoW shamans can tank, and wondered if something about my situation was very skewed.</div></div><hr />

In your second parapgrah you state that what you hit for decreases when you activate this Seal, which sounds exactly like what the spell description says it will do.  Maybe I am not understanding what you are saying, but this sounds exactly right.<br />
<br />
ATK also helps determines IF you hit, as far as I know.  I believe the intent of this seal is &quot;Swing faster, have a greater chance to hit the mob, but do less damage per hit&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well, no.  But I've never had a buff on that said I would deal less damage either (which Crusader states).<br />

Not sure what you are getting at.  I *think* your complaint is that Crusader does 2 things.  1, it immediatly drops your damage per swing, and 2, it keeps lowering your damage further over 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
You seem to be upset about part 1, and I was simply pointing out that I always read the description to state that part 1 was how it was supposed to work.  Thus my comment about how it never occured to me that blizzard would code in part 2 (decreasing damage over time).</div></div><hr />

Thats the description. I get you click the seal and you go from normal damage and scale down for 30 seconds since it says EACH attack .

Why does it feel like pallies need to have proof and have a rebuttal for each and everything anymore? Not just with sotc but all game experience?

<br />
But when the high lvl pallies make a statement saying things arent as they appear people like to argue , rebutt and imply our heads are buried someplace. Not quite that bad here but all the message boards and in game people are full of knowledge. So if i seem bitchy thats why.</div></div><hr />

I admit it si probably wrong to wish a class nerfed. Perhaps it is simply the fact we are so outnumbered by hordes and hordes of screaming paladins, many of which are really stupid annoying people. You should see some of the people on our server. They run from anyone within 5 levels of them, but just love to wander around killing newbs, blah.<br />
<br />
And I really am tired of a Pally being able to pull all of the guards from a town, with complete invunerability, or run through a pack of horde with complete invunerability, just is silly.<br />
<br />
A 60 rogue should not need to chase a 37 pally halfway across the zone, using mount, sprint, etc to finally kill the little thing either, and that is how bad it is.<br />
<br />
Tell ya what I hate - it's when I get sapped and the Rogue has insta-vanished again.<br />
<br />
Talk about a get out of jail free card.<br />
<br />
Or when Mages can instantly fire off a freezing spell totally immobilizing their attackers while they (Mages) get away.<br />
<br />
There's a LOT of Horde hatred towards Alliance. Numbers, perceived abilities (which grow with every telling, a year from now five paladins will have 1 grouped Onyxia), and b-net boy wankerism.<br />
<br />
You saw the same &quot;I'm Horde so I should be bad ass and be able to kill Elves simply by staring at them&quot; mentality on the no holds barred PvP server in EQ.<br />

And what happened?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Shilzah:<br />
<br />
This is a quote from a paladin (mid 40s I believe) on another message board where we were talking about Seal of the Crusader:<br />
<br />
This is to do with the way that melee damage is calculated. Attack power effects your chance to hit and total damage by nullifying some of the effect of the target's armour. Extra damage only applies when you actually do hit. Crusader seems to me to be designed to allow paladins to hit higher level mobs with lots of armour. It wasn't intended as a massive melee boost.<br />
<br />
In addition, theres a different player (not sure if they play a paladin or not) that says :<br />
<br />
I can't find the quote, but this is how they explained it to work.<br />
<br />
SoTC should NOT increase your overall dps increase aside from the attack power boost. This means that the damage reduced should be the same percentage as the attack speed increase.<br />
<br />
The way you describe it is how it used to work , before the fix. As it was, this was by far the highest dps seal, and the proc ones were useless in comparison (except for in a few situations). That isn't how it was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
I realize these quotes are out of context, but the basic gist of those two posters seems to indicate to me that Crusader shouldn't be viewed as a DPS buff.<br />
<br />
Now the reason I'm asking you these questions is because I don't know the answers.  I take what you posted, throw it in with what I have learned from other paladins and I come up with more questions.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Its says in there what ive been saying.

As in each application lowers the duration on the target. Only 1 target can be sapped at a time, it requires stealth, AND!!! if you vanish  in my experience the sap breaks immediatly. This means improved sap (about 15 down the sub talent tree) is the only way to stay hidden.<br />
<br />
While it can be annoying to have a high level chain sap you (if they have improved sap) its not even the same ball park as invulnerablilty. Hell it's not even the same sport. I can't chain sap a town removing the guards from action.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, my experience (mostly pve) has been that if I sap a target and then vanish the sap immedialy wears off. I also cannot re-stealth since I'm on the sapped targets hate list which puts me in combat. The only way to chain sap a target is to have improved sap. I am pretty sure I was clear about all this in my last post. I even made the point to say *in my experience* meaning that I'm presenting an observation, not a fact.

Heal up, switch to cat form, wait a second to get energy, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why the paladins feel persecuted (maybe it's nerf-enhanced sensitivity).  The main thrust of the arguments seems to be two (or more) differing opinions of what BLIZZARD's intent of this seal is.  It appears that this was worded ambiguously.  What I can't figure out is why people would take different interpretations of that so personally?<br />
<br />
It appears they did some testing and found that the seal was granting DPS above what they'd intended.  One *could* assume that they'll continue to test, in order to establish that the numbers are now where they wanted them the whole time - which may or may not correspond to your personal opinion on the matter...  They've additionally come to the boards and stated flat out that their decisions about class/ability balance have less than 1% to do with what's said on messageboards - so it's not as if there's any use in arguing that the nerf was either too harsh, or not harsh enough.<br />
<br />
It's a lot like when slow mitigation was introduced to EQ1, and there were 3 basic reactions.  Some shamans said &quot;this is crap, I'm rolling a new character&quot;, others said &quot;big deal, I still love my shaman - we shall overcome&quot;, yet others kept playing their shaman and hating it.<br />

I'm not making this stuff up when i say people are very quick to be jerks on other boards and in game. Soon as they fixed the bug some people on my server were dancing in the streets that the big bad pally got nerf/fixed. <br />
<br />
Bottom Line I didnt cry about the fix , I've agreed with some people when they said maybe a few things were out of line with the pally class. I'm just trying to say that the seal feels wrong. That was it intially. <br />
<br />
Ive given up with peoples perceptions in game because they dont listen. Soon as I try to explain things arent what they seem they go Right to the sarcasm. I thought i might have better luck here. People are alot more civil here so this isnt an indication of what happens elsewhere. Sorry If I appear headstrong and beating a dead horse. Not what I was attempting to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I see both sides of this.<br />
<br />
On the one hand paladins are over powered, mainly in the utility area. They gave paladins rez too low a level and too useful a form of it. They should swap out the paladin and druid rez. Long recast plus reagent seems more fitting for a paladin than a healer class.<br />
<br />
But I also understand Paladin frustration in that this game is designed in a way that dps classes are incredibly fun so naturally Paladins and any other low dps classes tend to feel a bit left out, even if they are still very powerful.<br />
<br />
Reading laughing woman's description of how a druid can kill stuff cracked me up, that's a lot of work and a long time for one kill. My mage basically blasts things four or five times and it's dead, that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree with the unnessary focus on paladin's lately with all the other issues, but as someone that plays both a paladin and a druid I'd still have to say overall the druid is the lower dps class. <br />
<br />
At 46, my druids average DPS is about 30-45 on even con mobs in bear form. <br />
<br />
Before the seal change my paladin was doing 50-60 dps on even con mobs at 26 and after the change still does 30-40ish dps. So even 20 levels lower I can already put out close to the dps of a druid. They are low dps, but I really can't say the lowest. <br />
<br />
In comparison my brothers 49 warrior was putting out 150-200 dps last night against 45-46 mobs and his 28 rogue puts out 60-80 dps on even con mobs, so I really think they do need to balance some things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Darkpaw sounds right, pallies claim lowest DPS, but there are alot of level 60 Paladins that post and call sauce.<br />
<br />
Level 60 paladins are claiming 50-60 dps and I do not believe it for a second.<br />
<br />
Often, for some really stupid reason, people compare Paladins to rogues, and expect DPS to be similar, I have to just laugh. Take away your plate, give you leather, take away all your shields and heal abilities and seals and then we could compare dps.<br />
<br />
I have fought many, many Paladins in pvp, I can assure you, my dps is not 7-8 times theirs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>agomir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I do play a level 30 Paladin alt, but the way Crusader description reads and what Blizzard said its suppose to work is the following(what I think anyways).<br />
<br />
A weapon with 100-150 damage range and 3.2 speed, using Crusader this weapon is now 71-107 damage and 2.29 speed.  Crusader is to scale the damage of the weapon to match the speed.  Both of the above are 39 dps weapons.  Where the dps upgrade come from the +attack that is suppose to go along with Crusader.  So of course you are going to see lower damage hits even with the increase from the +attack.  But you should see a rise in your overall dps using it.<br />
<br />
The way it was working while bugged was the damage range would not go down at all but the speed would.  So that 100-150 damage weapon now has a speed of 2.29.  This changed the weapon to a 54.5 dps weapons.  Then on top of that it added the +attack to it.  So you were looking at least a 50% increase in dps.<br />
<br />
I have not tested the new changes enough to know if my non seal dps went down or any dps from my other seals have went down.  But it from all the reports it sounds like there is another bug that was introduced.  Maybe for everyone or maybe just with certain talent builds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Level 60 paladins are claiming 50-60 dps and I do not believe it for a second.<br />
L49 paladin, using Fist of Stone. I did some tests against L24-26 grey mobs in Wetlands.  Using crusader I was around 50-60 dps. Using any other seal I couldn't break 40 dps unless I got a lucky string of crits- and I'm dps spec'd.<br />
<br />
I borrowed a buddy's L46 paladin using a really nice UM 2h mace, full dps spec, and used him to drag my rogue through Deadmines.  Using a 2 hander and seal of command against mobs 30 levels below him he was able to maintain a nice 80 - 100 dps, spiking to over 250 dps on 10+ pulls due to AE.  Sadly, for exp you do not fight mobs 30 levels below you...<br />
<br />
<br />
Take away your plate, give you leather, take away all your shields and heal abilities and seals and then we could compare dps.<br />
I thought it balanced out defensively until I started comparing percentages, now I'm worried.  My paladin with shield and plate in all slots runs 54% mitigation. He gains another 10% in parry and 5% in dodge (roughly).  So I'm mitigating or avoiding 69% of incoming melee damage.  My L19 rogue has 20% dodge, 5% parry and 21% mitigation.  So he's avoiding 46% of incoming damage.  The kicker? My rogue only has 80 agility and this will only go up...<br />
<br />
So basically I do 1/4 the dps of an even con rogue to gain an additional 20% dmg reduction?  How about I do 20% less dps than a rogue? Sounds fair to me!<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot that with talents rogue can add another 5% dodge and parry to narrow the gap to 10%.  Blows me away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">My L19 rogue has 20% dodge, 5% parry and 21% mitigation. So he's avoiding 46% of incoming damage.<br />
<br />
Um.  I'll use your numbers, assuming they are even correct for dodge/parry/mitigation:<br />
<br />
If you can dodge 20% and parry 5%, that means you will outright take no damage from about 25% of all attacks.<br />
The remaining 75% will hit you.<br />
Your armor mitigates 21% of the damage coming from those 75% of all attacks.<br />
What's this mean?<br />
1/4 of the time the rogue takes 0% damage.<br />
3/4 of the time the rogue takes 79% damage.<br />
<br />
Comparing this to paladins:<br />
I don't know what your dodge or parry percentages are.  I'm guessing about 5% dodge and 5% parry?<br />
But, for whatever you don't manage to dodge or parry (and however exactly shields block damage), you mitigate 54% of the damage.<br />
What's this mean?<br />
Assuming 10% avoidance total,<br />
1/10 of the time the paladin takes 0% damage.<br />
9/10 of the time the paladin takes 46% damage.<br />
<br />
The rogue will manage to outright dodge 2-3 times more attacks outright than a paladin.<br />
But the grand total of outright misses from the opponent is very very low compared to the number of actual hits.<br />
And when those hits happen, often, the rogue gets hit for big damage, because they don't mitigate it.<br />
The paladin isn't going to deftly dodge out of the way of the attacks as the nimble rogue, but that's ok.<br />
The paladin's armor and shield are meant to make each and every hit do less than half damage.<br />
So, while the paladin is hit often, it's for much much smaller amounts of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I don't know what your dodge or parry percentages are.  I'm guessing about 5% dodge and 5% parry?<br />
Per my post directly above yours, I have 54% mitigation from AC (5200ish armor at L49), 10% parry and 5% dodge for 69% damage reduction.<br />
<br />
My L22 rogue, now with 106 agility and 717 AC has the following stats:<br />
Dodge: 23.27% (will be &gt; 24% after I get defense maxed, I just dinged)<br />
Parry: ~5%<br />
AC mitigation: 24%<br />
That's 53% damage reduction- and I do not have the +5% dodge/parry talents.  Yes, that means I would be at 63% damage reduction vs. 69% on my paladin.<br />
<br />
Your subsequent analysis on how the damage reduction is applied is irrelevant other than making the healer's job harder because rogue damage reduction is streaky due to the all or nothing nature of avoidance. 53% is 53% over time.<br />
<br />
This is reminiscent of why monks were nerfed into the dirt in EQ- their damage reduction was actually superior to warriors (but streaky of course).  Paladins also have garbage aggro control- if the rogue skill Expose Armor works the same way as warrior Sunder Armor rogues will be able to hold taunt like a champion.  I'm going to try this out in our next crew night- we'll make the rogue the MT and see how it goes. I'm afraid of what the results will be.<br />
<br />
Note that I'm mostly talking group PVE here, specifically in instances. In solo PVE the rogue takes 1/4 to 1/10 (depending upon crits) the damage a paladin takes on an even con mob.  Even con casters right now barely last 6 swings, 3 if I land a crit stab.  The most downtime I have now is the time it takes to pull the next mob- of course I have a gun for that, unlike my paladin, so that isn't all that bad.<br />
<br />
All I can say is I've definitely found the new &quot;god&quot; class. I just got vanish so if I die again it's my own fault- unlike my paladin who gets to live 12 more seconds before he dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're forgetting your algebra here..<br />
<br />
You dodge 20% of attacks and parry 5% more (these MAY be additive, but they may be applied after each other - I didn't program the game so I couldn't comment).  This means you avoid damage either 25% (if they add) of the time or 24% (if they are applied after each other) of the time.<br />
<br />
Of the remaining 75% (or 76%, as the case may be) hits that you don't outright avoid, you are going to get your AC mitigation applied.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you were hit for 100 damage by some random monster(and this goes on my observation that damage isn't that streaky barring critical hits), you would be hit for 76 damage each hit - on average.<br />
<br />
Now getting back to the algebra:<br />
Lets run an imaginary test that assumes we are fighting something that averages out to 100 damage hits and we pit our imaginary rogue with 20% dodge, 5% parry and 24% AC mitigation values against it.  We will assume 100 hits for simplicity of the numbers.<br />
<br />
100 hits - 20% will be dodged outright.  That means 80 will go through.<br />
Of these 80 hits, 5% will be parried.  Leading to 76 going through.<br />
Finally, we will be hit 76 times for 76 damage (AC mitigation).<br />
This means we were hit for 5,776 damage out of a potential 10,000 damage or 57.76% of the potential damage (42.24% mitigation).<br />
<br />
If you had incorrectly decided to add these percentages together, you would have come up with an (incorrect) figure of 20% + 5% + 24% = ~49%.  The numbers are close, but they aren't the same by any stretch.<br />
<br />
Over time has nothing to do with it, by the way.  You do not have the mitigation you claim to have, you need to multiply it right.<br />
<br />
For the correct numbers :<br />
24% dodge, 5% parry, 24% AC = .76*.95*.76= 54.87% (45.13% mitigation)<br />
29% dodge, 10% parry, 24% AC= .71*.90*.76= 48.56% (51.44% mitigation)<br />
Your paladin by comparison would be at 5% dodge, 10% parry, 54% AC or 60.67% mitigation.<br />
<br />
The paladin is 18% better than the future rogue in terms of damage mitigation, 34% better as of right now.<br />
*edited because I forgot to add in the 5% to dodge, only parry)*<br />
<br />
I thought I would add a little anecdote on to this as well to explain this another way.  Ever notice how stores will offer 30% off their already reduced prices (or some other seemingly large percentage)?  They (correctly) believe that most consumers will see the 20% reduced price that is further reduced by 30% and think, &quot;WOW I am going to save 50% on that!&quot;  Actually however, they will only be saving 44% (100%-(100%*80%*70%)).  Although the percentage is close, it is not the 50% that many think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Aside from the DPS and Damage Prevention, you have to look at the versatility that a group member has in a party.<br />
<br />
What can a rogue do?  They can sap a mob before pulling.  They can run away from a bad fight (which doesn't especially do anything useful in a group unless they have jumper cables).  They can scout.  And they can do damage.  They can stun.  Rogues have very bad versatility.  They do damage and tank badly and sometimes can reduce a pull size.<br />
<br />
What can paladins do?  Besides tanking incredibly well.  They can res (this is big).  They can heal well enough that they can be primary healers for the entire group, which isn't prohibiting them from doing their primary tanking job either.  They have a variety of incredibly useful buffs and auras that can highly enhance the power of a group member.  They have high versatility.  Their low dps is offset by their high dps and high versatility.  The fact they can fill 2 out of the 3 roles in a group at the same time they just ignore.  The fact they can incredibly reduce downtime, or even prevent a total wipe due to being able to res people back in without having to reclear mobs in instances is huge utility.  The fact they can reduce the aggro gained by casters who very easily become main tanks when they do as much damage as they can otherwise.  All this utility is completely glossed over when paladins are whining about their loss of their bugged dps ability and complaining they are underpowered.<br />
<br />
It's really annoying.</div></div><hr />

The last high lvl intance i did the rogue did most of the pulling using sap and snare poison for runners which is huge. He never died all night and did manage to get a rez in with the jumper cables. Being able to do damage is big in this game and you scoff at it like its just damage. What he was doing was huge. Know what my surviablity netted me that night? Almost 4 gold in repairs from my trashed armor from trying to do all my 2nd healing and getting aggro. I died on every whipe and when the cables didnt work who ran back? Who used their shields to train himself back so they group didnt have to break up? Me. People bitch about the shields but its part of my surviveability and escape ablility. <br />
<br />
I bring some **** to groups and have never denied that. But that **** translates to some stuff in PVP and PVE that people complain about. Oh i can live through 3 mobs, Big deal I need to sometimes since I have no control over if a mob has friends to pull unless i just dont pull him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway we can debate about this stuff all night long. Thats my point the preception that pallies are just gods isnt accurate. We tell people what we cant do because they get so stuck on what they or someone else has seen us do. So they tell us we are glossing over the good stuff we can do. We tell them they are glossing over the voids. Really an endless cycle. <br />
<br />
I'm not walking around with 6k hps and 6k mana. When i overpull and live I have to get mana back and I dont kill the big pull exceptionally quick. But I can kill a tough mob. Not as glamourous as it seems. Yeah its cool to kill something with an elite tagged on it. But you know who the rich farmers are? The rogues who can kill mob after mob in azshara. The lvl 50-52 mobs quickly. She has blue and purple items set to sell. <br />
<br />
Anyway I'm not trying to say Oh my class sucks look the other way. Why are people beyond pvp reasons so put off by us living longer?<br />

The cost of repairing armor isn't a factor in how well a group member contributes to a group.  You don't go &quot;well, the paladin's armor costs so much more than the mage's armor to repair, so we should make the mage tank&quot;.  Ya.  That doesn't happen.  I think all armor should cost the same amount to repair.  But that has no relevance to balancing the power of an individual in a group.</div></div><hr />

I am getting around 16dps add... using a 1h weapon (easier to eyeball dps w 1h, but my 2h does more damage in shorter time) I hit for 66 every second... approx... and when you dump consecration out there... for another 30 dps... thats not too bad.<br />
<br />
There was a few days after the patch that they had REALLY changed something though... I am telling you I was hitting for teens against +2 lvl yard trash with my witchfury... that made me want to quit... but they stealth fixed that... now I only see a slight dps drop from of the crusader nerf... and my misses are back to normal.<br />
<br />
Try you pally again...</div></div><hr />

I have- I no longer have an effective means of single target aggro.  They could drop seal of crusader's dps to 0 so long as it still held aggro the way it did before (pure dps).  Now I'm screwed.<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
seal of fury: no joy<br />
judgment of fury + seal of righteousness: no joy<br />
judgment of fury + seal of righteousness + consecration: 5 seconds of aggro love<br />
judgment of fury + seal of fury + consecration: 10 seconds of aggro love and oom every few mobs.<br />
seal of crusader: no joy<br />
seal of command: if I use a 2 hander and get a lucky big proc in first few swings, this holds aggro just fine.  If RNG isn't kind, you hold less aggro than anything else.<br />
Rest of seals: none do any significant dps or aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
Shrewd, do you instance tank? If so, how are you holding single target aggro?  This has only been a problem for us post-patch.  Seal of crusader + consecration before was enough to hold aggro 90% of the time, which was good enough for me.</div></div><hr />

I don't instance tank a ton for large groups... but I do do instances alot with either me and a hunter or hunter +1 other. Aggro holding has been fine... but of course people just need to hold back on the huge dmg for like 4 seconds.. while I wack away with a fast 1h crusadered (still using).<br />
<br />
If they cannot hold back 4 seconds... there is a problem. Aggro gets pulled sometimes on a 2 pull.. but I just grab em.... and bring em back w consecration...<br />

2h only gets pulled out against casters or 1v1 mobs in instances....</div></div><hr />

Shrewd, who do you normally play with? I played around a ton in Mauradon last night and holding aggro on my paladin was very iffy.  I tried different combos with seal of fury before I basically settled on seal of fury + consecration even on single mobs.  That kept me right on the edge of aggro, but since all the pulls are 2-6 I'd usually only have issues with the first mob since I hadn't had time to build up damage on it.<br />
<br />
One huge complaint I have with paladin aggro control is the complete lack of snap aggro.  Once I've lost aggro using seal of fury there's not much I can do but throw up my hands, strap on the 2hander and step in line next to the other plate boys and let the rogue/priest figure out who wants to tank the most.  None of us pallies will be getting aggro back unless and until the rogue/priest are dead (which generates very little aggro from my experience hehe).</div></div><hr />

I play on draenor with a good friend a 50 hunter named Thornal. We just plow through stuff and make sure everything is managed... Rarely if ever must we deal with a 6 pull, since I pull and make damn sure its not that bad.. If neccessary.. though.. here is the pull...<br />
<br />
I always do long pulls... My friend sets up an ice snare slow trap.. I proximity pull and run back through the trap dropping a consecration right in the middle of it.. all mobs get a little toasty and are all aggroed on me by the time they get through it. If one still is pissed about the trap... either my friend will hit that mob with his pet or another consecration is comming to convince him otherwise... after aggro is firmly established my friend starts AOE and single target kills...</div></div><hr />

I take it this is not instance play right, since you're just duoing?  Most of our pulls were 6+ last night. It's holding aggro on the first mob that's the real issue, that and the fact that once you lose aggro as a pally it's pretty much gone for good unless everyone /sits for a few min.</div></div><hr />

Also. We used with good effect the judgement thingy that heals when you hit the monster. Our groups Paladin had to stop useing it due to drawing too much aggro away from the warrior since I was hitting so fast. (As a thief) Maybe that would help. <br />
<br />
What about a firey enchantment on the weapon so that you get incidental ae damage? And does the weapon have a dot proc?<br />
<br />
All of this can be leveraged to get aggro. Just saying paladins suck at aggro is much like old school EQ warriors bitching left and right that they couldnt tank in groups at all Ever!!<br />
<br />
The paladin has alot of strengths and a few weaknesses. Leverage the strengths and minimise the weaknesses and you have a damn viable main tank. Might not have the snap taunt aggro of a warrior but that warrior aint gonna heal the priest at 50% life either. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Does stun generate much aggro?<br />
Paladin stun is virtually zero aggro. Its only use for aggro is to take aggro off someone for 6 seconds or whatever and use that time to try and regain aggro (good luck).<br />

I use judgment of light on high hp elites, but I've never noticed it generating aggro.  It's really good for healing dual wielders but virtually useless for the paladin himself- given that the paladin should be the one taking the damage you can see our frustration with 99% of our seals/judgments.<br />
<br />
What about a firey enchantment on the weapon so that you get incidental ae damage? And does the weapon have a dot proc?<br />
Paladin AE already handles group aggro superbly, that is not an issue at all.  Single target aggro is bad and if you lose aggro it's pretty much gone for good.  That plus abysmal dps (read: aggro generation) remains the paladin's Achilles heel in MT role.<br />
<br />
All of this can be leveraged to get aggro. Just saying paladins suck at aggro is much like old school EQ warriors bitching left and right that they couldnt tank in groups at all Ever!!<br />
I tank damn well as MT in our crew on everything but the first mob in a 6 pull. The first mob is going to pong about 50% of the time at least.  The other 5 I will have locked on me for the duration no matter what the rest of the crew does.<br />

Letting rogue tank mob #1 while I lock aggro on mobs 2-X seems to be the most efficient way to ensure healing isn't spread over too many people.</div></div><hr />

I played the version of mage in CB before they were nerfed 8 or 9 straight patches in a row.  It was almost as powerful as rogues are today, with the exception that you still had downtime soloing.<br />

think you are going to handle groups of 5-10 level 50 + non elites, non stop for 5-10 fights, all the while on the move, because they have a 30 second respawn? I killed a torch bearer solo as a rogue, before I was able to vanish, I got hit by about 5-6 of the guys, I died a fast, horrible death. Only viable tacic that works is aoe damage, or very fancy rezzing techniques with a rogue getting lucky with the torch kills.<br />

5-10 nonelites? Do you have any idea how easy that is already for us? If the mobs aren't elite I purposely train as many as I can grab in a small area onto our crew right now.<br />
<br />
L50 dps paladins have an AE that does 280 damage over 8 seconds. That's 35 dps per paladin, or 105 dps combined.  On 10 mobs the 3 of us pallies will be slapping down 1050 dps PER CAST. On top of that we use damage shield aura + spiked shields so that mobs take additional damage when they hit us.  My screen is completely yellow with damage scroll when I drop 10-12 mobs on our crew.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when our paladins get to L60 and get the next AE upgrade? Yep, that's 384 damage over 8 secs for 48 dps each * 3 for 144 total dps continuously to every single mob.  Is it mage dps? No, it's not.  But I'd far rather have aggro spread over 3 beefy lads with 4k hps and 6k+ of armor than a guy in a bedsheet.<br />
<br />
Not to mention nonelites our rogue ganks in 6 secs and our shadow priest isn't far behind.  Honestly I thought Lyceum was mostly elites- if it's nonelites it will be pretty boring. Oh, and as far as mana goes: we use fist of stone (innate mana proc) and run seal of wisdom (mana proc) and blessing of wisdom (FT25) in this mode- and that doesn't even count mana pots. Oh and did I mention if we get a crit in melee our AE damage jumps another 15%? Next.<br />
<br />
I'm going to get Fraps so I can take a video of this when we get there so you don't doubt that we did it.  Just gotta find someone to host it.<br />

Our CC is offtanking- unlike sap/poly it works on anything.  A paladin offtanking lasts a heckuva lot longer than sap/poly does and the aggro goes to a guy in plate- not to a rogue or mage. I pretty much hate mages- I call them &quot;downtime machines&quot;.  On Horde, however, they are pretty much necessary from my limited experience in instances there so far.<br />

Just going to stop aruging with you, untill you are there you will not understand, this isn't Uldaman or Mauradon man.

eh? A poly lasts as long as the mage wants to keep it there, and they are free to do whatever else they want, you just took a party member out of the equation to off tank, a group with a mage does not have to. You do know how poly works, right?<br />

You are going to do in 8 seconds, with three Paladins, what a mage can do quicker? Not very good I do not think.

Yeah, and then the mage is oom and screwed for the next fight. Not to mention you're going to have tons o' fun keeping that mage alive.  I'm still trying to understand this logic- nonelite mobs hitting hard are going to be a problem for us (using paladins to absorb their damage while AEing) but they miraculously will not be a problem for a cloth wearing mage? Please explain.<br />
<br />
Oh, and that 35% increase in damage comes at a price of 35% increase in mana.  Is there time to drink in between those 30 second pulls? I know people use a mage to do this, but either they don't hit as hard as you say or they have very low hps- in either case we'll be fine.  I can't wait to fraps this.</div></div><hr />

L50 with the right talents (the one that gives instant cast arcane explosion) have an AE that does 200+ damage per cast.  I can chain cast my instant cast Arcane Explosion roughly once per 2 second waiting for recasts (I timed it.  10 casts in 16 seconds under no lag).  On big pulls (I'm talking 10-15 mob pulls) I do 1000+ dps.  This is before I use my 35% dps ability.<br />
<br />
When there's an AE pull, I tell the healer in group to cast their heal over time on me BEFORE I start doing the AE thing.  Then I tell them to chain heal me until I'm dead, or all the mobs are dead, because doing that, I become the main tank for the fight.  When the healer knows this is going to happen, and devotes everything to keeping me alive, I can basicly duo the entire pack of mobs.  The *ONLY* limiting factor is whether the pack of mobs can overcome my total hit points plus the healer's healing, because I've got enough mana to AE a group of mobs with my mana pool.  Adding a second healer devoted to healing me allows for even harder pulls.  With 2 healers healing me, I literally could kill about 25-30 non elites at once.  It would be a close fight, but doable.<br />
<br />
You just don't understand the power of AE like that.  You have a 20 second fight, and you end up killing nearly unlimited numbers of non-elite mobs.  Find a mage some time, and learn their power vs packs of mobs.</div></div><hr />

I completely understand- my first char in WoW was a mage before the nerf train started.  The issue is that we don't have a mage in our crew and since no one is willing to drink one up, we make do with what we have.  I'm not saying paladin AE dps is close to that of a mage. I'm saying it's enough for everything we've encountered so far on huge pulls. Will it be enough for Lyceum? I think so, but we'll see. Given that people have beaten it w/o an AE class, I know it can be done.<br />
<br />
And given the choice, I'd still take a rogue over a mage in every other situation.  There is nothing worse than a dps class that is out of dps.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ. Paladins have crap DPS, ONE (if they spec that way) DD, a complete inability to hold runners beyond a five second stun, and no way, other than the aforementioned timed invuns to mitigate or control the battle. Seals are dicey at best.<br />
<br />
Anybody who loses to a Paladin in a duel needs to learn, dare I say it, SKILLZ.  The only class I can see a Paladin defeating on a regular basis in a duel is a Warrior and the Paladin will have to burn at least one if not both of those invuns and possibly LoH.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's not quite that bad.. I can kill healing specced priests sometimes, and if I'm (very) lucky a druid.<br />
<br />
Truth to tell, in the current scheme of things rogues do seem to have the upper hand in a many ways, but you know what?  I'm not going to scream &quot;NERF ROGUES&quot; because I died (yet again) to one. No, having played a rogue, and seen how much fun they are, I'd much rather see other classes brought up to a similar enjoyment level.<br />
<br />
Frankly, until you've levelled up a paladin, all your screaming is doing is showing a 'grass is greener' mindset without seeing all the problems associated with said class.  If that paladin came even *close* to killing one of you, I'd be very surprised, and not grouping with any of the three characters that were beating on him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">The nerf/bug fix wasn't for pve content I'd imagine, it was for pvp. If you are in a fight, and mind you this can be grouped or 1 v 1 the issue was that paladins with this increased dps + seal were pretty much unstoppable. With their seal their dps while not approaching rogue/mage levels was repectable, combined with the fact that they can immune 3 times, and then heal to full meant that noone could outlast them. The best you could hope for was a draw. <br />
<br />
Also that stun, you know the one with the 1 minute cooldown? I've had fights where I've been hit with that 3 times. The reason is because the timer is always going and fighting paladins with all their abilities up can actually take that long. The problem only becomes worse when you have mutiple paladins in a group that can cross heal each other while invulnerable. <br />
<br />
What the nerf/bugfix has done is make it so that the fights are a lot more balanced. Taking on an even level with reduced dps I can at least stand up to him for 2-3 of his extra lives, and occasionally pull out a win. Something that was not possible before. <br />
<br />
I do understand why paladins are upset. I'd be pissed as hell too if every fight I started was 3 times as long. Still, the fact that paladins were soloing even level elite mobs (even though it took forever) should be a strong indicator something was out of whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">combined with the fact that they can immune 3 times,<br />

Are you considering the stun an &quot;Immune&quot; ? If not, can you list those three please?<br />

<br />
Umm you're kidding right?  Can you please post a parse of this &quot;unstoppable&quot; Paladin DPS?  Not a guess...a parse.  Then can you compare to say Rogue, Mage, SS Priest DPS?<br />
<br />
People talk about &quot;Immunes&quot; let me clue you in - my SS Priest gets a shield every 20 seconds. He isn't immune, but you have to beat the shield down. Oh and his shield doesn't stop him from meleeing,or casting.<br />
<br />
The reason is because the timer is always going  <br />
<br />
The timer is always going on your abilities too.<br />
<br />

You do realize that even before the nerf Paladin DPS was sub Warriors by a considerable margin?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">OK I'll try and find a better way to explain this. The issue wasn't that dps for paladins was greater than any other class. The issue was, at least in pvp was that it was high enough that combined with invulnerablity you could outlast any class. Making them basically unstoppable. <br />
<br />
My rogue might be doing 4 times the dps, but the fact that you can turn invulnerable x2, stun, and LoH meant that there was no way I could ever kill you before you could kill me. Since I can't self heal paladins win through attrition.  As it stands right now, I at least have a shot to tank you through all 3 or so lives and possibly eke out a win. I completely get how this is a kick in the nuts for PvE, but I feel it does make PvP a bit more fair.</div></div><hr />

Then I trust nerfs to hunters and warlocks are upcoming for (gasp) soloing even con elites.<br />
<br />
DPS using 35 dps 1h: 40-60.<br />

AC difference between 1h/shield and 2h sword: 1800 + block skill.<br />

Buh-bye 2 handed weapons.  If I can't do dps I may as well not get hurt.  On the upside I haven't done a quest in over 5 levels.<br />
<br />
Edit: for fun my crew's L47 shadow priest and I (L51 paladin) each solo'd L47 ogres in Tanaris.  His kill time: 11-14 secs at 140-175 dps.  My kill time: 48-51 secs at 40 dps.  Luckily since he's wearing cloth and has 5k less AC he also took less damage.<br />

Paladins are overpowered in PVE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Thats the hard part about DPS - each tool calculates it differently. Using CTMod I go from 160 to 200 dps at level 52 fighting those elite 42-44 sand trolls in Tanaris, depending on the mob type (caster vs melee) and position. This seems in line with the numbers Izmalis is stating. As for the 3rd immune, call it the LoH. It basically gives you can extra life which is all I care about. It's rare a paladin uses a shield to melee, normally they use it to heal to full.</div></div><hr />

I really, really hope rogues don't get nerfed.  In addition to them earning exp the fastest, I've discovered to my delight they also earn gold the fastest when coupled with mining/skinning skills.  My rogue has 28g at L30 and I still have 3 mailbox pages worth of stuff to put up for sale in the AH.  Getting my mount won' t even be a challenge.<br />
<br />
8 sec kills on humanoid mobs (for cloth/green drops) or 8 sec kills on beasts for skinning + no downtime = lots and lots of gold.</div></div><hr />

For elite quests I do and when I really, really want to abuse an area jam packed full of mobs. I recently respecced my rogue's talents to pick up remorselessness, also known as &quot;abusiveness&quot;. The simple fact though is that for nonelite quests or for when I'm only going to be chain ganking 1-2 mobs at a time, the paladin is 100% unnecessary.  Who needs heals if you don't get hurt? Who needs rez if you have vanish?<br />

I Have Slowed down my Thief's playing and have been playing a Warrior almost constantly.<br />
<br />
Guess what. It is still really really fun.<br />
<br />
As for the best Dps in the game Guess what. A warrior under limited cercumstances will destroy a thiefs Dps. Cleave and whirlwind Baby.<br />
<br />
But but but... that is not agaisnt a single monster. <br />
<br />
<br />
So. Your point is? Like I said limited circumstances. But as a warrior I can chain pull 2 or three Level - 2 mobs and chain kill them for almost as fast as I want. Quick bandage and I am up and running again to the next.<br />
<br />
I am leveling faster than the thief in the Level 25 - 32 range of content. <br />
<br />
And the Guilds warrior Got 60 before I did with Feather, But he might have played a little more than I did. (But not massivly)<br />
<br />
Intresting no?<br />
<br />
<br />
All the classes are what you make of it. With Strengths and weaknesses. <br />
<br />
As for Paladin Superpowers. Try a wound poisen and Mind numbing poisen and see how they do. You know you can Not kill them in the normal 6 seconds but you have options. Lead with Stun and hack away and listen to the gurgle as they realise they are burning twice the mana to heal up. <br />

Or maybe just maybe paladins are not the gods people think they are?<br />

There are options, time to apply poisens. Paladins don't kill you fast. They can't, they outlast you. <br />
<br />
<br />
They may not be the greatest options in the world for all possible encounters but if there is will there is a way. Obviously since paladins are so called god mode when you are just pumping away on damage you might want to change the rules up on them some. <br />
<br />
Do the unexpected. The unknown. Unbalance thier holy asses and see what happens. We are thieves and trixters and con men. Start acting like it rather than a thug who goes rarrrg smash!.<br />

It is all in the outlook of the player. Many seem to just want to pwn or whatever. I have always belived the players of the shaman class in EQ were better than that. <br />

Amen.<br />
<br />
I gotta laugh man, my sustained DPS as a 40 shaman over 150 fights against elite mobs 6 lvls below me (chain fighting, almost no breaks, sometimes taking 2-3 at a time, getting good exp each kill though) is 75 DPS (there's a fraction in there, but I was never any good with frations).  I'm a Ele/Rest specced shaman with a dagger and shield.  My AC is over 3100 unbuffed and my HP are at 2200 ish unbuffed.  I can burst DPS easy and blow my mana load, but I generally don't hit for what the pallies here are claiming.  That said, in 1v1 with +/-2 lvls in PvP with pallies I'm 3 for 3.<br />
<br />
Honestly, no one, even now, wants to fight pallys.  They are just too much of a pain in the butt, not because they can't be beaten, but because even an unskilled neophyte with the self heals, shields, and armour generally stretches a fight out way too long and even if you win you usually get jumped by another alliance and end up dead.  Guys like Faern and Iz can argue this all they want.  Yes, their shielded time is only 22 seconds, but you really can't discount the AC and the self heals/LoH.  It takes time to mow through those.  My dagger damage is reduced on the plate and chances are the pally has more HP than I do and he can get those back easier than I can do it for myself (no NS yet, working on it).  Yes, a good pally is much tougher, but good pallys are rare and any pally is going to kill you unless you pick your fights VERY carefully (actually, it isn't the pally that's going to kill you, it's his 10 friends dancing on your corpse and CCing you that will because you took too long to kill the pally).</div></div><hr />

Let me make sure I'm understanding this: it's not that paladins are hard to beat, it's that it's too tedious and time consuming to do so because while you're ganking their helpless ass other Alliance may come along to rescue them? That about right?<br />
<br />
If so, what a ringing endorsement of the paladin class- we take the longest time to gank! We can't prevent you from getting away, and we can't get away either- unless a Good Samaritan of our faction happens along.<br />
<br />
For the record if/when I ever roll PVP it will be undead rogue, prolly with engineering and blacksmithing- I want the &quot;I win&quot; buttons. Having played a paladin for so long it will be child's play beating them.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHA!!!! Iz, you're taking me out of context.  Skilled paladins are FAR from helpless, crappy paladins (which seem to make up a huge majority of those that play this class) are, so are crappy shaman, crappy rogues, crappy ... get the picture.  The difference is with little or no skill a monkey with a KB and a pally char can hold me off long enough to get me ganked from other passing by alliance.  I'm not talking ganking helpless newbies and I'm not talking about skilled players.  A crappy shaman lasts 1/10th the time and is less likely to get help due to pop imbalances.<br />
<br />

It is a ringing endorsement.  They're tough.  They last the longest.  If you play one, you won't likely die as often unless you really suck or you like comminting suicide on your toon.  I don't think this makes them overpowered, I think it makes the class easier to play and is an adequate counter to the SoC fix.<br />

LOL! It is never child's play beating a pally.  It is a long term slugfest.  You might see things differently once you actually play PvP.  Yes, rogues are one of the toughest classes to beat in PvP and a well played rogue will clean my clock, but pallys can be very tough.</div></div><hr />

Been talking to my crew a bit, I think after we beat all the 50+ dungeons w/ our Alliance toons we'll rejoin some of our old EQ buddies on a PVP server playing Horde.  At least give it a go- if it's a boring gankfest we can always resume on our PVE server and twink them to the gills.<br />
<br />
I still don't see how an evenly matched rogue can lose to a paladin after level 30. I can see how it could take awhile but I just don't see how, other than poor play by the rogue, they could ever lose.  Paladin dps is so bad, even w/ a 2hander and command.  Forcing them to constantly cleanse your poisons keeps the 5 sec rule working in your favor.  If things go south, vanish and gank once again.  It's not like he can get away. And if you can get him to blow LoH, you now have an hour to hunt his ass down and gank him to your heart's content. Oh well, maybe I'll learn differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because you have shown time, and time again, a complete lack of understanding about pvp and how it works, especially between rogues and paladins.<br />
<br />
Paladins hit a rogue, almost everytime when evade is not up, for 300-500. Unless YOU are an idiot Paladin, it is going to be a massive effort on the rogue, to even have a chance, we get one bandage, one potion, you get one bandage, one potion, 3 lives, plus lay on hands.<br />
<br />
And the fact that you still cannot get it out of your head that the ability to last 1 minute and more to multiple enemies is very, very unbalancing, is just weird.<br />
<br />
Leave pvp to the real players man, please. You have absolutely none, zero, understanding of what a real pvp situation is like. Seems like all your &quot;observations&quot; are based on fighting in dungeons when the rogue is several levels higher then the critters anyway.<br />
<br />
By the way, in a duel, I, as a rogue, without the benefit of surprised beat our two level 60 shaman, how? I killed them within seconds. I did not let them heal, and I did not allow them to run and kite me. Can't do that to their adversary the paladin now can I ? No way in hell. This is what you simply do not get, and you never will I guess. Kill the pally first and let everyone else beat on you? Or kill the others while the pally heals in complete god mode? Horde does not have that choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">I actually enjoy fighting paladins now. The fights seem more *even*, certainly not a gankfest.  The reason why rogues would lose, pre-nerf was because while our damage is nice and high against monsters it was drastically reduced against a plate wearing paladin, even without a shield. Like I've said a 100 times before, it wasn't their crazy DPS that would win them the fight, it was their ability to self heal with immunity and outlast me that did it. <br />
<br />
 Rogue defense basically consists of evasion and stun lock. If you can wait out evasion my chance to dodge drops way down. Stun lock is dependant on connecting with the target to build combo points.  So even if you only swing every 3 seconds, those 200-300 hits start to add up pretty quick. I wish you had made your rogue before the nerf Iz so that you would have had the opportunity to duel a paladin and see what I mean. <br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to strategies about applying poisons in combat, it doesnt work. I know you are trying to be helpful, but none of those suggestions are even remotely feasible. If a paladin immunes he will normally self heal, and then use the remaining duration to get some free hits in, interrupting application. Trying to apply poisons during a gouge or kidney shot is also equally improbable. Gouge is only 5 seconds or so, kidney has a max of 7. Keep in mind each stun lasts less than the last one. The only way I can see to do it would be to keep a 2nd set of weapons on hand that are pre-poisoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Why would you apply poisons during a fight anyway? Should already be on.<br />

Mill has 4k hps as a rogue.  I'm not going to pick up more than 20 dps or so by hitting L60 and getting BRD/BRS gear on my paladin.  At best you're talking roughly 100 dps- that's 40 seconds on average that a combat rogue like Mill could last against a paladin, unless he goes on a hot streak of command procs + crits. And what happens after LoH is down? Does the rogue then avoid the paladin for the next hour? How about after the paladin's shields drop? Can't you run away and restart the fight minus the paladin's lives being gone for the next 5 min?<br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to strategies about applying poisons in combat, it doesnt work. I know you are trying to be helpful, but none of those suggestions are even remotely feasible. If a paladin immunes he will normally self heal, and then use the remaining duration to get some free hits in, interrupting application. Trying to apply poisons during a gouge or kidney shot is also equally improbable. Gouge is only 5 seconds or so, kidney has a max of 7. Keep in mind each stun lasts less than the last one. The only way I can see to do it would be to keep a 2nd set of weapons on hand that are pre-poisoned.<br />
Okay this may be my PVE naivete speaking but don't you run around w/ your weapons poisoned 100% of the time? I pretty much login, poison my daggers, eat my +stam food then proceed to annihilate everything in my path. Do PVP rogues not normally use poisons this way? If not then yeah that would be a big problem.<br />
<br />
Can you clarify another point for me as well? In PVP, doesn't stealth become available after 5 seconds out of combat? Why wouldn't you immediately run away and restealth every time the paladin shielded and restart the fight? It's not like the guy's getting away unless he summons his horse and flees. BTW I'm not trying to be sarcastic or anything- I honestly don't understand the issue with killing paladins other than the sheer tedium of doing so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first yes, only times poisons are not up is when they time out, or you need to switch types. To your point, when a pally is shielded, I usually have better things to do than stealth, I either need to bandage on the first or second shield, usually first to make sure. I suppose you could restealth during one, would be better for an ambush rogue, but a smart pally would be moving when the shield dropped,  a CS would be nice.<br />
<br />
You so not realize how little damage we do against a well equipped level 60 pally man, it is way, way low. Your dps might not be stellar, but I have gotten some mean hits from a pally, I always have to heal.<br />
<br />
You just should have seen how tough that pally was the other night, I have never been so frustrated in my life. I gotta wonder about purge too, My roomate says he tried to purge on every shield and it never did anything.<br />
<br />
I cannot imagine how little damage a dagger rogue would do to a plate class, the hit me for 35-80 usually off hand hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Iz, I fight pallies all the time man, they are often group breakers, they often can so fully take people out of the fight by being impossible to kill, or being an invunerable healer, it is just too strong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">To answer your first question, it boils down to why you are fighting. If you're out just ganking than sure, running away and resetting the fight is an option, assuming the paladin sits around waiting for you to come back. On a PvP server, most fights I get into involve me being at a camp clearing, or running a quest. The combat happens because either a) the other side is out ganking, or b) they are trying to do the same I am -farm a camp, or complete a quest. In either case the whole idea is to have ownership of the camp, spawn etc. Running away while sometimes necessary is basically surrendering my overall goal.<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf your only option was to knock a paladin down far enough that they would blow their abilities, manage to escape and then try to find them again. Since most rogue abilities are on 5-minute timers, the same as shields you are never really gaining an edge. LoH isn't a big deal to me, sure it's a free life but it doesn't make the paladin immune and it drains all of the remaining mana right? <br />
<br />
Also with stealth you need to keep in mind the stealth timer doesnt start counting down until you're clear of LOS. It's 10 seconds by the way, not 5 unless you buy the talents. So when the paladin immunes, I'm still in combat, meaning I can't stealth. (Sometimes this isnt the case, and I haven't quite figured out why it works sometimes and why it doesn't other times). The guarantee is to basically run out of combat range. There is also the option to vanish, but honestly it seems rather buggy, and vanish 2 seems to fail an awfully lot more than vanish 1. <br />
<br />
My statements about poisons were a counter argument against someones post that I should be using wound/mind numbing if I was trying to kill a paladin. When I hunt I use crippling/instant, and they are always up. This is because they are useful against all targets, not just one single class. The previous poster was making what I consider an absurd claim that I could magically swap poisons simply to fight the incoming paladin. Either by having 2 of my friends beat on them while I apply, or by doing so in between stuns. Neither of which is realistic on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, I think I understand now. If/when I go PVP I will do a subtlety ambush/bs build as that is the playstyle I enjoy the most thus far.  Given what I know of paladins through firsthand experience I suspect I will have an edge once I get used to PVP play.<br />
<br />
Mill, as for finding solo paladins- how long do you think you'd solo if it took you 45+ seconds to kill an even con mob? None of our paladins solo or group outside instances anymore, it is simply time inefficient. I can't imagine this would be any different given the frustrations of trying to level on a PVP server.  Given what I know now I can't imagine wanting to play paladin on PVP- ouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">Seems to be some confusion.  One side is arguing that a paladin is nigh invincible and paladins needed an adjustment.  The other is arguing that paladin DPS is sad and that the first side is mistaken about the need to reduce paladin DPS.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the two sides are not even arguing about the same thing.  Invinvibility does not mean high DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">Actually my only point was that pre-nerf paladin dps combined with their invulnerable made them overpowered in PvP. Post nerf I think they are fine. I do however recognize that by reducing their dps it makes the PvE game a lot less fun since evey fight is a marathon of tedium. - I don't have a solution for this, and since I don't play a paladin I can only offer my own observations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">If there are 3 people beating on paladin I don't think I would need to switch poisons in the first place, and when paladins are shielding I'm using first aid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my point Cappi. I bet mill said screw it three powerhouses here I dont need to do anything to slow his casting we'll just beat him down. Wha???? Healing?!!!!! NERF!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering how the fight would of went had the shaman purged his blessing shield, use cheapshot and poison to slow his healing down instead of the all out damage shots. <br />
<br />
I apologize if i am faslely assuming but.....<br />
<br />
Seems like some rogues go all out damage vs a paladin. In a group situation like mill desribed I didnt hear him say he loaded up full cheapshots and put mindnumbing poison up and the shamans purged. They only HAD to eat one shield. The 2nd one purged and I dont see how he should get more healing off if they time it right with kicks, cheapshots and totems. Maybe he had his layhands up that might happen if he was prepared for the fight. <br />
<br />
So I dont see why you shouldn't have to put poisons up if there are 3 people beating on him. MY point was also you dont have to stop his charge to apply. That was the context 3 people.  When solo vs a palidan you also have options to apply a different poison when needed. Telling me that isnt true? 5 point cheapshot doesnt work on plate or pvp? If i am missing something i'm sorry. I just know this. I dont live on a pvp serverand  i dont duel either. I do however full pvp when I am in the mood. Ive yet to have anyone stun me while i am healing. I dont get it. Talking no shielding healing. People just swing ,swing , swing. Stupid monks in SM kick me and stop my healing more than pvp enabled people do. <br />
<br />
Just want to hear the context of mills 1 minute fight to see if it was reasonable or they just couldnt just give him a dps beatdown. I'm just not getting it i suppose. <br />
<br />
Oh well no talent 102, 309, 133 signing out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">I talked about some dps numbers in another post mill you never said anything. I'm leary doing dps numbers because I dont know the best way to do it and I want it to be accurate. <br />
<br />
I use the cmtmod but ive heard that all the ui's will report the dps different. Is there a &quot;best mob&quot; to attack? Only time ive been on my pally lately is to kill some 51-52 elite dragonkin in azshare. I dont elites are the best judge of dps. <br />
<br />
I'll tell ya though my 1h dps is horrible. My 2h dps isnt terrible. With seal of command sometimes some decent burst like dps sometimes not so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Timing attacks is of course very important, and can be very powerful, but you need to keep in mind they have to land to do anything. If you miss a kick or cheapshot you have to wait for the cooldown to expire in order to use them again, plus you lose the energy. Don't get me wrong, my main technique against paladins is controlling the fight through stun lock, which is the main reason I don't use rupture. I'd rather take the hit in max dps than give up gouge.<br />
<br />
*edited* wanted to make a quick comment for Iz. First, the ambush/sub talent tree is great for pve, and group pvp. It does however lack in solo play on a pvp server. Mainly because it's highly specialized with a stealth opening damage. <br />
<br />
I also thought of a way to illustrate the problem with pre-nerf paladins that might make it more clear. Ok everyone here can aggree that it takes paladins forever to kill a mob, and rogues do it much quicker. When in PvP the rogue is forced to fight on the paladin time table, and the paladin doesn't give anything up. Paladins are made for long ass battles. The longer a paladin can extend the fight, the more likely they are likely to win. At least 1 on 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">Right good point Cappi. See My rogue is about to hit 40. So i do have some exp playing one. I dont however have any pvp vs a pally. I just keeping getting the image of Mill and Crew doing all dps and getting mad the paladin can shield and heal. <br />
<br />
I may very well be mistaken I Just see so many options My rogue can do vs a players with lower AC , stunning and damage. Ive seen how some rogue PVP me without a single stun or expose armor or poison beyond the DD poison. With two shaman to do damage all i can see is a  rogue doing stun/poison control and only do good dps instead of OMG. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry Mill it may not be fair since Ive never seen you play but i get the mind impression of you doing the Highlander there can be only on routine and demolishing alot of people and getting mad when it doesnt work that way. I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">We have options for PvP. For every ability you use, you have to give something up. Yes we can expose armor, but boom, there go 5 points you could use on eviserate or rupture. Sure we can use mindnumbing/wound, but they are really only useful against certain classes. What about the other 5 they have no effect on? What you suggest is great strategy for dueling, but isn't really feasable for your average play session on a pvp server simply because you can't always choose when to fight. (Yes I appreciate the irony of a rogue saying he can't pick his fights).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">Shilzah,<br />
<br />
Mind numbing poison is stupid against a paladin, really stupid, you need to foce him to use up his shields fast, period. instant/crippling is best combo.<br />
<br />
As far as purge, I am waiting to see it work, it really does not seem to on any shield, and I wonder if something else is going on, or our shamans are ust retarded only trying to purge one shield. They have little trouble fighting a paladin alone, or any other class for that matter, they are doing something right.<br />
<br />
Shilzah,<br />
<br />
my pvp win to loss ratio is staggering, I am doing things right, I am probably in the order of 50 to 1 against level 60 rogues, sadly paladin fights alone are rare, maybe 5 to 1, unless it is a zerg rush, I kill very well, 4203 hps now and going strong, I know what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
The only place mind numbing is good, is against a mage.<br />
<br />
You keep talking about &quot;loading up on cheap shots&quot;  eh? So I waste much time to get stealthed again, wait out CS timer, to stun for a few seconds? Gee, my maces do that several times a fight anyway, why would I do that? In the time I could do two CS's, we are talking thousands of points of damage and even more stun I have probably lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to see actual pvp vs a rogue pally dps, like I said, get hit all the time for 300-500 and I have to bandage every single fight, they are not hitting weak. My dps vs a pally is knocked down to around 200-250 tops, while they are unshielded. We are talking 150 ish for an overall fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
My problems are not with palies 1 vs 1, but the effect they have on group pvp, wait till battlegrounds come out and see :)</div></div><hr />

I'd still go that route because stealth is so handy to avoid mobs/players, not to mention the ambush/remorselessness build for me is by far the fastest way to solo grind and it's so much fun.  Fun &gt; all for me, which is why my paladin is slowly heading to the old soldier's home.<br />

Mill I gave you dps with my setup already.  L51 paladin runs 40-60 using 1 hander (Fist of Stone) depending upon which seal I use.  With my 46.5 dps 2 hander I run 60-80, with spikes of 100-120 if command goes off a lot and/or crits.  I hit for over 200 a swing with my 2 hander and with a melee crit + command crit I can dish out something like 800-900 points of damage, but that's very rare.  Big hits != dps. Missing with a 3.90 speed weapon is extremely painful.<br />
<br />
By comparison my L31 rogue is clocking over 70 dps already and I'm using a L27 instance dagger.  When I get my SM daggers my dps is going to soar into Abuse Land- I can't wait.  When I get my Thrash Blade and MR dagger- it will be into Insanely Overpowered Land. I can't imagine what it will be like when I get my Shanker and other 55+ instance daggers- egads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">These conversation get confusing. I'm referring to cheap shots and I didnt bring up poisons actually first. Just saying they CAN be applied in combat and not a helpless passenger. <br />
<br />
My exposer armor and cheapshots was meant for the 3 vs 1 pallie killing. The poison situation was also meant for group and a troublesome pallie. I UNDERSTAND how many points are wasted not spending it on damage BUT IF YOUR NOT THE ONLY DAMAGE DEALER why wouldnt you go out of your way to NOT minimize his strenghts??<br />
<br />
I was in all that trying to talk about your group rant and it kept getting turned back into one on one tactics. I didn't say you should 1 vs 1 do any of that. Vs him alone you will have to eat both shields and possible a lay on hands I understand its a different tactic. These threads are just a mess boucning back and forth betwen pvp , pve , duel , one vs one , 1 vs 3. <br />
<br />
If you are the only damage dealer one on one than Id assume cheapshot wouldnt stun him long enough to warrant using it. Than damage would rule to make him blow through his shields and than mana. <br />
<br />
I understand the rogue has limited health and chance to bind wound. When you are 3 vs 1 that doesnt apply now does it?<br />
<br />
I didnt say that using Mind Numbing was the way to go one on one. But someone acted like it was impossible to put on during the 1 vs 1 fight. That doesnt seem true with Cheapshot as your hands. I didnt say it was feasable. <br />
<br />
Are we clear now or did I make things more confusing? Its hard debating all this stuff we things are different in different situations. Duels are different than PVP. PVE is much different than PVP. Small PVP raids are different than living on a PVP server and each fight is different. Isn that actually the fun of the game?<br />
<br />
If they add a plate class to Horde ala Death Knight will they have to add something to alliance along the lines of a shaman? Would that even make sense in Wow lore?</div></div><hr />
