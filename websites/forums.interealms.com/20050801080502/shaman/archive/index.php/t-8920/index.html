Is it possible to have a setup that won't slow down EQ with the luclin models on and a 1024 x 12xx resolution?  I have 512 DDR ram, a 1.8 ghz athlon processor (2200), an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro with latest drivers as of 12/14/02, no programs running in the background, a cable modem, and I'm doing my special whoady dance.  I spent all this money and STILL it slows down in expansion lands with full clip plane!<br />
<br />
Anybody have any ideas why?  Is there anybody out there who has a computer that avoids this problem?  Exactly how much carbohydrates do you remove from a sandwich by decrusting it?</div></div><hr />

You're welcome to call me a troll when you've contributed the amount of worthwhile posts to this community I have. :) And I've never (to my recollection) posted to any druid thread. So, /rude on :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm that seems like an odd problem.  My friend has a Geforce 4 4600 and has absolutely no problems in the bazaar with all models on.  I find it interesting that a video card, that is from what I heard supperior is having troubles.   Is your mother board set up correctly for the card? IE. Do you have it set to agp 4x?  It could be a driver problem with ATI, try the set before it to see if that helps.  ATI has been notorious in the past for crappy drivers, that may very well be the case.  Mind you I haven't been reading up on the newest video cards and ATI may have changed their act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Veon of Firiona Vie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Fozy... yeah I thought it was odd getting slowdown and overall i have not gotten much of an improvement through this card.  I know a good deal about computers but not much about motherboard configurations.  All I can tell you is that I had to manually install drivers... the install program gave me a message that my current system's driver setup won't support the specified device(s).  <br />
<br />
It's a new computer, HP, windows XP.  Any way I can check to see if it is set to agp 4x?  Sorry I wish I understood what you were saying.  I'm just upset b ecause that card was so darn expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found this out from personal experience. EQ does not like the 9700.  You will get much better performance in eq with a G4 Ti.  In all other games however the 9700 ownz.  But if your like me and really only play eq, get at ti4600. You'll be much better off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You'll never get a decent framerate in the Bazaar, simple as =(<br />
<br />
As long as performance is acceptable in places you actually hunt in, who cares =)<br />
<br />
One thing though, it helps a LOT to just restart EQ every now and again, especially if your zoning lots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Your resolution is damn high.  Oh my goodness!<br />
<br />
You know what, I thought 512 mb of RAM was really pretty great for quite a while, until I put in 1024.  I noticed quite a big difference; even things that didn't seem particularly slow to me before started to seem faster and smoother.<br />
<br />
Also, a 1.8 athlon really isn't THAT fast.  <br />
<br />
You're asking close to the maximum you can expect to ask in EQ -- all Luclin models on and 12x10 resolution. God only knows how much you have on in terms of spell effects, /showgrass or whatever, and how far out you set  your character to see.  Broadband and a nice video card or not, it seems to me you're pushing things to the extreme, especially since not all parts of your system are really that extreme at all.<br />
<br />
According to Gruog, your 9700 isn't ideal for EQ -- no idea how accurate that is, or if settings on your card can be adjusted to compensate, or whatever.  But if you're like most people, you won't be too keen on returning a card you otherwise like.  If you bought it from someplace that will let you do it, and you want to do it, maybe you'll give it a try, I don't know.<br />
<br />
But if you keep your card, the slowpoints in your system that you tell us about seem to be memory and an average CPU.  Changing your CPU is something you might or might not want to do, but getting more memory is a no-brainer.  Memory always helps most everything I wind up doing on computers, and I've found through personal experience that EQ is one of them.  Since that's the cheapest upgrade you can make, try it out -- get another 512.<br />
<br />
If not, consider not dialing in the max possible difficulties for your system in EQ and tone down some of your settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a similar issue.<br />
<br />
I just bought a new laptop. Alienware area 51m - comes with an ATI Radeon 9000 built in. So no, swapping the graphics card aint an option.<br />
<br />
1 gig of memory. Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz. 64 megs on the Radeon.<br />
And I still get slowdowns in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I run in 1024 mode, with luclin graphics on but spell effects off.  What I found helped was turning social animations off. I still have dynamic lighting on and clip plane at 100%, and I can walk around, but I do get little lag spikes from it. It's not smooth like I had hoped. But before, with my GF3, I had to crawl around looking at the floor with clip plane set at 0% on my old machine. So we've got progress. Just not the progress I had hoped for.<br />
<br />
The machine is wonderful. It's only 10 pounds, it is a beautiful shade of shiney blue, it's great for lan parties. It does get VERY hot at times. I often suspend it when I am not using it - my other machine runs my trader char, as the hotness worries me a bit.<br />
<br />
You know, people still wave and stuff with social animations off. I never could see a diff with it on, so I dunno why people ever turn it on.<br />
<br />
Mip mapping is still on, texture caching off, dynamic lights on, all models on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some thoughts.<br />
<br />
What type of motherboard do you have?  In order of priority for impact on graphics &quot;lag&quot; in EQ, is the following:<br />
<br />
1)  Graphics card<br />
2)  Motherboard<br />
3)  CPU<br />
<br />
Your CPU isn't that strong, and if you are running all of this on an old motherboard, you could stick a Cray supercomputer in for your graphics processing and it wouldn't do any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">who DOESN'T get slowdowns in the bazaar? I have an Athlon XP 2400+ with a Geforce 4 Ti 4200 overclocked to 4400 speeds and with 128 megs of onboard DDR memory, and 512 megs of 2700 DDR system memory. I have to turn down my far clip plane to 0 to get reasonable framerates. This is with the luclin extra detail models, of course.<br />
<br />
To me it seems that it's basically impossible to get good framerates in the Bazaar with your Far clip Plane up. It doesn't matter what hardware you're using, the only thing that does matter is how many people there are in the zone. And considering how almost 100% of the time there are 450+ people in the bazaar here at Tunare, it makes sense framerates suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Veon of Firiona Vie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's probably the motherboard.  I tried to see if agp4x was enabled but my BIOS is extremely limited.  Also, I can't download the latest drivers for my video card due to an error and the fact that when I do it manually, after the next restart XP automatically downloads its own, old drivers over the new ones.  It's awfully frustrating.  Is there any way to disable XP's automatic installation of its version of drivers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Veon, I seriously doubt it's your motherboard.<br />
<br />
We all just need to face the fact that pretty much no PC (at the moment) can handle trying to run the Bazaar at full-clip plane.<br />
<br />
My Athlon 1700+ with 768MB Ram and a decent Geforce 3 lags bad in the Bazaar with clip-plane &gt; 20 percent.<br />
Thats WITHOUT sound, no Luclin models, no dynamic lights, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Just stick clip-plane to 10-ish percent when you enter there. /Shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There's an easier way to do it too, but I cant remember where... Maybe control panel/system?<br />
<br />
I do it like this:<br />
 Control panel -&gt; Adminstrative Tools -&gt; Services -&gt; Automatic Updates. Pick properties, and disable or turn it to manual. (I prefer disabled, I want to know what drivers or updates my computer uses...)<br />
 Just a hint for you people, Win XP has damn good Help files in Explorer, at the... help section. Just type what youre looking into the search field and it'll give you answers faster than any messageboard or tech help.<br />
<br />
 I'm a tech at the local cable modem provider, and it never stops amazing me to see how many people, even pretty computer literate,  dont even windows has help files. You dont even need to be connected to the internet to browse the help, and they WILL save a lot of your time and effort if you even look at them before calling to tech or ask help in the net.</div></div><hr />

You might try that.</div></div><hr />
