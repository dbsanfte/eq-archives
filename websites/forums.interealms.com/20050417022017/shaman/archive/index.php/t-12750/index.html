<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't flame me yet!  I've looked at some other related posts and have a couple of questions.<br />
<br />
I've seen some soloing zone lists and some posts on here referring to PoG/PoI/PoN, etc... Now, am I to take it that you can actually solo/duo in these places at 55?  I'd love to go to PoG and get some cash and xp.  Now, I'm way underequipped for my current level and can't even afford to level to 56, so for now I'm farming pp and doing AA's until I can get some respectable stats.  May I ask what is the recommended minimums for trying to solo/duo (with an SK) in these zones?  Not asking for a gear check, just a rough idea of what HP/Wis/AC I should be shooting for before putting myself in front of quadding Planes mobs.   I am JBB and Drogmor equipped.</div></div><hr />

Might be hard (or at least tideous) to solo in most of the planes before you get Bane of Nife, though I heard of soloing PoI zone-in without much is possible.  I personally hate PoI zone-in though.<br />
<br />
If you're going to solo or duo in any of the planes, I think most people will agree that you (or the tank) will want to focus on hit points.  I think it's wise to focus on HP for any character even before your primary stat, because it's what keeps you alive.  Don't sacrifice wisdom completely, but if you have to choose between two pieces of equipment, one with high WIS and no HP and one with 2-4 less WIS but with 25 HP, you'd want to take the latter piece.  I have very few pieces of armor with no WIS at all and usually it was to balance another piece that had more than enough (e.g. JBB and Bracelet of Sense).  If you come in at around 200 WIS in your 50s, you're probably doing okay.<br />
<br />
AC shouldn't be a problem either.  Whether you have 900AC or 1100AC at this level, it probably won't make a difference in PoP.  Shaman aren't PoP tanks, even with a slowed mob.  You'll be looking to avoid damage rather than absorbing it.  Though I have tanked a (slowed) nettling wraith or banshee add a few times while the rest of my group killed the first mob.  The mobs are going to hit you hard no matter what; Shaman don't have the luxury of high AC items compared to the mobs at the appropriate, respective levels except at the very high end of the game.  Though I would say you're probably making some wrong choices if you don't have at least 800AC unbuffed in your mid 50s (and having both Offense and Defense maxed at 200).<br />
<br />
My best advice for PoP is to get into a small group (you, 2 tanks and a cleric) and try to arrange so you're the highest level in the group (hard to do in mid 50s, but possible).  Avoid groups with casters other than Enchanters, because they'll just sap xp (those freeloading wizards and mages).<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting to 56 though, since you do get a very nice DOT upgrade with BoN.  Makes getting AA much faster (Darkpaw gnolls in JP last about 40 seconds with BoN, JBB and alpha pet).  You also get a haste upgrade with Celerity, which your tanks will love if no enchanter is available.<br />
<br />
If you duo, make sure to have both Chloroblast and Superior Healing up and if your tank doesn't mind, Stoicism (get this spell if you don't have it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karrelmm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a 55 Sk and i have a 46 shm we do the grey ok and the exp isnt bad for my 55 SK either. the occational names at some of the camps drops some pretty nice items, that sell from 1-5 k depending on how patient you are or how long you can keep your mule on in the bazzar. The exp isnt like the plains but i think a lot of the old world and some of the new worlds non-pop/loy have great exp and are very under used. The grey can be crowded at some times but for the most part since it is an underwater zone i have it to myself. And the grey is a lot safer and has less risk than the plains in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm in the same boat, kinda, and here's what I do.  I've been doing maidens solo.  Xp is 1% every 2-3 mobs(DB), or a 1(white or yellow)mob.  With alpha dogdog, aego/virtue + KEI sitting on my leezord, I can TANK them.  I also have all my own buffs up.  Infusion of spirit, talisman of kragg, str, dex, agi, sta, and alacrity.  HP's tend to be abut 3.5k with aego, 3.9k with virtue.  I try not to tank the white/yellow ones, as even slowed they tend to tear into you.  I cast slow, pull to where rover is parked and commence to smackin dem mobs around.  I nuke when they run, no dots or anything.  May not be the most effective method, but it works.  I normally pull in 10% a night with this method.  Duoed with a SK guildy last night, and pulled in same xp in a 1/3 of the time.  Actually ended up + 17% last night.  Sitting on your leezord you can end the fight with the same mana or more at the end of the fight as when you started, I canni in between swings.  XP might be easier somewhere else, but I'm not sure where.  I've tried the planes, and for a shaman sitting on his leezord I like Maidens better.  However I am open to suggestions on different alternatives.</div></div><hr />
