<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I originally posted this in response to a post in the general forum, but I thought I'd repost it here where it belongs.  Basically, its a laundry list of places I hunted in between 40 and 46.  Hope it helps you.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns (Velious):<br />
I'm a tradeskiller, and this place is a tradeskiller's dream (velium peices drop of miners, and crystal silk drops of spiders)<br />
<br />
Eastern Wastes (Velious):<br />
Two places I found were good to hunt here.  One was at the zone to Great Divide, where I pulled giants, animals, manticores, etc. and the other was along the ocean (kind of near the great bridge) where I hunted Ulthorks and walruses.  Ulthorks occaisionally drop tusks, and if you collect four and give them to the othmir chief in Cobalt Scar (easy to get to if you have a druid port you) you get a chance at a valuable gem such as a black saphire or blue diamond.  Also a lot of people like to do the Ry'Gorr fort here as well.<br />
<br />
Great Divide (Velious):<br />
The kodiaks here should be great for you at 41, but by 46 they've become light blue mostly for me.  You can wander around hunting shardwurms here as well, or you can set-up near the East Wastes zone or near the giant fort and hunt giants.  Exp is a little slower with giants (they have too many HP) but they give you valuable dwarf and dragon faction.<br />
<br />
Temple of Drooga (Kunark):<br />
Lots of goblins close together make this place a little hard to solo, but keep your pet buffed and gate memmed (bind nearby in Frontier Mountains) and you will be fine.  Most parts of this dungeon are filled with light blue goblins to me at 46, but some parts have clusters of dark blues, and even the light blues can give good exp because they can be killed quickly.  Beware the casters though, and always kill them first.  This zone is great for faction with chardok BTW, if you ever plan on doing those quests (http://how.to/chardok).  Also there are a few rare items that drop here, like the stone of morid which is a +30 cold and fire saves ranged slot item.<br />
<br />
Overthere:<br />
Exp in this zone at this level is slower, but still decent.  I have the best luck in southwest corner, as no dragoons path through there and I am a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie (Kunark): The giant camp in the north east corner is awesome.  Do this, do it often.  Good drops (forest giant loops) and good exp.  Great solo spot, but the spawns might be too slow for a duo, you will have to try it out.<br />
<br />
Dreadlands (Kunark):  Do yeti caves if they still give you exp at this level (I think they should at 41).  If not, try camping the little giant hut on the south end of wear the ice meets the desert.<br />
<br />
City of Mist (Kunark):  I hunted here for shaman epic quest peices and the Cann2 quest peice and gained about a level overall.  Just use root to seperate mobs, and stay near the entrance, and you should do fine.<br />
<br />
Nagafen's Lair (Sol B) (Antonica):  Too cramped for my tastes, but lots of fine steel drops and good exp.  Incredible exp for powerleveling if you have a 60 warrior who can run through getting 10+ kobolds per pull, but that is another story....<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains (Luclin):  Grimlings, grimlings, and more grimlings.  I hear there are vampires and other mobs in this zone (I may even have killed a sonic wolf once, I can't remember) but since I am a tradeskiller, I just hunt the grimlings for acrylia.<br />
<br />
Hollowshade Moor:  Same thing as above, except with a bank and a merchant.  I bound myslef in the mini-town, then alternated between the two zones depending on which one was more heavily camped already.<br />
<br />
That's all I can remember at the moment.  As you can see, I like to travel (and having druid friends helps with this a lot), but even if you don't there are probably several good hunting spots on whatever continent you are on.  Good luck, and happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thanks for the info.  I'm 46 atm, and I've hunted in several of the places you mention.<br />
<br />
Add one:<br />
<br />
Feerott - Specters. There are specters in the South West, at the Plane of Fear entrance.  One out by a tree, and after you pull him you can pull one inside the entrance.  Easy for lvl 46, and since I'm an Oger I can sell inside the zone.  Specters drop up to 3 plat, and after 1 hour I accumulated around 8 scythes...sell for 10pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fubah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Katta Guards - Good XP near Tenebrous Entrance<br />
<br />
Echo Cavern - Good XP hunting Underbulks<br />
<br />
Dreadland - Yeti Cave on NorthWest side.   Easy, All are single pullable and abundant. Decent XP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As for XP in the upper 40s, Echo Caverns is the place to be.  You can easily duo with a tank or create a group.<br />
<br />
I have been hunting there for the last 4 days and I have gaind over two levels!</div></div><hr />
