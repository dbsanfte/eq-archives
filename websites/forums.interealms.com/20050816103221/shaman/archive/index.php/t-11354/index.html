Anyway around any of the other unpleasant new graphic horse stuff?  The slow start/stop.  The interupting of spells?<br />
<br />
I will miss my old troll - he was very handsome. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shrink twice I think for a troll will remove the horse head for you. Or you can trade horse for a lizard whose head is far lower and not an obsturction. Although from what I hear riding a fast moving lizard is like being a drunken seacaptain hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye shrink twice removes horse head. There's no way around the slow start/stop but it really doesn't bother me. Only way to interrupt your spells is to click off your horse icon then duck then resummon horse.<br />
<br />
Also to reduce awful lag from the luclin models I had to turn textures to low quality. Surprisingly this doesn't affect the game graphics much, just makes the walls and ground a tad blury at close range.<br />
<br />
Once I'm done pharming gems in PoG I'll re evaluate ol' gluey. I'm not happy how this change was suddenly thrusted on us after all this time.  I prefer dungeons anyway and will probably sell horsey and be back in Seb soon camping the emp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also invis yourself after summoning horse and the horse head will disappear.  You can then knock invis off and the head will still stay gone as long as you stay in zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you drop your fps right down then cast horse you get rid of delay when fps is back to normal.<br />
You can test it by setting clip plane to 100% in bazaar, cast horse then set clip plane to 0%. Almost instantly goes to full run speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soul, I tried that last night (with a wood elf druid) and it had no effect.  Also, shrink doesn't help wood elves.  I guess I need troll illusion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BowenBathory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whats Fps mean? i thought it might mean Feet per second and how do you drop it right down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I actually like the new troll and ogre graphics. The old ones had a certain charm and nostalgia, but the new ones arent that bad. On the other hand, I wasnt sure I liked the new barbarian graphics at first, but now that I have been using them I like them better than the old models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How clever.  They finally fixed this.  Riding around on a real horse is a joy.  Riding around on an EQ horse sucks ass!  Anyway, they are too much of a hasstle to be worth anything now.  Good for them, yet another nerf.  Good for them, they aint getting my money no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Still don't own a horse .. I can well live without the standing mana regen, Canni will do the trick for me anyway, and I need to interrupt my spells constantly (lousy puller, dammit :D )<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cant be dealing with having to knock off the horse, hit D, recast horse, all just to interrupt a spell.  Add to that the other disadvantages of a horsey and my old geegee is going back to the glue factory.  With Quiesence, Canni4 and Canni5 cant say I am too upset - I knew it would happen - just means I will have to go back to smacking my canni button more often again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Kronenbourg<br />
<br />
The slow start/stop makes sense - it sucks, but it makes sense.<br />
<br />
The horsehead in the frame is just a stupid bug that should get fixed, but it does have a workaround.<br />
<br />
Eating more food and drinking more water is too trivial to worry about.<br />
<br />
But two things have me ready to banish horsie altogether: not being able to duck out of spells, and the fact that I am MOVING while standing still in first person mode.  The horse's idle animation moves slightly, and it looks like I'm drifting around a bit - not much, but enough that if I was doing it with the arrow keys I'd be interrupting my spellcasts.<br />
<br />
The other problem is that my GeForce 2 is straining anyway, and adding a bunch of horses and male barbarians with the new model is not gonna help in a raid situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Forgot to mention, I also hate the new troll models, so refuse to put em on.  Shame really that my class is the only one I still dont like the new models too (well, cept eggheads but dont see many of them).  That and frontal stun immunity really makes me wish I had started an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Theres a few more visual defects.<br />
<br />
When I first saw my horse (ie. after this patch) I thought that a polygon was missing from the back of its neck.  Closer inspection revealed that this was - apparently - its mane.<br />
<br />
When I turn right or left my horse swings like an inverted pendulum.  The effect is extremely bizarre, and so unreal its laughable.  Its more like I'm sat on an inflatable, plastic, floating horse rather than a real one.<br />
<br />
If thats not enough, here I am now forced to use a higher resolution model for my character and yet the quality of the graphics that I actually see has been significantly degraded by a horse model who's detail is insufficient given that is appears very close to my face.<br />
<br />
I am keeping my horse.  But now its only going to be used when I desperately need the additional mana regen.<br />
<br />
I can't consider this as anything other than a stupid, pointless nerf .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a personal thought here...<br />
<br />
My horse is invaluable to me for one thing... zero sit agro while swapping spells!  I never have enough spell slots to keep up spells that I need during duo, group, or raids.  With my horse up I can swap spells in and out without having to worry about the mob ping ponging to me.  <br />
<br />
I'm not too worried about mana regen unless hubby and I are taking on something that pushes us to our limits.  But it definitely cuts duo downtime in half.  I still hit my canni button while on horse and can regen back the hps very quickly without having to do the dance.  <br />
<br />
For these little points I will keep my horse.  It's not that much of an inconvenience to me to double shrink, click it off the interrupt spells, and have a slow start/stop.  Given time I got used to it and it's now an old habit.<br />
<br />
Thoughts expressed here are just the personal opinion of Sunbur Wanderaimless and not necessarily that of staff and management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Having never ridden a horse IRL (i r cityclicker) I had an easy time getting used to the horse.  Not being able to duck does suck, especially when you need to interrupt something with a long cast time.  I just upgraded my computer not even a month back and, after living with EQ on a p3-550 with 128mb ram and a voodoo3 card, I immediately put every setting on full and haven't looked back, so I never got used to using a horse with the old models, as I bought my horse right after upgrading.  Not saying I wouldn't rather start/stop faster, or that I like not being able to duck, but the mana regen in outdoor zones is worth it to me, and at some point I hope to sell back my rope horse &amp; get a chain one :)<br />
<br />
That said, I love most of the new models except trolls &gt;_&lt;  Old troll graphics may have been boxy and looked.. well.. old :p  but new trolls just don't look mean enough.</div></div><hr />
