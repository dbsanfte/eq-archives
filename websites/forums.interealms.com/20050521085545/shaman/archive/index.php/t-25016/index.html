<br />
  The &quot;I'm leaving EQ&quot; fire sales in the bazaar are spectacular, why yesterday I traded a fire beetle eye for a manastone.  <br />
<br />
  Naw just kidding, but the servers are seriously getting barren, hard to find people, only bout 12-15 people lfg at peak normally bout 6-8. We've all had friends leave EQ for the flavor of the week to just come back in a month or two, but it definatly feels different this time.  Lots of guilds on my server are haveing problems with their leadership calling it quits and along with them the more veteran cores of the guilds, should be seeing some major guild consolidations going on.<br />
<br />
Is EQ approaching Its endgame?  And if it is what do you think will happen?<br />
<br />
How long till server consolidations?  And how would they go about doing them?<br />
<br />
How are the PvP servers standing up to this, are the newbie gankers leaving and the more mature PvP'ers stickin round?<br />
<br />
How do you see the next 2-3 months of EQ outside your guild?</div></div><hr />

Most like me have been hacking away at EQ for 5 years going on 6 years. Thought it all most gamers have put up with &quot;dream fixes to the game&quot; hoping that the next patch will fix that one bug we know will make the game better, however it hasnt and l dont think it will,hench, why more and more are leaving for Real Life, In short Most gamers juat moving on with there lifes and Love the memorys EQ has giving them....

Im one of those disappearing players some of you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Ive been playing eq2 since it launched and have been pleasantly surprised.....except for the tech/ system demands the game assualts you with, even with an upper middle class-system ( :0).<br />
<br />
I canceled eq1 and deleted the game from my comp to free up space not just for eq2, but also for WoW.<br />
<br />
I didnt leave eq1 because I dislike it, quite the contrary as I was having a blast with the new content, but like some others, Im looking for something fresh (not necessarily new).<br />
<br />
I also have been guildless for the past year so leaving wasnt as difficult being that all my guildies quit or went back to their old servers a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Ive also quit eq 3 other times....and returned eventually.<br />
<br />
EQ will be around for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who needed an excuse to try the new games now have one. And the people upset with SOE customer service are likely to make that choice WoW. Diablo II is like the greatest selling game of all time (not counting Myst) and people are banking on Blizzard turning out another polished gem. I know I am. I have spent the past few weeks reading every WoW/EQ2 thread I can find.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I just cancelled my last 2 EQ accounts about 5 minutes ago. No goodbyes to friends. It's too painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the vast majority of people leaving now are people that have felt left out in the cold for a very long time in EQ. For many people EQ turned from fun to work somewhere between PoP and now. And SOE flatout refused to do anything substantial to change this situation. And that was a good decision...for as long as they didnt have any real competition. They certainly do now but amazingly enough they havent announced any of those major changes I thought they had up their sleeve.<br />
<br />
I think they are gonna loose a huge amount of subscribers. Their only hope is that people dont cancel their EQ accounts when going to WoW or that they are fed up with WoW in a month or two.<br />
<br />
EQ going to be around for a long long time.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;a long long time&quot; ?<br />
<br />
If its a year I certainly agree.<br />
<br />
If its 2 years I to a degree think that EQ1 will be around but there will be some server mergers.<br />
<br />
If its 3 years I dont believe it. I dont see why SOE would want to keep both EQ(1) and EQ2 alive for that long. Maybe it will be EQ2 that gets cancelled but definately one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Biggest loss to me personally has beem the retirement of several of my duo partners, That sucks. As I understand , I can't even inherit their accounts to box if they go on to play eq2. The station names are the same or something? Haven't really pursued it though... anyone have any insight into this?</div></div><hr />

EQ will honestly be around, as long as there are enough people to pay the bills.<br />
<br />
There may be server merges, there may be less LFG people... but I honestly see EQ being around for a long time - as in years - yet.<br />
<br />
Every expansion has people coming back &quot;Maybe this is the expansion that will make EQ rock&quot; or whatever... <br />
<br />
Many people &quot;quit&quot; but don't actually cancel their account, or just do it for a month or two (that was me - part time quitter).<br />
<br />
I have a THOERY (as in, no, I dont have facts) that EQ loses and gains people at about the same rate.    For every burn out, there's someone who's been away for 2 months, paying again.<br />
<br />
The double WoW + EQ 2 release, WILL take some people.   Some of those EQ 2 people may buy the &quot;All Access Pass&quot; and still pay for EQ 1.     Some will leave and come back.   Some will play both games... and yes, there will be some loss.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Stormhammer is by far the lowest populated server. Two years ago  you would find 220 traders in the bazaar tops. Just before eq2 was released you would find mabey 110 traders in the bazaar. Today if your lucky you might find 60 traders up and you might see 16 people in pok. Keep in mind that Stormhammer has the unique situation of having eq2 included in the subscription price so the people haven't actually left. <br />
<br />
We also have guilds leaving the server. As of reciently Precision Strike is leaving the server and it's rumored that Township Rebellion is also considering making the change. It's scarry how dead the server is.</div></div><hr />

Township rebellion have appeared on Luclin server last week.<br />
<br />
I think EQ is also headed for a nosedive when WOW is available to the rest of the world in a month or so. That's what I'm holding out for, and a great many of my friends who also tried the EQ2 beta but found it lacking. They have convinced us (my gang of buddies) to skip EQ2 and hang on for WoW, otherwise we would have probably already left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have no idea.  But I firmly believe EQ will be dead in 6 months.  By dead I mean 100k players, tops, on consolidated servers.  Just no reason to keep playing when the end game raiding is decimated by lack of players and no new players are joining.  Just natural attrition with no new influx will kill it.  Add to that the exodus to EQ2, WoW, Guild Wars, etc., and there is no way a new player to the genre would pick EQ.  Why?<br />
<br />
A few hard core players who really want to raid will remain, but for 99% of the population, one of the newer games makes much more sense.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think they are moving to consolidate PvP servers.  My husband got a random /tell from a guide asking &quot;How would you feel about that?  We're asking some of the high level players.&quot;  (and yes, when did a /who on the person asking, he had the *GM*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's funny that the elitism of the raiding guilds and the idiotic game design and playstyle-catering that SOE has done is coming back full circle to bite them in the ass.  Guilds that made it seem like you were testifying before the Senate or were being nominated for Supreme Court justice just to get into their guilds and be uber like them are now wishing they had more people to replace their losses.  Their xp playgrounds will still be empty because of SOE's idiotic game design and progression requirements, but so will a lot of other zones.<br />
<br />
People that were stuck pre-Elemental and pre-KT are going to leave in mass droves.  The uber &quot;haves&quot; are the ones that are staying, trying to justify hanging on to their TA's and the 300 hp/300 mana items and their uber huge e-peens.  No more level 65 newbies around to be impressed with your uberness in PoK or Nedaria's.  How many people that have been wallowing around at levels 65-70 with no where to go are sticking around defending EQ at this point?  Everyone I see on these boards that is doing that is an uber raider with 10k hp.  Face it, the design of this game that held the non-raider back is going to be the death of it.  I don't think OoW will keep any casual players around for very long personally either.<br />
<br />
And I didn't just quit either... I cancelled 2 accounts about 3 months ago.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And yes, clearly I was bitter, no need to point this out.  I still talke to people on my old server and I love to hear the daily stories of guilds breaking up and uber guilds resorting to cross server transfers to keep numbers up, etc...  it makes me smile :).

It's not all doom and gloom!  We just like to work hard when we raid, but we only do it 3 days a week.  T and Th evenings, and Sa mornings.  I think the problem with a lot of the end-game guilds is that they burn people out.  You don't have to raid 24/7 to progress--we're in anguish too, but our people aren't dropping like flies.<br />

So far there  haven't been major drop offs for EQII (guess people saw sense and decided there's sod all point let themselves be exploited by SOE in a different game. Stay and be exploited in the game you know. Plus now that WOW has been announced for Europe as &quot;early 2005&quot; we're not going to see that much of an exodus when the stateside servers go live.<br />
<br />
AB itself tho has gotten much quieter. Bank at PoK is usually a gathering spot (hey - let's all group together and see if we can crash the zone) but lately there's not many on outside peak hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My guild is what I call a &quot;casual, high-level&quot; guild.  We have mostly 66+ people in the guild, with decent gear and lots of AAs, but we don't raid a whole lot...  we've been like that for 5 years now, and previous game releases never really threatened our numbers.  Most of us have been together for years and we just play it nice and slow, but got some nice power in our ranks.<br />
<br />
I figured EQ2 and WoW would put a big dent in our #s finally, and actually a lot of folks went over to EQ2 on release and formed a branch of our guild over there...  We have even more planning to go to WoW.<br />
<br />
Yet, I'll log onto EQ1 in the evenings and we'll have the same # of people on that we normally do...  20+ people, even with the departures.  Not sure if some folks who were gone for awhile have come back or what, but Xegony definitely appears to be lower in #s, yet our guild is still going at the same rate.  =/  /shrug<br />
<br />
Personally, I was pretty hyped for EQ2, and bought it and played it for 4-5 nights... I'm already bored.  Yes, it looks nicer, they've added a few nifty gadgets and some newer functionality, but in the end I'm still a level 7 noob hitting a beetle for 4 damage a round and i say to myself &quot;I've played this game before......&quot;<br />
<br />
I just don't have any desire to make the full-time switch.  I might log on to say hi to the new EQ2 gamers every once in awhile, but the game is offering me very little relative newness.  For a first-time MMORPG gamer, it's probably a wonderful game, but to me it's just EQ1 with a pretty interface, and it just feels like I'm doing the same thing over again.<br />
<br />
That said, EQ1 is kind wearin on me, not because it's sucking or things have gone downhill.. but because I've been playing it hardcore for 5 years now and I'm just kinda burnt on it.  I still log on when I'm bored and have nothing else to do and get in an xp group or do a quick epic fight or raid somewhere, but otherwise I been doin' the RL thing and playin a bit of WC3.<br />
<br />
I'm definitely gonna check out WoW, see if it does anything for me.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to be the end.  Most large games retain at least a sizable cult following for years after the initial &quot;death.&quot;  WoW is going to be a huge hit to SoE though.  There won't be any server mergers, but they might offer something like a free transfer so you can join your friends or a guild on another server.  PVP in EQ has always been broken and will always be broken.  The only point to PVP in EQ is to punish weaker characters.  Most of the Zek servers are dead, because of the poorly designed nature of PVP.  I think Rallos Zek is the only one that is sort of living, but it's slowly drifting away.  I've already left EQ for WoW, so I can't really speculate other than more people will be leaving EQ in the coming months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That clause only works if you suck at playing whatever class you play.  I've server transferred twice in my EQ life and joined near end-game guilds without knowing anybody on the server or in the guild.  I showed up more than 90% of the time for raids and knew how to play.  I didn't need to grease palms or kiss asses.  Skill can still determine whether or not you succeed and you will also be respected more than someone who got in through politics.</div></div><hr />

You obviously haven't yet mastered the SOE way.  If they can charge for something, they will. ;)  I for one am leaving EQ.  Just can't seem to summon up the desire to log in anymore.  That and the fact that I do not like the direction the game has taken.  I will be giving WoW a shot just for the simple fact that I usually like Blizzard games, and I would guess that this will be no different.</div></div><hr />

and in my experience those are the people that usually don't end up sticking around for long, or don't get in the guild at all.  Don't think that we've ever taken someone just because of who they were or anything like that.  Well, I take that back, guess we did invite someone cause his brother was in the guild, but he didn't stay long cause he sucked.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter who you are, if you don't have the skill to bring it every night, then more than likely you are going to be detagged.  It's happened a bunch that I've seen in my guild.  This is also another good reason to not tag people automatically and to physically have them wait through a recruiting period.  More times than not you see someone for who they really are before they join.</div></div><hr />

Not all the end game raiders are zergers, but numbers definatly play a huge role in whether or not you can raid.  Not what you can raid, but straight if you can raid at all.  Many guilds were doing their best to maintain raid quantity, a couple weeks of a guild not being able to hit raid lvl is a true moral killer, people start dropping.<br />
<br />
Yea, people start saying oh I'm burned out, or RL is breaking in, but if they still had something to do in the game, that is where they would be.  People want something to do, I know I do, and currently just can't find it in EQ.<br />
<br />
Still hanging out, watching, waiting, hoping, but whether EQ is truely over or not, its possible I am.  Cancel button ain't hit yet, but this place don't look like its been cleaned in 5 years, I think I may be busy for abit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No, I would say that EQ as such will not really die. Online games don't just die, if people have invested into them. Look at UO, that thing was running years before EQ and is still running, despite being archaic and what not else. Even after all new updates.<br />
<br />
At some point EQ will though reach the point when there will be really no new accounts created. I don't mean old players making new accounts, I mean totally new players joining the game. The other new games, like WoW and EQ2, offer different approach to the game, and let's be honest, much more user friendly approach, with features better then in EQ. Old EQ players may not care much about them as they're used to 'old stuff', but to totally new people, these arhaic systems will not feel appeasable. So at the end it will just be more of a point for SOE how to make the current EQ population happy, so that they keep cashing out for it and not leave.<br />
<br />
But no, it wont really die as long as there are people who still play it. Most likely the amount of players will reduce over the time, but it will come at some point to more or less certain number of accounts, at times some old cancelled accounts will be renewed, then again cancelled and so on, but it'll remain at some general digit. Only question then will be how long SOE will keep it running, because twiddle yer thumbs as you want, it's still just business and money income for SOE, nothing else. If they see at some point that income is dwindling but expenses raise, they may just shut the whole thing down and nothing will help there, no petitions, no nothing. This may be in far future of course, but if the income will get lower and lower due to new games - and it will, sooner or later, there is no doubt - then question is how will the game suffer or benefit from it. Possibly no new content is created, or, the opposite, in order to keep the money coming in, some quickly slapped together expansions may be released, though quantity &lt;&gt; quality.<br />
<br />
So no worries, you'll still see some 'old timers' around and can have fun with them. Wont see really new blood around, especially the more the time goes on, but still, can do your stuff.</div></div><hr />
