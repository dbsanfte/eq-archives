Elemental mages can get well over FT200 using reclaim energy spells/clickys with pet focus effects. They are pretty pissed from first glance at that 14 page rant on it that was started yesterday. Looks like people quitting their accounts and stuff. hmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its simmilar to the reaction that the manaburn nerf recieved from Wizards.  the unfortunate thing about a nerf like this is that SOE has, for over a year, factored pet cani into Mages mana regen and a reason to deny them further passive regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its not FT200 because they can't do anything at all while pet canni, its not even like our canni where we can just hit it once in a while. They have to stop everything for a few minutes to actively regan their mana. Personally I think this change is BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, been keeping an eye on it.<br />
<br />
It's pretty discouraging to know that they'll nerf something out of the blue that even though maybe it isn't supposed to be that way it has been that way for years and has become a common routine. <br />
<br />
With their logic who's to say we won't log in one day and find our dogs not duel wielding and/or procing from the mage weapons we gave them only to find out later that sony said &quot;oh yeah, that was a mistake. Shaman pets were never meant to use weapons, sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only bigger difference here is that Mages spent much more AA than they're getting back so they could be able to pet canni.</div></div><hr />

I've heard of pet canni for mages, but I haven't heard the specifics of it.  I'm guessing that the way it works is that there is an AA that increases the amount of mana mages receive from casting reclaim energy on their pets, resulting in them getting more mana than they used to create the pet.  FT200 sounds pretty insane though, and I'm guessing for that kind of mana regen they can only do it in downtime, since they don't get root and they would not have a pet since they are killing it with reclaim energy.  <br />
<br />
I may have it all wrong, but that's what I have gathered from the few details in the posts.  I would have to see it in action to say whether or not I thought it was overpowered, but I always hate to see classes get nerfed :(  Especially when it is something that has been in place for a looooong time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow, a whole extra 20 mana per minute! <br />

Yup, that'll make the mages happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They're getting a bump in their self mana regen that should help to compensate for the nerf / bug fix / whatever you want to call it.<br />
<br />
Their common defense seems to be that it was extremely situational for when they could use it and so it shouldn't be nerfed because it couldn't be used very often. My line of thinking is that if it can't be used very often, then you won't miss it very much. How do you regain mana the rest of the time you're playing? Is it really so bad to rely on KEI + Self Mana Regen buffs the way most casters do? I'm thinking that it's not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the mages mana regen line stacked with PotN like familars do (I think anyways) they'd have something going on. But since they don't stack, the mage buff is rarely used and puts them behind the other casters. For mana regen bringing Necros (Lich series) and Enchanters (Gather AA, Mana Taps) into the picture only makes it worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The self buff also has the same stacking issues as the cleric self mana regen buff.

not to mention mages that switched their spec. to support pet canni.<br />

<br />
It takes a ton of AA and gear to get setup to do it really well. Fully equipped time level mages have gotten over 250mana per tick if they stop everything and do it. The average magician with all the spells and AAs can get about 150mana per tick from it. Most magicians dont use the reclaim AA, they use a reclaim energy clicky.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea, with all the AAs and a instant Reclaim Energy clicky a magician can pull about 200 mana back per cast of a pet. They can get their pet cast time down to 5 seconds as well.<br />
<br />
I'm too tired at the moment to try and run the numbers to see if this is a more efficient mana regeneration that our own cannibalize lines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Important question here.<br />
<br />
Who is the dev with a stick up their ass that said, &quot;Let's be complete jackasses about pet canni and screw up a few tens of thousands of mage's week!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, developers MUST have some quota of changes they have to make a month.  I honestly can't imagine what would make this pop into the head of a developer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Develpoer --- &quot;Hmm what can I do to make this game much mroe annoying and monotinous --- Oh yeah nerf any type of mana regen that may be even slightly out of sight....

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a mage/former mage, I am rather pissed about this change, I am still not sure if I am going to quit my mage and play Wazbuk full time.  And another thing that is so bad about it is Absor would give us hints about it being our regen, and said it would stay the way it is and not be changed.  When asked about Mage regen Absor Said, Look towards your pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If it wasn't so overpowered, they wouldn't be complaining about losing it so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think this is the case at all.   In many cases they have spent a ton of time, plat, and switched their specialization in order to pet canni effectively.  They have bought AAs they might not otherwise buy,  bought equipment they might not otherwise have bought, etc.  I can't imagine how angry I'd be if this happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Canni isn't overpowered, but I'm sure we'd have 20 page threads if they decided one day they wanted to change the fundemental way that it worked without changing any of or spell costs ect. <br />
<br />
You could give a mage unlimited mana though, they're biggest limitation is agro. They have absolutely no way to reduce agro, not even root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What, did Thott finally got around to diagramming mages (why couldn't he have picked beastlords this time?)?.  The current devs don't play the game.  It's really obvious with every big change they make.  They're trying hard, but they don't have even the slightest idea of how the game is actually played.  They're trying to balance it on paper, and there are just too many variables that they're not taking into account.<br />
<br />
True, it's very complicated, but that's why you don't make massive sweeping changes like this out of the freaking blue.   /rude Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Are you all stupid?<br />
<br />
Do you really think 240 mana per tick regen without losing life was balanced?<br />
<br />
Darkpaw, you don't regen 240 mana per tick, period.<br />
<br />
Pet Canni was no different than Canni, as it fell under &quot;active&quot; mana regen. The mages would suspend their current pet, and start &quot;pet Canni'ing&quot;, then recall the pet again.<br />
<br />
How many of you used to hear about Pet Canni before they introduced those AA's and the new pets? Wonder why? Because it was &quot;in line&quot;, it would never outdo lich, let alone Canni.<br />
<br />
A nerf to this ability was overdue. Of course, it was adressed too late. <br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that i think Mages are fine. Actually, Mages need help badly imo. Their lack of CC/utility and controlling their aggro is incredible. They have my support on many things, just not on something that is broken. Pet Canni, as it was, was broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">man they have really been gettin the nerf bat out lately :/   Me thinks they getting peeps ready for EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pet canni is very situational, mages can't just start to canni whenever they feel like it. They either need to completely sit out of the fight or do it during downtime only. <br />
<br />
Gather mana is 10,000 mana in one tic, is that overpowering? No, because again it has limits. Yah if someone could walk around getting 200+ mana per tic every tic there'd be a problem with it. I would say the vast majority of mages don't get anywhere near 200 mana a tic with pet canni, would need elemental + foci most likely. Takes my wife about 4 minutes to go from no mana to full mana assuming she has a pet to start the chain with. If they don't have enough mana to even cast a pet (like after res) they have to sit down until they do which is what gives me a huge head start on getting my mana back since I can just canni a few times and Q right after res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mages and Monks both begin with the letter 'M'.  So does 'Mod Rod.'<br />
<br />
Sheesh. Poor Mages. Got to admit, of all the things that might &quot;unbalance&quot; EQ, Mages and mana regen really didn't top my list.<br />
<br />
Was there some ultra-l33t PoTime raiding strategy that called for Mage Pet / Can / Mana thingy? No? <br />
<br />
Were Mages soloing encounters they shouldn't have been? Don't think so.<br />
<br />
Was the presence of Mage(s) is a group / raid unbalancing encounters? Haven't heard anything about it. <br />
<br />
Sounds like somebody whined, Sony caught wind, looked at it, realized that the set-up in question had eluded their ultra-l33t team of &quot;testers&quot; and decided to crack down on it. <br />
<br />
Ask not for whom the nerf bat swings - it swings for thee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Pet Canni was not situational. You could freely pet canni in any environment. It was &quot;active&quot;, like shaman canni, rather than passive like lich. That doesn't change the fact that huge mana regeneration with no cost channeled through extremely efficient nukes is out of wack.<br />
<br />
Shaman Cannibalization is designed to generate mana. It has costs associated with it, it has timers and rate limiters and all shaman spells are adjusted for this capacity. The magician equivalent was not.<br />
<br />
The source of the nerf was basically the mages themselves though. Posting guides on how to get FT200 is exactly the sort of thing that is going to cause a developer to go &quot;***?&quot; when they come across it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It didn't really seem unbalancing before.  I can only remember being in one group where the mage did it regularly.  It did seem unbalanced in comparison to other classes, but I'm not sure it was actually much abused.  Hard to really call for a nerf, its just not at the top of anyones' list of imbalances.  It does seem like they're trying to adjust a great many things all at once about the classes.  Bards are getting a rather hefty spanking as well.  It just makes me a bit nervous when they try to rebalance so much at once.<br />
<br />
What bothers me about the players reactions is its ALWAYS the same.  Any nerf and the messageboards are crawling with 'I Quit' posts.  If even half the people who post on message boards saying their quitting actually did, eq would be a wasteland.  Seriously, if you want to quit, please do.  Trying to get someone else to quit to make YOUR point is total bs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Someone mentioned &quot;Gather Mana&quot; above because it's 10k mana in 1 tick.<br />
<br />
Dude, GM has a 142 minute reuse. Even with max AAs it's about 100 minutes. 100 minutes = 1000 ticks = FT10... ASSUMING you have a 10k mana pool which NO ONE does. At best with uber gear it's close to FT6. My god... lets nerf that right now.<br />
<br />
Assuming you could Canni4 constantly and hit Canni5 every time it popped (ie, you were ONLY regenning mana and never used any) a shaman is going to cap out at around 120mana/tick. That's C5 every 3 mins (1066mana/30ticks = 35mana/tick) and hitting C4 every time the spell gem pops (82mana/tick). In reality that's doesn't happen because you'd be sustaining about 35dps on yourself. It'd be like tanking a slowed exp mob while you're just standing around.<br />
<br />
A Mage on the other hand... with no focus items at all can get away with around 40mana/tick. <br />
<br />
If you add in the right focus items (50% Summoning Haste, Conjuration Specialization, Spell Casting Mastery 3, Mana Preservation 4, Summoning Efficiency 3) is pulling in around 165mana/tick.<br />
<br />
If you throw in the pet focus from LDoN... that number jumps to 200mana/tick.<br />
<br />
At the same time the Mage suffers NO penalties other than not being able to cast other spells... the same as a Shaman would. A Mage with a Mod Rod only has to med for about 20 seconds after rez before they can make their first pet and be good to go. There is no way any other class can compete with that.<br />
<br />
And FYI, with Time Gear a Mage is up around 280mana/tick.<br />
<br />
I don't think there's anyone here can can deny that just screams &quot;Nerf Me Please&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I never heard anyone bitch about pet canni while it was in the game, and to my knowledge no mage has caused a huge ruckus by taking down a huge mob solo because of his pet canni ability. Correct me if I'm wrong though, I might've missed a beat.<br />
<br />
The bottom line, to me, is: Why cause a huge uproar from a whole class by nerfing something you've left in the game and known about for quite a long time? They weren't taking down Gore with 6 man teams or anything, like back when MB was the cool thing to have. I'm sure if they nerfed something that the shaman class has been using and enjoying for months we wouldn't be very happy either.</div></div><hr />

If the MT goes down, who gets summoned 1st?  The mages.  Unlike wizards they have no means to control there aggro .  If mages have to rely on FT+MC+buffs for mana regen, they will become useless on raids.  Yes, they have there pets, but how many high end guilds allow pets on raids and how long would those pets last?<br />
<br />
As to the Mod Rod nerf, most mages demanded it.  Before the nerf, all a mage did was summon rods.<br />
<br />
This nerf is unwarrented in it current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">This change is long over due.  Mages have the exact same limitations as we do while using their active mana regen as us.  And they dont have to lose health in the process.  And well equipped/well AAed they get upto x2 to x3 more mana then we do.  <br />
<br />
Then they complain about agro, rofl spend 5 minitues playing a shaman and see what kinda of agro our dmg spells generate.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention what was stated in the post Reclaim energy was never meant to give back more mana then the pet cost, its an error that they got away with for a long time should be happy they got away with it as long as they did.  Remember when affliction haste was changed to not affect debuffs, we just sucked it up cuz it was an error in the first place.<br />
<br />
Mages are the biggest whiners invariably of all the classes out there that Ive met, just they should just suck it up and deal with it.  Hope this is in the patch tonite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean like when they nerfed the various affliction foci to stop working on malXXX/Slow/Root? That was a far more sweeping change than the changes to mage mana regen.<br />
<br />
I don't think refunding a fair number of the points is out of line, there are some abilities in there which without pet canni become not so great anymore...but the ability needed to be toned down, it was really grotesque.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">For those that think mages can canni to the same extent as a Shaman, try suspending your pet mid fight and canniing, the way this is used is by a fast burn play style.  You bun down mobs as fast as possible then have to pet canni for a few mins to get your mana back, totally different to a shaman who can constantly canni with no downtime.  Pet canni is the only reasonable mana regen for a mage, with its removal they have really screwed up mages balance.  <br />
<br />
Another thing that you may not have considered is the fact that every pet summoned requires a Malacite.  This is not a cost issue but a space issue, think how you would feel if they all of a sudden announced &quot;Ohh by the way, we fixed canni now, it now uses component XXX every time you cast it&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Mages are already having enough problems in the high end game as it is, they are soo far behind wizzys at that level in DPS that they cant even get into a guild, never mind make raid selection.<br />
<br />
As someone said above, pet canni has been around for soo long that it has been factored into mages spell mana costs.  <br />
<br />
As for those scoffing at the agro issue mages have, we shaman have the AC and HPs to handle that agro, as well as our slows and roots to further keep us alive.  Mages are the only int casters that have NO root/snare, NO rune type spell and NO agro reducer.  Mages biggest heal is for 1300HPs and have horrible recast times, if they get an add they struggle to keep their pet alive, they cant chain nuke or they get agro, they cant park adds as they have no root.<br />

None of the 60+ pets continue to use Malachite.<br />

Pet Canni while fighting isn't that hard really. Depending on the mob and the tank you can probably produce more DPS just nuking than bothering to get your pet to engage anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it was, if you had to pet canni midfight, you could have just reclaimed your pet, get FM via pet canni and resummon and buff a new one. No matter how you turn it, it was broken.<br />
<br />
Active manaregen is designed to be inconvenient(see Canni), that's why it must heavily outdo any form of passive mana regen(even lich). For Shaman's Canni this currently isn't true, for pet canni it was. <br />
Give mages a active mana regen(through pet canni) of 80 per tick and raise Shamans' to the 240+ mark and we are both set for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Even this, however, wouldn't fix the real issues with Mages, which i stated above.</div></div><hr />

  Brenlo is right it was NEVER intended to return more mana then used.  Regardless of how you accomplish this, its still an exploit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Since I play both classes and this change will effect me in a MAJOR way, let me dispell a few misconceptions I have seen.<br />
<br />
Any 49+ mage could pet canni - but not well. To maximize pet canni you needed the right gear + AAs. How many AAs - oh only about 38. If you had access to a pet focus item (easy now with LDoN) that enhances it further. Mages could achieve mana regen in excess of 200 mana/tick. A time equipped mage could in fact refill their mana after a rez faster then a shaman with can 5 - I've raced before, but you have to have the right AAs and gear to do this.<br />
<br />
Using Pet Canni heavily, a Mage could tie a rogue for long-term DPS. For short term DPS wizard's have always blown us out of the water. Note I say TIE a rogue. Mages are supposed to be a DPS class, yet without pet canni we rank way below rogues, wizards, and necros.<br />
<br />
How was pet canni balanced? To pet canni to full mana took 100 secs on average. During that time a mage's only form of defense is gone. Also during that time a mage is contributing 0 DPS. Pet canni was used in about 3 situations: 1) An Experience group - nuke full for 4 mobs, canni on the 5th 2) A LDoN group - same as exp group really 3) To regain mana after rez.<br />
<br />
PET CANNI WAS NOT AN EXPLOIT. It has been in the game from the beginning. Mages even brought it up at fan fairs. It was treated the same as FD pulling - never intended, but part of the game none the less.<br />
<br />
Without this our mana regen - and by the same token DPS - will be totally hosed. Mad would be an understatement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">So much bitterness and anger on these boards . . . what's up with that?  I haven't seen one post on this board EVER about how unbalancing mage canni-pet is.  NOT ONE.  Now half the people on this board act like this is some &quot;exploit&quot; that all the over-powered mages have been using, and that it's been begging to be fixed for years.  How many of you even knew about it before this morning?  <br />
<br />
The facts are stated rather reasonably on some of the more well-articulated posts on mage compendium.  Those posts spell out exactly how disadvantaged mages are compared to the other int casters when it comes to both passive and now active mana regen.  The few mana regen spells/abilities mages get either require a large investment in AAs or don't stack with other commonly used mana regen spells.  Their water form ability doesn't work with horses, so it's basically useless in any outdoor zone.  As it stands, mages are clearly at the bottom of the heap when it comes to mana regen.  Increasing mana regen by 2 is really going to fix that problem  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Finally, don't compare mages to shamans - that's just plain idiotic.  We have much higher AC and HP and can take the beating.  How many mages do you know higher than level 20 who tank-in-the-face?  We have root, slow, and VP to prevent damage.  Mages get NOTHING like that.  As it stands, mage pets are basically higher hp versions of the beastlord and necro pets, sans the utility spells to make those pets really useful.  At this point, mages are looking for some indication that SOE will increase some other aspect of a mage's power, such as pet boosts, to help mitigate this mana-regen nerf.<br />
<br />
The main issue at this point is no longer &quot;bring back canni&quot;.  It's &quot;why, even with this supposedly godly level of mana regen, weren't mages considered overpowered?&quot;.  If mages can regen mana so quickly, why weren't they the god class of EQ?  Anyone who's now going to try to claim that fact is going to look pretty silly, because before this morning I saw NO ONE on this board making those claims.  <br />
<br />
It just seems a lot of people here enjoy seeing someone else getting nerfed, without even needing to know the details behind it.  And that's pretty sad.<br />

Beeg, this right here tells me you have no experience with a 60+ Mage.  The only pet Mages have that doesn require a component is the Epic pet.<br />
<br />
Mind you there is an AA they can purchase for 5 AAexp points that allows them not to use components when summoning their pet, but you still must have at least ONE malachite on you.<br />
<br />
The only thing this nerf is going to do is make Mages even more of a joke of a class sadly.  They have absolutely no utility, no form of crowd control, and more mobs are getting removed as being summoned.  Add on to the fact that their nukes are almost equivalent to a druids. They have turned in to a really sad class.</div></div><hr />

Actually neither of you is exactly right. The following pets don't use any reagent:<br />
Epic pet - see below<br />
Servant of Marr - 62 pet<br />
Servant of Ro - 63 pet<br />
Rathe's Son - 65 pet<br />
<br />
The epic is technically a level 46 spell, but the pet cannot be summoned till level 51. However, the mage epic is one of the most difficult in the game and VERY few mages get this epic before their upper 50s.<br />
<br />
Of the pet's that don't use a reagent, Rathe's Son is the only one that was useful for Pet Cannibilization.</div></div><hr />

I know when you read the numbers it looks out of whack but as a mage i can tell you it is not what it seems.  Absor has told us mages for yrs to look for our pets for mana regen because our mana regen is poor compared to other casters.  After spending roughly 40 AA, buying the right gear, and specilizing in Conj you can canni quite well.  Anyone playing a mage past 49 knows canning was a fundmental part of being a mage, it was part of what they build our class on in later expansions.  In PoP mages were defined as a DPS class, our pets could not face tank mobs anymore and cant do enough damage against PoP mobs with all those HP.  Sony idea of making harder mobs is to jump hp/ac and DPS for those mobs which means to a mage our pets can not survive encounters anymore.  As a long encounter DPS class at the high end level mages ranked in the top 4 in DPS classes.  The rest for this was because of canning, on long fight we could drain our mana and canni back conitnue to nuke.  With out canning we are just ahead of Pallies in DPS.   <br />
<br />
For those say this was needed  PLAY the class then come tell me about how overpowering it was.  Now maybe in a big encounter u will wipe because of the drop in DPS.  You can not give us no compensation for taking a fundmental part of class away and think we are fine.  I place mages as one of the classes in most need of help.  Please make mages better then just for summons items for others and their pets and farming greens in old world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">To all those that keep saying &quot;There is no cost to pet canni&quot; wake up.<br />
<br />
1. Mages' only defense is its pet.  We don't even have root.  I can't tell you the amount of times in say an LDoN mission where the puller brought back more than one mob unannounced while I was in the middle of canni'ing.  By the time I tried to unsuspend my pet I see &quot;Interrupted...Sarridon hit for 346 damageX2...interrupted...&quot;<br />
<br />
2. If the pet or you is on any mob's hate list you can't suspend your pet.  That effectively, in a fast pulling situation, puts you in the position, IF you need to canni, to kill your nicely equiped pet and do it anyway, which 99% of all mages won't do. If you do then you have a weaker pet.<br />
<br />
3. While I am canni'ing I'm doing nothing else.  I'm bringing 0 damage to bear (which is what I was brought along for) and 0 utility (like we have any anyways but hey).  This is not the case with necros or shaman.  I don't begrudge that it is just a fact.<br />
<br />
4. the 150-200+ number is only relevant if you are doing it or can do it constantly which you can't.  PRACTICALLY, it adds approximately 30-40 mana per tick to our totals,which is significant but doesn't put us higher than necros, who have everything under the sun.<br />
<br />
5. With canni we still aren't the top damage dealers on raids.  Without it we will slump lower.  Wizards top us and do it lower on the hate list.  Necros equal us and lower on the hate list.  Rogues can sometimes beat everyone and get that nifty evade skill.<br />
<br />
6. With canni we still don't solo as well as any of the solo classes which include you guys AND still don't have meaningful utility.<br />
<br />
Maybe some should understand the full dynamics of the situation before they make comments. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I going to have to side with the mages on this one.<br />
<br />
Mages were by no means one of the overpowered classes in EQ.  Largely due to the lack of utility, lack of aggro control and no access to slow (pets not strong enough to face tank without it).<br />
<br />
The numbers behind pet canni sound great... but there were many issues that make it balanced.<br />
<br />
An optimist would say this means that Sony is finally going to &quot;fix&quot; mages and give them some utility/aggro control, and that the new stuff would be so good that it would be broken if it was added to the already high mana regen...<br />
<br />
If thats the case... why didn't they hold off on the nerf until they actually had the fixes in place?  As it is, it just seems like kicking em when they're down.<br />

<br />
Whats the shortest amount of time you can pet-canni?  ie how long is one 'cycle' from start to finish?  <br />
<br />
Shamans aren't doing anything while cannibalizing either.  But I'd guess a cycle of canni4 / 5 is much quicker than what mages can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6. With canni we still don't solo as well as any of the solo classes which include you guys AND still don't have meaningful utility.<br />
<br />
Mages have the highest sustained DPS in the game in group XP situations, because of the combination of pet damage + nuke damage.  As far as raids go, ask a shaman just how much damage they put out on a raid.  The game does not revolve around raids.<br />
<br />
And the aggro argument does not wash when a mage is grouped with a Knight.  Knights can hold aggro on any mob from just about any other class (except shamans ;) ).  I've seen mages in XP groups just hold back a few until the Knight has aggro-lock, then chain nuke like a wild man.  Then they just canni up between pulls and do it again.<br />
<br />
That's the reason for the nerf.  That, and some mages were so impressed with this ability that there were guides floating around message boards about how to recover insane amounts of mana in a short time with no intrinsic risk.<br />
<br />
Remember, mages, all you do when you canni is lose access to your pet.  Shamans trade HP for mana, which means we directly put our lives at risk when we do so.<br />
<br />
I think that the nerf came to restrict a mage's ability to solo, however.  Many of the nerfs that have come down the line have been aimed at solo, as if SOE hates the fact that anyone outside a necro can solo, so they're stepping in to do something about it.<br />
<br />
The way the nerf was done was rather raw, but I don't think that the nerf itself is so crippling as mages lead us to believe.  Our guild mages were talking about it last night and they said it simply meant that mages were going to have to learn the concept of mana management.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Its good for mages really, I can imagine that pet canning is a total pain in the ass.

Also they are getting boost as a class, I mean I bet most of the mages did not bother with pet canni, now they are going to obtain extra mana regen. I have nothing against mages, cool class if you like that class.</div></div><hr />

This is not completely true. We have the advantage of spells that work over time, such as dots and heals. I could have several dots working on a mob while canning, I could be healing myself or others while canning.<br />

True, but you can't increase your damage factor as a shaman by much via canni.  If you use that mana for extra dots, you will get aggro.  If you come anywhere close the damage output of a DPS class with DOTs or DOTs + blasts, you will run out of mana, be limited by the canni-ing you need to do (or the healing to regain the lost health), or gain aggro.<br />
<br />
The top level mages damage increase via pet sacrifice appears to be overpowered, and doesn't seem to draw the increased aggro.  That said - it would be better to nerf the mana return formula (i.e. lower the amount of mana received per reclaim) to keep it in line than to get rid of the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

As for the mage nerf, no, I don't think they were overpowerd and I'm sorry they got nerfed. My guess as to the reason would be that it limited things that they could do with mages in other areas. Increase the hitpoints on a pet and you have to worry about how much it increases their ability to petcanni. Same goes for decreasing the duration of their pet summoning spells. Odds are it would have been a balancing nightmare in the future and maybe they noticed it when gearing up for the new expansion. At least I hope so for the mages' sake, getting hit by the nerf bat this hard when you're talking about focus items and AAs that suddenly become huseless is painful, I recall how pissed I was when they did that with shaman and affliction items no longer affecting all detrimental spells. ... and that one didn't hit any AA skills, just items that people had spent time and money to get.</div></div><hr />

When they say they refund one type of AA ... it's worse than this. When mage had the AA they want to refund, it was preventing them to get full benefit of canni pet. In other words, all mages who used to canni pet actively never had the AAs that are being refunded. To improve it you had to spend like 40 more AAs, have specialized gear / quested gear =).<br />
<br />
What makes the mage community that angry is the fact they tried to stealth nerf it. It's because a mage found out it was getting nerfed on test server, the mage community was aware. It was 3 says ago and it went live today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">You guys are on crack, if you are arguing *for* pet canni. The class has many problems, which I have stated many times and in my first post on this thread, but pet canni was and is totally unbalanced.<br />
<br />
I have been playing a Mage up to level 65, in the normal and end game of EQ, so no lecturing please.<br />
<br />
Mages coming to this board explaining how situational pet canni was make me cry. We know better than anyone else how situational Canni is. Yet, we, the masters of Cannibalize, don't regen close as much mana as pet canni used to give mages *without* taking HPs from them.<br />
<br />
Glorianna, how are you healing while you cannibalize ?<br />
<br />
Mages get a DoT, rather weak, but they get one. Mages can use their swarm and their wizard, while they pet canni.<br />
<br />
Mages aren't balanced, I have been saying that and if you know the Mage class, you can't deny that. But pet canni is NOT the way to go.<br />
<br />
For those arguing that mages weren't overpoweredd due to pet canni, I only got a &quot;what is overpowering?&quot;. a sustained DPS of 250+ for an infinite amount *is* overpowering in my world. The reason you don't notice it is, because many are just clueless in this game and as long as the large majority doesn't capture something as &quot;overpowering&quot; it just isn't deemed to be so.<br />
<br />
If a Shaman could cast Quiessence for 1 mana, would people cry overpowering? I think they would, even though it would still be situational and not allow the Shaman to do things he couldn't do already in 99% of the game. And this is just a an example...</div></div><hr />

About 8 seconds (with the right items/AAs) which returns 120 to 200+ mana (depending on gear, AAs, and specialization).<br />
<br />
Perelandra - thanks for the info. <br />
<br />
I was under the impression that pet-canni'ing was a 30-40second affair.  I can understand a mage being upset about being both defenseless and useless for 30 seconds or more...but for &lt;10 seconds? Not such a big deal.<br />
<br />
Another question - what percentage of mages will this affect?  Everyone remembers how practically every level of monk was hurt when they fixed the problems of the very high end...will this be the same for mages?  I have to admit I've never seen a mage pet-canni'ing...but I've never seen the elemental planes either, and I'm sure they exist :)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Gloriana, I disagree with you on DoTs and HoTs.  If you're casting Canni 4, you're not doing anything at all for those 4 - 5 seconds.  Same as a Mage (well, 8 seconds for a mage).  Both a shaman and a mage can work in other spells in between Cannis.  We just have to add in a heal.<br />
<br />
So  &quot;Can Can Dot Can Can Q&quot; could just as easily be:  &quot;Pet-Can Nuke Pet-Can Nuke &quot; ....etc.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't work like that. 8 seconds is for one cycle of summon pet and dismiss. It takes another like 4 seconds to suspend current pet just to setup and time again after to recall their pet. Most mages do it only when LoM so they are doing it straight for a few minutes leaving them basically defensless the entire time. Channeling on AA abilites is like nil (I have trouble doing DvA if I'm getting beat on and thats like a 1 second cast), I think it takes another 4 seconds or so to recall a pet and without their pet mages are slightly more then speedbumps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">A couple of things to remember.<br />
<br />
Malachite costs like 1 pp for a stack of 20, so it shouldn't be used in the arguments.<br />
<br />
Shaman put themselves at great risk when using CanniV by taking a massive chunk out of their own health.<br />
<br />
Mages are at little risk with Pet Canni even though they claim to be at high risk.  If the Mage is solo, Canni in a spot clear of roamers and repops.  If the Mage is in a group or raid, they are full health while they canni away, and are not going take the mob's agro away from the other folks slowing, snaring, stunning and damaging it -- because they are not actively doing anything to it.<br />
<br />
To say Mages have no defensive skill is silly.  The mage pet is the defense (and the offense).  Mages don't need root, etc. like Shaman do.  They don't need it because using the right pet for the situation allows the Mage to Stun, Root, add extra Nukage, etc.  The Mage pet taunt is huge, and good Mages know how to add damage without out-agro'ing their pets.  I've seen Mage pets get summoned before the Mage does.<br />
<br />
What was overpowering was the ungodly ability to solo.  Not necessary to take down much more powerful mobs (though they can with chain-pets -- which is a great tactic), but to take down many considerbly powerful mobs -- several in a row -- and then only have 2 minutes or less necessary to regroup.  (I think people just don't realize how powerful Mages are/were solo.)<br />
<br />
Shaman can solo the same mobs, but it takes much longer to do it.  A 30 second fight for a Mage is a 2 minute fight for a Shammy.<br />
<br />
I venture to say that Shaman use considerably more mana in the course of any fight than Mages -- especially on raids.  And, for this, the Shaman needs CanniV.  I don't have it, and I don't have super gear (5000hp raid-buffed, for example).  When I am among one or two Shamans on the raid, I am constantly Canni'ing to retain mana.  Between Regen'ing the necros, FA'ing the tanks, Malos'ing and Slowing the Mob, Patch Healing with inefficient heals, and re-buffing the dead -- well, you do the math (on even a small raid of 18).<br />
<br />
However, knowing that they had this ability to pet canni, Mages spent a ton of AA, etc. getting the maximum out of the ability.  It was not just the Reclaim Energy AA (which, btw, Mages have told me that it actually worked in such a way that it didn't allow pet-canni), but they spent AA getting dimensional pockets (to put a full-buff pet away and canni an unbuffed one), they spent AA to make the pet reagentless, etc.  If the nerf is in, they need to refund all the AA that were used to enhance this ability, so the Mage can think about putting them elsewhere.  They are also left with no other mana regen ability besides mod-rods (self-buff does not stack with the druid spells).   Mod-rods are not all that great -- good for mana in pinch, but not good for general mana recovery.  In my opinion, they need to give the Mage something to make up for this loss.  I would have played a Mage before, but definitely would not now.  So, I tend to see a little from both sides -- the reclaim was way overpowered, but complete removal is over-nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are only spending that short of a time canni'ing then you aren't doing much.  Ever since I got canni1 I have either a) chain cast canni, or b) weaved other spells inbetween canni casts.  If I am not casting canni4, I am casting another spell.  I check the timer for canni5 so I can have Q landing just before canni5 pops, then right back to using canni4.<br />
<br />
Shaman canni requires constant work.  When I play, my fingers never stop spamming spell keys so that I am always casting.  I don't just canni a few times and then &quot;get back to what I am doing&quot;, because canni'ing is what I am always doing.  I can't say this is related very much to the topic, but I am boggled by shamans who seem to replace canni4 with canni5.<br />
<br />
I can imagine using pet-canni much like our canni4 though.  When you aren't nuking, you are pet-canni'ing.  Like someone said earlier, &quot;pet-canni, nuke, pet-canni, nuke, pet-canni, etc.&quot;  Perhaps this is way more effort than most mages would like to put forth, but I do not believe for one second that it is situational.  If there is an active process to regain mana that can be done while soloing then it can also be done grouping and raiding.  What is a tragedy is that mage spells have been tuned towards pet-canni, or so mages state by quoting Absor.</div></div><hr />

This just proves to me that you don't understand the actual mechanics of it in-game. Doing what you suggest would drop a Mage's DPS by about 90 - and improving DPS is the whole point of Pet Canni. Pet canni worked best for the mage to nuke off much of his mana and then canni back up in one chunk. In experience groups that don't chain pull, a mage could do one or 2 cannis in between the pulls though.<br />

Not every mage pet canni'd, but don't think that those who did were some small minority. This change will hurt more than you think.<br />

Without Pet-canni, it very well is possible for a shaman to out damage a mage in the long haul. Might want to look at some of those log parses.</div></div><hr />

You have got to be kidding.  Mages can solo a little in tier 1 with our post 60 pets.  Anything else requires either agro kiting or charming.  Most mages simply don't bother to solo much, especially in PoP.  Mages post 60 are far and away a group class, not a solo class.<br />
<br />
Mages with pet canni where a good DPS class.  Not the best, but decent.  Mages without pet canni have about the worst mana regen, with less efficient nukes, and no utility.  The answer if it caused mages to regen too much mana was to reduce the amount of mana regen you can get from pet canni, but not to eliminate it.  The most amusing part was, SoE refunded aa points that you would not spend if you do pet canni.<br />
<br />
I play 2 classes at 65, warrior and mage(my shaman is 56, whom I play when it is nice to feel like you are actually wanted in groups).  Warrior got a huge boost this patch, and mage got crushed.  What an odd day.</div></div><hr />

I used to have to chain cast canni too and that used to use up a lot of my time. Now though with FT13, MC3, VoQ (18), Nine (8), SD (9) my passive mana regen is 51/tic in raid situtations. On a long fight I'll generally chain cast tears, torrent, + bane. Canni 5 when it pops, and maybe canni 4 two or three times in between and this will keep my mana up for a very long time. If I'm grouping I might be missing Nine or SD although I try and bring a BL along as much as possible. I can slow, nuke, DoT, and have very little mana problems whatsoever (outside of the occasional 5-6 pull with no chanter) using canni 5 and maybe 2 or 3 canni4's in between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right there I know you know nothing.  Take a check at what we are soloing and you'll see that it is not very efficient even with pet canni.  And no I don't consider my mage (65 with 170AA) soling in tier1 very good.  We solo for crap post 60, especially compared to the other notable solo classes (i.e. wizard, druid, bard, enchanter, and even shaman).<br />
<br />
Are we a suck ass class not worthy to see the light of Norrath?  No.  But many mages don't see the upside now either.  It would be optimistic to say that we got this so that we can be overall better in the long run, but like always the implementation sucks ass.  Take pet canni........NP.  However, do it when you have the compensation to dole out as well.  Don't make me pay for something that has been in the game for 3+ years and part of the status quo in the next expansion if you are taking it today.  <br />
<br />
When Absor was asked, &quot;Why is our mana regen the worst of any int class?&quot;  He responded, &quot;Look to your pets.&quot;  So for those that were saying that this is a semi-exploit or bug the answer is no.  It was an unintended consequence of expansion inflation.  Before Luclin you could canni with moderate results.  With Luclin you could do it with big results, BUT at that time it didn't matter because you had 'god rods' for a large portion, so people didn't notice those of us that were using it because EVERYONE was regening mana out their ass.<br />
<br />
As far as what a shaman can contribute dps wise while canni'ing you have dog dog.  Not great but better than 0.  However, remember why you were brought into the group.  You weren't brought into it for DPS. YOu were brought into it for your utility, which you have a lot of.  Mages are brought in purely for DPS.<br />
<br />
This shouldn't be a class battle here.  As I've said before the implementation of this nerf sucks ass.  They could have been more patient with it until they had the compensation in hand until they did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Shaman can contribute massive DPS while canning: DOTS and Pet.<br />

Mages cannot. (although I suppose Rains count)<br />
<br />
Shaman have incredible utility. Heck they can even &quot;tank&quot; sorta and melee some. <br />
<br />
Mages were given CotH, then it was nerfed. Now it's like kind of like Ringo. Yeah he's there, but he's just the drummer. <br />
<br />
Were Mages unbalancing encounters? REALLY? I'm not talking like High End Monks &quot;Rampage Tanking,&quot; I mean in day to day PvE grind were Mages THAT unbalanced?<br />
<br />
Were raids stopping because Mages couldn't Pet-Canni?  Unlike raids that grind to a halt without a slower / healer.<br />
<br />
Over-reaction plain and simple. Had Mages been &quot;all that&quot; people would have been mass re-rolling or at least mentioning them as a viable alt / duo partner. Frankly, (no offense to Mages), even here, Mages were an OPTION as a duo partner, but nothing so eye-popping as to say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mages hands down because if they're level 60 with a slew of AA's they get Pet-Canni.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the offense is people were having 'fun' playing a Mage, then frankly, I don't find that to be an offense of the nerfable type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You aren't fighting anything when you are solo and doing pet canni; you do it off in a corner.  And if you agro something then, you aren't playing intelligently.  And, when you are in a group, you do not have the mobs attention.  The other group members do.  You don't need defense when there is nothing to defend.  Stop using it in your agrument.<br />
<br />
And, as far as soloing, like I said, it is not that you can solo the really big mobs, it was that you could slam through the nearly big mobs.  The mage I hang out with, who has only very slightly better gear than I do, kills/killed things 4 times faster than I did, and does it to 5 or 6 mobs before taking a pet canni break (which is over in 2 minutes or less).   And, if we duo, he always has to wait on me even when I am constantly canni'ing.  And, btw, he is 65 and solo's all the time (maybe he is having troubles getting groups, but he does solo all the time and does it very effectively).<br />
<br />
Now, my point was not bash, it was to say there was a reason for the nerf.  It was overpowering.  And, comparing that ability to the Shaman canni is not really where we should be focusing.  However, to completely remove it was definitely over-nerfing.  For one, Mages need to be refunded any and all AA that were related to using pet-canni, because while those AA may have other uses, the Mages may (and I'd guess probably) want to put those AA elsewhere.  And two, and like I also said, they need something to make up for the loss -- a new ability or spell.  Perhaps allowing their personal buff to stack with Pot9, but a little something wouldn't hurt here.</div></div><hr />

Maybe Bane one CCed off in a corner. I was going to download a parser and see what my damage was then I realized it sucked and wasn't worth looking at.

<br />
The only way to effectivly do this is charm soloing.  How many zones have mobs where a mage can effectivly charm solo?  Almost none.  When do mages get their first charm?  65, so mages have no chance to learn charm tactics before having to play high end with it.  What additional abilities do mages have to make charm soloing safe?  Very few...Malosinia/Elemental Silence are it.  All other charm classes get root or snare(or both), which make charm soloing far far safer.<br />
<br />
Yes, some mages do charm solo, with spectcular results.  Most do not, as it is very frustrating to learn, and leads to many many deaths.  Remember, mages get no rune spell, so when a mage catches agro from a charmed, weaponed and hasted pet, they are reduced to a grease spot very very fast.<br />
<br />
Now, my point was not bash, it was to say there was a reason for the nerf. It was overpowering <br />
<br />
You still have not explained how it was overpowering.  It was an ability with some definate limits to it, ie you had to have a certain set of aa's and gear, you could not have a pet out and ready while canni'ing, you are tied up in a long cast spell.  At the high end game, you could get great mana regen out of it, but not any more overpowering than anything else is at that level.<br />
<br />
PoP reduced mages to a primarily grouping class.  Mages have very little utility, so the only thing we can offer a group is DPS.  With pet canni, we where a good DPS class.  Now we are a class with about the worst mana regen(due to stacking issues), less efficient damage spells, and almost nothing else we can offer a group.  Why would a group take a mage when wizzies, necros, rangers and rogues will all out DPS us?  If we were at all overpowered before, we are certainly underpowered now.<br />

<br />
It got on the radar screen because, if you read between the lines, it would become extremely overpowered in the next expansion. Since the majority of mages did not have IRE, the formula that was used to calculate the mana returned was based on the HP of the pet. The more HP, the more mana you get back when it is reclaimed.<br />
<br />
SOE's options were twofold:<br />
<br />
1) Increase the mana cost of the pet, so the return is minimized if the pet is reclaimed<br />
<br />
2) Change the Reclaim Energy formula to work solely off of the mana cost of a pet.<br />
<br />
If sony's intention was to give mages pets with more HP, then because of canni, their mana regen would skyrocket.<br />
<br />
If sony wanted to give mages more traditional Mana Regen, it would have been overpowered because of pet canni.<br />
<br />
Canni by itself limited a lot of enhancements that mages might have otherwise seen. Very sad though that they will probably make people pay $$ to buy improvements in the next expansion.<br />

Its a little bit like paying the bully your lunch money not to punch you in the stomach each day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Their summons only take something like 4 seconds with the right AAs, reclaim mana is right-clicky.  I fail to see how this makes pet canni &quot;situational.&quot;  When soloing, maybe, but not otherwise.  Shamans are casting a 2.5 second spell *constantly.*  Is cannibalize 4 situational?  Um, not really.  We cast it in between heals, slows, dots, roots, while tanking, etc...  Define a situation for me, other than solo play, where it would be better for the mage NOT to pet canni.<br />
<br />
Don't fall into the trap of feeling sorry for mages who complain about switching to conjuration spec from evocation.  With or without pet canni, they would have done this anyway.  Why?  Because, starting at level 57, all their single target nukes are CONJURATION specialization.  Once a mage hits level 63 (the level they get Black Steel), there's barely a weak argument for evocation spec (Firebolt of Tallon).  At 65, with Sun Vortex (which is focused by ornate/elemental gloves), all mages are conjuration anyway.<br />
<br />
Or, you could just remember the fact that the difference between Main spec and other specs is only 7.5% of the base spell cost.  Either way, none of the arguments mages are throwing up are realistic.  A situational FT200, where the only situation is that you're not casting other spells at the same time (and of course don't have a pet), is broken.  Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
I'm not championing the nerf, but I'm not going to back mages up on this one.  People pointed, smiled, laughed, and in the end accepted a completely untrue reason for the monk nerf, the even slightest need for which was entirely invalidated within a month due to the release of the PoP expansion.  I have a level 65 monk.  I know what nerfing feels like.  The only advice that I can offer is not to bother trying to fight it, because SoE honestly doesn't care what the players think.  Regardless of past suggested nerfs that the players supposedly kept them from implementing through endless whining, you can usually find where SoE got their way in the end anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The mana regen from mage pet canni was sick.  With a knight tank, aggro control in an Exp environment is near-pointless.  and has everyone forgotten that you don't need to damage *every single mob* that gets pulled?<br />
<br />
Burn down first 3 pulls, sit next one out to canni, repeat ad infinitum.  Damage per hour will be much greater than could possibly be intended.  We can't bust out 800DPS with a non-knight tank either, so aggro control doesn't really add to the arguement - it's another situational factor, and one that's very easy to manipulate in your favour.  Defenseless?  They have 5 other people there to protect them.<br />
<br />
Remember pre-PoP, when we were limited to torpor?  Our spells have always had high mana costs, which we offset by canni-torpor.  Did we cry about being defenseless because we were walking around pretty much perma-snared?<br />
<br />
I have access to a RL friend's 65 mage, and have played as him on occasion (mostly to try out pet canni for myself) - it was simple to pet canni in a group without danger to myself.  If you get trained by 20 giants in BoT, you're dead, pet or no pet.  Jabober may delay it by 0.23 seconds.  Whoop-de-doo.  (no, I'm not arrogant enough to think I got the most out of the mage straigt away, but I'm oh so very good at repeating monotonous actions to increase my mana.  Most of us here are ;))<br />
<br />
That said, I hate to see any class nerfed, and several more AAs should be refunded, as they were used pretty much solely for pet canni (Elemental pact anyone?)<br />
<br />
One thing I know very little about is comparison between INT caster classes.  With Mages complaining about how gimped they are compared to Wizards, could someone explain why?<br />
<br />
Assuming a 6k mana pool and equal foci (will ignore them completely for comparative purposes), a Wizard could cast SoS 9 times (5760 mana) for 24660 damage.  A Mage could cast Sun Vortex 15 times (5925 mana) for 23250 damage. *All the while having a pet beating on the mob*<br />
<br />
While mana regen will favour the Wizard *familiar, epic), nuke damage is pretty much equal.  It could be argued that wizards need the extra mana regen to compensate for lack of pet.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Mages are still more than welcome in any of my groups.  You don't need Pet Canni as much as you probably *think* you need it.  Same happened with us and the Affliction focus nerf - many of us paid a lot of PP for items that became junk overnight (Hi ceramic skull).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">It got on the radar screen because, if you read between the lines, it would become extremely overpowered in the next expansion. Since the majority of mages did not have IRE, the formula that was used to calculate the mana returned was based on the HP of the pet. The more HP, the more mana you get back when it is reclaimed.<br />
<br />
SOE's options were twofold:<br />
<br />
1) Increase the mana cost of the pet, so the return is minimized if the pet is reclaimed<br />
<br />
2) Change the Reclaim Energy formula to work solely off of the mana cost of a pet.<br />

I think the fact that the only AA that was refunded was IRE shows that SoE doesn't have a clue how anything actually works.</div></div><hr />

The worst thing about this game is player an developer intervention on issues like this. Someone discovers another part of their own character and someone cries like a kid. Then when that first person finally discovers something cool about their own character that for 10 minutes might make them happy... well they got me nerfed so NErf them!<br />
<br />
They should just leave stuff alone.<br />
<br />
This is why EQ will fade away. CHESS is great game. Been around 1000s of years and guess what the rules are freeking set. Imagine if someone said... Oh rooks are too powerful.. they can move ALL the way across the board and more than that.. they can do it instantly!!!! They don't have to wait 15 minutes slowly pushing their character across the board!Thats just wrong.. look at pawns! They take multiple turns to get across the board, rooks should too.<br />
<br />
How about any of the thousands of cool strategies people have come up with...<br />
<br />
Mobs in EQ are over powered.. You see, they can Summon instantly stun anyone, and have usually 10X to 10000X the Hps of players, and worst of all, they have the developers on their side.</div></div><hr />

1) mages have the best pets <br />
2) they have the 2nd best nukes <br />
<br />
and while they didnt have the best utility they did have some. mod rods and coth. Having that kind of mana regen was just crazy. Yes they did have to have an active roll in it but so do we and our spells all have an adjusted mana costs to ofset this. Im not saying what Soe was right but more expected. Mages are just another class in the long line of constant balancing issues.</div></div><hr />

Because mages just can't pet canni whenever they want. If their pet is on a mob's hate list, they cannot be suspended which means no pet canni. You don't reclaim your main pet - the one you fully equipped and buffed. You reclaim a fresh pet while the real one is safely stored away. 1 cycle of Pet Canni took 8 secs btw for a return of between 120 - 200+ mana (depending).<br />
<br />
Don't fall into the trap of feeling sorry for mages who complain about switching to conjuration spec from evocation.  With or without pet canni, they would have done this anyway.  Why?  Because, starting at level 57, all their single target nukes are CONJURATION specialization.<br />
Many many mages are specialized evocation. Without Pet Canni, the argument for which specialization to be becomes VERY valid again. About half of mages' nukes are evocation including our 59, 61, 62, and 64 nukes. Add to that ALL our rains and PBAoEs, and maybe you'll understand why the specialization of a mage is not so clear cut.<br />
<br />
I used to have to chain cast canni too and that used to use up a lot of my time. Now though with FT13, MC3, VoQ (18), Nine (8), SD (9) my passive mana regen is 51/tic in raid situtations.<br />
Just as with the monks, this nerf will affect those mages who aren't &quot;uber&quot; the most. Those of us with access to FT items and higher level spells are less impacted.<br />
<br />
One thing I know very little about is comparison between INT caster classes. With Mages complaining about how gimped they are compared to Wizards, could someone explain why?<br />
When considering nukes, wizards regularly do about 33% more damage - 66% on a crit. Wizards also can crit a lot more often. Wizards have aggro management tools (concussion) so they can actually use all their mana on one fight. Wizards have evac/translocate spells for utility. All of this makes a wizard a lot more powerful than a mage IN A GROUP. Other than a few rare spots for quadding, I don't hear of mobs wizards can solo that mage's can't.</div></div><hr />
