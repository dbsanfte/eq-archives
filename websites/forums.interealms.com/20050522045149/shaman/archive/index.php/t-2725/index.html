<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OKay.. lead me to the slaughter:) My magelo is in my sigfile..so those who feel the need or desire.. take a gander and give me some ideas on what I should upgrade on he budget of around 2k.. give or take a thousand  if I can borrow it..or things I can quest for at 51 or camp solo or guild?<br />
<br />
Danks my friends!<br />
<br />
yer the grooviest:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ivory collar from chardok to replace the neck, should be less than 1K.  Or, get a group and go to Chardok and camp it, it's not terribly rare and the exp is good.<br />
<br />
Um, buy a spear? Slime coated harpoon would cost around 500 plat and you would look muy macho.<br />
<br />
Long term goal - coldain gloves, great hitpoint item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG, get rid of the book! Hehe, if you REALLY have a strong disdain for getting your hands dirty in combat (read, weild a weapon) then get yourself a Paw of Oppalla (2k). You get a nice boost in AC and a net increase of +3 wis and some mana.  My recomendation would be a Spine Chill Spear, same wis, some stats and you can actually add some damage.   Boots, easy upgrade here, get the black fur boots (part of your epic quest) They are absolutely sweet with wis, stats and a neato click effect.<br />
My strongest recomendation would be to get an Iksar BP ( one group of 50s can easily do this).  Regen = Hp = Mana.  That would be the best bang for you buck.<br />
<br />
So here is my list:<br />
 <br />
   BP               Iksar ( get it with a group of friends in Trak Teeth)<br />
   Boots          Black Fur, (get them with a group of friends in MM)<br />
   Neck            Imbued Ivory  1k<br />
   Primary        Spine Chill Spear  400p<br />
<br />
<br />
These are some very cost effective upgrades, that will significantly increase your effectiveness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Totemic helm and paw of opolla would be nice.  Totemic helm has ok AC (not as good as jb I know) + 5 wis.  <br />
<br />
Paw of opolla has nice wis and ac for primary slot.  Might also wanna get a spear like a slimey that you can put in range but switch for primary in case ya wanna melee here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also replace your Rings with 6ac 65hp Rings or 1 6ac 65hp Ring and 1 Shaded Bandit Ring (lore right? )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, if you're into long camps, gather up a group of people and camp bank area in kael, assuming you're on dwarf faction.  If you spend enough time, you might get a couple armor drops.  I got silk sleeves soloing there once for like an hour.  The ones who can potentially drop armor are the ones in the blue suits as opposed to red-suit giants who won't drop armour (but can still drop helms).<br />
<br />
Giants drop helms too, and if getting your cov faction up is not a big deal atm, you can try selling those.  On my server, they go for around 100pp a pop.  Make sure you can allow for a lot of extra weight though or have a few weight reducing bags handy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, but they're not your most important stat. <br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations (admittedly a bit for the future, since they're a bit too pricey.. . of course this might just act as support for a recommendation not to spend plat on minor gear upgrades right now.)  :) <br />
<br />
1. Get an iksar regen BP. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. Alternatively (if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too. <br />
<br />
3. If you spend a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
4. Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
A few other recommendations that won't break the bank: <br />
<br />
Ditch the fingerbone necklace and get a Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP, you might even break even on this one), and it will make every spell you cast under level 44 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing! <br />
<br />
Ditch the plat ruby veil and get an Arctic Wyvern Mask - you should make a few plat on this deal. You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask. <br />
<br />
Wrist: Sell the RMB and replace it with a Chipped Bone Bracelet (CBB) (with the CBB you get &quot;Affliction Efficiency II&quot; - which will cause all DoTs under level 45 to cost 25% less mana to cast. You should make some plat on this deal.)<br />
<br />
Feet:  JB boots are a nice and very cheap upgrade.  After selling the totemic, JB should only set you back another couple hundred.<br />
<br />
Rings:  Sell your +6 WIS rings and buy some 6/65 rings.  Should set you back a few hundred pp total if you get good prices.<br />
<br />
Primary:  Ditch the spirit tome.  Put either a similar-mana weapon there (slime harpoon, jade prod, spine chill, etc.) or a Paw of Opolla (9 ac, +9 wis)<br />
<br />
Hopefully the sum of all of those deals won't set you back much.<br />
<br />
Your gear goal is to get your AC to 900.  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get rid or that Mithril arm piece. Get a SSA from KC. Free and nice stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, I DO have a spear.. Mortificator...procs Stun, crappy stats but stuns + slam are always good, since my melee skils are so far down and never go up... I HAD a Jade Prod, but I kinda accidently sold it to a vendor when cashing in FS weapons.. oops..<br />
<br />
I have tried 5 times alone and with guild to get Iksar BP..but can never find Crusader up:( I want one badly.. but the prices on Veeshan are a bit out of range. <br />
<br />
I still have a CBB in the bank, but since I only use EBolt, it didn't seem work it for the less AC and the focus effect?<br />
<br />
And sheesh..I finally took Glori's advice and ditched the Testament for the SBS.. it's an improvement:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bigguss: Some good ideas there, thanks..I'll look to sell the rings soon, but I am worried about wis dropping below 150 with too much AC upgrades? When is the point I need to stop? Is 150 the lowest I need to let WIS go?<br />
<br />
It's at 174 right now presently... so I I have a lil room to move. I would think at 150 or so..less mana pool..but less mana pool to canni back as well, right? More mana for the hp?<br />
<br />
And what is an SSA from karnors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Supple scale armband, no drop from the Drolvarg warlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okay, thank you, Glori:)<br />
<br />
Checking allakhazam's for info now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oooo...extended range 3? Nice... how rare a drop is it? Anyone know? I never did DW camp in there...I guess I am goin back to KC over vacation:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's his common drop.  His rare is the harmonic dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it rots ALOT. you can try auctioning to pay a few hundred pp for it to loot rights and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldn't worry about dropping below 150 WIS.  At level 51, I typically run around with 130 or so, and don't have any problems. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, good to know, Bigguss:) I been sweating for a while around the 40s, trying to hit 200 WIS..til I found this place and starting reading and understanding the AC/HP philosophy. Of course my first days back in DL before they fixed the Slow spells, I got beat so bad I kinda starting thinking that AC would be a very good thing:)<br />
<br />
And now I got Canni2 (not a word, I like it better than Canni1 and am proud of myself for finally gettin it hehe) I can canni back a smaller mana bar to full faster than a large mana bar... So long as I always got enough to solo an IG or 2 before needing to med or canni..I am happy.<br />
<br />
I'll check this weeknd in KC for the SSA...should be able to get one since its mostly always the some folks in there and I am sure they all got one by now. I got all my jarsath from running around there and grabbing it while always in a group across the castle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">45 here, sitting at 139 wis...WITH bearform.  I have 0 problems with mana if I watch myself and micromanage a bit.  As far as upgrades go for you, the one that stuck out the most for me was the veil.  I'd replace that with Crystal Spider Eyes, or an Enshrouded Veil...700-1k for either of those.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, ya look good : )  Equip that spear, though...hehe.<br />
