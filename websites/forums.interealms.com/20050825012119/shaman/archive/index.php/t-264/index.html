<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please help me out with these I am sure I't been said before but i can't seem to find it.<br />
<br />
1.  What is the rule on spell level Vs. Player level...I am re organizing my spell book and I wanted to set up a &quot;twinkie&quot; buff page like many others have but i was not sure on the MAX spell level that can go on these pages.  And what level to players have to be for my better spells to stick?<br />
<br />
2.  In looking at spell information it may say Spell X has a resist check of Magic +25 and another spell may say Cold +5 or magic +10 ect ect ect...what does the +25, +5 ect mean?  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I rarely buff lower level people, but I think I remember how it works..<br />
<br />
I believe starting with level 50 the player either has to be 40 or 41?<br />
<br />
Then it scales up to 45..i.e. a level 51 buff can be cast on 41, 52 on a 42, etc, until 45, when level 60 spells can be cast on em.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that's exactly right or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My buff pages are the following:<br />
<br />
Str<br />
Dex<br />
Cha<br />
Agi<br />
Sta<br />
<br />
Chloro<br />
Alacrity<br />
Ultravision<br />
Tuna<br />
Guardian<br />
<br />
I've had no problems hitting a level 1 with any of those buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Short answer, any buffs under level 50 can be cast on any character.  I think any buffs over level 50 have to be cast on level 45 plus.  Not sure about the 41-45 range Morbad mentioned.  I haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
This does lead to some fubar'd results.  For instance:<br />
<br />
Chanters can cast celerity at 39--ie on anyone.   Shaman cannot cast celerity on anyone under 45 because it's a lvl 56 spell for us.<br />
<br />
Componentless levitate and enduring breath can only be cast on characters 45 and up because they are spells over level 50--if you want to help a newbie, you still have to carry components and dig out the old spells.<br />
<br />
However, compare these with group buffs.  I can group with 5 level 1 characters, and cast group focus . . . on myself.  It hits all of them.  Now that group spells carry the same stats as single target spells, you can still get a few high level spells on low level people if you want.<br />
<br />
Thanks VI :p<br />
