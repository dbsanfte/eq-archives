<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Since &quot;W T F&quot; is an integral part of this story, and this board filters out W T F [***], just know that I put spaces in it.)<br />
<br />
Thought I'd share a humorous story (I thought it was kinda funny, anyway).<br />
<br />
When they announced that they were putting in the ability to edit your own surname by just typing /surname [name], I thought to myself, &quot;Cool, I can change my monk's surname 'cause I really don't like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I gave it some good thought for a week trying to come up with a cool surname to put on my monk, who's name is Xosa.  I finally came up with &quot;Li.&quot;  I don't really know why I liked it, it just looked and felt right.  So I had it all settled in my head that when they put in the new patch, I'd change my monk's surname to &quot;Li.&quot;<br />
<br />
They put in the patch and I log in my monk to do the deed.  I typed:<br />
<br />
&quot;/surname Li&quot;<br />
<br />
and it comes back and tells me &quot;sorry your surname has been rejected.  Please choose another.&quot;<br />
<br />
W T F was the first thought that crossed my mind.  I was heart-broken.  I really wanted that name and I just couldn't for the life of me figure out why &quot;Li&quot; would be rejected... I mean it didn't make a phrase... it wasn't vulgar or demeaning...  the first thought that crossed my mind was literally &quot;W T F&quot; because I was baffled.<br />
<br />
So I'm sitting there disapointed, thinking  W T F to myself, trying to come up with another name.  Just to be stupid I typed:<br />
<br />
&quot;/surname W T F&quot; just knowing that it would be rejected by the filter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your surname has been accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
W T F!!!!  So let me get this straight --- it won't let me put my surname as &quot;Li&quot;, but it will let me put &quot;W T F&quot; as my surname?!?!?!  As it turns out I just so happened to change my surname while in a hard LDoN with some guildees, and they saw my new surname immediately and died laughing at it.<br />
<br />
The BAD part was: I didn't know that you had to wait 7 days to change your name again!  So I had to walk around Xegony for a week with my surname as &quot;W t f&quot; until I could change it again.  A lot of folks commented on it and even told me I should keep the surname, but in the end I knew someone would probably /petition me.  'Sides, I really didn't like the surname, although it was kinda humorous.  7 days later I changed it, but the guild still refers to my monk as &quot;Mr. W T F&quot; every time he logs on.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, that's pretty funny.  Initially I was thinking that it might be a minimum length thing, but then it occurred to me that I know somone with a single letter surname.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I think your caps lock might be stuck or something, Outkast. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya, I thought the same thing about the minimum length too, but I just know I've seen folks around the server with the surname &quot;X&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">alot of people on my server are running around with wierd surnames...<br />
<br />
I spotted someone called Soandso &#1649;&#1649;&#1649;&#1649;&#1649; (firstname I cant remember, surname was those squares when using an unrecognised symbol, like '£' isnt recognised in EQ)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would it tell you it was rejected if someone else already had it?  Thats the only thing that would make any sense to me.  In that case you could just petition for it though it may take a few days or weeks to get hold of a GM since guides can't give surnames for some odd reason.</div></div><hr />

That restriction only applies to the first names, not surnames.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and you can get characters that you can't normally type to show up but editing your config files for your characters. If you scroll down far enough you will see where all the lines in your hotbuttons are and yo ucan just go ahead and edit them as you like since it is a basic text file.</div></div><hr />
