<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've not been able to find much information concerning LDoN raids besides the 54 person limit.  I've not done one myself, and from what I can gather the &quot;goal&quot; of the raid is somewhat obscure.<br />
<br />
LDoN adventures are clear cut.   Collect, Slaughter, Rescue, Assassignation.  What are the goals of the raids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's actually a 36 person limit. Never did one myself but someone posted here a couple weeks ago some information on them. You might be able to find it with a search I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Short version, they suck.<br />
<br />
Long version, they suck really really badly.<br />
<br />
There are several previous threads you should be able to find by searching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They are obscure. They are hard. The loot isnt worth the risk or the time involved.  If you can handle LDoN Raids you can handle the raiding of mobs that drop better stuff and more of it.<br />
<br />
In summary.  Dont waste your time and just act like they dont exist :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That about sums them up. Completely worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So, tell me how you really feel.  :)<br />
<br />
Found some older threads on it that say pretty much the same thing.  Won't waste my time thinking about them any more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They are obscure. <br />
<br />
Indeed  :D  . The biggest problem : we don't know what we are supposed to do. It's really navrous ,i would know what prathum think about that point...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let's describe it this way.  We are a guild that clears time in under 6 h with 50.  We got our behind handed to us on a silver plattern when we tried a MM LDoN raid last month on an &quot;off&quot; day. Just not worth the effort for 4 pieces of loot, of which usually only the augments are worth anything.<br />
But try it, if you survive the first pull you might have a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN's don't deserve the bad rep they get - a lot of people even actually like them, as they are generally well designed and more interesting/challenging than a lot of events.  They are hard, but that's not always a bad thing; it makes them interesting and a good preparation for things to come.  Doing LDoN raids help make guilds better.  The loot could definately use work, but with aug removal and the quality of some of the LDoN raid augs, it's worthwhile even if not as good a return on the time spent as it could be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But try it, if you survive the first pull you might have a shot.<br />
<br />
Yeah first pull is always jacked up.  Then again the first time we zoned in there were 3 unslowable mobs that mopped up about 3/4 of our raid before we got a foot hold.</div></div><hr />
