<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have been in the spot where he's supposed to spawn for the past 4 damn days (wide open room with 3 tents, and 2 goblin spawns on both the left and right sides.. ya know.. the room after that railroad track looking dealio).  And nothing.. nada.. zilch.. zippo.. no Overeer.  <br />
<br />
Also, Ive noticed there are no rockchanters in Nurga.. and the ones in Droga aren't dropping the stones I'm after.. but the same crap that every other goblin drops.. like some alcoholic beverage.. some crappy insignia.. the occasional gem.. I even quit to go get some exp last night only 3 more blue til 57 yay.  Heh.. fighting green cons for 4 days straight just wear thin after a while... <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the Overseer's spawn point has been moved or if there any other rockchanters in existance that drop that Slate Chant Rock.  I've only managed to forage that shroom so far for quest items that are needed from there.. so I'm getting a bit impatient.<br />
<br />
<br />
The GM I spoke to last night told me to /bug it.. not sure how good that will do.. /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4 days is WAY to long.  This guy is a pretty regular spawn and it sounds like you have the right room.  When I killed him for my own quest it took about 2 hours and the few times I have been back there it never took more than 3 hours to get him.  I did kill the gobs in both adjacent rooms too out of boredom tho.<br />
<br />
 Are the rockchanters still droping the blue rock or just not dropping rocks at all?  That part sounds like it could be bad luck, but it would not surprise me if VI is getting ready to throw in the Droga/Nurga changes that went live on test awhile back and goofed up some of the spawns.<br />
<br />
For now, I would just /bug the hell out of it and pray this is not some intentional change to make the quest longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Rockchanters aren't even spawning in Nurga.. and the ones in Droga are just dropping the same crap all the other mobs are dropping =/ like that lil Mistmoore shield looking insignia thing, goblin brew, the occasional gems or fine steel.. they aren't dropping rocks at all bleargh.<br />
<br />
What changes did they make to Nurga on test btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm at the same part. Did about 5 spawn cycles last night, 12 min repop I think? No overseer. <br />
/sigh I remember running by that dude once when we were headed to the sleeping ogre...wish  I knew what he was for then..lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hissanhi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got some bad news guys.... they messed up the spawn tables in here.  After a recent patch some new mobs were popping WAY too often in Nurga (Traitors and Angry Goblins to be exact) and they did an emergency change to the zone.<br />
<br />
When I got back in, the tables appeard to be reset to the same old goblins, BUT the special pops sem to be gone.<br />
<br />
Including sadly the Slave spawns, guess I have to find another place for Iksar Blood.  I'm not surprised the overseer got messed up too.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will fix the hopper cave in Dawnshroud when/if they get this guy back in.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Damn you Verant! Damn you!  On another note.. wonder how rare that Sarnak Partisan is.. is he near that building with Sarnak knights and bezerkers in FM? =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar blood never dropped for me on Fennin from the slaves anyhow.  I wish it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I camped Nurga for about 12 hours yesterday and today and no Overseer, GM also told me to /bug it. I saw every other kind of goblin in there though, including the stone chanters. No one dropped any sort of rock though.<br />
<br />
BTW the ore, brew, and salts are used in smithing now, help you get to 170s now that they screwed up banded and FS.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stonechanters are not Rockchanters.. don't be confused by the closeless of the names :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No rockchanters in Nurga and No Overseer. :( How many times have I destroyed all those drops and now when I need it they break the zone. <br />
And Iksar Blood does drop from the Iksar Slaves which no longer spawn in Nurga :(<br />
Why haven't they fixed this? Don't we make enough noise ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess we don't make enough :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">camped this guy on and off all freekin week and weekend...no overseer. Didnt do a ton of exploring, but didnt see any rockchanters either. In my earlier post I  said I had seen one...was mistaken, was a stonechanter.<br />
<br />
Bleh!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is going to take quite a bit of whining to get a fix for this and is worth your time to e-mail a bug report detailing the problem to VI.  There are addresses at the official EQ site I believe and if you are not already shooting out /bug and /feedback reports EVERY DAY then start.<br />
<br />
Since this is not a bug that works to the advantage of the players and since a very small section of the population is actually working on this quest, a fix will not be forthcoming unless we spam the hell outta VI.  <br />
<br />
Get busy dammit and mebe we will see a fix in the next patch!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yepper.. been /buggin everyday that I've been in game :)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately my work blocks the main everquest site.. so if anyone can post the eMail addy that I can send problems to as well... that'd be peachy keen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The GM (guide) I spoke to last night told me that she was aware of a problem with rockchanters not spawning in Droga where they used to....but otherwise had heard of no problems what soever with Nurga. Said she would pass on my concerns to the other GM's however.<br />
<br />
Help me clarify exactly what the problem is with Nurga since I am not that familiar with the zone ( lol although im getting there now)<br />
<br />
What isnt spawning: Overseer, Rockchanters, and Iksar Slaves.<br />
<br />
Are there any other named in this dungeon that dont spawn? I know the sleeping ogre still spawns, see it everyday I am in there. <br />
<br />
I also park a 54 druid in there...nothing on track either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bah Droga had plenty of Rockchanters when I went in there.. they didn't drop anything worth while to though... absolutely 0 rockchanters spawned in nurga..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I explored all of Nurga a week or two ago, and every spider, burynai, and slave spawn was missing, with regular goblins in their place.  So no surprise that the Overseer is missing too.  The only other mob I saw in Nurga besides goblins was the sleeping ogre.<br />
<br />
At least mushrooms still forage.</div></div><hr />
