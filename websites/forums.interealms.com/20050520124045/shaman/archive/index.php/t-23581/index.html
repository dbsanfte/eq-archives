<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few changes to the epic foci/spells<br />
<br />
The focus effect has been reduced from 10% to 6% (Reverance of the Heyokah  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=6289&amp;source=Test) )<br />
<br />
The clicky effect has been upgraded to 500hp/tick (Prophet's Gift of the Ruchu  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=6273&amp;source=Test) )<br />
<br />
In addition, another focus effect has had a name change suggesting that it too might be an effect on the epic (Prophet's Channeling  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=6403&amp;source=Test) ). Basically it gives you a 40% improvement on your chance to resist a spell (for example, if your chance to resist a particular spell was 50%, a 40% improvement of that chance is 50 x 1.4 = 70% chance to resist). 24 sec min duration would imply that it works only on DoTs and other detrimental over time spells though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you also notice that there has been a new Timer:  section added for alot of spells today?  The timers were called Unknown155 and they are now Timer values between 1-6.  <br />
<br />
Any idea what they could mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Timer groups are used in discs. Basically it uses a reuse timer to lock out a specific family, but other families can be cast immediately. So, if defensive was in group 1 (I dont recall off hand which it is in), the reuse timer is 10 minutes, in other words you cant use any other discs in group 1 until the timer is reset. You can use the discs in group 2, 3 or 4 though, provided you have endurance. I expect that they are moving spells over to the same system. For example, if you have a spell with a recast time of 30 seconds in group 5, any other spell in group 5 will be locked out until the recast timer is up. You could still cast spells on other timers though. Most spells have a recast time of 2.5 seconds, so it wont affect us too much.<br />
<br />
I imagine the reason for doing that is to allow them more flexibility in making diverse spell sets with powerfull effects that might otherwise be unbalancing if they could be chain cast.<br />
<br />
One implication if they are actually doing that, is that if you cast a spell from one timer group, you might be immediately able to cast a spell from another timer group without waiting for the recast timer to reset. That could be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, sounds scary to me.  But hopefully it will be for the better and not the worse.  :)<br />
<br />
So far of the Shaman spells listed on Lucy these have had timers added to them:<br />
<br />
Timer 1 <br />
Ancient Ancestral Calling<br />
Pained Memory<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
Cannibalize 4<br />
Cannibalize 3<br />
Cannibalize 2<br />
Cannibalize<br />
Healing  :confused: <br />
<br />
Timer 2 <br />
Vindictive Spirit<br />
Greater Healing  :confused: <br />
<br />
Timer 3 <br />
Champion<br />
Ferine Avatar<br />
<br />
Timer 4 <br />
Blood of Yoppa<br />
Yoppa's Rain of Venom<br />
Tears of Saryrn<br />
Spirit of Cheetah  :confused:  (I guess they don't want us AE'ing and running?  :p )<br />
<br />
I think that is all of them.  I may have missed some though.  So far Cannibalize is the only one that truly worries me.  I wouldn't see myself having room to have more than 1 AE memmed at once, but I guess that is just to make sure we aren't doing too much DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They talked about putting all cannibalize spells on timers so that we couldn't cast Pained Memory, Ancient canni, and canni4  to get supermana.</div></div><hr />

Bingo. They are done nerfing Slow, Cannibalize is next.<br />
<br />
The recast timers are probably used for all the future clickables(epics etc.) as well.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt call this a nerf, they just dont want us to have 2 canni spells memmed and use them back-to-back-to-back. Its a reasonable idea. Not like I have enough spell slots for TWO Cannis, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only way they said they would give us a significant individual upgrade to Canni would be to make it so that you couldn't chain all the canni's together.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope they change the Extended Duration focus, both right now are limited to minimum duration of 48 seconds.  Which means we can't use them on our HoTs or our MR DoT's.  Which makes them basically worthless to me, meaning I'll be stuck using my old Time gear still, even at the lower focus ability its better than no extension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can understand them putting the Cannibalize spells above Canni IV on the same timer... but Cannibalize-Cannibalize IV?<br />

<br />
They said this was going to happen before GoD came out, but they said the code for it wasn't going to be in before GoD went live, so would probably would have to wait for OoW (part of the reason why the canni in GoD was ancient, they didn't want a large amount of the shaman user base to be able to ancient canni then canni4 while it refreshed as this would be an insane amount of mana regen (ask anyone who got the ancient canni)<br />

Not 100% sure what effects your refering to, but I assume there will be OoW versions of the 24 second minimum buff extension focuses, although the current Spiritual Serenity is pretty much useless compared to Quie and BoT (someone give SoE a clue they missed updating the spell, before it goes live like that)<br />

The 25% versions are also 48 seconds.  There are no 24 second version to be found.   Which means these focuses will not work at all on Blood of Yoppa, Curse of Sisslak, Spiritual Serenity, Blood of Saryrn, Bane, Anathema, Qui, Breath of Trushar, etc.   Making these two focuses basically worthless as the main things we use them for they won't work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm cool with them putting a timer on canni. It's good there finally being pro-active with this kinda stuff as appose to let it go by everyone gets use to it a year later, were screaming bloody nerf. So what is this about the spirit of chetah timer? I think that is funny the spell no one ever uses anymore, unless they plan to finally upgrade it. That would be very cool to have spirit of cheetah upgraded maybe something like scale of wolf.</div></div><hr />

And yet, my wizard twink can chain-nuke, and my cleric guildmate can chain-heal... Paladins and enchanters can chain-stun...<br />

I suck at breaking down what means what with lucy. But this is what I think will happen. You can land VS on a crap load of mobs but lets say 3 for an example.<br />
<br />
So you live the the 18 seconds (3 ticks) that the spell lasts. Then you have 3 mobs beating on you unslowed for 800+ a pop because you know no other slow spell will overwrite the lvl 70 spell. So it has to land after the VS wears off...<br />

Thankfully Vindictive Spirit won't block anything, as it's the only slow in the game to use slot 8:<br />

I hate needing to spam a lvl 58 spell from Velious. This (a bigger canni so that we could do our jobs with less clicking) was something that was asked for back at the beginning of PoP iirc.<br />
<br />
This is progress, embrace it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, not being able to alternate 2 different rains is a straight-up nerf.  Even if they were to remove the hard coded 20% resist rate on rains, we'd still end up loosing a good chunk of dps by only using one at a time.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like the vindictive spirit recourse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=6152&amp;source=Test) is going to overwrite Vie.  I can live with that, VS looks like a great spell so far.  I can imagine it making it's way into my &quot;don't ever un-mem these for any reason&quot; spellset.</div></div><hr />

AEing raid targets such as the cornav encounter and some earth rings i guess maybe....<br />
<br />
edit- this could lead to shaman stackability in raids....we would have to have 2-3 shaman chaining this to keep slow up on the 300 mobs pulled that can't be AEed!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an interesting concept, attaching a damage shield and damage mitigation recourse to a spell (pbaoe snare) that's designed to stop mobs from hitting players completely.<br />
<br />
I've never played a necro or SK before, does a spell need to land to get the recourse benefit from it, or do you get that on a resist also?</div></div><hr />

OK This is looking sucky, but in all honesty, I can live with it. I never mem 2 rain spells now, unless I am greenie farming. One rain, One Nuke when I am in DD mode. <br />
<br />
So heres how I rate it: <br />
New rule = 2 (of 10, it sucks)<br />

IMHO there is nothing wrong with having canny4 memed to click when you have a spare moment (in addition to the new Omens canny)- it will reward a hard working shaman who has to swap out spells more often and is hardly overpowering at about 2% mana pool per click.<br />
<br />
As usual I am boggled at the developers/spell guy (whomever) who either don't have any imagination or their M.O. is to take the extreme position and then back into the more reasonable solution.<br />

I chain rains when the guild is doing AE fights (mud ring in Earth, phase 5 trash in Time) or when I'm doing easy LDONs with a tough guild group (no CC, just pull a ton and knock em down). <br />

I won't be happy at all to lose that ability.<br />

One thing no one has thought of with the new timer change...  its possible that we won't have to wait for the full refresh time when we first mem the spell.  Instead of having to wait 10 mins for SoC to refresh (or whatever time it is), it could be instantly available on mem'ing and the time only kicks in AFTER you cast it.  <br />
<br />
Sounds to me like a great way to improve their spell system if they change all recast delays to work like this.  I'd love to have FA available seconds after memming it, and just have the recast delay after casting.  Same with Bane, Anathemna, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I suspect a lot of spells in the same category (like rains) will likely just have the standard recast delay before being able to use another spell in the same category.  Just because things are grouped together doesn't mean all of them will lock out other spells in the same group for 20 minutes or anything.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if they changed the way many existing spells work in this regard.  But then again, I've been surprised before. ;)  It does give them the potential to do some cool stuff with more powerful spells though, so I'll be interested to see where it goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But wont that still be able to be exploited by unmeming and rememing?<br />
<br />
Or am I not understanding the way it works?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I don't think that unmemming and rememming a spell will reset the group timer...  or at least it shouldn't if they do it right. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Although now that I think about it, they'd still better have individual spell timers, 'cause I sure don't want SoC disabling all sow spells for 15 minutes, or whatever its crazy recast is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It's most likely going to be no different than the recast you see on VP weapons or even Mod Rods.  Even unequipping and then re-equipping a mod rod doesn't allow you to recast it.  They most likely have some kind of hidden check flags for each spell to see when the recast is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Assuming it works like the disc timer groups, unmeming and then rememing a spell wont work. Once a spell from the group has been cast, a timer is started based on that spell's recast time, and everything else in that group is locked out no matter what until the timer is up. Again, that is assuming it works like disc timer groups, but it seems pointless making a change like this unless they were planning to make at least some spells operate this way.<br />
<br />
One other thing, I made a testbuffed cleric on test yesterday and tried out healing/greater healing (which are on separate timers), and the spell gem lockout timer is still in place, so it won't shorten casting times on some combinations as I had hoped (unless they change it later).<br />
<br />
Only a few spells have these timers and some of them are odd choices (the 2 low level heals for example), so these might just be experimental stuff they are trying on the test server.</div></div><hr />

The Can timers are another way to keep us from regaining any effciency in our mana regen while all other classes are upgraded in their mana regen abilities.<br />
While I might understand the timers on the new can spells IF and only IF our can line gained effiecency not keeping the same ratio and just less casts and not being able to cast it any faster.<br />
We simply do not regain mana any faster it is just more convienent.<br />
Every other class actually gets mana back FASTER.<br />
<br />
The timers on our other spells are just another flat out nerf to our class.</div></div><hr />

Canni 5 is sitll something like FT80 when parsed out with the timer. Spiritual Channeling looks to be a decent solution to a &quot;fixed&quot; upgrade to c5. We are still WAY ahead of other classes in mana regen, except necros. <br />
<br />
What I want is more better efficient spells to burn all this mana on. (little GW Bush-ism for you Political fans in there, heh)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but you're wrong here. Canni V is a FT 35.5, that's if we neglected the 1924 damage you take, the inability to time it perfectly even if you wanted, the fact that it's situational(you can't cast this while you run). <br />
On top of all that, sometimes AEs or aggro basically do not permit us to use it(AEs can force you to have to heal up first, before you are safe to use it. A 2k hitter is trying to smack you left and right and it wouldn't be smart to hit yourself for another 2k damage etc).</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling there wouldn't be any complaints about cann if it was ft80 :D</div></div><hr />

Whats your point? its 35 Flowing thought, on top of out 15 Worn, +3 Innate, + VOQ, + SD + Chorus of Marr + CanniSpells... <br />
<br />
We have the potental to Out Manaregen any class in game with the excpetion of Necros... Give me a friggan break. Dont bitch about our mana regen, its already amazing. What we need is spells that are actually worth something to a raid/group and isnt already given to another class... (an MGB'able HoT for example, would be awesome)</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry that you're bad at math, but yes, Pained memory is an increase in mana regeneration speed.<br />
<br />
One cast of canni 4 @ 2.5 seconds + 3 second recast time = 82 mana gained<br />
<br />
82 mana / 5.5 seconds = 14.91 mana per second<br />
<br />
One cast of pained memory @ 2.5 seconds + 18 second recast time = 360 mana gained<br />
<br />
360 mana / 20.5 seconds = 17.56 mana per second<br />
<br />
Now I know you're thinking *** 2.65 mana per second suxxorx sh!t.<br />
<br />
Let me remind you that EQ times things in tics, and that 2.65 mana per second = 15.9 mana per tic.<br />
<br />
Looks like a pretty solid upgrade to me, please stop whining.</div></div><hr />

Sweet!  I somehow missed that :)  Thanks for pointing that out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, before you panic too thoroughly, wizard rains are now linked as are some wizard nukes.  Paladin wave heals and paladin stuns.  Enchanter stuns and enchanter nukes... and those are just the classes I've bothered to check out so far.  You are not alone.</div></div><hr />

Can you read? It's a theoretical 35 FT(remember Thott's super Shaman?) and nowhere close to that 80 FT. That was my whole point.</div></div><hr />
