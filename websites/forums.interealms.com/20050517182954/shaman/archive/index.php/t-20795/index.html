<br />
We have introduced the new graveyard zone, Shadowrest, to the live servers.  The zone will allow adventurers whose corpse has decayed, after 7 days, to retrieve it.  They will merely have to greet the appropriate NPC in one of the following zones to activate their transport to Shadowrest;<br />
<br />
East Commonlands<br />
The Plane of Knowledge<br />
Toxxulia Forest<br />
Qeynos Hills<br />
The Feerrott<br />
Butcherblock Mountains<br />
The Field of Bone<br />
Shadeweavers Thicket<br />
Misty Thicket<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy this new addition to EverQuest!<br />
<br />

There are probably many people out there who have their corpses rot due to genuine accidents or technical difficulties.<br />
<br />
Plus, as stated before, GMs are probably feeling a huge weight lifted off their shoulders, which makes them free to ignore even more of our petitions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right.  Games should involve lots of pain, misery, and suffering.  Why would anyone ever want to have FUN?!  Everyone should pay to waste their time spending hours and hours retrieving corpses - especially if they die to lag, servers crashes, or the stupidity of other players.  Not to mention that now people will probably never do CR or get rezzes - they'll just use this feature &lt;rolls his eyes&gt;.<br />
<br />
Is this 7 game days or 7 real days?  If it's 7 real days I don't see how this makes the game easier - what're you gonna do if you choose to wait 7 days for your corpse?  Play an alt?  Not play?<br />
<br />
Seems to me this is more of a last resort measure for CR and could alleviate work for GMs - instead of helping people with messed up corpses they'll just tell you to wait for it to pop in this zone.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
Most people won't wait 7 RL days for their corpse to rot and will /gasp get a necro or SK to summon their sorry asses to the zone-in where a GY doesn't exist.  That seems so much more challenging ... not.  CR is only challenging if you're doing it on the spot either trying to beat a GY pop or other timeline.  I can't see this dumbing down the game at all, it simply reduces the CSR load on the SoE end and gives options to people who can't connect to the game due to various technical problems (problems that are more and more frequent).</div></div><hr />

Ok thats 2 replies you have made that to me show you either have not read what this zone actually is or you are a complete numbnuts.<br />
How the hell does having a zone where your corpse goes after 7 days instead of totally rotting make it any easier ?.<br />
Ah yes people are going to exploit this i see it now.(sarcasm)<br />
This is actually a service that is going to help some people (As well as cutdown on CS which is probably the real reason it was introduced).<br />
A long time ago my baby shaman was running around in EF and my pc decided to go on the fritz so i went LD.<br />
Basically needed a new HD but at the time i didnt have the 300 odd pounds it was going to cost to replace it.<br />
Anyway next pay day circa 2 weeks later i brought new HD etc logged back in and found myself naked back at bind point.<br />
Contacted a GM (yes he actually answered me within about 2 hrs of logging on but at that  time GMs were plentifull.<br />
Result was that my corpse had rotted and he could do nothing at the time apart from speaking with someone higher up the VI food chain.<br />
Never heard anything else from them but id already started another Shaman off so didnt bother.<br />
The moral of this story is please **** in saying this is &quot;dumbing down&quot; etc as it is purely a help in situations like this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just curious, how many people do you know lets their corpse go 7 days without looting? I’m not trying to be cynical or sarcastic, I’m just wondering. I can understand that things come up in real life and maybe some emergency has kept you away from the game, but how many people do you think this will benefit?<br />
<br />
I’m not objecting to what was done because this is one less area they have to address from Customer Service stand point, but how many times have you left a corpse for more than a few days?</div></div><hr />

<br />
just meant that there is no sence of challenge or worry left in this game. with a click stick you get almost all of your exp back in 10 seconds. or get a necro/sk to summon you're body out of a tight spot.<br />
<br />
I could go on about the pok books but thats way off topic.<br />
<br />
I dunno, im just an old school eq player. part of the fun for me was trying something new and knowing if I messed up it would be a challenge to get my body back. it just made the whole experience for me more fun.<br />
<br />
I just always thought that a game you cant lose in isnt really fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So it's not retroactive? I can't go in and get my Druid's dead, decaying corpse that I lost to a wall glitch in Wakening Lands (Wuoshi + Level 40 druid + Rallos Zek (no clerics / necros want to help) = bad)<br />
<br />
Or... Can I? That would be just too sweet, I could start playing a class that looks dumb but works, rather than a class that looks good but doesn't!</div></div><hr />

Dying while trying to reach an Ikkinz trail entry would be somewhat of an issue with no summon.   :cool:</div></div><hr />

He then logged on his main and went and killed the giant that killed his alt. Then he had a RL emergency come up and could not get back to the computer for a month. his twinked alt had about 200k woth of stuff on him and it all rotted. If there had been something like the GY zone then, he wouldn't have had the headache of re equiping his SK. He earned the plat with tradeskills..so it was hard earned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You still don't understand this zone, even after your explanation. This isn't a feature, where if after dying deep in CharokB you can log out and get your corpse in the morning with no worries. The only time this feature will kick in, is when your corpse has rotted after 7 FULL REALTIME days. No one will play naked, forgoing a rez, just to avoid a cr. <br />
<br />
Its a good idea, I have a good buddy just few nights ago who was in a panic, he went ld on an adventure during that log in down fiasco and was leaving for his wedding and honeymoon in the morning. He gave me his info to get his stuff or it would have been gone forever. Ya gonna damn him and call it dumbing down the game because his wedding is more important than sitting there for a full day hitting the log in server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">you could always just stand naked in game for 24 hours straight... pretty sure that still causes rot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's 7 days, on or off now. Reading patch messages is a good thing, it's been changed for a LONG time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do no-rent items stay on your corpse when it pops to Shadowrest after 7 days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This is an excellent idea. Anyone who opposes it is mentally retarded. There are many circumstances which prevent you from getting your corpse in 7 days and even after harassing GMs for a long time the best they can do is put you into a character save that most likely will not have much of your gear. How would you like to loose your corpse because SOE made a billing error and banned you or your computer broke down and you can't get it fixed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a pile of corpses on the Stromm server. Either they hailed the NPC and left their corpses or you do not need to hail the NPC for your corpse to be summoned there. So much for getting rid of lag, and despite the rumors it is not instanced.<br />
<br />
The ring of corpse callers is cool, but the Keeper of Lost Things made me snicker.</div></div><hr />
