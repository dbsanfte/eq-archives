<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This one should be rather simple. How much (if any) improvements to their nukes do you feel shaman need? I am just going to list examples for the ice line, the poison line should of course be adjusted accordingly (as well as similar upgrades to our OoW nukes).<br />
<br />
For comparison: The current Velium Strike does 925 damage in 7.8 seconds for 300 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, we're not meant to be powerhouse nukers.  We do, however, need to be able to land something useful.  I'd keep everything the same and shave off 2.5 seconds on cast time.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">None of the above. I want 1K in 4-5 seconds, similar cast time to Spear of Torment, but more damage, even if it has a 4 second recast time. All I want is 1 per fight after malos, slow, and maybe a heal. In situations where a nuke would be better than a DOT, it HAS to be under 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Note how I said that the poison nukes would have to be adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
1200 in 7 works out to a 850 poison nuke (in 4.2 secs)<br />
1400 in 6.5 works out to a 1000 poison nuke (in 4.0 secs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm fine with how much I nuke for really, even though it's not much, but I do want to be able to land the nuke before the mob dies.  So just make them cast faster, even if they add a bit longer of a recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did not respond to this poll. 7.0 seconds and 6.5 seconds are way too slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agree, it's not so much the damage as it is the casting time. I don't want big nukes. I just want to be able to get them off in a reasonable time.<br />
<br />
I don't want a long recast though. If we had a nuke for, let's say, 1100 dmg and a 5 sec cast with a 2 sec recast, I don't see that anywhere close to being over powered.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Note the recast times, Thunder (though with cast times and spell gem refresh times, they can be chained).  We don't really have the spell gems for 2 nukes.  We need 1 that can be chained--but it needs to be a decent amount of damage and fast casting.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't want improved nukes, give me a dot that works right.  Damage done in shorter time without the insane aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* 100% more damage per tick<br />
* 40% fewer ticks<br />
* lower agro on poison dots<br />
* -30 resist adj to magic, -50 poison, -100 disease</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like fasting casting, big damage DoT's that over the coruce ofr 30ish seconds will equal to a nice nuke.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, we never were nukers and it just doesnt feel right to ask for them or expect them. Retuning DoT's is the shaman way of damage output balance IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I could care less about a big cold nuke, I havent memmed VS since I can remember. SoT is so much more efficient in everything I do. I got sick and tired of casting VS only to have to interupt it because the mob was dead. Dont need another.<br />
<br />
1K 4.5 second poison nuke. Hardly overpowering, hardly gamebreaking, but will make me feel a TINY bit useful during that last 5 seconds of a battle.</div></div><hr />

/agree.<br />
<br />
Give us a 1k 4'ish second cast time poison nuke.  We don't need the big numbers.  I'll take a fast casting (normal 2.5 recast delay, no more of that 24 second crap we have to endure with Bane/Anathema) nuke for lesser damage over a long cast time big nuke.  We need fast damage alternatives, not more spells that tie us up for 10 seconds before we can recast. An upgrade to Spear of Torment would be perfect at 1k damage 340mana 4 second cast time.  Less efficient than Velium Strike but enough mana that we won't be using it indiscriminately without consequences.  That's a usable upgrade that isn't unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In my opinion, Sham does not need Big nuke.<br />
Instead of nuke, our DoT should be strong enough and we should have some method to escape or reduce DoT taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I voted &quot;Shaman Nukes are Fine, I'd rather get better heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't believe our nukes are fine, but I believe we need to pick one thing we want to be our role, and ask for that.<br />
<br />
Or, we can ask for them to figure out our role, and work on it.<br />
<br />
What we can't do is ask for better nukes AND better heals, in my opinion.  If we DID get both, they'd be watered down upgrades, compared to if we were more specialized in one of the areas.<br />
<br />
We are a priest class, as opposed to an INT class, so I personally believe our emphasis should be on healing.<br />
<br />
I think that the newfound focus on the inefficiency of our DD's is simply exasterbated (sp?) by the fact that, all the sudden, they are our primary contribution to a group due to the decrease in usefulness of our slow (whether it is due to fight duration issues or mitigation issues) and, to a similar degree, DoT's (shorter fight durations / insane aggro issues).  <br />
<br />
So, the only reason I would want better nukes is if I chose to be content with having them as my main contribution in a fight after malo/slow has landed.<br />
<br />
If we got better heals, then, after Malo/Slow (or Nihil), we would be spending our time on healing, and would not care as much, on the whole, about our nukes.<br />
<br />
DoT rebalancing is a whole 'nother issue altogether... but come on, can't they do something with that aggro?</div></div><hr />

Clerics are getting a 1500 nuke with a 6 second cast. How is giving us a 1K nuke with a 4.5 cast different than this? Hey if they want to put a 7 second recast on it, like the Cleric nukes, fine. I am only gonna need 1 a fight, probably all I will have time for, but I wanna do SOMETHING with that last 7 seconds of a fight, and an 8 second nuke isnt it. <br />
<br />
DOTs are another topic. All I really want there is to stay the same as we currently are in relation to Necros. Thats it. Our Bane upgrade should be as big as theirs (Bane being the ONLY DOT I mem in non-solo situations). Again, I am not that annoyed by the re-cast time. If its resisted, oh well, FM HERE!! PULL ANOTHER!!</div></div><hr />

        Same ,but our spell would be improved with lvl70 , if i have to choose ,it would be same dmg but faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have to agree that speed is more a factor than size.  Even if we had a 2k nuke, it wouldn't do much good if we had to debuff, slow (cast again if resisted) and then wait 8+ secs for blast to hit.  1k is just fine as long as it's fast enough to actually get used.</div></div><hr />
