<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I've just hit 45, and moved into Ill Omen to try bloodgills. Having spent a while trading, killing geniods, selling my soul, I've managed to get JB bracer, arms, gloves, boots and helm.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm having a whale of a time killing the little goblins when I accidentely pull 2. I slow them both, and attack the one dogdog isn't. I'm busy playing with my new toy (JBB) and kill this one off. I'm surprised dogdog is still alive, and not only that, he's actually not doing too badly! <br />
<br />
Well, I kill of the other goblin, and sit down to think about my puppies amazing performance. I'd not buffed dogdog with aclarity or regen, but, I'd buffed him with the free stat buffs from the JB armour (str, dex and agil). <br />
<br />
Maybe our pets are designed with the idea that we buff their stats. Seemed to make a big difference, but then again it could just be the rosy glow from the JBB affecting my imagination!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The shaman pet is very unde rated. I use mine to solo by himself all the time. For example, a cleric friend and I spend a lot of time in the grey. I tend to pull 2 mobs at once to get a nice chunk of xp (being that i have free dots and all). I try to pull a golem and a snake that way the cleric has something to do. I slow both, sick pet on snake and epic both. Then i dot up the golem and sit back watching pet rip the snake (who resists all my dots except epic). All my cleric does is cast cel heal 2 times and bye bye snake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At higher levels the shaman pet is actually pretty decent with a suprisingly effective taunt.  At 34 your pet can't take too much punishement, but my 55 pet is pretty decent.<br />
<br />
I've been soloing suits in WL, I pull with slow park it, malosi (to get more bang for my buck on paralyzing earth and JBB), epic and then JBB till root breaks.  The pet runs to my aid and I root the mob backing off to med/can/regen.  I step in when the pet is down to about 30% health, take aggro and a couple shots later its dead, I'm almost full mana/health and cujo sitting is fully regened (natural NPC regen) and is FoH by the time I've pulled and epiced the next pull.<br />
<br />
As for his taunt, I've seen him take after a wiz partner I play with only to turn on the pet after taking a swing or 2 on the wiz.  On a rare occaision, I've had brief issues taking aggro from my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bloodgills isn't a very accurate test. Bloodgill Goblins are very very weak mobs for their level. They have low hitpoints, and they don't hit as hard as mobs of their level.<br />
<br />
This makes them fantastic mobs to level from of course, :)  (I did so from 42 to 51) but your milage with Dogdog using this method will vary on mobs that aren't big wimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dogs good when u get adds cause it keeps them busy whilst you and your group (if any) work your way round to killing the add.<br />
<br />
Only buffs I give my pet are haste and regrow, usually with just those it can see off most mobs (slowed) whilst I do my stuff.<br />
<br />
They might not be as good as alot of pets, but damn they are handy.  All I need now is the AA pet command :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What makes Dogdog good is your slows. Without them he gets eaten fast. <br />
<br />
When i solo i always use Dogdog. As long as he can nibble on mobs from behind he does ok damage, nothing whopping but enough for me to notice the difference.<br />
<br />
I might be wrong on this, but im pretty sure stat buffs do NOT affect your pets performance at all. Well, str might but only to a miniscule degree. I usually give him only speed and sow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I give mine haste and HP buff.  Regrowth is rarely necessary as long as he lives out the fight - his natural regen is pretty great once he quits fighting.  And the HP buff last a lot longer.<br />
<br />
When soloing I've gotten into the habit of making sure to give dogdog the chance to get low on health.  I figure I'm wasting a resource if he's at full health while I'm medding.  Let him take some hits instead of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always give my pet a HoS, resso, and symbol hehe i just thought of that..be he still hits for 50's and bashes...and tanks mobs that put a hurtin on me in the grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm the same as weissblau: I've gotten into the habit of letting the pet's health get fairly low during the fight. He regenerates quickly between fights, and I figure there's little point in him sitting there at full health while I'm medding. With the earlier pets I didn't do this, and I'm not sure if it's just that they were much weaker, and so I couldn't leave them in there for very long, or if the better slow has allowed them to tank more.<br />
<br />
If I know I'm going to be soloing for a while, and so the pet will outlive the buffs, I give him the works: Talisman (HoS doesn't seem worth it, because as far as I know Dex doesn't do anything for the pet), AC, Str, Agi, haste, and any resist buffs that are relevant. The more time he spends tanking, my thinking is, the more time I can spend medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When soloing, I give dogdog Spirit Quickening and that's it. Just doesn't seem worth the mana regen time to buff him any more. He does great tanking a limited time vs. slowed mobs if need be, so I just let him do his thing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Please don't reply if ya don't know for sure.. No sense in speculations<br />
<br />
- Does Speed line and Spirit Quickening(pain to get) stack and worth it?<br />
<br />
- Does dex/agi/sta actually help our pets?<br />
<br />
- Do pets get our resists buffs?<br />
<br />
and for giggles...<br />
- Do pets drink potions we give them? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1) The spells themselves stack but only the spell with the greater haste component will apply haste.  (Thus you get the haste from celerity but the other benefits from the pet buff.)  I've not really noticed it being very worth it, especially considering the spell's duration.<br />
<br />
2)  All stats help a little... the key words being &quot;a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
3)  Only if you cast it directly on them.  They are not included when you do group resists.  I saw somewhere what our pet's base resists are supposed to be... sorry I can't find out that info at the moment I'll update if I can find it.<br />
<br />
4)  Hehe I wish they did... just give him a 10 charge and let him manage his own buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hrrmm. . . I was under the impression that the celerity and pet buffs stack in all respects.  At least the dog seems to attack faster  . . . I guess I could be wrong as I've never done tests with dmg parsing and all.  I was pretty sure the haste stacks tho.  That was kind of the point of having a pet buff, dont'cha think?  Not like it's a lot of haste, just 25% or something.  <br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed tho, Cujo has a hard time hitting mobs that are blue to me.  His attack isn't the greatest, so if I can raise it a little he lands a lot more bites.  There's a magic point at which he can reliably bite a mob rather than miss it.  Str adds attack, and you can stack both HoS and str on the dog for some pretty kick ass attack increases.  I notice a difference anyway . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I believe the haste part of the pet buff does stack with celerity.  If not, whats the point of a pet buff with 20% haste when we can cast 50% (yes, I know it adds a little attack and I think ac.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You know what would be really funny...if you could give caster pets a mod rod.  <br />
<br />
As far as resistances go, our pet's resistances are supposedly so incredibly low that buffing their resistances makes no difference.  I've buffed mine with resistances plenty of times, and personally have never noticed a difference.<br />
<br />
As to buffs on the pet, unless I am going after a particularly tough one-shot spawn, I generally give them only buffs that I can cast off my armor(riotous health, and JBB armor earlier in my career), SOW if outside(can make a BIG difference in how fast a mob dies or if it gets far enough away from me to poof back to spawn point), and the pet haste spell.<br />
<br />
I figured out on many mobs and camps that I would actually spend less mana conjuring a new pet than I would refreshing buffs on the old one, and since I didn't notice much improvement really after casting buffs, I didn't bother.<br />
<br />
Now that I have torpor, though, I will generally put focus on the dog, too.  The strength seems to make a bit of an improvement in the damage he does, but more importantly, the hitpoints are a nice safety net in case I get distracted or he takes a few bad rounds of damage.  Torpor makes the difference to me, because now mana is very trivial; all the more so with canni 5.<br />
<br />
When fighting the great saprophyte, though, I buff him up good -- focus, shifting shield or whatever that AC buff is, regrowth, pet haste, riotous health.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'm even smart enough not to try to cast them on him when I'm out of the water and he's not. :P</div></div><hr />
