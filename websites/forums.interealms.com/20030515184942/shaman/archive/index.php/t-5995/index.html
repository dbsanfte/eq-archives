<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would it be within the realm of possibilities to add a section for equipment threads like on the Rangers Glade?<br />
<br />
/rant (youd do well to start ignoring me now)<br />
Its just a peeve of mine and I know its been this way for some time, but a section devoted to gear would be nice instead of seeing 12 threads on the first page with the post being someones magelo and the line &quot;what should i upgrade?<br />
Or of course the weekly whats a JBB worth posts .<br />
And of course the Legs A are 45 ac 50 hps 80 mana legs B are 45 ac 80hps 50 mana which should i go for , oh btw im lvl 22. <br />
(If youre seeing yourself in here and still reading and getting mad about it i tried to tell you not to continue )<br />
Of course using the search function is probably too complex for most to comprehend so maybe just a whole seperate section with maybe stick notes at the top for JBB prices , which BP is best ect ect .<br />
Ok i feel better now.<br />
/rant off<br />

Peace love and geese<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would, but honestly, I don't think anyone would go there.  If I'm wrong, by all means let me know and I'll add one tomorrow.  I just don't want to add a forum specifically for it and then watch it rot while everyone posts in General regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Thantu pointed out I doubt anyone would use the forum, unless posts were moved there and that would mean this board would need to be moderated. And go dforbid that happened...<br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That solves that :)  Icklymuk just volunteered to moderate the new Equipment forum!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Find someone who REALLY cares about it and has a lot of time on their hands.  Put them in charge of moderating equipment threads.<br />
<br />
&lt;--- Not volunteering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">look at the monk board posts get put into equip forum and they get replied to...i think they would here too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&lt;-- would quite happily shift equipment posts into the equipment forum for you if you want Thantu, need something to help me slack during the work day ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd also move equipment threads to another forum.<br />
<br />
They are all the same annoying threads that clutter up the general, and scroll something that might be usefull out of sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">: agrees with Kronenbourg and Rokkeb. Put me in coach!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tried a armor and equpiment section once and it as just way to hard to keep up with all the new armors and items coming out. People would constently tell me this is good to add that is good to add and it would be a full time database to keep up. So now I just link to http://www.planeteverquest.com/eqwadb/<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think an equipment forum would be a great idea, and I for one would actually use it!  (go figure =P )<br />
<br />
You got my vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AJ0302</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the website is now http://www.planeteq.com/eqwadb/</div></div><hr />
