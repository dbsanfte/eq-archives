<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you haven't already read the preview for wednesday's patch you're missing out on an emotional experience.  Everything from the removal of 1018 to the revamped Hate (zone).  Check it out and try not to thrash your computer till after this wednesday.  *Angelic chords resonating*  Verant speaks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1018? what is 1018?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't ask! If you don't know you have no idea how lucky you are. I have gone LD or had to /q out and it has taken me up to 30 minutes to get back online. Meanwhile my second account is sitting there waiting for me to POOF.  It's so frustrating to see Genine just standing there, in group, no LD above her head for 20+ minutes. You would think that disconnecting your internet connection and rebooting your computer would help SOME, nope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you go LD and you get:<br />
&quot;Error 1018:  you have an active character on that server.  Please wait a bit and try again.&quot; or something pretty close to that effect.<br />
<br />
For many people, it's been going from &quot;wait a few minutes&quot; to &quot;wait a few hours&quot; before you can get back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was 1018 on my 2nd account for about 14 hours one day, luckily it was just my bazaar mule account and not my shaman, so i was able to play.  I could /w all my bazaar mule and see him lol.  After 14 hour the bazaar zone crashed and that was my ticket out of it, otherwise who knows, it could have been days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1018's are so bad that people have changed their chat handles to include some reference to the errors.  I think the GM's in chat finally got so sick of repeated requests for world kicks and being asked how the 1018 problem could be fixed so they might have actually suggested that SOE fix this problem.  This fix and the removal of VP's dumbass gate restrictions are some of the best parts of the upcoming patch.</div></div><hr />

Bro what u do is log that account and at server select screen select chat.<br />
Then politely SCREAM in the ear of the nearest gm askign him to world kick character X from server x cause u are 1018 :)<br />
<br />
Puter crashed after i died fightign the poi dragon.<br />
Got back but it was late enough that i missed the gnoem i was supposed to hail for the flag so no flag for me. Sure it could have been a lot worse but still SUCKS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Soul, I wish it were that easy.  Spent 10.5 hours standing next to my chanter (on my main account) with my bazaar mule (on my holder account) with a petition in queue.  Had the chat loaded up on my main account only to be told that they could not world kick a toon and that I would have to contact a friend in game to send in a petition.  Well TM petition queue got bottlenecked badly that night because I ended up having at least 40 petitions turned in on my behalf.  Still didn't get world kicked until the servers crashed... 4 hours after a Guide escalated to a GM :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is what frightens me about Everquest.<br />
<br />
I am a relative Everquest newbie, considering how the Game has been out, what, 7 years now? And these basic networking and balance problems still exist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There has always been the 1018 error, but it was usually very reasonable - just a few minutes, so it was working as intended.  With the last patch though, they broke it and it is now lasting ridiculously long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We've  always done a /guild request to send the target tells until he blinks out and it's worked.  Anyone else have some sucess with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The thing that has always made me laugh about 1018's is the catch-22 policy on getting a world kick.  It does not effect 2-boxers, but you are supposed to drop a petition IN GAME to get yourself kicked. :p  Chat GM's are just there to answer some questions, but not take action.<br />
<br />
Genius...pure genius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, I had no idea this was such a wide spread problem.  I go LD a lot, unfortunately.  Usually by the time I can get back to the character selection screen I can get back into the game.  But lately I&#8217;ve had to wait five or ten minutes each time.  It&#8217;s been a royal pain.  But I had assumed this was an intended &#8220;fix&#8221; and not a bug.  I&#8217;m happy to see this being corrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can confirm that spamming the LD char can make them drop off and reset.  We do it all the time in guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually its not a case of 'these problems still exist' but rather that problems of this kind are being introduced.<br />
<br />
Originally if you went LD - if the connection problem went away and you could reconnect quickly enough - you could get back into the game and find your character still up and your pet still alive.</div></div><hr />

No no no<br />
<br />
U do not petition from the game.<br />
<br />
U simply log in and go to server select (make sure u are logged on account that has a 1018 char.<br />
now instead of clicking a server and gettign that nasty 1018 u click the button on the bottom that says &quot;CHAT&quot; go to general chat and there is ALWAYS a gm on. Heck there was on there last night at 4am.<br />
Keep spamming the channel with.<br />
<br />
Can i please get a world kick? Thanks<br />
<br />
if that won't work send a tell to the gm in the channel askign politely for a world kick. Usually this takes no more than 10 minutes the gm is there for that purpose anyway.<br />

We've always done a /guild request to send the target tells until he blinks out and it's worked. Anyone else have some sucess with it?<br />

We doe this as well, and it works.<br />
