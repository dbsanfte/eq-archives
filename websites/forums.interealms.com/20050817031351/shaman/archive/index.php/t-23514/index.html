<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was posted at Monkly Business and at our guild forums by one of our bards. Its a browser based RPG that kills time better than GEMS imo. Here's my referral link http://dragon.not.net/referral.php?r=Rtugok or you can just use http://dragon.not.net. This isn't one of those click and get more army things, its a text based RPG with some interaction with pther playeres. Even a bit of PvP. Im a level 4 troll atm, Farmboy Rtugok. Holla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use to play a game with a similar name. Legend of the Red Dragon, back in the old BBS days. Anyone remember those? Or Trade wars? That game was the bomb, trade wars was my eq back then.</div></div><hr />

by the way there are like hundreds of player run logd games, if you want faster gameplay, more customization (one was run by maddog i believe.. it had like 5 custom towns, lots of new items and shops, etc)</div></div><hr />
