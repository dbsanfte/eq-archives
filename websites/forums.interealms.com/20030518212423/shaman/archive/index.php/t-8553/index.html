<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I need cash and have 2 bracelets from UP. The STA one and the WIS one. I think both still sell pretty well..but which do you think is best to keep? +15 WIS or +15 STA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sta &gt; Wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on the rest of your gear honestly.  I hear a lot of folks saying how STA and HP are better than WIS, and I partially disagree.  I mean, we use mana, so it's nice to have it, right?  Now I am not saying sacrifice sta, hp, and AC for WIS by any means, but IMO you should try and get your WIS to 200.  After 200, each point of WIS only yields about 6 mana per point, so it's much less important, and you need those HPs.  So if you have an item that gives 15 WIS, that can free up a couple weak-WIS slots for sta, hp, and AC (and saves, at some point).  If you want to go with strict numbers, then 15 WIS, from about 41st level on, yields about 150 mana, if you're under or up to 200 WIS.  STA 15 will yield about 60 hp, which cannibalizes into what?  30 hp?  Not real sure on the exact calcs, but I am probably not too far off.  Granted, HP are multi-purpose, but in this scenario, it's not even close.  And your HP regen will give you those 60 hp back at about 15-20 per tick, which is about the equivalent of 7-10 per tick of mana regen.  So if you find you find yourself with Clarity of any form, the mana is a better value.  Now, if it keeps you over 200 WIS, then I'd say keep the STA bracer.  <br />

All this is IMO, of course, and YMMV  =)</div></div><hr />
