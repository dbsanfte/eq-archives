<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got the expansion, absolutely love the adventures, but I do have one gripe.  This is more of a lowbie issue, so many of you probably will never have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
At level 32 I've completed 3 of four adventures, and had a blast doing so.  Loot is okay, being mostly sellable swords and such on the level with fine steel. <br />
<br />
My gripe is this...for completing a successful adventure at level 32 I get 2 points.  I understand that balancing rewards for your level is important, but when you look at the cost of certain items, the reward stinks.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look at the lowest level of spells: Lesser Augury, cleansing, and exorcism.  These are level 14 spells, they cost 25 points each.  So, if the average mission takes about an hour (not counting the other hour of trying to gather a group) and you get two points for successful completion at level 32, you're talking about spending 13 hours of straight LDoN adventures to gather the points for a level 14 spell.<br />
<br />
I love the dungeons, the whole concept is awesome, but they need to rethink the cost of these lower level spells.  I'm not saying at level 32 I should be getting more points. That would be unbalancing.  My point is the low level spell point prices need to come down.  At this rate I should be able to get spirit of the shrew sometime next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks pretty balanced.  At level 65, to get Greater Remove Curse, you would need 800 points.  At 51 points for a normal adventure, it works out to...15 hours.  The high level curse is a steal at 600 points, only 12 hours!  <br />
<br />
At level 32, it takes 14 hours to get a spell, at level 65 it takes a comparable amount of time to get a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the rewards for lower levels could probably be bumped up a bit.  Looking at the highest level of the same spells he lists (granted, they're lvl34 spells, but they're what the lvl65s will be using, and they're a similar relative level to the person trying to get them), you can afford to buy them with points left over after 4 victories in a lvl65 group.<br />
<br />
Edit: Either that, or drop the prices on the lower spells.  They're something very nice to have for the dungeon crawls, and I think everyone should ideally get them at relatively the same point in their adventuring career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At level 32, it takes 14 hours to get a spell, at level 65 it takes a comparable amount of time to get a spell.<br />
Bare with me here, because I think we're looking at this from two different perspectives. If you look at the spells in relation to your level, percentage wise, level 54 is about 85% of level 65. Level 14 is right around 43% of level 32.  <br />
<br />
To compare the spells for my level to the spells for yours, you'd have to look at your level 39 spells. Even then the spells are higher than half your level. But You'd still be looking at about 9 hours of adventuring, which in my mind is still rediculous for a spell that should have been available to you 26 levels ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Think about some of the quest items/spells in the other expansions. You're talking four to six hours of questing for a level appropriate item. Here we're talking about at least 9 hours of work for spell that is appropriate for someone half your level.<br />
<br />
**edit** I was looking at remove curse as the level 39 example. I suppose a more appropriate example would be the reebo's line at level 34.  At level 65 you could attain these in two missions, or one on hard setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lv 46 player succeed in adventure gain 8 point Adventure Point(while one member LDed, but still gained adventure point after he log back).  <br />
<br />
Shaman lv 44 Odium, 72 points, require 9 succeed adventure, takes about 14 hours.  <br />
It acceptable since the exp in LODN group is so great, about 1 hour 1 yellow,  much better than Dreadland.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Big problem with having a similar 'hours invested' philosophy for a level 32 and a level 65. At 65 you're done leveling, you're at the ceiling. The spell you're working towards is always going to have the same usefullness (barring a nerf or boost on sony's part) to you. At level 32 every mob you kill puts you further and further away from that spell you're working towards being usefull. In the 14 hours it takes (if everything goes well) for the level 32 to earn enough points to get the level 14 spell the character will probably level at least twice, diminishing the value of that spell to him/her even more.<br />
<br />
The costs for the level 14 spells need to be reduced IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm.. I could afford to buy the best chest disarming spells(1 of them) after 2 adventures(lvl 65th). Lvl 34 spells.. why should a lvl 35 have to spend 3 to 4 times as much time to buy the lowbie level 14 version?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to agree, that the lower-level points are way too low. My alt is a 31 rogue, and so far after three grueling adventures (Deepest Guk with a bunch of level 25 testbuff newbies is no picnic), I can afford to buy a &quot;good&quot; charm to put my adventurer's stone into.<br />
<br />
Of course, my shaman is 61, groups usually with 65's. Sees 41 points per, and after a few adventures, i'm seeing stuff that I might consider putting on my rogue :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are a newb and are able to get a semi-balanced group together, you will gain far far far more by adventuring in LDoN than by hunting in one of the dreary outdoor zones in the game.  I think this is a very good thing, and tested it with my lvl 35 enchanter.  In 90 minutes we cleared all the mobs out of a dungeon.  With two monks, a ranger, and two druids, we managed just fine, in fact better than fine.  It was flat out easy for us, good exp (got three yellows), good loot (too bad one of the druids (the ML) was a greedy whore and ran off with the stash!), and i got a whopping 3 points which I spent to get myself a LDoN charm that increases intelligence or something.  Mostly tho, I wanted a charm to put my port stone on . <br />
<br />
Having done that once at that level, I see no reason to exp any other way than in an LDoN dungeon.  The risk v. reward is quite well balanced, tho the point awards at that level frankly stink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">THe hypothetical level 32 doing 14 adventures for those level 14 spells would end up that cycle somewhere in the area of level 36 or 37, getting more points with which to buy stuff, and money too.<br />
<br />
It isn't as though the trap disarm spells are worth buying at all. Save up your points for something that is actually valuable, and enjoy the ride.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Let's say a person is level 34 and just bought LDON so they are doing adventures for their first time.  They see our curse spell that is 36 points and decide that is going to be their first goal.  They get 3 points in an hour and half.  They also gain about 2-3 orange bubbles of experience.  The next adventure they succeed at will also give them 3 points and they will most likely be 35 at this time.  So now they have 6 points, 30 points remaining and they've already lost one level of usefulness to the curse spell.  Now they continue adventuring gaining 3 points and half a level for 5 levels.  Now they are most likely level 40 with around 36-40 points.  That is excluding any failures they may have had which would still possibly yield as much experience without as many points collected.<br />
<br />
So, do they spend all of the points they have earned so far on one spell they should have gotten 6 levels ago?  Or....do they keep saving for a spell that they will be able to use in 4 levels....but wait, they have been saving up points at Northern Ro camp and they now have to start all over again at Southern Ro to unlock the 72 point level 44 spell.  <br />
<br />
I guess you can see that I agree with Jahvah and that the points should not be on an exponential curve as they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You forget that that same person will not be getting 3 points for an adventure at level 39, most likely they will be getting closer to 5 or 6 points per (I really don't know how many you get at those levels).  But it will not stay constant as they level, it will keep going up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Progress check for anyone that's interested.<br />
<br />
I started this thread at level 32. Most of the experience I've gathered has been in LDoN dungeons. I'm level 41 now.  When I dinged 41, I had finally gathered enough points to buy Pack Shrew.  That's the only thing I've purchased with my adventure points.  So there ya have it, 9 levels = 36 points.<br />
<br />
The way I've been looking at it is this: The experience in the dungeons is so good, and the adventures are so fun, that the adventure points are just a perk.  I'd be really freakin frustrated if points were the only things you got out of these dungeons.<br />
<br />
Edit: One thing I forgot to add was I'd done a few adventures in different camps. So I geuss the ratio would be closer to 9 levels = @50 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The lowby rewards could definitely stand to be bumped up IMHO. <br />
<br />
I also wish they would remove the differentiation between camps points wise. All my guildies understandably want to do a nro adventure all the time - because they can get plate there, I believe - and I can barely get people to join me on an EC adventure. We can blow through those missions in like 20-30 minutes depending on the group, yet I end up getting one adventure done a night - if I'm lucky. I just want Bane :(<br />
<br />
I wonder how it'll be when I go for the pants in everfrost :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Be careful what you ask for -- they could always take the opposite approach and lower the points on 65s -- where it isnt the uber exp that it is at 35 in the LDON dungeons....  <br />
<br />
Personally what I would like to see is some other useful things.....  Would spend 2000 points on a mana pres 4 augment if such were available...  Would like some better tertiary armors to be available -- the cloaks, masks, belts, etc all stink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jahvah could you give a break down of the points and how they increased as you progressed from 32-41?  You may not remember each level, but if you can remember certain levels where you are sure how many points you received it would be helpful :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Problem with that analogy Gloria is that with 14 hours of work at lvl 32 he'll be lvl 50, with a useless spell, or useless gear...<br />
The rewards for the lower lvl stuff isn't worth it... Period...<br />
You gave a perfect example as to the reason why...<br />
<br />
If you wanted to equip your char through LDon you would be lvl 45 or so before you could by your first peice of lvl 20 armor...:)<br />
<br />
But that works right? hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It works because nowadays at level 45, the only gear you would be able to &quot;earn&quot; at most other spots in the game would be equivalent to that &quot;level 20&quot; LDoN gear.  The kicker is that while adventuring, LDoN missions have a high enough payoff with sellable drops (especially tradeskill stuff) and vendor loot that you can also earn plat while leveling.  <br />
<br />
If you remember, most of the lowbie (50 and below) zones are sided with either good exp or good cash, not both.  LDoN gives you both, with the incentive of gaining adventure points.  <br />
<br />
Besides, with the cost of some of this stuff, I don't think SoE meant for people to just be able to blast through 1-2 months of dungeons and fully equip their characters on AP alone.</div></div><hr />

Personally I've had 0 trouble getting people to do EC or everfrost. The melee's all wanna unlock the 40hp augment in ec. Alot of our tanks want to unlock anger in everfrost or the yak stun in guk. Clerics always wanna go to guk at first so they can get Vie. I'd say that theres enough variety that most people have a good reason to go to every camp.</div></div><hr />

Most of the tanks in my guild either have it, or play at different times than me, so it's kinda difficult. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's makes a lot of sense, but there is a potential solution<br />
<br />
increase the value of all LDoN camps, and subsequently increase the spread of point to buy the higher stuff<br />
<br />
ie: a level 65 adventure now gives 102 point, the best stuff in the game costs 2880 points.  So it will still take the same amount to buy the best equipment<br />
<br />
a level 20 adventure you get 5 points a win, but leave level 20 stuff the same price.  just spread everything out more, so the level 20 isn't earing points fast enough to buy uber_loot_001, however they aren't shafted by being unable to buy any equipment at their reccommended level.<br />

<br />
True, but I still feel that at least the spell costs from the adventure merchants should be lowered for the lower level spells.  I really do not feel that level 14, 24, 34, 44 spells should only be available for purchase using LDON points.  This basically makes it impossible for anyone to get the new spells at the appropriate levels, and it makes the low level spells all but useless considering the only people who can buy spells at or near the appropriate level are those who are 50-65.<br />
<br />
I do not care how much equipment costs from adventure merchants, I am happy with my gear at this time, but spells I have no other way of earning except by dragging people to a specific theme for 10 levels so I can buy one spell is just a tad bit rediculous.  I at least feel that if they are going to force us to buy our new spells from Adventure merchants that the 1-50 spells should be available from any merchant, not specific ones for each spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I thought the point rewards seemed weak when I first started LDoNing at about your level.<br />
<br />
But, you'll gain a level every 2-3 adventures at that level, level up fast, get nice splits, chances at drops, and since you'll level fast you will gain more and more points from your adventures.<br />
<br />
There are so many benefits to LDoN, such as drops, augmentations, good splits, meeting cool people, and all around fun, that to me the adventure points are just a bonus.  I like to get them, but the're the least of my concerns.<br />
<br />
Over time I've got the LDoN charm, a cool ranged slot item with 3 aug slots, pack shrew, a regen aug that I can friggin use because it's of slot type 3 &lt;sigh&gt;, a (lower) remove curse spell, and I'm sitting on a bunch of points to get a DoT or a nice item at some point.  I can't complain at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The lowby rewards are a compelte joke. Like 220 points for an 11 ac 9 agi mantle? ummm... does ANYONE think this junk is balanced? I may do a few more for my bl , but its far better time invested if my friends and I just level in nurga or something. They will level faster, and get points more quickly in the long run over anyone going in ldon alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yeah, the points are screwy...my 41 monk only gets 5 points per adventure, and looking at the lists for stuff that you can get, let's see...minimum 110 points for anything other than a craptastic charm (he has Idol of the Juggler, gotten in Gunthak from a level 30 mob) would take approximatelt 20 adventures. Be realistic, none of the 110 point stuff is even remotely decent, even for a true newbie who has just stuff he bought from scrounging. I spent all of from levels 51 to 54 adventuring to get my 54 Anathema and even had to go 100% AA at one point just so I wouldn't ding and lose usefullness of the spell. 410 points at 18 to 22 points per adventure, you definately level way faster than getting points. I have many alts, ranging from a level 27 Enchanter to a 56 Ranger and the point spread is horrid. 1 point per adventure for the lowbies is more like a slap in the face, when you can be off getting the same amount of exp in any other dungeon, but get better upgrades or enough plat to buy upgrades, at the same time. It just seems like the exp is better because you move at an insane pace, do that in a normal group and you'll see the same results. LDoN is mainly nice for the instancing, no more fighting over mobs with others, and I'm starting to go back to other zones solo or with a partner cause it's getting boring doing the same exact thing over and over...yeah, yeah, EQ is basically the same thing over and over again, but there's a ton of zones to do it in, each with different strategies and that is what LDoN has eliminated, there is no strategy other than: Go from point A to point B and kill everything within 90 minutes. Not to mention if you make one mistake and fail, you lose points (lesser reward) meaning even MORE time to get XXX piece of gear/spell/augment, whatever. Hey, I'm not gonna trash LDoN, it's opened up a lot of zones for me to tear up with my alts and learn the ways of each class in solo/duo environments. Now to find a zone for my 55 SHM that I can pull non-stop....</div></div><hr />

I used that as a selling point to get people to do EC with me so I could get Bane. And now I have Bane and I don't overly care where we adventure. I wouldn't mind a few 40hp augments myself however! ;)</div></div><hr />
