<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any info on soloing guardian wurms in SF. I'm 60 have JBB bane of nife no torpor though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not sure if its been done before, you definetly would need all your spells to even have a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't think I could be done solo... maybe find a cleric and warrior to come with you. A tracker would help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its been done w/ an SK/Sham Duo, but i doubt its possible to do solo.<br />
<br />
You can try, but youll need all your spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bet people would disagree with me. But I see nothing wrong with using alchemy potions like stinging wort to try something like this. Nobody would complain if a rogue pulled off a nice solo with poisons on his weapon.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Have fun farming 400 ice giant toes.<br />

Guardian wurms double for 530 and have 32k HP.  The only way shamans can kill big HP mobs like this is by outlasting them while their dots do their work.  Torpor will not keep up with 530HP hits, and making this many stinging wort potions would be a HUGE time sink.  We're talking &quot;more time than you invested in your epic&quot; time sink.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's doable solo, although I would be very happy to see myself proven wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are just too tuff imho.<br />
<br />
Seen them in action.  Scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They aint that tough for a 60th mob.   They just have a ton of hps and summon.  I dunno, I guess my gear sucks, but I dont think I can do more than 15k to them before I am asking for a rez at the RF camp.  Its not the melee that gets me, its the hps they have and the &quot;You will not evade me a_panic'd_shaman&quot; messages when I decide that oom and a 50% guardian wurm has won the battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some of them also cast a fire based AoE spell so that adds even more damage to you.<br />
<br />
Yes, for a 60 mob they are pretty easy as a duo or in a group but solo....  the only way it could be done is with c3 +potg + a horse.  Even then... they hit for max a lot and loosing over 1k of hp in one round is going to be tough.<br />
<br />
If you kept topor up on yourself the entire time and did sup heals every few seconds on yourself you &quot;could&quot; live through it but I think you would eventually fall behind.  epic plus puppy would take probably 20+ minutes to chew through 32k of hp.<br />
<br />
I really don't think you would be able to spare the 8seconds to cast jbb or at least not very often.<br />
<br />
Perhaps when the new 2k heal goes live they might be soloable.<br />
<br />
This could be the next be challenge.  :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've duoed them with a 60 Troll SK. <br />
<br />
SK pulled with CoS, he'd shout when 10secs to inc, i'd torpor self, malo/slow wurm, take 1-2 rounds of melee while I cast a second torpor on self, then he'd have aggro and I'd start ghetto cleric/mana battery routine with a few epics thrown in.<br />
<br />
Took about 8 mins to get it running, had no time for JBB really, just kept constant canni4/torpor for mana, started torpor on SK when he was at 70%, sometimes had to use choloroblast to level it out. Did a few banes towards the end. SK had 1300+AC with my buffs and he would still take over 1k on some rounds of melee. (though slowed they hit once every 9-10secs, torpor and few chain cast CB can keep up with worst case scenario). <br />
<br />
I went down to about 25m-30m a few times in the fight, ended on 50m tho. Would be much easier now I have canni5.<br />
<br />
Sk is a good tank for Gwurms though,  he can tap/dot etc while being torpored, and straight melee rest of the time.<br />
<br />
Atm trying to convince a monk friend we can duo one...<br />
<br />
Maybe a 3sec/6tick Torpor Oracle with all focus3/top tier kit could solo one, like to see it ;) i know a scuffy arse like me would get torn apart in fairly short order, even after debuff kiting..<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see if a 60 cleric/60 warrior duo could do it self buffed, I'm thinking maybe with a 6k+ish tank and a 4500mana ft15 cleric, that would give 13-14 c-heals of 4-5k a pop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also easy with a 60 pally if you have torpor. I did this and never went under 60mana from healing Pally. Even used a couple of banes and kept epic running all time. I have a horse tho so I medded when casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">These things are EZ.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've duo'd them with a 60 sham. I would go pull and when it came in he'd torpor and during torpor he'd slow it. I dont think he ever malo'd because he wouldn't be casting much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway I just kept meleeing it and he just kept torporing me and he had canni 5 so that must have helped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I *doubt* you could solo them. But hey, anythings possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There may be an outside chance you can solo them, but definately not without torpor.  Torpor is what makes the majority of our soloing feats possible.</div></div><hr />
