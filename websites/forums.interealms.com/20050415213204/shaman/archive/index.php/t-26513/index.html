<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking last night, the problem Rytan has is with panther not leopard. Leopard seems to be within his specs for dps and they have not changed anything on that on test. Is there any reason why they could not make panther into Talisman of the Leopard and triple the mana cost of leopard? Maybe even make Talisman of the Leopard group only, even give Talisman a 40 sec recast so you can't use it on raids. Leave leopard (level 61 version) the way it is now so if we want to cast ourself silly on raids we can, but have the 69 version help us have less of a hassle in groups. I am gonna also post this on EQlive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a primarily soloing shaman, Spirit of the Leopard was a breath of fresh air for me. I bought 2 copies of LDoN but don't have bane or anathema, I bought 2 copies of GoD but don't have any of those spells, I bought 2 copies of OOW, but have stayed at level 65, and I bought 2 copies of DoN....this is my first new spell in 4 expansions &lt;sigh&gt;.<br />
<br />
How about this.....leave Leopard alone, same mana, same damage, same recast, no timer, even same pet proc rate, just make it only castable on my pet.<br />
<br />
Let Panther be the group/raid spell.<br />

Puh-lezzzzzzzzze!<br />
