<br />
I am a shadowknight who ended up with a child's tear from Fear, when our shaman had to all leave b4 we got to the minis.  As the player with the highest faction to truespirit left I was asked to MQ the tear for one of our Shaman.  I have indifferent faction to Truespirit, have completed 98% of my own epic (SK epic is on TS faction too), and am at a loss on how I can MQ a child's tear.  My in game wife is a shaman and needs the tear for her epic as it is her last part needed.  Will indifferent be high enough on a SK to MQ the tear?  If not any tips on how I might increase my faction to do so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can likely do it the same way many shaman try to skip parts...<br />
try doing the envy/woe and marrs promise quest over and over...If it won't let you, do that at indif then you may be out of luck. If it works than you can also try turning in the giosk books from CoM for faction. Try turning in dire wolf pelts.<br />
<br />
If you don't have high enough indif faction to do woe/envy though, then you would have to try doing the shaman epic from the start...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SK's sometimes raise their true spirit faction by seal running.  Once again, to skip certain parts of their epic.  You can find a description of seal running over at shadowknight.org here (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9668).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">as an SK and not a shaman, your tear will most likely be eaten by Rak'Ashiir.<br />
<br />
however any shaman need ally faction with true spirit in order to do the tear turn in (wich is granted by giving Neh'Ashiir diary to the spirit in EJ, that's an huge faction gain).<br />
<br />
my bet is that doing all this faction work to ally will take you as much time as going back on Fear and get a new tear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Typhoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Been trying to run SK seals for a couple weeks, and Marl Kastane doesn't give me a seal when I say what prophecy?  He jumps to a later conversation.  This could be from someone turning in a note everytime b4 I go, but I was starting to fear running SK seals no longer worked and that the shamman quests might give more faction faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im pretty sure others have tried this as SK's and it does not work. YOu might wanna search the quest boards, but i believe its been reported that no class, other than shaman, can hand in the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Typhoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thnx Aeshere, I'll look into it.  No need in me wasting time.</div></div><hr />
