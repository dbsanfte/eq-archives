<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I tried this on alt.games.everquest but no luck at all.  Thought I'd try one more forum before the big call to tech support.  <br />
<br />
I am experiencing a strange bug in the game in which one of my characters is unable to gate to Great Divide.  I have tried to take her there via Spires from the Nexus and have her gated in via druid and via Wizard gate spells and none of them work.  When I use the Nexus I am relocated to the center Nexus and I get a message that says the zone is down.  When I attempt to gate via druid or wizard, I am simply left behind.  <br />
<br />
I have another character on the same account on the same computer that I am able to gate into GD with no problems at all. <br />
<br />
I was planning to reinstall Velious but I was wondering the best way to do it.  I installed it the first time as part of the Trilogy and not a separate expansion.  Do you think I would need to uninstall Velious before reinstalling it, and how can I just uninstall Velious?  I really don't want to reinstall all of EQ.  The last time I had to do that I had a lot of problems getting it to work right because the uninstall didn't get all the files and I had conflicts and then there's the godawful patch download on a dial-up.<br />
<br />
Any way, any suggestions would be appreciated-except those that imply that I am a complete and utter dumbass like &quot;did you get a shard?&quot; and &quot;do you have Velious installed?&quot;  I may be a dumbass, but the complete and utter thing is just going too far!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep there was supposed a bugfix on test that may have fixed this. as far as i know, there is no fix for this. i have the exact same problem with dawnshroud, and a guy in my guild has a problem with GD? i honestly would suggest uninstallying everything, and then making sure you download every optional update out there (which can be done on the advanced screen from the main patch window).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coralis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure if this would work, and assuming it may be a bug on your copy of EQ, but have you tried moving all the GD files from your EQ directory into a test directory somewhere?  The patcher should then pick up that the files are missing and replace them.. hopefully with good copies.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this would work, but it works for other files as I have had to delete Everquest.exe before and get it re-downloaded.  If it didn't work, you could then move the files back in from the test directory, so you wouldn't have lost out.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />
