<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been a long time gone (about a year or so). However, my friend wants me to play again, so I will... <br />
<br />
I've mothballsed my kittie shaman for some time. He's level 26 now, and I kind of remember how to fight. ;) <br />
<br />
At level 26, I am fighting on the moon (mainly in the netherbian, or marus seru hunting reg's and hoppers). Question is:<br />
<br />
1. What spells should I buff myself with for solo? Currently, I give myself a full range (SOW, Spirit of monkey, protect, inner shield, Spirit of ox, Spirit of cat, Spirit strength).  I am not sure I need all those.. it might be overkill, and I waste a lot of time medding after buffs. <br />
<br />
2. what fighting stradegy should I use? Currently I do it two ways depending on my mood:<br />
a. hit with slow (walking sleep). Hit with envenomed breath and affliction, then melee to death, getting in an occassional frost strike, and maybe a disempower if he's hitting hard. <br />
<br />
b. hit with envenomed breath and afflication, root, sit and med. When breath wears off, recast breath and root again.  When mob is less then 1 bubble, melee to death (he's usually running, anyway). <br />
<br />
Both of these leave me with less then 10% mana left after a single battle, and I have a long wait till I can fight again. #1 leaves me with sometimes less then 50% heatlh as well. <br />
<br />
I'm sure I could be doing better..... how? What should I be doing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Next question:<br />
I have over 300plat. I'm sure thats not much, but to me, it is. I think I am lacking in boots and sleeves.  Whats good for me, and where can I find it? <br />
<br />
Last question: Not sure what I rolled this guy as.   I know i wasn't too awful, but it may not have been the best stats by 2 or 3 points. Would it be worth rerolling for 2-3 points? How much differance does that really make at these levels? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

Unless you have a procing weapon, skip the Monkey - it isn't doing you any good.<br />
<br />
Droping the Cat is probably also a good idea - the couple points of AC you get from it are almost certainly blocking so little damage that the mana would be better spent on heals.<br />
<br />
Spirit Strength - only has a minimal effect on your damage output. You can probably skip this one unless you are having weight problems.<br />
<br />
I don't see Regeneration in your list. I am hoping that you just neglected to list it. If you really aren't using it - start now. It is is the most mana efficient healing you have available (though it does work slowly of course).<br />
<br />
<br />
Both fighting styles are perfectly valid. Some situations call for Tank soloing (your a), and some for Root-n-Rot (your b).<br />
<br />
Which is best depends on your equipment and what you are fighting.<br />
<br />
You should do some tanking each level to insure that your Defense and Dodge skills are maxed out. Beyond that, do whichever you prefer.<br />
<br />
Also, never forget that with Cannibalize your HP bar is really just a 2nd mana-bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your stat points, as long as you didn't dump them into Int or Charisma you are going to get some benefit out of them wherever you put them so don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Equipment : without knowing what you currently have, it is rather hard to make upgrade suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At these levels it's hard enough to keep up your melee skills (Defense, Offense, 1HB, Pierce, etc.).  These spells don't help directly with damage, but they have been proven to effec the rate you LEARN your melee skills (how quickly you get your skill ups after dinging each new level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are there any spells I should be using in battle that I am not? Can I stack poison spells, or disease spells to get more effective rotting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes regen is a must.  I really am not familiar at all with luclin zones, so i cant really say anything about that.  as for gear, I think for boots you should get Kobold hide boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1760) for the effect, and as for sleeves, at your level i had sleeves of the ancients, no drop from FM, but they are part of some spawn killing table and someone let me loot them.  Maybe totemic to hold off till you get something better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DoTs I think will stack. I know I've hit some mobs within the past 3 days with both e-bolt and venom of the snake. I never really used nukes when I was soloing, just poison, disease, root, med. <br />
Far as mana regen...aside from using cani, you could pick up a KEI/PotG and at your level probably never run out of mana. (Well, ok maybe not in reality.)<br />
You might also want to move to south karana. You should be able to solo at one of the spires or the aviaks, and get into the random group inside Paw as well (for nice xp bonus...provided they aren't a bunch of farkups).</div></div><hr />
