Well, since these shots are being made by the character creation CD's, anyone can be taking these screenshots.  And who knows what the person is using for a graphics card.  I've seen shots from people with some good systems and the shots look much more crisp and clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
    for being such  a strong business(Sony in general) I really am amazed at their lack of CS.I know if a store owner didnt care that people had problems with his/her store,he would lose customers.The most important thing to a business owner is to keep your customers coming back.<br />
<br />
    I guess I`m not saying that sony needs to re-evaluate themselves,but 1. they Would be making more money if they had better CS and 2.they see their customers as expendable,addicted fans.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Every &quot;dynasty&quot; comes to a closing point.I`m curious to see what sony does when someone actually does make a game that takes a majority of EQ players.It`s almost like they think this cant/will never happen.</div></div><hr />

There will be a point when EQ will be over, and then gotta start over anyway, so why not do it sooner :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Kate Winslet in Titanic<br />
<br />
<br />
kate's not skinny.  that's for sure.<br />
<br />
I dunno why all this H8 for skinny women.  biologically, while admittedly there's an impulse towards gluttony as a means to hedge our bets so to speak for the lean times, there's a lot of research coming up now that suggests that being skinny (and I mean REALLY skinny) has a direct correlation to a longer life span.<br />
<br />
furthermore, if you're in the medical profession you know that for people 30+ the number one contributing factor for medical complications is by a MASSIVE margin being overweight... for everything from heart disease to diabetes on and on<br />
<br />
to say it plainly, it's healthier to be skinny.  while eating disorders are bad.  on the issue of just being thin, there's almost no such thing as being too skinny... healthwise as long as you're not in the bathroom at Bennigans throwing up what you just ate.  there are no adults dying of malnutrition in the United States<br />
<br />
you CAN argue that a lot of women on the screen dont look like women on the street but if you talk to your doctor, he'll tell you that on average, most of the people on the street in america are fat.  also he'll probably point out the fact that most of the women on the street aren't good looking enough to be onscreen... even if they were skinny.<br />
<br />
plus, the idea that Hollywood is promoting some sort of false thin ideal on us is false.  if you start with the idea that beauty and sex appeal is correlated to sexual fertility and reproduction.  for men, the thin lithe look equates to a younger, higher probability of fertility and child-rearing energy.  it's not that hollywood is foisting that on us... men prefer skinnier women and inherently consider them more attractive than older, fatter chicks.  it's a fact.  it's not localized to the US or the West... you see the same preference whether it's africa or korea or whereever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well, we're pretty far off track, but Hollywood has definately changed.  If Marilyn Monroe tried to audition for anything other than the &quot;fat girl&quot; part, she would be laughed out of the audition room.  Elizabeth Hurley said she would  &quot;kill herself&quot; if she was as fat as Monroe.  Funny, I'd bet quite a bit that men will be thinking about Marilyn long after Hurley is dead and forgotten.<br />
<br />
I don't think people are complaining that women on the screen don't look like women on the street, its that women on the screen have the bodies of 12 year old boys :)  But if you want to get biological, no, a woman with no hips is a poor choice in that arena too.  And while morbidly obese has never been attractive, in the past even in our culture the ideal woman was much, much heavier than anyone who could get a movie gig today (check out some Medieval/Renaissance art and compare to G. Paltrow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ugh, I think the EQII models mostly all look stupid.  <br />
<br />
Like the Luclin era models, they don't have a sense of art or style.  Plus the eyes are usually too close together and races just look weird or uninteresting to me.  <br />
<br />
Lots of polygons =! good art.  <br />
<br />
Give me Marilyn Monroe anyday of the week over the reining stickqueens of Hollywood, and I'll have a smile on my face.  <br />
<br />
Liz Hurley is pretty hot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Yo Temucchikan - when you start talking women, that is one area I have some experience in. (Slowing in GoD = no, women = yes).<br />
<br />
Men throughout the ages HAVE preferred heftier women. Not fat, but with &quot;meat on their bones.&quot;  This includes your claims about the far east.<br />
<br />
http://www.accelerated-learning-online.com/research/body-shape-preference-body-satisfaction-taiwanese-college-students.asp<br />
<br />
On the contrary, female ratings of the Ideal figure were significantly thinner than their perception of their current figure, the figure as others saw them, and the figure they felt most of time. Furthermore, the female figure that women rated as most attractive to males was thinner than the figure that males actually preferred.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore hollyweird and many magazines (Cosmo, Vogue) do foist on women the ideal of 'thin, thin, thin.'  Have you seen the models on the runways? They ain't sporting 36B-D's I assure you.<br />
<br />
Also - vis-a-vis hollyweird again - who is seen as &quot;glamorous&quot;?<br />
<br />
The aformentioned Gwyneth Paltrow.<br />
The heavily botoxed Nicole Kidman.<br />
The chunky and butt ugly Renee Zelweiger. (She breaks the curve)<br />
<br />
Note there is a difference between 'fit' and 'thin.'  You may prefer anorexic, salad-eating, Goth chicks with bad teeth and breath, but that is not the norm.<br />
<br />
http://www.umkc.edu/sites/hsw/other/evolution.html<br />
<br />
Why, in spite of trends towards slimness or plumpness, are men attracted to curvaceous &quot;hourglass&quot; feminine figures, while women generally prefer broad shouldered T-shaped male physiques? Why, in nearly every culture throughout history, do threads of similarity run through the mate selection process?<br />
<br />
Cosmetic surgery. <br />
<br />
If 'thin is in' was the norm, why is cosmetic surgery and more specifically, breast implants so common and becoming MORE common?<br />
<br />
http://www.breastimplants411.com/dbii/articles.asp?Article_ID=23<br />
<br />
With this increased confidence in implant technology, more women chose to have breast enhancements in 2001 than ever before. In fact, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported that 216,754 American women underwent the procedure in 2001 compared to 32,607 in 1992.  <br />
<br />
Come with facts and not your personal preferences or &quot;observations.&quot;</div></div><hr />

They all look pretty much the same to me, at least in shape.  Seems like there is more variation in face shape in EQ now, but I have not played with the setup disk.<br />

The new Kerran are so awful its almost funny.<br />
<br />
Iks females actually look pretty good (Body is a bit thin I think, but the head is such a massive improvement over the luclin model its untrue).  Whilst Iks males have a good awful looking head that looks like they've been crossbred with a bull terrier or something.<br />
<br />
The skav... er Ratoonga look pretty decent although the fur shader needs work.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the humanoids can look pretty decent with enough fiddling imho.  Just some of the settings cap at rather extreme levels, you can practically make wood elves look like Desperate Dan from the old Dandy comics =(</div></div><hr />
