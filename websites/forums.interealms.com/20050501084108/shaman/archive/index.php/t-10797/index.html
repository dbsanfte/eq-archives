<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do people think of the idea of making a seperate forum section for all the &quot;Nerf/Rant/I H8 Sony/I H8 EQ&quot; threads?<br />
<br />
A year or so ago, this board was a great place to come and discuss playing a shaman/seek advice etc.<br />
Now every 4th thread is a &quot;We've been nurfed&quot; or &quot;We suck&quot; or &quot;I hate Sony/EQ/etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
The EQ traders tradeskill board limits all rants etc to a &quot;Primal Scream&quot; forum.<br />
<br />
I think this could be a good step towards restoring the board to what it used to be.<br />
<br />
It's not the &quot;nerfs&quot; (or &quot;bug fixes&quot;) that put me off playing a shaman. It's seeing all those threads full of nothing but &quot;omg we suck/we've been hard-done-by/etc/etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure I could chose to not read these boards (or those threads) but this could be a valid alternative and it would be nice to stop whining and get back to focusing on the &quot;Good&quot; parts of being a Shaman again.<br />
<br />
It works a treat for EQ Traders anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been over two years since this board was what you are describing in your post (Kunark release was when things really started to slide down the slippery slope of haves and have-nots) - and even then the whining got pretty shrill.  Today the Crucible is what it is - and there's still no better place for Shaman to learn their trade - or see incessant complaining about the validity of changes made to an entertainment medium.<br />
<br />
I submit that the forum you're suggesting will languish due to lack of posts - even though a majority of the posts in the general section would qualify in your new sections.  Whiners demand to be heard, not shuffled off to some backwater forum.<br />
<br />
Part of the job description of a shaman is to feel like a second class citizen (we are second best at SO many abilities).  As a result, there is a knee-jerk tendency to think you are getting screwed from every direction.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say the board would be quite full :)<br />
<br />
Part of having such a board is that moderators shift posts to their correct place (if they fit the description).<br />
<br />
As for feeling 2nd class, as a shaman I have _never_ and will never feel 2nd class.<br />
<br />
Not until the day Druids or Clerics can slow mobs and cast haste *grin*.<br />
<br />
If whining and feeling 2nd-rate is part of being a shaman, then I guess I ain't one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It really puts me off reading about people talking, that shammies, suck, we got nerfed,etc,etc,etc,etc. <br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons why I will try EQOA, to get a different prepective, from EQPC.<br />
<br />
Then after a while I'll come back...maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Toshizo, that is exactly my point.<br />
<br />
We have a separate section for those that want to vent their spleen/complain about stuff and the rest of us who are happy to get on with playing their shaman (and enjoying one of the most versatile and useful classes in EQ).<br />
<br />
It's not as bad as people make it out to be. Really!<br />
<br />
Shamans totally rock man! Don't be put off playing one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EQ traders is a very deifferent type of forum.<br />
Tradeskillers are people from all classes and all races just doing a tradeskill and seeking knowledge etc.<br />
Shamans come here amoung other things to vent about stuff they feel is unjust, to get symphaty and to get support.<br />
<br />
I think that one of the reasons you see so many of these posts is that we never seem to have a decent discussion about a chance but always get someone who post that all others are whiners, then the flamefest starts and those seeking to discuss stuff start a new topic.<br />
<br />
BTW if people really would hate SoE or the class they play they would not come here and post but they would quit. Those posting about what they feel are still very attached to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know what the big deal is. There was a big Nerf, and there was some discussion and &quot;whining&quot; about it. Isn't that what we are suppose to do? Talk about the current events of Shaman related EQ events?  To many forums is a bad idea, i like to check out the general forum, and see a nice variety of posts. Hell if you kept adding forums, what would the general forum even be for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this is what The Grey forum is for.  generally I won't move a post there unless the tone of the post changes from discussion mode to attack mode.  if you think we're slow to do so, please feel free to use the Report this post to a moderator link. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Myself, I doubt it would do any good.  I imagine at least 50% (probably actually alot higher...) of the people that come to these boards don't read/use any forum other than &quot;General&quot;...<br />
<br />
Gert</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the original poster knows that Gert, and is attempting an underhanded way of removing the posts he/she is uncomfortable with.  Very sneaky.  I'm gonna classify this entire post as a &quot;whine&quot; tho, and move it to the Grey.<br />
/nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You realize one-fourth of the threads on the current frontpage of the General Forum have been moved? I'm going to have to agree with your post awhile back Landragoran.</div></div><hr />
