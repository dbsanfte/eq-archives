<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Popped one in my warriors magelo and noticed that at level 51 it looks like an effective weapon. They go for 20k on xev, but i'd rather get a group in HoH to try and get one to drop before I drop the cash on it. Is it a random drop? Or specific mobs?<br />
<br />
~Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Windblade does indeed still drop in HoH, but it is very, very rare.<br />
I myself haven't seen one drop yet, but I got it confirmed from guildies. It drops at one of the 3 trial spots off human Mobs. Very rare though.<br />
<br />
To save you the hassle and time just buy one for 20k.<br />
But I have another suggestion for you:<br />
<br />
Buy a GsoT (Greatstaff of thunder) it owns windblade anyhow.<br />

It drops from BoT and is a very good 2h weapon for a warrior. I use it on my 56 warrior and it is awesome. Can't beat the dps/aggro.<br />
And with the recent patch change it is more common, on my server, Rallos Zek, it is already down to 3.5k (Highly underpriced imho)<br />
<br />
You can use it at 55 but it really starts to proc a lot at 56. Awesome dps and aggro. It outdamges and aggro my windblade anyday:p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The droprate on Windblades was nerfed horribly several months back.. they used to drop every couple nights if you XP'd a lot in HoH, now they drop about as rarely as a Haste Item in OS.    You would honestly be farther ahead to just work on accumulating the cash for it. It'll be faster.   If you already have the cash, spend it.<br />

Well to be honest don't buy the windblade. Go with whatever weapons you got and lvl him to 55. Spend the 20k rather on decent 1h. The Windblade is not worth it, I have it and the taunt factor just sucks. Hammer of copper striking from new nurga comes to my mind or sword of the bloodsworn. for 2h: go with the GsoT:)<br />

GSoT, don't worry, i've already had my eye on this for a while =) Problem is, my warrior is only 51 1/2. GSoT ~ 4500pp on xev, lol!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The proc from the GSoT is excellent agro too.  <br />
<br />
But, if you're not the MT/MA...that agro may not be beneficial later in the game.  Windblades are great just as DPS weapons<br />
<br />
At 51, the agro and such probably isn't an issue.  Either of those weapons would easily take you into the 60+ realm, by then, agro will be an issue for you.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Saw a GSoT on Vazaelle last night for 899pp...  Pretty crazy.  Was pretty tempted to buy it for my warrior just for the stun proc, but seems like I'm already carrying too many weapons. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Buy a GsoT (Greatstaff of thunder) it owns windblade anyhow.<br />
<br />
Not sure how a 31/30 weapon will &quot;own&quot; a 50/44 weapon...  pretty sure a Windblade would smoke a GSoT DPS-wise... the only thing goin' for the Greatstaff is the stun.  And it's quite a bit cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Poguk:<br />
<br />
Yes DPS-wise the windblade is really a tad worse than the windblade. I did some parsing as I was curious myself. and the GsoT was ahead of the WB, not much but it was.<br />
<br />
The main thing I'm so found of the GsoT is because of the iinsane fast aggro you can generate with it.<br />
<br />
But yeah DPS might be not the BEST, but its still very, very good.)<br />

The bladed staff is supposedly higher sustained DPS, the windblade will have a streakiness to it where itll be higher but itll also have a streak of being lower, basicly cause of the big delay and big hit. The bladed staff is more consistent in its DPS cause of the lower delay and more hits. <br />
<br />
So basicly what im saying is, they are both about the same with the staff edging just slightly ahead and more importantly on my server they are about 1/3 the price of a windblade. I bought one for a friend last ngiht for 9500 where as the only WB in the bazaar was 35k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm guildless and living in droga atm. Leveling the warrior as fast as possible at the named camps ( gotten 2 of those vengance II daggers so far, trying for the haste sash ). Agro doesnt mean crap to me, the warrior is my alt I use for farming essentially. I need him to have DPS. I'm sure i'll have one of all the weapons from droga by the time I leave there. Currently, the best DPS weapon I can get for him appears to be a windblade. <br />
<br />
Good point tho, the war marshals staff would be a good buy if the price is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Krakster, they drop in NW and NE corners of HoH. Normal MOBs are the undead black armors but sometimes a white-armored one will pop in their place. These rarely drop the Windblade or Girdle of Mithaniel. I'd recommend the NW top camp if it's open because it has the most black armor MOBs so better chance of a white armor popping. Basements suck unless you're stuck soloing/duoing.<br />
<br />
If you want the War Bladed Marshall's Staff, it drops fairly commonly from the Stampeding Piglet in Tactics. If you can't make a Tactics group, the piglet is soloable if you don't mind sitting on your butt waiting for the stampede.<br />
<br />
Also, sorry to hear you're no longer in Dissonance. Hope you find a new guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ground out 60 - 70 aa in various spots of hoh, saw 2 windbladesdrop in all that time. Both in temples. I'd suggest buying it if you really want one or you could be in for a very long wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On Saryrn the WB is about 25K and I've seen the WMBS for as low as 11K.  I picked one up for 15K.<br />
<br />
It is an aggro magnet.  Hydra-ing an 62 warrior I've stolen aggro just from leaving auto attack on from a 65 warrior who was wielding a windblade.  Of course, part of the fun of the Windblade is the huge smacks that scroll by.  Less reposte damage too.<br />
<br />
For a hydra, I'd get the WMBS because of the aggro and improved DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GotSandDunes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hammer of Copper Striking in a newbs hand is horrible... Damn thing can push the mob in weird unexpected ways....  Not sure if its &quot;lag&quot; on my end, but the mob can jump around during a fight.. Bad for tight combat(read dungeons)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They drop in the basements, usually off of the white spirit mobs.  Rare drop though, but if you live in HoH you will see a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I want one of those Sword of the Bloodsworn for my warrior. He needs new weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If ya don't want to be taking agro and are purely farming looking for DPS I use the Windblade, but am looking to pick up the GSoT as an agro weapon. Compared to WMBS results are noticeable for some, negligable for others, so price and asthetics play a part in that choice.. I like seeing big numbers, so use Windy, but it does look like I strapped a double-edged razorblade to a stick<br />
<br />
BTW using windy and a spiked seahorsehide belt for haste item at 58 I was stealing agro from a lvl 60 non-agro procing, dual wielding Warrior in PoS without using taunt. Windblade will keep agro fairly well if you get a chance to establish it solidly.</div></div><hr />
