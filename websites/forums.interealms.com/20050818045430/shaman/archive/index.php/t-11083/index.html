<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Allidoisslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I along with 4 other buddies are moving to a new server and we need a bit of some advice on our makeup. We currently have decided on Shaman, Cleric and Enchanter and our other 2 friends are looking at melee. Since we're going in untwinked, and completely self-reliant on our own group, we may need to cover all bases to survive. :confused: What 2 melee combination is good in our case? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would ditch the Chanter and go Paladin, Monk, Mage and Necro but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I kind of agree with the last reply.  A shaman's abilities overlap quite a bit with a cleric/chanter pair.  You may be better off ditching either the chanter or the shaman. <br />
<br />
If you're set on those three though, and the other two have to be melees, I think I'd want a combination which includes all of the following:<br />
<br />
- plate class tank<br />
- snare<br />
- FD pulling<br />
- good damage<br />
- good taunt<br />
- lockpicking<br />
- good corpse dragger<br />
<br />
SK (good plate tank + snare + FD) and  rogue (lockpicking + excellent damage + good corpse dragger) seems to work.<br />
<br />
You are missing something fairly important with this group though.  You don't have a Evaccer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go with one feign puller and a damage dealer. <br />
<br />
If your FD puller is a monk, get a damage dealer with snare (Ranger or Necro), if your puller is an SK (my preference), you have snare already so you can pick any of the high damage classes (mage, necro, ranger, monk, rogue) for the last slot and have a nicely balanced group. All else being equal, I'd go for SK and Ranger/Rogue in the last two slots. <br />
<br />
Don't worry about the people saying ditch the shaman or enchanter. You might not kill things as quickly as if you had a DPS class in one of those slots but I always liked the sheer flexibility of <br />
a cleric, enchanter and shaman. Their power to go anywhere and stand up to trains is impressive. What you loose in killing speed is made up by the fact that you don't pull singles, you pull a small trains. Not only is it more fun, but you still tend to kill things quicker since there's always a couple of mobs waiting in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well since youre starting from scratch on a new server im guessing youre doing it for fun. So go with what appeals to each of you and dont worry about having &quot;the best&quot; combination. <br />
If youre looking to remake mains on a new server and plan to powergame ( as much as possible being untwinked etc etc) then the SK damage dealer suggestion works. Or the old monk warrior standby works fine too. I guess it depends mostly on what your ambitions are , if its a for fun group as a diversion from your mains then just pick chars each of you have wanted to play but havent had a chance to. Otherwise as far as formulaic groups go a fd'er and plate tank are what youre lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Allidoisslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I kind of agree with the last reply. A shaman's abilities overlap quite a bit with a cleric/chanter pair. You may be better off ditching either the chanter or the shaman.  <br />
<br />
So there's really no point in having a Shaman and Enc in the same group? Here's my reasoning for having one based on my meager understanding. If any of this is wrong please don't hesitate and tell me it is, heh. Better to go in prepared than be misinformed. :)<br />
<br />
Enc - Crowd Control, Mana regen, debuff<br />
<br />
Sha - Stat buffs (i know this trivializes in end game but we're all going in untwinked and Im not sure how readily available +20 stat items are), much faster cast time of slow, DoTs, SoW, and haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I'd go with the SK / Rogue combo.  You have alot of utility in those 2 classes, FD, snare, high dps, ez corpse recovery.  Yea, chanter and shammy overlap a bit, but really would you rather be overprepared for absolutely anything or just manageing with what is expected.  Cleric, shammy and chanter in a party is a sure fire safe party.  In 59lvls I've only been Evaced twice, so I dont consider that very essential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Enchanters have the better haste, Even bards do better on haste alot of time now than shaman.<br />
<br />
Main reason for a shaman is slow, stat buffs and stackable hps buffs. Personally I've always liked having a shaman and enchanter in group. Makes the group really hard to kill and now a days leave the enchanter free to charm which is pretty crazy right now.<br />
<br />
Having only an enchanter means alot more work for the enchanter and not as survivable a group. Remember while an enchanter can mes, can charm and can slow they can't cast all three at the same time so when the enchanter is getting everything mesed they aren't slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get a bard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's not that there's no point in having both an enchanter and a shaman, it's just that they happen to bring some of the same things to a group.  With either a chanter or a shaman, you have both haste and slows covered.  So with both present, neither one will need to use his full array of abilities.   The shaman will handle the slows and the chanter will handle haste.<br />
<br />
With both a shaman and a chanter, you can probably handle disasters better, but when things are under control, the mobs would go down faster with a higher damage class for one of those two slots.  All depends on your play style.  You can go for redundancy/safety or you can focus on efficiency/higher-risk.  If you're trying to build a &quot;perfect&quot; group, you probably want to avoid having excessive redundancy and instead make sure you have all your bases covered.  <br />
<br />
If you go with cleric+shaman+chanter+sk+rogue, you're missing a couple of potentially useful abilities:  tracking and evac.  If you replaced the shaman with a druid, you'd get both, along with better fast damage and better backup healing.  Since the druid can snare, you now have the option of going with warrior+monk rather than SK+rogue.  <br />
<br />
If you replaced the chanter with a bard, you get tracking and a wide array of other useful abilities, especially once the bard reaches higher levels and gets the haste and mana regen songs that stack with regular spell haste and kei.  Or you could replace him with a damage class like a second rogue or a magician and get a faster kill rate or some focus items.<br />
<br />
With a chanter and a shaman you'll probably have less deaths, but your kill rate may be a bit lower than if you replaced the shaman or chanter with a damage class.  <br />
<br />
(although, a good charm-chanter probably is as good a damage class as anyone else....)<br />
<br />
It's all a bunch of tradeoffs.  Since you're asking the question, I assume you want advice regarding what the trade-offs are, rather than platitudes like &quot;play what you'll have fun with&quot;, so hopefully there's enough food for thought to help you choose your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With the 3 classes you listed I would go SK and rogue.  I would also consider switching from chanter to bard.  Unless your chanter is really good at charming the bard is going to bring more to the group.<br />
<br />
SK as your tank again because wars cant hold agro, sk can fd on pull and can snare.<br />
<br />
The reason I would go rogue over mage is again utility.  There are skill only a rogue gets (picking locks) that eventually you will want.   Both mage and rogue are high dps and a mage IMHO makes a better partner for a shaman a rogue works better for a traveling exp group.  The other option for this slot might be a wizzy.  Porting isnt as important as it used to be but evac is still quite handy.<br />
<br />
Since you are basically make a 1 group for all occasions utility of classes is the most important thing.  A war just doesnt bring enough to the table</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bard and paladin for the melees, and try to get the enc to go druid or wizard.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enapay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think you have to think about what you are wanting to do with your group.  If you are going to see how deep you can get into a dungeon or if you are just going to grind with exp.   With a group of friends that meet to play I think you will end up seeing how deep you can get into a dungeon.  With this in mind keep the chanter and you might want to find someone who can port to join you.   Its nice to stay deep in a dungeon without having to worry about fighting your way out when it is time to log.  <br />
<br />
As for melee I would go with pally/sk and a monk for the pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Allidoisslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you're trying to build a &quot;perfect&quot; group, you probably want to avoid having excessive redundancy and instead make sure you have all your bases covered.  <br />
<br />
Yes, that is exactly what we're trying to do. It's a tough task but we're going to try to cover all bases necessary to survive in any given environment (from newbie-lands all the way to higher-level romps) yet still be efficient enough to kill mobs.<br />
<br />
That said, one of my friends mentioned Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, SK, and Monk/Rogue or Beastlord combination. I hate to give up the Shaman though. Love the bear. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Falmorn Hawkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since you're moving to a new server, you will probably have some open character spots - why not make an alt or two to play with?  Yes, it chews up even more time leveling up an alt, but it'll give your friends a definite feel for what they enjoy playing, as well as a heads up about what classes work well together.<br />
<br />
From personal experience, a shaman and a necro duo'ing can prod serious buttock.  :D   Add in a couple of melee-types and another healer-type, and you can pretty much own.  I confess to a certain fondness for SK's (my RL wife has 3 SK alts she plays when she's feeling anti-social) and monks, but I've had *very* good experiences with both.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Train together, fight together.  If you know what you're doing, you can chain pull in a place like DL or OT with very little loss of health or mana.  Play with some of the suggested combinations, see what works best for you.<br />
<br />
Just a simple shamans suggestions,<br />
Falmorn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see no problems with Chanter, Shaman and Cleric.  I personally would have SK and Rogue.  SK can build huge aggro, a rogue would never see the face of a mob.  You wouldn't be the fastest killers in the world, but in the long haul, you'd be very very steady and consistant.  Once you've all reached the 60+ game you'd be huge.  Chanter with charm (with shaman watching chanters health).  Cleric healing SK tank, rogue tearing mobs to shreds.  SK dumping mana on group.  You'd be pretty huge : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">to those who say shaman and chanter are redundant.... pfft.<br />
<br />
Taking the chanter off slow duties allows him to do one thing very well.<br />
<br />
Charm.<br />
<br />
It adds up, in a hurry, even at lower levels, and once you get into PoP... fuhgetabudit.<br />
<br />
I'd want a Druid... almost instead of the cleric. healing, evac, and snare - yes, SK/Nec snare is nice, but not nearly as nice as the 10 minute long ensnare - and you can't forget charming animals!<br />
<br />
Evac is a wonderful thing too. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If last 2 need to be melee, I'd go with SK/Ranger or SK/Other.. just keep the SK for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">shaman , cleric , enchanter , sk , rogue . <br />
was i think the best combo so far . <br />
last spot can be taken/filled by anything , from caster to fighter .<br />
you're missing out on the evacs , no big deal i think . <br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Interesting that no one thinks you need a warrior.<br />
<br />
I'd say SK (FD puller, MA on low damage mobs) and warrior (MA on high damage mobs).<br />
<br />
Stick with the chanter - these days if you need a high damage dealer get him to charm something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Chanter.<br />
<br />
 Already have heals and buffs with cleric, sounds as though just want shaman for slows. Chanter king of CC period, good slows and good haste, and mana regen is always nice.<br />
<br />
Can add good damage with pet if know how to handle it, especially with new mez rules.<br />
<br />
If didnt have a cleric would say shaman all the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree, with an enchanter there, I would exchange the shaman with a druid, ports are still handy, good backup healing, damage shield, evac, snare and tracking.  Enchanter covers everything a shaman can do and has the added bonus of charming.  Then I would probably make the 2 melee a pally (they tank/hold agro unbelievably well with stuns and you have cc covered already with the chanter) and a rogue.  Pally, Rogue, Chanter, Cleric, Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Shaman, Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk.<br />
<br />
That's balanced. And if someone takes the night off (well, except the shaman), you still have a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Shaman: Buffs and slows are gonna make the trip to 50+ much easier.<br />
Paladin: Plate class tank with suberb aggro control and many useful utility spells including rez (albiet gimped a bit).<br />
Druid: Gotta have snare and evac. Decent nukes at the lower levels plus ports for those still difficult to reach zones like Katta and some of the Velious zones.<br />
Monk: FD puller + damage.<br />
Fifth slot: I would opt for some type of DPS here. A wiz would usually be my first choice but there would be some overlap with druid so perhaps a rogue would be a better choice since it would be able to lockpick as well.<br />
<br />
Man I wish I could have a group like that together on a regular basis, would be a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I still like the bard in place of chanter. <br />
Can mez, charm, track, travel songs, lull, haste, mana , snare, and even enchance your parties nukes. Not to mention a myriad of other things.<br />
Throw in some AA and they become even better damage dealers and pullers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you have a shaman in the group I think you may have better luck swapping a bard for the chanter.<br />
<br />
In my groups when my shaman is slowing our chanter tends to get a bit bored unless we are overpulling like crazy to give him something to do.<br />
<br />
With the recent changes to bards charm and improved mez line a good bard can lock 3 mobs down pretty constistantly if needed. This combined with their swiss army knife series of abilities makes them awsome in a small group situation. They also get very good mana recovery abilities that stack with kei. With a bard in your group and kei from your local nexus vendor your mana bars will always be full.<br />

This party can go anywhere, do anything - they are the A Team of EQ (you can argue amongst yourselves about who gets to be BA! &quot;Ah pity the poor foo Orc!&quot;)<br />
<br />
For sheer killing power, my 5 would be:<br />
<br />
Cleric; Shadowknight; Rogue; Wizard; Mage<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For independance on a new server then I like<br />
<br />
shaman, chanter, cleric, sk, rogue.<br />
<br />
This group has a wide array of skills but is lacking DPS and evack.  This is a very safe group but will be a little slow to level.  It will allow you to go a lot of places thow.<br />
<br />
I would pick a Wizard to be the 6th for the massive short duration DPS, evack and porting (including old world plains).<br />
<br />
The SK may have a lot of jobs to do depending on the zone you are working in....  Your group will slow down quite a bit if he must both pull singles and MA, but most of the time I would expect the shaman to pull for this group....  small trains.  Your DPS will be lacking and I would never want either the SK or the Rogue to stop slashing and stabing.  Any time you are grinding I would try and fill the extra slot with more DPS.</div></div><hr />
