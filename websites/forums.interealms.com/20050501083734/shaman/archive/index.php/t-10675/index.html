<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi! <br />
<br />
Just wondering what kind of focus item you Shaman use to increase the damage done by our DoT's? Personaly I am most intrested in items for lvl49 spells to lvl 60. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe. Kind of a fun question. They just nerfed the focus items but they still work fine with DOTs.<br />
<br />
You should look for the Affliction focus items. Affliction Haste speeds up casting time 33%.  Extended Affliction makes your DOT last 20% longer. Afflicition Efficiency reduces the mana cost by 25%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I rarely DoT :p<br />
<br />
Waste of mana and doesn't do much in a grind group and raid when there is enough DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lenaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi again!<br />
<br />
I appriciate your point Wisey but I am a total NooB compared to you.  Only Lvl 45 at this stage and use my DoT's frequently. <br />
<br />
So it looks like I need an item with Extended Afflication III and Afflication Efficiency III. I know I only need it from 49 but I like to plan ahead.<br />
<br />
Tips on where items drop or what to buy would be great. Hints on web sites that give opption to search items after focus effect would alson be appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From a personal perspective:<br />
<br />
At those levels I only used DoTs when solo (still do). I also never used disease DoTs at those levels. This means that the only focus effect I would have considered usefull would be the Efficiency to save mana. That one is pretty good though. BUT it is not easy to get one. Found these three on Allakhazam:<br />
<br />
Focus items (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?classes=0&amp;race=0&amp;type=Any+Slot&amp;effect=2365&amp;fzone=0&amp;smod=0&amp;stat1=None&amp;statlim1=0&amp;stat2=None&amp;statlim2=0&amp;stat3=None&amp;statlim3=0&amp;pristat=ac&amp;priwt=2&amp;secstat=hp&amp;secwt=1&amp;tristat=none&amp;triwt=0&amp;level=&amp;price=&amp;qt=b&amp;st=) <br />
<br />
Only one is 'attaniable'(sp?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dots are actually pretty useful before 60th lvl, they don't cause all that much agro and do nice/quick damage (at least for the poison line). <br />
You need affliction 3 items for lvl 49-60 spells, Coldain Military Wristguard is the obvious one because it's an easy quest and increases the duration (damage) of your dots.</div></div><hr />
