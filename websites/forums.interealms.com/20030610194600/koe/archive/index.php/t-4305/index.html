<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So once again, Ubisoft messed up and the Euro release for Luclin is delayed. I've managed to download the files for SOL, but I still need an account key - I've preordered one, but that won't arrive till Friday at the earliest.<br />
<br />
So, what I am asking is...is anyone buying 2 copies of SOL anyway and can you wait a few days with getting the 2nd one active? If so, please help me out by letting me have a cd key - as soon as my copy arrives, I'll email you that cd key in return.<br />
<br />
From the patch: &quot;As fellow gamers, we envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and waiting to be solved. Except of course those of you who don't live in the US, you are, in fact, SOL.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's hoping :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: Do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and download the rest of the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will not impact our other customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have your CD to do so<br />
