<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am desperate for a few attempts at a Nightmare bow and only need the Innovative cams (freind picked up the PoN components for 3 attempts for me off of a guildy that was about to dump it on a vendor)...<br />
<br />
With that in mind, whats the lowest lvl group that could reliably do some killing in PoI? I ported in there last week and watched a group of 55-57s while I foraged by the port-out (got 4 lots of grease :D) but I don't have a load of 55-57s to back me up (I can get 51 and 52s tho). Also no-one was selling their bolts/cams, I guess they are giving them to a guild tinkerer to make the cams which sell for a rip-off 2K EACH on the Luclin server :(<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

Set up camp and pull to the gy where you zone in.Do not go in any further than that.Pull from the left ,mobs are spaced out a little bit more on that side.Archaics cant be slowed/rooted/snared blah blah.If you get one of them you will have to zone most likely.<br />
<br />
Not sure of drop rate cause I never pay too much attention to loot but I do remember groupmates saying that they had stuff to give to tinkers after awhile.<br />
<br />
hope some of this helped.<br />
<br />
I should probbly mention though,that camping in the gy can be considered poor manners.Seen quite a few people pop up from a rezz and get low health agro from a mob some group was killing and die again.Also if you cant get single pulls constant trains to gy will umm annoy people to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1 cleric and enough space to Kite :p<br />
<br />
I duo there with my shaman and ranger np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you stay at the zone and warn those around you might zone out sometimes it's not bad. A good tank will be your key I think. I mean at 60 i ghetto gear I've tanked there with a 55 shaman as the only healer in a 4 person group.<br />
<br />
If you had tank of 57+ (and to pull) and a competent well balanced group of 55ish you'd be ok at the zone in and could get your drops there with patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ralence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can often find the parts for sale on &quot;certain&quot; popular vendors.<br />
<br />
  The one's in the large building in PoT which contains the zone in/out and the bank has vendors in the wing closest to PoN zone in.<br />
<br />
  The two closes to the Nexus and PoT portals in PoK are very popular as well, not to mention the vendors in bazaar, as well as the ones close to bazaar and the bank in SH.<br />
<br />
  I've actually purchased a lot more from vendors than I've seen drop.<br />
<br />
 Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gryfalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, Juneau has heard about me soloing in PoI methinks..;-)<br />
<br />
Yes, clerics, druids, wizards, etc can solo there, but probably require<br />
level 60+ or very exceptional gear.  But the drops you are looking for<br />
aren't that rare, really.  I give them all to a tinker friend of mine.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Set up camp and pull to the gy where you zone in.Do not go in any further than that.<br />
<br />
Ugh.  Please people, have some sense and DO NOT camp the zone ins.  Remember, these are also the graveyards where naked, just-rezed people will be clammering to get their items back.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want PoI to be easy, get:<br />
<br />
58+ Plate tank<br />
Cleric<br />
Chanter<br />
Shaman<br />
2 x damage dealer<br />
<br />
You can own the whole outer area with that group.  But I have done it with way weirder groups.  Like last night<br />
<br />
61 Ranger MT (hey Fadetree nice train :))<br />
59 Ranger (me)<br />
57 Ranger<br />
58 Rogue<br />
59 Cleric<br />
59 Shaman<br />
<br />
We crawled the whole outer ring.  Talk about ghetto mezzing heh.  Handled up to 3 adds with no real issues.  Fade took a dirt nap, but hes kinda soft.  Har har!<br />
<br />
Anyway, a good tank and healer is a must, CC and slowing are huge.  If yer smart, you can do it with 3 out of 4 of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">(brief hijack)<br />
How about this for a weird group:<br />
4 Endless Quiver Rangers<br />
2 Enchanters<br />
Killing lvl 62-63 Razorfiends in PoV<br />
Chanters root and dot<br />
Rangers shoot arrows.<br />
<br />
Anyways. Vendors to check for stuff:<br />
The fishing stuff merchant in the room near the PoN zonein in PoT.<br />
The one vendor in the Bank room in PoT<br />
All the vendors around the building in the merchant section of PoK nearest the nexus/PoT ports. (3 on each side, 6 in the back, 2 in the middle, 2 in rooms)<br />
All the merchants in the library (!) (found all sorts of odd stuff there, including 2 pristine emeralds(w-t-h?))<br />
Thurg bank (still a popular place).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been finding more Blue Diamonds than Innovative parts on vendors the last few days. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RoddoTorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On Torv the graveyard is always camped, Rarely if ever zone in and not see a group there. All you really need for sure is a slower 55 and up, a mid 50's tank, or even a 60ish ranger, a cleric or a complete heal druid or shammy, if no cheal then 2 druids/shammys mid 50's and fill in the rest. I was in agroup with a chanter, myself(56 druid) 3 pallies and a shammy (57) and we rocked. Had cc, healin out the wazoo and plenty of dps. You'll see plenty of ghetto groups, but really want to minimize the number of people under 54. I've also groupe dhere with my 52 ranger, and even tanked in a pinch when MT went down. The mob was of course slowed, but even with gimp druid/shammy 600 hp heals wasn't bad at all. Good luck with finding groups, and remember to constantly forage grease while your their, makes you money and minimizes the wasted time lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>madmerc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">do it almost every night solo or with my 58 ranger friend geta 58 shammy and your set.</div></div><hr />
