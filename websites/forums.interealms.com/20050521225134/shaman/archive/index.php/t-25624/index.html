<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crazysmurf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just recently got level 68 which was my goal to get to before I AA'd.  My question is with all the new oow, and GoD AAs do you think the old standards such as canni 5 and defensive AAs are the primary goal.  Or do you think AAs such as the HoT crits and Ancestral Aid are more important.  Any advice would be nice and appreciated.  Thank you kind shammys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say stick to what has proven effective, Canni5, mgb if you raid, ND, LR etc.<br />
<br />
Imo most of the GoD/OoW AAs are just toys, and not really any type of &quot;class defining&quot; ability</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;The Oldies&quot; are always going to be must-haves in my book. They're effective, solid purchases. When you hit 70, Spiritual Channeling (which ranks right up there with Canni 5) and Call of the Wild should become priorities, IMO.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd definitely start out with the &quot;standard&quot; AA route for Shaman, working your way up to Canni 5:<br />
<br />
1. Run 3<br />
2. Either Innate Regeneration 3 or Innate Metabolism 3<br />
3. Mental Clarity 3<br />
4. Canni 5<br />
<br />
I've seen it argued that Regen is better or worse than the Metabolism, but at only 1 point each I don't think it's all that critical (not as fast as AAs can flow these days!)  Pick whichever works best for you (Regen is nice if you Canni a lot, but not critical with Quiesence, etc., Metabolism's really only important if you use stat foods)<br />
<br />
Then I'd work on Spell Casting Mastery and Spell Casting Reinforcement (and the Mastery upgrade to it).  One will reduce the mana cost of your spells by up to 10%, the second increases buff durations (especially your heal over time spells) by up to 50%.  With SCRM, Quiesence costs a little over 300 mana and heals for 2500 HPs on average (sometimes more if you are lucky with the timing).<br />
<br />
Beyond that it depends on your play style.  MGB's pretty much a necessity if you raid.  Healing Adept and Healing Gift are pretty important if you help with healing.  Radiant Cure is great for cleansing many detrimental effects.  Virulent Paralysis can be a lifesaver, rooting and knocking the mob back. The defensive AAs are great, especially if you solo or tend to grab aggro quite often.<br />
<br />
As for Omens AAs, Call of the Wild (AA Rez) can be handy if your party's only rezzer dies.  Spiritual Channeliung sounds rather interesting, though I'm going to work on some other AAs before I worry about that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd throw scs3 in there with the &quot;new&quot; AAs you should get.  Greatly enhances your survival with sub-optimal aggro tanks.<br />
My list right now would be<br />
can5<br />
nd3, lr5<br />
scs3<br />
scm<br />
scrm<br />
HA3, HG3<br />
RC3<br />
SC<br />
CotW<br />
VP3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">level 70 for Call of the Wild, captain.  And yeah, Canni5 &amp; tanking aa's are where it's at.  People don't talk about it so much anymore, just because it's taken for granted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would throw RC 1 in there pretty early - it's a super cheap AA for the first level and the first level is pretty darn handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the older AA's are still 'the cake'.  New stuff is just icing, for the most part.  If you raid, there are a few 'must have's, like the mgb'able HoT, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dont forget Planar Power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Planar Power is quite far down the list of aa's to get, imo.  It's a fine thing to get, but aa's that actually DO something have to come first, ne?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gates - none are important.<br />
Omens - get Mnemonic Retention (55), Ancestral Aid 1 (67), Call of the Wild (70), Spiritual Channeling (70)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spell Casting Subtlety is rather important imo.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy run 5. it never fades. but it is hardly a &quot;must have&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">DoT crits are great for making more AA, faster, if you solo for exp a fair amount.<br />
<br />
A personal favorite of mine is Quickened Curing with RC3+ for raids.  It helps keep my groups all scrubbed clean in the bad places of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Herger_Athach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have checked through various AA posts over the past few months, trying to figure out what course to run in terms of AAs. Although I still have some tweaking to do, I am grateful for the info you all have provided. It is very helpful to the undecided. Thanks to you all!!</div></div><hr />

I wish they would make a &quot;Quickened VP&quot; AA. I absolutely LOVE VP. Its wonderful soloing, grouping in most places, and even useful on raids (bounce the adds off the clerics, or play ping-pong with the other shaman when bored).</div></div><hr />
