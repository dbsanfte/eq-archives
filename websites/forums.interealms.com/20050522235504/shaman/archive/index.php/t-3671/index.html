<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this link in a thread over at the Necro Board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hahaha pathetic ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wot, so is this for real, the spawn time and qeue stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, its a fairly accurate description of the Rage situation on many servers (those with lists).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The list on Rodcet is estimated to be about THREE YEARS long.<br />
<br />
IMO it ain't gonna last that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FFA on Fennin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe Verant will now wake up and smell the roses and realize that their &quot;social&quot; experiment is gone horribly wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Luclin was the first server to come up with a viable Ragefire list, because of the posts about it on the cleric boards, a lot of other servers have adopted it.<br />
<br />
Works best when the clerics enforce it across the board, regardless of guild-lines-in-the-sand that governs most contested spawns.<br />
<br />
It has gotten crazily too big now...VI really needs to make a spawnable rage who just drops the epic widget, and no naggy gear (ALA the spawned faydedar for dr00ds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Omg.. that's so sad :(<br />
<br />
Edit: we camped Ragefire for 6 days.. I had to wake up at 6am 'cause I was on the dawn patrol :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still don't understand the &quot;list&quot; in EQ.  The guilds that can summon the forces to squish RF in a heartbeat don't follow any lists, while those that need hours to get people on for an attempt do.  A tad pointless IMO.<br />
<br />
Verant just needs to change SF to SZ or figure some order into the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh, maybe this will give Verant's a head up.  I mean, if you were a non EQer and read that news article, would you want to play the game?  <br />
<br />
Bad publicity that hits Verant in the wallet is 100 times more effective than any player petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Echoing what Gloriana said. Between the Shawn Woolery episode and this little tidbit - EQ is going to get a bad reputation along the lines of old D &amp; D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm still trying to figure out why they moved it from Sol B to Skyfire.  <br />
<br />
Amazingly it's even more of a pain in the ass now than it was before.</div></div><hr />
