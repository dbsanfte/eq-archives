Makes me proud to be a shaman laddie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I see a lot of Shaman in the &quot;last ones standing&quot; portion of those posts. :)<br />
<br />
/grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah I noticed a long time ago that I tend to be the last man standing on wipes . . . or the first down depending on how the debuffing process went haha!<br />
<br />
 As all the melee started dropping one shaman waded in with rabid bear and chopped off around 2k of AOW hps before falling. <br />
<br />
****in A!  Half a yellow and I'm gonna train Rabid Bear!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and just to rub salt on our scaley brethren . . .<br />
<br />
 Gozzrem in the west wing of ToV. We were down to about 6-8 OOM casters all meleeing and a shaman got the kill with a jaundiced bone bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow!<br />
<br />
Well, if i ever get enough AA points to get Rabid Bear, i deffinately will :)<br />
<br />
I bet he was using an Uber 2hb though, to achieve that kinda damage, my 2hb skill is only 93, and goin up slooow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get hold of 'A shovel' from Chardok. Drops from the lowbie slaves. Stats are 4/20 IIRC. Great for upping 2h blunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or grab an 'Abandoned Orc Shovel' 4/27 from a tent in Lake Rathetear</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or he could have just ice-striked it for more damage in less time and not used rabid bear....shrug...AoW is easy to nuke. To do 2000pts damage even with Rabid bear would take 40secs or longer. I think this was slightly exaggerated.<br />
<br />
BTW, if he WAS able to do 2000pts of damage before dying, that means ALOT of melee were still up  to act as speed bumps before the shaman was hit. He sure as heck wasn't tanking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I forget if the shaman was me or Damman (probably Damman), but pretty sure we were all oom by that point.  A guy from another guild had logged in a level 1 ogre mule and destroyed all of our mod rods, so all the shm/dru had to spam heal the main tank too, as clerics were low.<br />
<br />
Believe the actual ending stats were 1 mag, 2 clr, and one enchanter (whose pet had died by that point).<br />
<br />
And no, the clerics and druids were acting as speedbumbs at that point, not melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do you know what guild that was?<br />
<br />
Pardon my french, but what the ****<br />
<br />
You show'd them atleast, killin AoW anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have suspicions, but that's not what this thread is about, only mentioned it to explain why nuking wasn't feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, yeah i know its not what its about, thats just a really ****ty thing for that guild to do, and i have no tolerance for that crap.<br />
<br />
If it was up to me, the entire guild would be banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speaking of suspicions how well do shammy ice nukes land on white(cold immune,  for all intents and purposes) dragons? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As far as I know, cold lands rather well on Gozz, even though he is a white dragon.  Exception to every rule I guess  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK so I pressed the button and trained Rabid Bear last night.  I gated to PoM after the group I was in was done and decided to test it out.  I attacked a halfling NPC in the arena where the god puppets spawn.  Pulled with slow, hit the hotkey, and started swingin with my SoF (piercing only melee skill maxed).  I did some decent dmg it seemed.  A lot less whiffing, but still whiffed at least half the time.  I also had a ranger attack buff that pushed my attack to 1313.  Double attack was present and was definitely kewl.  Only problem was . . . this dam NPC I attacked was pretty high level.  No way to know HOW high level but it hit hard and summoned.  I ended up spending half the time in Torpor.  I guess this was a bad test mob all the way around since it had a bazillion hps as well.  I kept it epiced (epic wore off 4 times) and meleed to the duration of rabid bear (5 min.) but didn't do more than a third of the damage to it.  Disappointing I guess.  It must have had an easy 32k hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, that was my bear corpse going for kill shot. 39 dam weap can put out better than my lovebracer. Don't get me wrong, Ice Strike is still win.<br />

<br />
hmm, .jpg format totally ruined that blue color~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, that AoW kill was very entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmmm, wonder if Rabid Bear and VoB stack?  it might be entertaining to see how quickly we can whiff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those mobs in PoM you're referring to are the halfling audience.  Double in 190s, all level 55, around 20k hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rabid bear and VoB do appear to stack fine, doesnt seem to make much of a difference to my atk though =(</div></div><hr />
