<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rootrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all. I'm looking for some advice on a duo spot for myself, a 52 shaman, and a 52 magician. We play together, roommates and are currently working AA. Magician is epic'd, my shaman is not. We are both well-equipped, bazaar equipped actually. Any and all advice is taken as law, great boards, great people. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dulaks harbor boats are great.  i soloed my shm in this zone to 56.  i currently have a 54 nec with my wifes 55 mag in this zone.  just slow with shm, use earth pet to root and have mag blast once or twice per mob.  you should be able to clear storm or lady di at your lvl.  when you get better move to dando or the armory.  exp is good and you should be able to get single pulls endlessly.  a jbb on shm will make things even eisier for you.</div></div><hr />

  Thanks, appreciate the reply, now have a 52 paladin joining us as well, and going to try dulak boats as well as sebilis, no jbb though, =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been playing on the boats reciently with me (52 mage) and my friend (41 shaman). Together we are having no problem at all clearing Lady D and when that is occupied we can clear about 3/4 of Dandolak's Run before respawn. With your crew I'd start with Dandolak's run and give Oceancrasher a try once ya got comfortable. The mage is a huge help on the boats. You'll want a bunch of the 10 slot weightless packs for the weapons that drop. The real trick to the boats is reclaim chaining with the mage. Have the mage bring 5-10 stacks of malachite, he can't bring too much and the fun will really slow down when he runs out. Let the pet tank the mobs, with slow the earth pet usualy ends the fight at about 20% health or so on the Lady D(no nuking needed); occasionaly I'd have to hit the pet with a heal to get him through the fight on Dandolak. Use one of the old focus items to reclaim the pet and resummon after each mob, total mana cost of about 30 mana each mob (plus malX if you want to use it, I found it to be worthwhile) and the cost of the slow for the shaman. You can kill mobs nonstop with no downtime like this here. The boats drop higher priced gems the tougher they get. The best I saw on the Lady D was saphires, got a diamond once on Dandolak's Run and a higher drop rate for the lesser gems. While we were on Dandolak's Run we got the Captain to spawn. He droped the Rust Encrusted Leggings which went straight to the Shaman. :) The boats are really a lot of fun, highly recomended, but I'm afraid the place is going to get a bit more crowded when the port stones go in next patch. Oh, by the way, this is with totaly nontwinked gear (primary characters on Stromm, hehe still wearing dusty burlap in two slots on the mage).</div></div><hr />
