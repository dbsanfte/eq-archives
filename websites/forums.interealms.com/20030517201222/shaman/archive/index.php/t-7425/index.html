<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hunnybumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I looked around a bit on here but couldn't find any details on this little froggy.  My husband and I are working on the canni 2 quest, we obtained the 3 other items rather easily (55 druid &amp; 46 shammy) but we spent well over an hour searching in TT for the Yun Shammys.  I have looked around other boards and it seems like most people just get in the zone, track, kill and they get the powder.  Well with a 55 druids track we run around TT for over an hour and none on track.  Is there a specific spot they spawn?  Place Holders? Any info would help.  Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Yun Shamans tend to hang out in the south part of the zone, I think. Whenever I have seen them, they have been near the large arched bridge type thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes check in the east, that's where they are.  It's a huge zone so druid  track won't see them unless you're close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And yes, they are very frustrating to find w/o a good tracker, so do yourself a favor and bring a ranger along =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Camp the giant fort in FV, they wander up.  I got like 4 or 5 frogs an hour camping it.  They became an annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Camp the giant fort in FV, they wander up <br />
<br />
NO.  You need the Yun Shaman powder from Trak's Teeth.<br />
The FV frogs drop the wrong powder.  To make sure you have the right stuff, use a silvery mask and identify (or get a friend to cast it on you w/ the powder in hand) it.  The FV powder from Froglok shaman identifies as something else.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ranger, ranger, ranger.<br />
<br />
Druids are sweet and nice, but they're blind compared to rangers. Bards are even worse. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your powder! Canni II was great at 44, it really kicked butt until Canni III. I cannot recommend getting this spell enough - just for the less amount of mouse clicks. The earlier you get it, the more it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I found Yun shaman on two different trips by starting at the arch leading into the ruins town above Seb.  Head straight West (away from the ruins town) a ways into the zone.  You will be jumped by frogs, and that is where I found em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done the quest about 10 times. Yun Shamans hop around southeast of the lake. Sometimes I find one right away, other times it might take 20 minutes, not using a tracker.  They drop a powder every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hunnybumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the info guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tensor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Isn't the powder different color too? There is white yun powder and black yun powder.  Can't remember which one it actually is that you need though :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yun shaman are most definately located near the 'aquaduct'.  There are more then one, I've seen as many as 3 on my Druidbot : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ARGH I hate this little bugger.  I been looking for him with my 51 Shaman for the better part of 3 days straight.  I always hire a ranger or druid to help me track them.  Right now I am almost out of cash from hiring trackers unsuccessfully.  The Yun Shamans are mocking me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Froglok Yun Shamans are in the area of (-2000, 0), south of the aqueduct. They drop the powder and it is black.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I gave up on the quest.  I spent over 3 days there and not one Yun Shaman ever spawned (Even had a 56 Ranger :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The powder isn't nodrop so check the bazaar, or ask around ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something I didn't see mentioned, as I did this part last night I will tell you my tale :)<br />
<br />
Ran around for 3+ hours no luck, actually heard one casting a spell once, then couldn't find it.  A friend let me use his mid-40s Druid and I found one West of the lake near the raised road.  The Yun in question was taking a lickin from two sabertooths.  That would explain why they are so rare.  Much like the Heritic Invaders in Stormbrunt, these buggers are KoS so don't last too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I finally found a Yun Shaman in the south central part of the zone after I had been weeding sabertooths for about 30 mins.  Even so he was locked in a battle with a sabertooth when I found him.  Nuked the sabertooth, killed the Yun and got my powder.<br />
<br />
Initially I weeded frogs and this was not the way to go.  Kill the sabertooths and you'll get your powder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giden Grooverider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I searched in the area from north / south n1000 to n2000 and east / west p1000 to n1000.   Kill the tigers and the Trakaraptors, they both like to kill the frogs as they spawn.   Kill the things that eat the frogs and you'll have a better chance of getting your power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The problem is that the frogloks now aggro every mob, which causes the Yun to become extinct. It didn't used to be this way, Verant changed something, probably around the release of PoP. Obviously this change is for the worse.<br />
<br />
I went to get another powder recently, and ended up killing every mob in that area of the zone in an attempt to get a Yun to spawn. And when I finally found one, he was already fighting something else.<br />
<br />
Seems to be the same condition in the northwest part of the zone too, except the frogs there are winning. Try running through, and they'll swarm ya.</div></div><hr />
