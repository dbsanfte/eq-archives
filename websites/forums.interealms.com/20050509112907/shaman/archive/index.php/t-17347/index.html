<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The next, and perhaps the last expansion, will be comming out suposedly early next year.   What kind of things (spells) would you like to have, just our of curiosity.  Lets keep it realistic.<br />
<br />
I would like......<br />
<br />
1) Group Quiescence (almost made it live in LDON expansion)<br />
2) A 5 tick dot that is hard to resist, which agros the same as a DD spell that puts out the same dmg.<br />
3) An upgrade to our pet only buff.<br />
4) An item that can summon weapons for our pet.<br />
<br />
Thats about it, I would be pushing it if I asked for anything more.  I would also be TOTALLY satisfied with only this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Something for PVP would be nice like a hard to resist dot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something to define our slow prowess a little more now that beasties are quite good at slowing. Not sure if this would unbalance stuff but still its a nice thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Tgb Shrink<br />
2. Higher Disease Slow, maybe 55%<br />
3. Disease Nuke<br />
4. AA's that either lower the refresh of Canni5 or increase the output exponentially i.e. 1600 mana for 2785 hps.<br />
5. Buff that eats a detrimental effect or two.<br />
6. Group Ferine Avatar &lt;&lt; this would make you up dps on all the melee for raids as much as they currently &quot;think&quot; you can actually do with a single FA.  I would definitely MGB this...we generally have 4+ shamans on our raids anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AA's:<br />
<br />
Hastened cannibalization AA.<br />
DoT damage increase AA's.<br />
Completely revamp of Rabid Bear, make it a 3/6/9 skill.<br />
AA to decrease resists on your specialization line spells.<br />
Group heal AA, similar to what the other two priests get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
New dot that doesn't suck.  Low resist, decent damage, no stupid recast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
General Stuff:<br />
<br />
Make slow important again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1.  Out of group shrink (allow you to shrink anyone in the raid, not just group)<br />
2.  Rabid Bear form not suck.  Unfortunately the best thing about Rabid Bear is 50 CR buff.  Make Rabid Bear give +50 weapon skills and 200 double attack instead of the crappy other stuff it does now.  Make it give the shaman merely the melee abilities of a knight for the duration.  Let it stack with Avatar.<br />
3.  Hastened Cannibalization would be nice, but we really don't need it.<br />
4.  Doing something to make Dots better with an AA would be nice.<br />
<br />
We really don't need anything more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3. Hastened Cannibalization would be nice, but we really don't need it.<br />
<br />
I suppose if you have lived this long without it, you could live on without it as well, but it would help a lot.<br />
And we need canni5 just to actually have mana to cast our overcostly spells.  We are the jack of all trades class, but with our variety comes inefficient spells (compared to other spells from other classes that do similar effects) sans Torpor/Q.  I don't know about what other shamans do, but on raids after buffing/debuffing is done, I might dis dot and either chain rains or rain plus one other type of nuke (if we have sufficient spot healers present), while keeping 45% mana for emergency healing and res buffing depending on the situation.<br />
  <br />
Canni4 by itself is good yes, but if you are using that during a fight then you aren't contributing to the fight at hand, this is especially important in PoP+ encounters and not everyone has ultra preservation yet.  This isn't even half as important outside of raiding though.<br />
Even cutting out 30 seconds from the timer would be a vast improvement.<br />
<br />
Make slow important again<br />
That's why I suggested a 55% disease slow...since you know they won't give shamans a magic based slow that is above what we currently have, may as well boost our harder to resist slow, and only slow that can land on specific mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mortwuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.  Bash...yes bash.  I am still pissed that a 2 foot tall halfling cleric can out bash my gigantic Ogre...it's sick and it's wrong.<br />
<br />
2.  Upgrade our Disease based Slows to 55%<br />
<br />
3.  fix/replace rabid bear with...anything please.<br />
<br />
4.  a LONG lasting haste buff...something about twice what we currently have...I'm not concerned that it be SLTW speed...just make it last longer natively so we can stick it on and leave it for a decent amount of time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1. I already love Talisman of Alacrity. That spell has been a long time coming. Lasts about 50 min with my extensions (lasts about as long as an adventure). Maybe lower level versions of it for the younger shams. I really couldn't ask for a more longer lasting haste spell unless it is for the youngin's. <br />
<br />
2. An upgraded cann spell. I know we have cann 5, but man in between those cann 5 times or when I am recovering from a death a new cann spell would be so welcome. An upgraded cann 4 is what I am asking for. Just can't believe we didn't get one with PoP. I mean SKs and Necros got upgraded conversion spells, why not us?<br />
<br />
C. OMG yes bash!<br />
<br />
4. Dont need upgraded disease slow. I don't use it all that much as it is. I would love a slow that was 80%. Then I would feel uber again.<br />
<br />
5. If you won't give me cann 6 (lol) then yes, hastened cannabilization pretty please. 5, 10, 15% time reduction?<br />
<br />
6. Effect on ornate and elemental gloves changed to ice nuke.<br />
<br />
I think that's about all I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I second the Group Quiescence idea. Druids and clerics and even beastlords have a group heal over time.<br />
<br />
Out of group shrink would be nice. I wish they would simpy add a confirm box to the thing already, like they did with TL! Then add an AE shrink spell, like Teleport. They did it for wizards, how hard can it be? :)<br />
<br />
I like that we have a new magic based dot line, but it would be nice to have a line of dots with resist modifiers. I guess the reason we don't is because we can already lower resists, but that benefits everyone else too. The other dotting classes both have resist modifiers on their post 60 dots. Druids get a -100 magic line and -50 fire dot, necros have -200 magic, -50 poison and -50 disease dots, and both classes have their new LDoN dot with -30 magic. Both classes have some resist debuffs also. Our debuffs will help both these classes as well as ourselves and our best debuff only lowers resists by -70 anyway. For raids, they'll have the benefits of our resist debuffs, for groups, well most of the time there isn't time to malos *and* dot anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't know about disease slow being 55% - if this was done, more things would probably just be made very disease resistant anyway. I like the fact that we get a disease slow at all, something no other class has.<br />
<br />
And finally, an upgrade to Turgur's: <br />
Here's some ideas for a suggested higher level upgrade to Turgur's, which don't include making it a higher percentage slow:<br />
- Faster cast time (beastlords one is faster, due to their innate hybrid casting haste)<br />
- Faster recast time<br />
- A resist modifier. Even something modest like -20 would not be overpowering on raids, but would be nice in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Note, it's just ideas, I wouldn't expect a new spell to have all of them, and let's face it, we all know we won't actually get any of them. We might complain about our best spell being a level 51 spell, but feel for the poor clerics - their best spell is a level 39 one!<br />
<br />
Overall, though, I still like the shaman class. I think we were overpowered before PoP, but at that point it didn't really matter so much because mobs didn't hit as hard, slow was nice but not essential. With PoP, slow became essential, but shamans lost power relative to other classes, so I don't think we are overpowered any more. Our damage dealing and healing has slipped in comparison to other classes, along with spell mana cost rising because our mana regen is so good. It would be easy to get bitter about it, but we're still viable, and still highly desired to have around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A Fast casting malos, or slow with quicker recast time. <br />
A new long lasting pet buff, which adds to haste+ maybe gives a small proc. <br />
I like someones suggestion on other thread- Talisman of the Wind 60% haste.<br />
Upgrade to Ferine Avatar with 200 atk with 14 min duration and 30 sec recast. <br />
Maybe a Combined Slow/dot, 60% slow with a small dot. Or a -25 pr/mr/cr/fr removal.<br />
-120 unresistable dr spell for pvp.<br />
Upgrade to Spirit of Bihli with more atk and longer lasting.<br />
Introduction of a DR based rain dot. 6 Rains of disease, which when lands on a mob is a dot which depends on the hit it hits the mob for. So potentially 1-6 dots going off, but say 1 disease based rain only hit for 5 damage, then that dot would do 5 damage+/-20% damage.<br />
Summon Weapon, lvl 65 spell. Weapon is enhancement to rabid bear. 650 dd proc, with +50  double attack and +50 2hb on it. <br />
Possibly an addition of an aa which lets you target someone and give them +300 atk and small bear form. With Recast of 6 minutes.<br />
Hmm and something to further our roles as debuffers on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Upgrade to Spirit of Bihli with more atk and longer lasting.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it should damn well be faster than soe, where do they get off making druids faster than shammies when it was our spell line to begin with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The whole point of upgrading the disease slow is because there are certain mobs (Emp/Seru) that can only be disease slowed, and then there are others who are super magic resistant and only grummus seems to be reliable (Rydda`Dar, Mithaniel Mar, BoT Named, other various PoP mobs that I'm sure I've done or have yet to do).  We are the only class with a disease slow that lands easier than any other slow...I don't see why having a 55% wouldn't seem beneficial to you.<br />
<br />
I don't know how things are done in other guilds, but on the mobs that we know are hard to slow, we always have one open with grummus while the other shamans try turgurs and the chanters try Forlorn...weaker slow is still better than no slow at all.<br />
  <br />
I too would prefer Turgurs either get bumped to 80% or get a negative resist modifier added (-50) so that it lands better than any other classes slow.  This would not take away from anything the other classes can currently do, but would put us back in the position of &quot;best&quot; slower...which is where we should be, but aren't.  But this is totally unlikely to happen, thus my arguement for a better disease slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just imagine what a group quiescence would sell for?  Haha, 200k+ the way people folks charge shaman spells?  <br />
<br />
1) Upgraded Bihli with a longer duration<br />
2) Not an upgrade to Cann 5, but an upgrade to Cann 4.  Something with a larger bite for more mana would be nice.  If I could Cann 5 every minute, that would be great, but that's not happening.  <br />
3) Group Quiescence would be nice.<br />
4) Something cool, like a spell that permits tracking as I was a bard.  I never understood why they get tracking anyway, and shaman don't.  What the heck do bards have to do with tracking?<br />
5) Improved melee.  Personally I think every single class should get double attack at 100 skill when they hit level 50, and increased double attack skill at 60.  It wouldn't alter any game play balances at all, and it would add an extra element that would be fun.  Plus, really experienced adventurers presumably develop some skills - Gandalf kicks ass doesn't he?</div></div><hr />

But this is totally unlikely to happen, thus my arguement for a better disease slow.<br />
<br />
I think 40% disease slow is a lot better than nothing, and not likely to be improved upon. For those few mobs that can't be magic slowed, shamans are the only ones who can slow them at all, and okay, while I'd like to see an improvement in this line, it's never been our main slow, always something that we do if the mob is very magic resistant.<br />
<br />
I just have a suspicion that if we get a better disease slow, then more mobs are going to end up being highly disease resistant as well as highly magic resistant to stop them being slowed. Yes, I know mitigation plays this part too, but a highly resistant AND mitigating mob isn't much fun.<br />
<br />
And we *are* the best slower, I don't see how anyone could say otherwise. It might not make a huge difference most of the time, but we are still the class that can slow a mob the most.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and one thing I would like to see that I missed off earlier - an AE malos. Even if it's only as powerful as malo, (like Tigir's isn't as powerful as Turgur's, and ae tash isn't as powerful as single) that would rock!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Was just going to suggest AE Malos  :eek:  I can't believe nobody else threw it out there earlier. If I had one single wish to grant, as a raid-oriented shaman in elemental zones, AE Malos would be it.<br />
<br />
Some improvement to Slow, sure. It would be great to not feel like I'm competing with BSTs again.<br />
<br />
Some improvement to Haste, sure. I don't DARE put Talisman of Alacrity on exp groups--I get screamed at for it. Its SLtW all around :mad: <br />
<br />
Fix Rabid Bear, please.<br />
<br />
Take Acumen out of the game. Take group Acumen out of the game. take Primal Essence out of the game. Take Billy out of the game, PLEASE! Nothing is a bigger waste of time than getting a tell from some SK who insists that he needs Acumen and Billy and PE all cast on him NOW! While we are at it, take IoS out of game, and make the damned cleric Xealot spell stack with Focus. Or if not with Focus, make it stack with HoS. I wouldn't mind putting HoS on them.<br />
<br />
(and yes, I know that Acumen and PE and Billy can be useful at lower levels. What I'm really asking for is for people to LEARN the darned use of spells, and quit asking for buffs that do them no good).<br />
<br />
Take the Daiku spells out of the game and give us something useful in place. <br />
<br />
I'm happy with Canni, but if they want to improve it, I wouldn't turn it down.<br />
<br />
And finally? Give us some useful AAs to work for, eh? As it stands, shaman have the WORST set of AAs to earn of any class in the game. Absolute worst.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">- An actual Cann5 spell (250-300 hp a shot)<br />
- New Form of the Bear spell that actually does something<br />
- Longer-lasting SoW (sick of having it wear off during adventures, don't care if it's faster or not)<br />
- Turgur's knock-off with a resist mod. Maybe 55% magic based with a -something to resist.<br />
- Group Q would be so ubar.<br />
- I like the idea of improved CannAA ratios or chunks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dunno.  I'm so pissed with SOE.  The only top of the line spells we get are Malos and our 51 slow.  The margins of superiority on those spells are slim compared to the pimped out abilities of other classes.  Our new Bane line isn't as good as Horror (-30 resist mod, more damage, less mana) and this is typical of what VI has been doing to us.  While the class overall is relatively balanced (compared to warriors, we're gods) I'm tired of getting our abilities pimped out and getting second in line spells.  We aren't getting anything unique or origional that beats what other classes can do.<br />
<br />
An AE malXXX would be nice, AE HoT great as well (expect a HoT torpor like spell with snares and slow rather than AE Q), a spell that has a small HoT and attack increase would be nice (so long as stacking wasn't an issue), or even some form of self only DA or rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Group haste has saved me from going insane.  One thing I hated more than anything else was casting haste on 4 or 5 people plus pets every 16 minutes.  Now, they get ToA and if they dont like it they can haste themselves.  You'd be suprised how they will fall into line when you tell them &quot;My way or suck it&quot;<br />
<br />
- Would love to see group Quiscence.  <br />
- Upgrade Bih'li.  Make it faster, please.  If nothing else changes to it make it faster.  <br />
- New slow- 75% cause Soe doesnt want to upgrade that, but faster cast and a -50 or -100 resist mod to it.<br />
- New canni (6?)  250hp for 130 mana  Its almost the same ratio as canni IV.  If they are REALLY ambitions they could make it 250 for 150. (Gasp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Haha group torpor. <br />

<br />
Personally, I wish they would do something with the Avatar line that makes it less of a pain in the ass to cast.  If there could be some way to limit the number of people you can cast it on without the damn short duration/long refresh, that would be ideal (this is a situation where the EQ2 buff system should be much better).  <br />
<br />
Best I can come up with is to just make the damn thing a group spell with an hour duration and design the raid mobs to account for that.  Or some passive AA that gives FA to the shamans group members but takes away your ability to cast it maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Targettable shrink of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Even group topor that would be MGBable would be a god sent.  Grummus raid, big grub at 5%, everybody dying of DoT, inc MGB Topor....<br />
Those that are healthy and/or need to melee can click it off. Everyone else lives.<br />
Otherwise I second the fast canni AA, and some form of resist modifier AA.<br />
I also like to see a PBAE slow, not like tigirs with the rain coding.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Something i've always wanted to see:<br />
<br />
Crit Dot Ticks.  Just like you can crit with a nuke, I'd like dots to be able to crit.  Maybe add an aa like spell casting fury and fury of magic to make a total of 15% chance for your dot tick to crit an extra amount of damage or something.  <br />
<br />
Group Quiessence should have been in the game a while ago, yeah still waiting for that /tap.<br />
<br />
On slows, a resist adjusted slow would be great, more % wouldn't happen on turgurs im sure but a -50 magic adjusted 75% slow would not be overpowered, and still usefull, give it a long recast if you want.  Also another idea i've heard, which I guess could be usefull in some situations is unresistable low % slow.  Something like 20% slow on those mobs wich are immune to spells, but not slow immune, or really hard to slow mobs, pop in that 20% first then work on turgurs.<br />

great idea if they also drop the recast time on it by 1-1/5 of a second OR stuck a -15 resist mod on it as well without making it more resistable with all the extra debuff components.  Definately not overpowering, but worthwhile memming over Tugur's.</div></div><hr />

-new canni spell would be very useful, with our mana pools now using canni4 eats up too much time. Necros can out mana regen us passively, and their spells are more mana conservative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Take Acumen out of the game. Take group Acumen out of the game. take Primal Essence out of the game. Take Billy out of the game, PLEASE! Nothing is a bigger waste of time than getting a tell from some SK who insists that he needs Acumen and Billy and PE all cast on him NOW! While we are at it, take IoS out of game, and make the damned cleric Xealot spell stack with Focus. Or if not with Focus, make it stack with HoS. I wouldn't mind putting HoS on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
IoS?  What's that?<br />
<br />
Why is Billy useless?  Extra attack is good especially if you have the spell slots free.  Sure, 15 attack may not be a lot but it's something and it all adds up.  <br />
<br />
Acumen may not be super useful when you're sta is buffed already but I wouldn't say to get rid of it.  Personally I like being able to see my wife when she hides (dang rogues! :) ).  Plus I tend to group with a couple of blind barbarians a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
(and yes, I know that Acumen and PE and Billy can be useful at lower levels. What I'm really asking for is for people to LEARN the darned use of spells, and quit asking for buffs that do them no good).<br />
<br />
Take the Daiku spells out of the game and give us something useful in place. <br />
<br />
<br />
As I said I wouldn't say the spells do them NO good at all.  Maybe limited usefulness but it doesn't take long to cast it either and that's one of our main roles in life - buffing.  (I can see the flames coming on this comment now).<br />
<br />
I agree on the diaku spells especially Talisman of Diaku...It's quite rare that I actually cast Diaku - only to hit my cleric when he needs extra dex or my wife wants to max her dex.<br />

Just because someone asks for a stupid buff doesn't mean we have to cast it on them. Taking the spells listed out of the game is not going to educate these people in the damned use of the spells. Actually, your SK certainly does seem to know his buffs and what stacks and what does not. He's not asking you to cast anything on him that does not stack with any other buff we get. And unfortunately, buffing useless stats IS one of a Shaman's jobs, which is why I play my Shaman less often now. I got sick of people knowing we were in the middle of a fight and expecting me to recast group agility because it ran out and I'm obviously too dumb to have noticed when my buffs run out.</div></div><hr />

3) A 60% PR slow, A 65% FR slow, A 70% CR slow, A 80% DR slow keeping the mitigation code of course :)  I kinda like trying new spells on new encounters to see what lands .... call me masochistic :P<br />
<br />
4) A 55-60% PB AE MR slow (I don't see why not, Bards get a 50% PB AE MR slow, not sure why it would unbalance us, and we couldn't outrun the mobs like a bard could). Even if it was short duration (say 15-60secs, then you could have Shaman in AE groups, like AE stun / AE DD :P )<br />
<br />
5) A PB AE Malos (or maybe something less like -30 resists) - don't see why not, chanters get a AE tash ....<br />
<br />
6) An upgraded AE DoT (like the level 19 AE DR DoT we get).<br />

7) Fix Rabid Bear, it should give us melee DPS at just below a knight level<br />

8) Better debuffs ... more of an AC debuff (want one better then cripple to make us debuff kings) , or an Attk Debuff, etc ...<br />

How about a group FA, MGBable, thats not really FA, but just a BIG bonus to everyone in the raids ATTACK rating. It could be timed with the whole &quot;FULL OFFENSIVE, DROP THE NUKES&quot; thing. This could be especially useful in the EPs (just recently gained access and lost a couple events with mob &lt; 10%)<br />
<br />
As for some of the other stuff mentioned, my groups get Tali of Aclarity and like it. My response to tells like &quot;agi and PE please&quot; is to recast Focus on them. I used to have guys with Primals asking me for PE so they could get the Primal to proc faster. At first I complied, but eventually I had a chat with these people and just said &quot;Look, I get 8 spells slots and PE aint one of em. I get 10 Spell Set saves and PE aint one of them. Just kill the damn mob and if your Primal doesnt go off enough, stop bothering and live with what you got.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry, it would be nice to have but it would break the balance. A new canni spell (like Thorzion already posted) with 5-10sec recast time would have less impact and could make it into the next expansion.<br />
<br />
(Group) Shrink out of the group would be great. But for this we ask since years.<br />
<br />
We won't get a higher % slow then turgurs. Adding more then -30 resist modifier to a new slow could be out of balance too. 5-10% more to tigris or grummus sounds not to overpowered.<br />
<br />
There are lot of areas SoE could add debuffs: like negative spell shield or shield on mobs (more damage from spells / melee), spell casting slow, a debuff making interrupting spells easier, a debuff to lower proc rate or AE range...<br />
<br />
We got the taiku spells with str and dex in one. Putting agi and sta buff in one buff could help guilds not in VT / EP / Time gear.<br />
<br />
I don't mind getting a new Bih'li with the speed of SoE and some more attack (like +50). Adding UV and see invis would make it even better. But please DON'T add lev!<br />
<br />
In the moment I don't bother with FA. The 1min recasting time sucks as hell. I don't mind buffing X melee with FA without recast time and repeat it in 6-10min but with the 1min recast time I don't load the spell. Well, if we get a 9th or a 10th spell gem then I will think about this again.<br />
<br />
Only 2 classes have group heal spells: clerics and pallies (btw in SoE's eyes a palladin is the battle priests and not the shaman). /*ok, Necros have group life taps*/ Druids and beasty boys got an AA. Not sure if I want such AA. Wouldbn't be very unique.<br />
<br />
I would like to see posion nuke focus effects. There are items for cold nukes, for fire ones and magic based ones too but not for posion nukes...<br />
<br />
When we are talking about nuke focus: let the focus work with rains too but you get only 1/2 of the bonus. <br />
<br />
AA skills... there are few posts here and other threads about it. Don't want to comment nor to repeat them now. I got some now ones:<br />
- awakening of the spirit: AA self only HoT: heals 2-3k HP over 5-10 ticks. Reuse time 1-2h. <br />
- spirit bound: some kind of of DI. When your target drops to under 20% you lose 50% of your max HPs and your target gets healed by the same amount. Reuse time... dunno.<br />
- cry of the heyokah: Like mana burn but it's a DoT over 5ticks. Reuse time 24h.<br />
- blood lust: Your vision turns (blood) red, you lose 500HP and mana per tick over 6 ticks. In the same time you get attack +1500, +100% haste, +25% v3 haste (that haste that you can put over the max. 100% normal haste), a high procing 500DD proc, 250 double attack, 250 reposite, 20% chance of tripple attack, flurry and AE rampage (friend and foe). Reuse time 24h.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see new versions of all stat buffs (wrulon/diaku/stamina/etc) that increase the stat cap by 50. Meaning you could get 355 potentially instead of 305. Kinda like bard overhaste, but with buffs. That would be sweet, esp for stamina buff.</div></div><hr />

We used to have spells like these, similiar in nature anyway. They were the rage/fury/Voice of the beserker line, it used to drain your mana totally and boost your stats so you could melee better.

 As for getting rid of Acumen, Bih-li, Daiku.. totaly rediculous<br />
 Acumen is required, not all of us see in the dark plus see invis is nice too. Bih-li is nice due to the attack buff. I'd love to see an upgrade that's faster and adds more to attack.<br />
 Daiku is great as long as you haven't already topped off thier Str and Dex skills. If Daiku is useless you may as well say Focus and any other Str and Dex buffs are as well. I'd say upgrade Daiku to the stat capp raising buffs we want.<br />

Buttoned Turgurs insects AA ala Entrap, slightly reduce Time's antithesis' cast time to compensate (It should have been done in the first place considering the damned 50% reduction on the ench stick).  I think this would be far more feasable to both sides of the fence, the AA cost could happily be scaled having it starting out with a regular turgurs recast and ending up with 0 recast delay.<br />
<br />
An MGBable group Avatar aa on a button would be a damned good idea yes, could quite easily be scaled on a points level basis too, maybe even allowing us to keep a group perma group avatared with it.  Kudos to the person who thought that one up.<br />
<br />
Hastened VP, its a fantastically useful ability, but the combination of a moderately slow cast time and a slow refresh for a mere root/pushback seems a bit harsh, an AA to speed both up would be great.<br />

-no need for group quiescence, it isn't our job. ( verant decided to give more healing power to druids, it is in this way that I mean it isn't our job, but they have to give us the ability to do our job on another hand )<br />
-AE shrink<br />
-Rez 0% xp<br />
-Do something about our slow ( adjust resists or casting time ) it is our job ;)<br />
-&quot;Gather Herb&quot; skill for shaman only, works like forage but for alchemy.</div></div><hr />

 So healing isn't our job but Rezzing is?<br />
 I think not.<br />
 I also agree AE shrink and AE Grow is wrong. Too many idiots out there that would misuse it. One possability would be to make it like an illusion that can be clicked off, BUT that would mean taking up a buff slot.<br />

 Group Buffs sticking on pets is a must. There's no reason why they shouldn't.<br />
