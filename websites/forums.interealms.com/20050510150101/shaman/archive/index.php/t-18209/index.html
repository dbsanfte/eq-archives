<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Occured to me today after dying a couple of times in an LDoN.<br />
Does anyone actually bother running away in these when mass out of control pulls/adds etc or are most of you like me and just stand and die.<br />
Remember the old days in OS/KC/GUK &lt;insert appropriate dungeon name here&gt; when the zone wasnt right till youd pullled a few trains after bad pulls etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can do it *if* none of the summoning mobs has been damaged enough to start summoning. At least in LDoN, the only people you might train would be your group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder if you could kite a big train in LDoN to give the rest of the group time to recover?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't bother running.  No back spawn, so no worrying about having to clear to your corpse.  And in LDoN it might be preferrable to kill as many as possible before dieing instead of running anyways.  Especially on those slaughter missions.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only time I'll start running is if we've lost 1 or 2 people ahead of me. Then I'll zone out, zone back in, and solo some till they get back.</div></div><hr />

You misunderstood me.<br />
What i meant is not can it be done but do people bother doing it.<br />
Has PoP and now LDoN made us lazy with no CR's anymore?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For me it varies.  A strong group that doesn't panic can usually overcome a bad situation...but I've seen some *really* bad pulls where someone's keyboard got stuck or a high speed runner ran deep.  Usually zoning out means people have died or are dying which sucks.<br />
<br />
A seasoned but sloppy at the time group of mostly regulars I was in last night zoned out twice without a death, which was amazing...and we still finished with ease.  On one of them someone thought critters were pacificed and they weren't and we happened to be very near the zone and decided to flee rather than take on 5-6 critters with no enchanter (root and pet mez works for 3-4 but beyond that it's sketchy - with 3 pets and many root-immune critters).  The other time our rogue's keyboard got stuck and he ran into a densely populated room causing a massive pull in a tight corridor - so pretty much no chance to get things under control and total chaos.  The first run was exciting and different from usual since we fought several huge pulls and didn't execute with precision like we usually do (except in the handling of the constant overpulling).  On our 2nd run we had no overpulls and finished in under 45 minutes like clockwork.<br />
<br />
Anyways.  I'm not a big fan of dying in futility.  I don't mind dying at the end of a hard fought battle but if a situation is totallly hopeless I'm all for a strategic retreat.  On the other hand, I've seen some girlie tanks that want to panic and run at the slightest sign of adversity - and that drives me nuts.  It always feels good when you face a seemingly impossible battle but win with no deaths due to remaining calm and executing well.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy not having to mess with CR's myself.  Whether or not that makes me &quot;lazy&quot; I have no idea.  It is a game, I play to have fun, CRs are not fun.  Actually come to think of it, if I'm playing any game, including Everquest, I'm probably being pretty lazy.  If I were feeling like working, I'd probably be working, or mowing the lawn, or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I prefere to stay and fight until the end, unless there's absolutely no hope. I just find it challenging to face a train head on and halt it in its tracks, especially since adventuring with guild groups means I very rarely get the chance to stand alone vs a train. Of course, I die more often than not when attempting this, but it feels good to be able to win once in a while.<br />
<br />
The best I've done was halting a 6 mob train in a normal Ruj adventure. I was in the proccess of killing the 3rd mob when the rest of my pickup group ran back for their corpses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but I'd take a wizard over a druid almost anyday.  I can usually handle the heals and the extra damage sure is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoP made running pointless.  Just stay and die, your corpse will pop up in short order anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Whenever we are quite obviously going to lose a fight, most of the group is generally smart enough to run away and try to survive.  If the cleric and other casters can survive, it makes the CR time much shorter.  There's absolutely no reason to have a complete wipe when half your group could just zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Meh, I'm usually the one yelling 'zone' while trying to keep the mobs pinned down as long as I can.  Shoulda rolled a pally ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For those times when someone misses a snare and the mob comes back with about 20 mobs, you be we run. Why die and have to be rebuffed when you can just zone out and zone back in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Running is fine in LDoN, although I do tend to stick it out to the death, unless we have a wizzy/druid.<br />
<br />
If you get in trouble in PoP, especially Tier 2+ pls dont run, just die, you will find that rez much easier to get from a cleric when you havent just trained his group.  <br />
<br />
I dont even think it is the easy CR in PoP and LDoN that has brought this attitude, at 50+ you can get a good rez and your groups can usually self buff to a decent degree, even more so at 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A lot of times running back just a few rooms will temporarily split the mobs too. Eventually most will make their way to you, but it seems to take a bit. Usually you end up with 1 or 2 that were damaged warping in, and the rest waddling along as they can find doorways and such. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, when you dont have a Mezzer and your group is lowish on DPS, root-run is your best bet on those double-healer pulls. They seem to have Channeling of 1,000,000 and can CH each other for half an hour solid, LOL. One of the only reasons I use a pet in LDoN is to bash these suckers.</div></div><hr />
