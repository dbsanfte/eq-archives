The &quot;debate&quot; over wrulan  in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=232708) left me wondering about how buffs are dropped/wiped when dispelled or overwritten in relation to the order they are originally cast.<br />
<br />
I've been under the impression that they are wiped based on the order they were originally cast...but I'm not sure why I think that.<br />
<br />
I've had friends (some as high as Time-enabled) ask me to put junk buffs on before good buffs as a buffer against dispelling/overwriting.<br />
<br />
In my own experiences I used to always cast focus of soul before other buffs...since I got F07 I always do wrulan and daiku first then stam and focus last...and it seems like with my old style people would often get focus wiped and now focus is rarely wiped.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just luck.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know if there is a system here or if it's random?  Is it best to cast less critical buffs first and your best buffs last to protect them or does it even matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dispells work differently.<br />
<br />
There are many dispell AE's out there that take your first (top) buff.  One example of that is Avatar Power, one of the oldest AE's out there.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule has an AE that take your first 12 buffs.<br />
<br />
Regular old mob and trap dispells, I have never seen any convincing evidence about the order that they take buffs in.  My ANECDOTAL evidence suggests that they often take the most recent buff cast on you.  So using instaclicks and junks keeps those buffs as your most recent ones.  <br />
<br />
Other reasons for using junks:<br />
Slot 1: Virtue<br />
Slot 2: Focus<br />
Slot 3: KEI<br />
<br />
If you get dispelled, you're gonna lose one of those for sure, cause you only have 3 buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now here is another buff setup.<br />
Slot 1: Acumen<br />
Slot 2: Bramblecoat<br />
Slot 3: Shield of the 8th<br />
Slot 4: Lunar Whispers<br />
Slot 5: Spirit of Wolf<br />
Slot 6: Virtue<br />
Slot 7: Focus<br />
Slot 8: Kei<br />
<br />
Now you have 8 buffs for the dispell to choose from, since you have more junk buffs than you have good buffs, the odds are a random dispell will take a junk buff.<br />
<br />
I think that's the best simple summary I can give about junk buffs in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even on first-slot dispels you may end up loosing something you thought safely buried at the bottom of the buff stack.<br />
If you get a set of buffs in a small amount of time odds are they will arrive at the server in a different order then you see them. A-dragon_01 uses his AE, the server wipes what he thinks is your first buff and your virtue vanishes in slot 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pells try for the first buff in the line, this is why on pvp servers most people put up 3-4 junk buffs, then cast the good stuff and try to burry the best pvp buffs in the very back. with 15 buffs up a druid can double dot  and I can just pumice it off with few worries about losing anything good. <br />
<br />
of course there is some random skipping now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the EQ engine is much more devious than we are lead to believe.<br />
<br />
I swear that the game knows exactly what you least want to happen, and then does it just to piss you off.  Dispells are one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for this.<br />
<br />
Is dispell being cast at you?  Yes?  Do you have virtue and/or kei? NOT FOR LONG SUCKER.  I swear to god I have had dispells skip my junk buffs, my first few real buffs, and knock out kei and virtue from the 9th and 10th slots on the first cast.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, dispells usually take the first buff.  If it doesn't take the first buff, it will probably take the second buff.  If it doesn't do that, it is more likely to take the third buff than the 4th+.<br />
<br />
I think it works something like this:<br />
<br />
Probability:<br />
<br />
1st buff - 50%<br />
2nd buff - 25%<br />
3rd buff - 12.5%<br />
4th buff - 6.25%<br />
etc....<br />
<br />
I just made those numbers up, but you probably get what I am saying.  In my experience, it is pretty rare but definately not unheard of for dispells to take anything past the 5th slot.<br />
<br />
Also, there are some AE's that ALWAYS take the first buff.  The dragon in the WW tov canyon with the unresistable AE (entariz?) will always take the first buff, whereas the other dragon's AE's take one of the first few randomly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The junks help push odds more towards your favor. If you've 10 buffs, and 3 get randomly dispelled, good chance you'll still be left with atleast one that you really want. If you've only got 3 buffs, and get 3 randomly dispelled, your left holding your spear wondering what to do next.<br />

<br />
...and the laugh...this concept is seemingly all too true.<br />
<br />
It would make sense for there to be some element of randomness in dispelling to prevent players from having an absolute way of avoiding it.</div></div><hr />
