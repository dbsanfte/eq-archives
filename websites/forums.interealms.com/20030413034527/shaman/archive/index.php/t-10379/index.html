<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After six months and being the seemingly only Oracle without it, my epic is only a few faction quests away!<br />
<br />
We didn't use Mage pets, although we did have one Mage along who did in fact use his pet. :)<br />
<br />
We had a 61 Ranger for tank, a Bard for resists and around four groups of support personnel. Spam healed the Ranger with little heals until he established agro, then all the other melees ran in. Only had one death as a result, but I must admit I was very nervous trying this. I had never read any strat posts that said to go get a Ranger and a Bard. ;)<br />
<br />
Was told Mage pets no longer work? Truth or rumor? I don't know.<br />
<br />
If I had any more, I would hope that my next Epic fight didn't include people being randomly teleported to their bind point and people randomly falling for 20k. Good ole patch day!<br />

Big thanks to the folks in the Serverwide Crucible for providing information and advice, they suggested using both a pet and a tank, which turned out to be a great idea. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sedax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a tear mq last night. Had 2 mage fire pets by rak and I did the turn in. I kept myself torpor'd while the pets went at it. They were taking alot more damage than when i did my epic about a year ago so at 50 percent we sent a pally in to helpout and had the casters unload some nukeage. All in all still an easy battle, but mage pets don't work like they used to.</div></div><hr />
