<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently went on a PoH raid and acquired a Rune Etched BP, legs, arms, boots, and the barbarian shaman only 17ac / 10wis shield. I should have my magelo profie up and running on Sunday night. I'll edit the post accordingly. I recently detwinked my monk and made a few deals that turned about 6k into 11k (hate me if you want, people offered me the money so I sold the items). Should my first upgrade be 2 Velly Fire Rings and a Sarnak Battle Shield? Then maybe save up for a JBB(?) OR I could try and deal my way up to a Lodi Shell Shield. But back to the main part, should I try to replace the Rune Etched gear I acquired even though the ac is decent and such? Or is that ok for now, and that I should concentrate on the items I spoke of in the early part of the post?<br />
<br />
Help me friends :).<br />

<br />
&quot;I recently went on a PoH raid and acquired a Rune Etched BP, legs, arms, boots, and the barbarian shaman only 17ac / 10wis shield.&quot;<br />
<br />
OMFG! :)  I stopped bothering with PoH at all after seeing only *two* pieces (/rude helm and boots) of RE drop in I think it was 4 raids.  Nevermind the 8 or 9 scaled heiro pieces that dropped grr.<br />
<br />
/ass off ;)<br />
<br />
Grats on the armor!  I wouldnt really call it overrated, as many 50+ softskin shammys might tell you its not worth the effort, but rather outdated.  The only worthwhile pieces, at planar character level at least, really are the BP and maybe a bracer.<br />
<br />
JB arms, boots, helm and gauntlets all have higher AC and are easy as cake to purchase.  The RE breastplate is a very nice item to have though, until upgraded with kunark/velious/luc boss mob bp's.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shields seem to be standard equipment nowadays for Druids and Shamans.  If you are looking to level, and dont mind soloing, the JBB will be the single best piece of equipment you could buy that will help you to level.<br />
<br />
A lodi is way out of reach unless you plan on spending tens of thousands of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*nod* JB armor FAR outclasses it and at least on BB, you can get the arms, hat, gloves and boots for 1K each.  SHORT money if you do specs/HG's for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was given a Ikky BP early, low AC compared to the 26ac -20 dex bp I have to swap out with, but other than that, I'd almost say a Fungi is as worthwhile as a JBB, albiet a bit pricier but we're not exactly talking cheap gear ANYWAYS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OMFG is right  jsmaze ;) as it literally took me about 7 months of raiding PoH at least once a week to get my BP. I swear at one time it had to be like the rarest piece of armor in the game, but it seems like it drops much more now.<br />
<br />
I remember when PoH first opened and RE was dropping like candy...or so it was told to me as I didnt get to planer level until just -after- they fixed the drop rate....like they always do :)<br />
<br />
I was a slacker on leveling and my guild was in the planes, but as soon as I leveled I was there with them full bore when the planes was the only real raiding going on...no Kunark at that point.<br />
<br />
Anyway it just blows my mind to see this post and the kind of so-so attitude RE has attached to it now. I would have given my first born for the BP after all the work my guild did in PoH...and to get almost all of it in one or a few sessions......the times they do a change dont they......lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Indeed they do change ;)  Back then some players still had banded/crafted/etc and were in the planes.<br />

Just not worth the effor if you ask me considering how cheap most JB pieces are.  That and dragon armor is dropping in price too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All of the JB prices are coming down.  Ever since Velious most the Kunark armor pieces are selling for decent prices.  Saw gloves the other night for 300.  Arms 500, Helm 400, Boots 500.  I got a JB BP for 16.5k.  Only reason I had that kind of money is from my retired 60 monk.  JB Legs use to be 25 to 30k are now 10 to 15k.  <br />
<br />
Yes, the Legs and BP are still kind of expensive BUT they aren't 60k+ for BP and 35k+ for the legs like they use to be.</div></div><hr />

Its just THAT outdated.  Its easier to save up 5K and get a dragonhorn bracer than try for a RE bracer, and the dragonhorn bracer is way better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/sigh.. I think I'm through with raiding PoH... ya the armor is nice.. but on the last raid I went on..  was a weekday raid and was up til like 2 which sucked since I wake up at 6:15 for work.. like seven pieces of standard shammy crap dropped (2 standard shammy arms off the lord spite guy /rude).. and the arms and boots dropped for me (which I already had of course).. was on 3 raids prior to this one and that same **** dropped..  =/.  One of them like 3 arms and 2 boots gah!  Why is even the damn bracer so rare hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1k per piece should get you JB arms, hands, and helm.  The pricey pieces are the legs and the BP.  Decent legs at that level are the Jarsath Legs that drop off the Undead Jailer in KC or even the Gladiator Chain Legs from (forgot) in Kael.  BP wise, RE is fine til you can get to a Trak raid... then get to ToV, pick your faction and get the gear from there.<br />
<br />
Well done on the armor though - were you the only shaman there?  When I started collecting Hate armor, I got boots, arms and hands in one night as I was the only shaman on the raid.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, GL.<br />

Curiously, Jarsath legs&gt;Rune Etched Legs, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I went to a Hate raid (pickup) last weekend (I was bored). I was lucky enough to win rolls on Rune Etched Helm and Rune Etched Booties. I declined on both because they were both so crappy. I dont have good gear, but the helm, for example is a joke = 14AC 7int 7disease (from memory) - like wow - thats real useful....NOT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Silsisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The RE armor from Hate isnt that great for the amount of time it takes you to get a full thing of RE you could probably be farming Kael with one group and get about the same amount of chain drops.<br />
   Thats how i upgrades from my scaled heriophant from Hate though i must admit the SH armor is much better then RE..and is one reason i am glad that i rolled a iksar (though at times i wish i was a troll)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Boy, it's interesting to see these opinions.  I'm going on my first ever Planes raid to Hate this weekend and would love some RE to drop (check my magelo to see why hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Risk vs. Reward -- PoH vs. Kael<br />
<br />
I still do Hate a l'il, because we have a good number of guildies needing epic bits from there - and because a lot of the gear for other classes doesn't blow chunks, like ours does.  =)<br />
<br />
Doing arena or bank or what have you in Kael involves the same size, or a much smaller force than PoH.  Lucky me, I have the ONE piece I'd ever want from Hate (bracer), because the Thurg armor is SO MUCH better.  The pants win on every stat (and clicky cure slow - WOOT), the thurg shammy hat is decent - bit better than 7int.<br />
<br />
Kael doesn't have a cover charge.  CR in kael is silly easy.  And just TRY to wipe out in there with a good sized group of guild.  Oh, and just about everybody will want to go, because it isn't a complete waste of time for any class in particular (unlike PoH).<br />
<br />
The clever shaman will go to PoH full of loving and giving thoughts of helping friends in need.  Don't go thinking that armor will make you happy at all (in most cases - bout everybody has a slot or two that... needs work).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think VI missed a huge chance when they added focus effects to old items. A lot of the old planar drop armors are seriously sub-par even for 46th level characters these days. They could've added some of the level 3 focus effects to the Planar armors (why not they added level 2 to some of the questeds) and it would've &quot;fixed&quot; them nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hail,<br />
<br />
My first PoH raid, the only RE that dropped was the BP.  I was the only shaman left on the raid at that point, so it defaulted to me.<br />
<br />
I wear it for tradeskills and weddings.  That is all.<br />
<br />
I kept a Phase Spider Carapace on instead until recently, when I traded that in for a Fungi from my guildleader.  (I LOVE my guild!)<br />
I don't see myself turning in the Fungi until I have Torpor, and maybe not even then. ;)<br />
<br />
I agree it would be VERY nice to add some focus item III effects to this stuff to make it have some worth.  Not just the RE, but many of the other classes just laugh at the stats when stuff drops.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

What's with all that wisdom gear? Cloth sleeves? 3ac cap? Gator legs?<br />
<br />
You're not a druid.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to knock your gear, it's just that you're completely and totally missing the point of a shaman's gear. It is supposed to emphasize ac and hp,  not - and I emphasize NOT - wisdom! Mana for a shaman comes from cannnibalizing!<br />
<br />
Having 130 wis into your upper 50s is completely OKAY, as long as your ac is 900 or up.<br />
<br />
Trade in your wis stuff and get some normal gear. You won't even need money, heck, you will probably save some. Get totemic or rygorr legs, 6/65 rings, totemic helm, rygorr/totemic arms.<br />
<br />
And max your defense already, looking at your setup I'm reasonably certain you haven't done that and are far from the 200 cap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Toorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thank God I decked my shammy out with HP/AC/Resist gear..<br />
<br />
I can Canni to FM, almost from OOM. <br />
<br />
Leaves me low on health, but with an Ikky and Regen on me, it doesn't take long to heal up at all. <br />
<br />
I have 2 Wisdom items on him.. A +8 Wis Veil and a Forest Loop. <br />
<br />
The rest of the gear is Ry'gorr, Various Pieces here and there. With AC being the main focus, and HP a very close, if not equal second. <br />
<br />
My AC, self buffed at 28 is 602. and have almost 800HP. I think 774 to be exact. <br />
<br />
A couple Wisdom Items are probably a good thing, but in anycase, with any class... AC/HP will do the most to keep you alive!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">PoH armor is overrated and quite frankly outdated. It isn't worth the effort for anyone other than Iksar. Velious quested stuff and PoG, and newly crafted armors are much better and probably easier to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">RE BP and legs are still by far the best for ease to get...unless you have cash to blow on artifactors for barbs...some of those pieces are near SS quest quality.<br />
<br />
RE boots over JB boots...with the agi on RE you loose very little ac and get other stats.<br />
<br />
RE bracer is not bad either....someone mentioned dragonhorn bracers, lol, good luck finding those for sale.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway...back to the original question...sounds like your on the right track, 6ac 65hp rings, sarnak shield is nice for resists. Keep an eye out for JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just noticed iksar PoH gloves&gt;&gt;SS. Gloves by a bunch...guess I'm gonna have to go back to Hate..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I currently have all the RE except the helm.<br />
<br />
I carry the BP with me for the times that I don't need to do massive canni and need my fungi (when I have KEI for example).<br />
<br />
I don't use either of the bracers - I use a Matchless Dragonhorn Bracer and my JBB.<br />
<br />
I wear the arms and the legs.<br />
<br />
Boots are in the bank - I use Tribal War Boots<br />
<br />
Gloves are in the bank - I use Coldain Skin Gloves<br />
<br />
Is the gear subpar?  Yeah somewhat... but I have found, despite many others who have posted here, that the RE crap drops pretty regularly.  I've been on a LOT of Hate raids and typically I'm one of two (or maybe even the solo) shaman on the raid.<br />
<br />
Try being a cleric.  Always 8 clerics going on the raids... Hate is like Christmas for clerics... never seen so many class-specific pieces drop in a zone before.  Typically see about 6-10 cleric pieces PER raid.<br />
<br />
What I would LIKE to have, though, is either the Thurg or PoG legs and BP (same stats).  Both are a significant upgrade to the RE BP and Legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Taoison</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Id say Iksar stuff is better becouse when they made Iksars they were thinking humm, Nice JB Armour and new race cant wear plate. Soo lets give them Something to wear at that level, so they they made the PoH stuff up to par with Kunark stuff, or close depending on how you deem the value of JBB.</div></div><hr />
