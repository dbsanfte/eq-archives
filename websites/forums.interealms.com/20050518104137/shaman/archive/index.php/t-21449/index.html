<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Multiple posters on the &quot;Sony / Yantis &quot; thread postulated that EQ is dead or at least on life support.  Granted, summer brings about lower numbers and W.O.W. is on the horizon; and granted Shaman have GOOD reason to be frustrated, and yes G.o.D. left a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
BUT, (and I admit to being in the dark on this), does anybody have factual data on the decline of the EQ userbase? I ask not as a fan boi, but an interested consumer.<br />
<br />
Frankly, even if EQ lost 100K folks to W.O.W. I can't see them turning the game off. (Maybe closing a server or two).  Normally I'd be skeptical, but I would wager that MANY people will buy O.o.W. simply out of habit. <br />
<br />
Thoughts? Comments ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the people on that thread failed to notice that Sony was talking about it's games on the PS2... Which if I remember correctly, is a whole different division than Sony Online entertainment.<br />
<br />
If 100k people left EQ for WoW (won't happen. Just because you play one doesn't exclude the other - A fact most of the EQ doomsayers forget), then that would simply shut down the three team zeks, to which I can say &quot;Huh?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no real data but i know the top 2 guilds on my server are struggling badly for poeple to actualy raid. though the ones still on pop are doing ok ish.</div></div><hr />

drinal used to be PACKED, pok had roughly 200 people prime hours.<br />
you'd be lucky to catch 35 on in pok during the same hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well if the amount of people like me returning after FFXI is anything to go by, I can see EQs dominance lasting long after the release of EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Corbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">About 20% of my Guild has quit in the past 2 months. I quit a few days ago and am very happy about it. I had my fun but EQ became more like work than entertainment over the past few months. I got tired of Sony's crap too. Who wants to be spamed with Ads for new expansions on login and logout? Not me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Overall i think you are seeing a decline in the higher end gamers that soe typicaly had a lock on.  These are vocal people and generaly go with the latest and greatest so the new competition is hurtin soe a bit there.  However in my personal experince the pre time guilds (the majority of the player base) are still going strong and with new expansions soe is brining in additional players (though nowhere near the numbers seen in the past).  Over all even if soe lost 10k customers a month eq would keep chuging on for another 2-3 years.  you likely wont see everquest die for atleast a year or two after the last expansion and they are already in the works for the next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It used to be that they listed how many people are on each server at the server select screen but I guess when DAoC and Shadowbane and such came out and they lost a lot of players they decided it wasnt good marketing to show everyone how many people they had lost. Now it just says whether the server is up or down.<br />
<br />
You think there arent as many people playing now as there was back when DAoC came out? You think they turned off the server population numbers because they were LOWER?<br />
<br />
Come on man.<br />
<br />
While the situation today is mildly worse than it has been in the past, all these events we are seeing unfold is NOTHING new with EQ. The &quot;killer&quot; games have come, and gone. The rants have been ongoing. You should try looking for a message board that actually started when EQ did, and see if you can find a SINGLE week where a buttload of people didn't threaten to quit. <br />
<br />
Dont confuse logged in populations with subscriptions either. A lot of top guilds are having numbers problems because they are BORED, and Gates BLOWS, because its tuned for lvl 70 people. So they are finding other things to do. On my server, I guarentee you that the logged-in populations of guilds 4-15 aren down, if anything, they are UP. Yeah, the top guilds are having numbers problems, does that mean that SOE isnt still making money off those people that arent logging in? <br />
<br />
There is a lull at the top, which has created a nice gap in the food chain for others guilds. Trust me, its getting filled too. Since gates came out 2 new guilds have reached Time on my server, and 2 others are 1 or 2 god kills away. At least 6 new guilds have reached the EPs. New EP guilds are moving out of Ssra and VT, allowing the next set of folks to roll in there. <br />
<br />
Once OoW comes out, I fully expect the game to take off again. Even if its still broken in a lot of places. Why? Because it will take a CROWBAR to pry most people away from a game they have invested so much time and effort into. Watch and see. I bet you that more than HALF the people who have stated they ended billing here come back. For a new game to make a SERIOUS impact on the EQ world, it will HAVE to be completely amazingly astounding out of the box. I just don't see it happening. Yeah, WoW will take a bunch of folks for a while, but lots will come back, just like they did with DAoC. <br />
<br />
Another advantage EQ has is that it is becoming more and more &quot;mass appeal&quot; friendly. Even if new people sign up and then play for . . . lets say . . . 1 year (and trust me when I tell you thats a LONG time for a game, I bet the WoW people are PRAYING they get 200K for a whole year) . . . they sign up, play a year, and max out. Hit that wall so many of us veterans seem to be at. So what? Thats STILL a ton of money for SOE, and more customers to target with their next product in the line. <br />
<br />
Don't let a few doomsayers convince you that EQ is unhealthy. It may be stumbling a bit, Gates was a blunder, they know it, etc, but the big picture looks pretty optoimistic. 5 new levels is a BIG incentive for lots of folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi ,<br />
Well i for one just bought CoH .. and a Game card too secrure myself a total of 3 months playtime on that game . I created a Magic Defender on the Penicle server . I played all night lastnight .. bot up this morning and logged on EQ ...<br />
I know a lot of people like CoH .. but it did not impress me . I will prob mess around with it since i have 90 days on my account but strongly doupt I will renew for anymore time . While it had a good bit of &quot;fun factor&quot; it lacked the &quot;depth&quot; of norrath in my opinion . If i could retract the 75$ i invested in CoH I would but I cant so Ill mess around with it for kicks when i dont feel like playing EQ .<br />
So in short too answer your question .. Is EQ dead ? Well not too me , at least not for now ... I fully expect too be playing EQ for months too come .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce/Subscriptions.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm in complete agreement with Blazz. As long as they don't screw up OoW and can keep the people at the top of the food chain busy with each new expansion this game will be around for a long time. I'm sure a lot of people are similar to me, they quit for long periods of time and each time they come back they enjoy the game even more than before. The last time I came back our guild had just hit ToV and I was having an absolute blast there. Some things fell apart in the guild, I got burnt out and retired again but I still have NToV, Ssra, VT, EP, LDoN and GoD to discover so there's no way I'm going to dump my shaman forever .  The only way I'll quit EQ forever is when it's a complete ghost town like the EC tunnel is now back before the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yes.  there are about twice as many people playing now as in 01.  probably a majority of people who regularly post on this board started playing after late sov and into sol.<br />
<br />
even if people quit now, there's a lag time before the numbers register.  even publically traded information isn't available until the next business quarter.  so people quit now, it wont impact sony's bottom line until the fall.<br />
<br />
I think eq is now truthfully in decline.  but it wont die given past behavior of MMPOG.  UO's and DAOC have both been long in decline but due to the enormous profitability of onine games they still make money.  what's dangerous for soe is the likelihood that they will have dramatically fewer new accounts created by 2boxers and new players.  people point to seasonal ebb and flow of subscriptions and think it's an indication of ppl leaving and coming back.  the seasonality of subscriptions is valid but it's incorrect to think it's ppl leaving and coming back.  it's new users.  look at any guild the roster is completely different year to year.  you can point to any of the top guilds on any server and you'll see the list of past members usually numbers in the thousands of long-dead names<br />
<br />
for a long time EQ was THE game people referred their friends to but it's likely that other games will get that.  it's normal for people to quit.  it's more natural for people to play for a couple years than quit... much more so than individuals playing eq for 3 4 5 years which is psychologically wierd.  but if they dont have the influx of new players the game will be hurt.<br />
<br />
but eq will go on... if for no other reason than the fact that people are by nature conservative and creatures of habit.  i believe even at 150,000 people eq (similar to what daoc has) eq will be very profitable and expansions profitable as well.  eq wont die for many many years even if it's the 10th most popular mmpog in 5 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">believe it or not EQ still attracts new players even now.  I dont think it makes up for the numbers quiting though.  I dont absorb myself in the numerous complaint threads that seem to populate every class board.  There are complaints about every class and I sure have mine about shamans and eq in general but ive been playing for 4 years now and its been fun or i would have quit.  im not a masocist and like to do things that cause pain or boredom, why would I waste my free time that way, why would anyone?  Its been always my experience that unhappy people are more likely to complain about something than people who are happy to praise.  I think the endless complaining skews the real truth a bit.<br />
<br />
From my experience people i know who quit do so because a) there friends have quit  b) they are tired of it and want to move on to something else (i mean 4-5 years is a long time to play a game)  c) the new content just isnt interesting or their guilds fall apart.  Ive seen some older guilds start to fall apart because of players quiting.  I expect more will fall after WoW.  But I dont see an end for EQ in the near future.  For everyone I know who says they will be leaving for WoW I know one other who says they will be staying with EQ.  Sony should worry more about EQ2 being a complete failure then EQ dying.  As long as they continue to support it and update and introduce new content people will be playing.  Some servers will more than likely be eliminated and merged and it will slowly die but I expect that EQ will be around for years to come, as long as it can be run with a profit it will remain.  It may be losing its number 1 spot soon but Sony is still goign to be making tons of money of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ will linger on just like UO does.<br />
In reality however all that once made EQ to what it was has been killed by SoE so yes EQ is dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hate to be the man dragging the black puddle, but on this topic i must.<br />
<br />
I have been playing games for a long time now, i have learned that games come in cycles. They come out, are popular then they slowly begin to die. Little by little the life of the community seeps out and moves to a new place. Whats left when this life begins to seep is a less then lively entity, that instead of exciting retorec and pleasent conversation or exciting things to talk about, a dark cloud rolls in and the rains fall as everything turns to complaints about this and that and the ever popular cheating. Once cheating takes hold of a game its really a downward spiral at that point in every game i have played so far and it seem that EQ is no different. <br />
<br />
EQ lasted a long time, it has lasted longer in a good and positive and growing light then any game i have ever played, but i truly believe that the community has shifted and the life, the good &quot;soul&quot; for lack of a better term, is slipping throught he fingers of SoE's desperate grip. SoE i believe has reached a point of no return and with EQ2 looks as weak as it is, i can say in all honestly that this old bear will probably be moving on for good from norrath. I hope the make a good book about the lore and the progression sometime, i think it could be fun to read especialy since we all lived it. I mean wouldnt that be fun? You read about some epic story involving some epic guilds and players and maybe some of us can be in the book. But i digress.<br />
<br />
SoE has gone to far to come back cause of how the business mind thinks. They will not take the big risks needed i feel to turn this thing around, they might in time, but by then itll be a desperation attempt and itll be too late. Right now they are riding the edge of a knife and they have the ability to sway to the side that is needed, but i have little faith with their track record they will.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, its been a wonderful ride, i cant believe how deep i got in this game, i can truly say i have deeply loved playing EQ. But the magic is gone and the ship is sinking and this is one cat that knows when to jump ****.<br />
<br />
See ya on the beach. ;)</div></div><hr />

Glad to see your not talking trash and being bitter about it Lit. There is another thread here that has all kinds of people talking trash and poking fun at how they &quot;sacked theirs characters to 45, gave away all gear, deleted characters, microwaved or ran over the disks in the car, etc etc&quot; and then in the next breath they talk about &quot;4 years I been putting up wiht this **** ect ect ect&quot;. Makes me wanna puke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This causes people who leave to come back. To see thier friends. But The reverse is also true. when people leave they tend to pull at the fabric that the game is built upon and multiple people leave as the result of one persons choice. <br />
<br />
Yes there will be new people playing. But the game is radicly different than when I was coming up in it. The flavor of the game and mindset is simply me me me. And Push push push to level 65 where the real game starts.<br />
<br />
And to me that is horribly wrong. Cause vast tracts of land are empty ignored and lay there forlorn. <br />
<br />
EQ at one time was the Journy. Now it is simply the destination. <br />

So no matter how many people they have logged in at the same time. and no matter how much money they rake in....<br />

Couldnt agree more Snow. I thought that the Fabled mobs were a step in the right direction. It got people into older content. The loot was darn good, but not so good as to have a bunch of Uber players SERIOUSLY trying to farm it non-stop, especially since it was no drop (couple of farming/camping exceptions, like J Boots, maybe). And it inspired many smaller guilds to do 2-4 group raids, like the old days, especially in zones like Sol B and Lower Guk. <br />
<br />
They really should have expanded on this theme. Have different Fabled guys pop up all over every other week maybe. First old world, then Velious. Fabled Frenzy Spider, or Foreman in CC, etc. Then Kunark, fabled KC and OS mobs for people to do. Spread it around. Give people a REASON to go places. <br />
<br />
But alas, SOE doesnt seem to know a good thing when it slaps em in the face. Fabled mobs are no more, and once again, Lower Guk is nothing but faction farmers who want to look like Elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, I can't say other than anecdotally that numbers of people seem to be way down on A Ro, but this is what gets me...<br />
<br />
RIGHT NOW, AS I TYPE THIS, I'm in a guild meeting where my guildleader is trying to force our casual guild (of which I and my friends have been members for 3 years) into a more raid oriented guild.  This is how bad it's gotten.  We've all hit 65, have little to do outside raiding, but if any of us had the contiguous time or interest to raid, we'd already be doing it.  <br />
<br />
I've noticed that we've had next to no advancement into the eplanes on my server as the gap is now to the point where those who can get there have already done so and those who can't, won't ever get there.  Even the open raiders have joined ele+ guilds.  Someone on A Ro can correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
The game may not be dead, but it sure is broken.<br />
<br />
Edit: typos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Here's the deal folks, all these top-end guilds ditching, I know it shocks you to think of it... But they don't count for shizz.<br />
<br />
There's guilds below them who WILL fill their shoes. Guaranteed, 100%. Think you're hot stuff because you're past Uqua? Pull out for a week and watch, a guild you never considered will be in there and past. The only thing stopping other guilds is the fact that there's always one guy ahead of them in line.<br />
<br />
Anyway, them quitting is a simple thing - Burnout. how far can you go before realizing that really, nothing this game sets in front of you will ever be a challenge, much less one worth your time? When you look at the uber loot dropping around you, and realize the stats on it nudge you up maybe one or two tiny baby steps, or rots on the corpse.<br />
<br />
How long can you stay in the game where the only reason you don't breeze through content is because it's bugged? I can whip through Diablo2 in a few hours. I haven't played it in three years. Same thing - it's a good, viable game, it just has nothing left for me.<br />
<br />
So seriously, get off your &quot;Uber guilds are disbanding, EQ is dead!&quot; horses, and realize the truth - Uberguilders DO have lives, and they've probably decided to go do something else with them. There's thousands of people left to flood into the vacuum, newbies will come in, alts will be created, and the circle of life goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hyena you clearly know nothing about the uberguild scene. Uberguilds are fully aware of burnouts, and shift leaders every handfull of months, and are continuously recruiting to replace burnouts.<br />
<br />
They are accustomed to players losing interest one at a time, as anyone and everyone has a worthy replacement somewhere. And being the best on the server, they can find that someone. However when burnout rate becomes greater than replacement rate, a catalyst like a burned-out leader can lead to disbanding of a guild.<br />
<br />
In short, the disbanding means that burnouts are in greater numbers than new troops. Let me rephrase that; people cancelling accounts are in greater numbers than people joining Everquest. The population is decreasing. Uberguild disbanding is definitely the telltale sign of the death of everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Some uber guilds are having a tough time right now.  They used to have people lined up for blocks trying to bust in.<br />
<br />
That does leave a great opportunity for others at a slightly lower end, though.  They can fill the gaps somewhat, so it's actually a great thing for them when uberguilds dissolve and have recruiting problems, in a certain way.  <br />
<br />
But sometimes it leaves a tough gap.  If you don't have a big fat uberguild to slide into, you have to figure out how to do things by yourself.  Most people aren't up to the job.  It's an order of magnitude easier to be a follower than a leader when it comes to content that's new to you.<br />
<br />
Some of the people cheering that now they'll finally get their crack at tough zones now that nobody is holding them back may be in for a bit of a surprise.</div></div><hr />

  Reminds me of something that drives me insane everytime I am in PoK.  There are always 2-3 people &quot;donating plat for port to Stonebrunt/Emerald Jungle.&quot;  I sent tells to them at first explaining that they can run there in less than 5 minutes, but after a while I just gave up- let the wizzies/druids make some plat I guess.</div></div><hr />

I still have too much to do in EQ..and on those days when I feel like goofing off and not raiding or playing, I go make my dyes and potions and go set up in bazaar . (also when I need to do housework)<br />
I feel sorry for those who have been playing so long and are having a rough time of it..I , too , wish they would have Fabled mobs pop up every now and again . It would bring some interest to the game. Also wish they would have more GM events(that you don't have to pay to get in to) .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">With all product life cycles there are certain stages, I think eq has gone from the stage of maturation and now at decline. However, the decline probably isn't that big and should be very gradual.<br />
People still play ultima online I think it is? I think all that will happen is eq will lose its top spot to some of its competitors. It could arguably be the best time for eq with SoE realizing the competitors on the horizon. Although, EQ has a big advantage over so many games when it will come to rivalling its top spot;- its big community and the massive amount of content there is. (Thats what keeps people playing. )<br />
When eq seriously starts to fall, I think they will merge some servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ may be at the beginning of its decline but that decline will be ever so gradual after the innitial shock of being faced with a good number of real competitors at once.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen of the up coming titles, I think I still want to play EQ and one of the new ones.  Most everything coming up looks pretty good and all have problems for me.  I like some of what McQuaid is doing with Vanguard but being in bed with MS scares me.  If there are package deals for EQII or special content for have an EQL and a EQII account that may sway me to play both.<br />
<br />
I wont play WoW, don't like the ass-ears.  CoH looks cool but not sure it would have staying power for me.  GuildWars looks like it will be a PvP raid game, so that could take large chunks (almost like playing organized sports).  The team aspect of GuildWars is appealing though.  Tabula Rasa, Richard &quot;Lord British&quot; Garriott's new project seems to be intancing gone wild, but could be cool for casual play.<br />
<br />
Everything has its pros but nothing can instantly give me a 5 year investment like I have in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">That's the main thing that's kept it going all this time, I think.  Sheer momentum, combined with habit.  Nobody wants to give up the massive time and effort invested already, and it's something they're used to doing, so....it almost doesn't matter how good the game is or becomes, after you've spent a certain amount of time there.  It's an unbelievable asset to Sony.<br />
<br />
Kind of like people who refuse to move out of neighborhoods that have become crime-infested hellholes even if they could afford it.  It would make a lot more sense and be far more pleasant not to live somewhere that has shootings, robberies, rapes, and angry nutballs running up and down the streets at all hours -- but you can actually come to accept pretty much anything at all, as long as you get habituated to it slowly.  There are people who wouldn't move out of hell itself, even if they could do it for free and it took no effort at all.  People can get used to ANYthing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think EQ is in decline, but if SOE plays their cards cleverly they can get many more productive years out of it. However a lot of it is going to be clear this year. CoH and L2 weren't really really deep PvE games and thus aren't really challengers to EQ. However WoW and EQ2 are. If those games prove to be solid, and OOW is not a kick ass expansion, not only will they lose numbers but they'll lose the mantle of being the &quot;dominant&quot; MMORPG which will basically put the clamp on new players starting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">While I think EQ is still strong and always will be, I do think that it is past its prime.<br />
<br />
I played UO for a looong time, since before that horrid rep patch.  When EQ rumors started floating about, I was amazed.  I remember reading a story about a guy in an early EQ beta who had fought a &quot;gnoll,&quot; been losing, and swam away, only to find the gnoll followed him into the water to slay him!  I remember thinking that was insanely awesome for some reason.<br />
<br />
Then I played in EQ Beta phase 4, and it was incredible.  I'd grind from level 7 to 8 in about a day at the ONE (yes one) kobold camp that was there in steamfont mountains.  Most of the objects were unfinished and had spider silk graphics, yes, but the game was fun.  I remember exploring LFAY for the first time (Before they stuffed it with level 30 plus mobs and Equestrielle... back when it was all but devoid of life, and just a step on the way to GFAY) and getting lost a bunch, and then becoming very proud of myself when I memorized which turns to take at which forks to find my way.<br />
<br />
I remember the first time I saw a player with a Blackened Iron Bastard Sword, or the BIBS back then, rip through and hit mobs for 80 points of damage... my entire orc group was astounded.<br />
<br />
I remember sitting in one of 3 groups lined up at the gnoll spires in South Karana, grabbing fine steel weapons which they'd use to *twink* their characters (along with the uber leet full bronze plate, which now showed up correctly as a bronze color rather than the blue it had appeared as for months, they had also collected) and /random 'ing over split paw hide gloves.<br />
<br />
I remember SoldungB, and my first GE boot raid.  I remember going there with a small group of well equipped fifties during the super bowl when it was finally not camped, and getting my first pair, rather than paying the 9k for them that was the average back then.<br />
<br />
And oh gosh how I remember Lower Guk.  My first (pre nerf) guise, my first manastone, having my IVU dropped by those freakin bats...<br />
<br />
Anybody remember when being uber meant walking tall with a pair of SSoY's strapped into your FBSS?  Looong message board debates over whether a caster class should get to roll on a FBSS, or a tank on a manastone...<br />
<br />
Anybody remember PUBLIC Fear raids?!  The guildless fought alongside the guildies and all was good!  Except for when there were two raids at once and they often collided.<br />
<br />
Remember the first time you SAW a plane?  The fear? The first time you threw a nuke on a mob that was being destroyed by about 30 people?  The first zone wide equipment roll...<br />
<br />
And then lets not forget Naggy spamming you with dragon fear for the first time.<br />
<br />
And then Kunark came out, and the level maximum was raised... people explored, epics were figured out... and Karnor's Castle and Sebilis emerged.  People would go in groups and be in line to get their Seb keys, and every class was itchin' for that one piece of their kunark armor that had the &quot;good&quot; effect, like ES vambraces, or JB Bracer.  Screw the bard pants that summoned water, we want the good stuff!<br />
<br />
I remember when, just for fun, I spent a day trying a few times, then finally succeeding, in making it into the inner workings of Karnor's on Harmony and wits alone.  I remember when I killed Venril Sathir, and I remember when I got my epic.<br />
<br />
I remember when velious came out.  Remember the first time you saw a velious helm?  You were all like, WHOA snap, i'm all amazed by that wiggety wack jimma jam, it's all impressively shaped and such!  I know I was.  I also remember getting my faction up in Kael, and snickering at a dwarf who had to jump to get up each step. I remember the masses of uber players who decked the halls of Thurgadin as people ran back and forth upping their tradeskills, trading favorite recipes, etc.<br />
<br />
I'll stop rambling on now... but somewhere along LoY the game LOST its fun.  Nobody gives a rat's booty about levels 1-50 anymore, you go and post level 35 stuff on a board, nobody will reply except to maybe call you N00B... it's all about leveling quickly to 60 plus to raid in the new zones.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to go into specifics as to why I think EQ lost its luster because, frankly, I don't think it's important.  What I DO believe, however, is that it is IMPOSSIBLE for a MMORPG to go on with the same magic feel to it FOREVER, and that is a good thing...  you have a RL to live people, don't forget... but EQ had the largest lifespan of interest to me than any other game I have ever played.  Any other MMORPG games I played just COULD NOT hold my interest.  EQ was new, uncharted territory for the first few years.  Now it's just an old goat trying to keep up with the joneses (let's face it, no matter how much they tweak the graphics, a game made in 1999 will always be technologically inferior in some way to a game designed 5 years later, aka CoH or WoW).<br />
<br />
EQ2 indeed... the character's face on the box looks all misshapen and unrealistic imo.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes, hehe, my main was a druid... so before someone says &quot;HEY GENIUS, this is a shaman board, go quad kite somewhere else!&quot;, let me say that I didn't make my shaman until early 2003, and by then, the game's interest was beginning to slowly taper off for me... so I tend not to include him in much of my fond memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Wow Slim I think I started to weep about half way through your walk down memory lane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Heres a big problem Slim. <br />
<br />
MMORPGS are basically solved. All of them. End of story. You Power level, with a bunch of other people who powerlevel and there ya go. <br />
<br />
The closest thing we had to power levelers in those early days were people who were 1 level above &quot;red con&quot; to me. XP was hard in EQ. It was so hard, for the most part, that most people tried to combine loot aquisition with XP. If there wasnt SOMETHING available at a camp, you just didnt bother, even if it was easy XP. <br />
<br />
Everything was fresh in those days. Now, what is fresh? There is nothing &quot;fresh&quot;. New expansions in EQ arent &quot;fresh&quot; anymore. Every new game will probably fill up with people who find some XP spot and burn through levels as fast as they can. It seems to be the norm now, rather than the exception, and we have 5+ years of EQ to blame for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">EQ being dead is up to the individual. For instance EQ will be dead to me the day I say it is dead. I will quit and move on and be happy I dont play a game that made me unhappy. Because I was simply burned out from playing it so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">That's a really good point Blazz.  I remember it taking two or three weeks for me to get to level 8 in Beta.  Also, I remember actually experimenting to find recipes for tradeskills... I even made one of the clockwork pets they had back then.<br />
<br />
The only thing they've changed since experience wise then is cutting exp loss on death in half, which they did a few months after release if I recall correctly.  <br />
<br />
People now know the best places for exp and the best ways to get it, and since equipment that was once top of the line is now 50-100p max at the Bazaar, I guess the speed at which lower level people can shoot up sort of hurts the whole &quot;journey&quot; concept.  And I know that making levels harder to attain, as in perhaps creating lower exp at the lower levels, would definitely make people angry... seems that Sony is PROMOTING the level like crazy school of thought though, with things like pop books, the wretched paludal caverns, and that new regen change.<br />
<br />
I know y'all are probably tired of memories though, but I got a good one I forgot to mention... there was a necromancer deep in minotaur caves in steamfont, named Meldonox, who used to be able to charm PC's in beta.  He charmed me once, and I killed 3 players before it wore off.  They were like wth?  That was sorta funny hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">The new regen change is because melee classes are dying out at the low end. I made a new warrior to experiment with them. Now I play at Australian hours which have always been sparse, on luclin server which isn't the most populated, and the situation seems to be quite bad now. 3-5 PC's in GFay, 6-10 people on the LFG list most of whom are 65 of course. You basically can't assume you're going to find groups. In the old days you could progress from camp to camp and know there'd be players there, now you can't.<br />
<br />
The regen change is because warriors were having to solo, and I think we all know how productive that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">In the old days, you dindt find the sheer VOLUMES of information about the game, either. <br />
<br />
Now, any game that comes out will be mostly solved and &quot;beaten&quot; and the info will be disseminated in short order. <br />
<br />
This is what made DAoC seem so tedious. This is what ruined AC. Eventually, it will eat up any new game that comes out. Or any expansion EQ puts out. Just look here. Within 2 weeks of Gates going live, there was &quot;farm your spells&quot; tactics posted from here to every other site you can name. <br />
<br />
Now granted, on an individual basis, its up to you if you want to take advantage of the info. Personally, I think thats HALF the reason that EQ has such tedious timesinks. Who wants to spend HOURS figuring something out, then more HOURS doing it. So, we skip the first half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I just had to post here when I saw this topic, it's something I've been thinking about for awhile.<br />
<br />
I'm not one of those naysayers that say EQ is dead.  EQ is still going strong, just do a quick /played survey with your average pickup group, and you'll be surprised how many newb players you run into.  Players that still have so much of this game to see, and can't get enough of it.  Sure I think EQ is hitting a plateau right now, but considering the amount of new games coming out, EQ is doing pretty damn good.  Don't underestimate the loyalty players have to EQ and to their characters.  The fact that everyone here is so caught up in heated discussions about the current state of EQ, is proof that everyone wants this game to succeed and continue.<br />
<br />
If they play their cards right with OoW, EQ could kill WoW, Vanguard, L2, CoH easily.  Just think of it:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Graphics: New graphics we've always wanted.  Graphics that fully utilize DX9 and are on par with other games.  I heard something about a revamp of the PC models, the models need more individualism.  What if all our new items glowed like the Beastlord epic?<br />
 Character Progression: 5 more levels and a bunch of aa's, nothing like getting people into this game again by giving them more levels to achieve.  You forget how it feels to be 60 and looking up to the 65s who are so much more powerful.  High-end players can't stand not being the best, that's what drives them.  Make everything hard to achieve, but not impossible like GoD before the retuning.<br />
 Spells: With a little imagination, OoW could come up with some really cool spells for each class.  Spells that weren't just version 2.0 of old ones, but completely new spells that were interesting and didn't break game balance.  This is a tough task, but that's why Brenlo and Ryan get paid the big bucks.<br />
 Items: New Epics, remember how proud you were to get your Spear?  Remember how it made you feel like you were finally a true shaman.  Epic 2.0, especially with the unique (solo, group, raid) aspect sounds promising.  Every shaman on this board is going to want the epic 2.0 even if it looks like a Vah Shir on a stick ( I hope they change the graphic ).<br />
 New Content: At first I hated GoD, but lately I've been raiding Ikkinz and having a blast.  Instanced zones are a really good idea.  I hope OoW goes in this direction.  Instanced zones mean no guild wars, and no KSing.  The majority of players don't want to play on red servers, they're mature adults that find enjoyment in a game that allows them to interact with friends.<br />
<br />
It's a simple formula really, just put together some of the most basic things and EQ will be around for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What EQ had was good gameplay, and most of the items on your list are every bit as likely to bork that as improve it. Especially given the amazing lack of talent or insight I'm seeing from SOE atm.<br />
<br />
Hell, OOW reeks of desperation to me. We can't actually think of fun things to do so lets just offer the playerbase more shiny objects even if it ruins long term game balance.<br />
<br />
Instancing zones is fine. Instancing boring zones is still boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">But it is hurting (I've cancelled after 4 years and 1 previous cancellation)....for giggles I go to Player Auctions (like here even tho I quit, well for the second time) and it seems like there are ALOT more characters for sale than ever before...burnout and cash out I suppose.<br />
<br />
If its still fun keep playing.<br />
<br />
Lars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">You know, I tried to level and group as a mid level Enchanter.  Supposedly this is a needed/wanted class.  But I'd log on and a /who all LFG 39 45 would turn up like 1 or 2 people.  And I'd have no luck putting a group together.  There just aren't many people at all who are low level or doing low level alts these days.  I assume that is because EQ is dying.  Or perhaps, it's only worth playing the game after a certain level . . say lvl 60 for starters.  That sort of mentality is unhealthy for newbies, would cause them to quit the game early for sure.  So if no (or hardly any) newbies are starting EQ, and many people are leaving in a constant flow, EQ must be dying.  I think multiple accounts and Ebay pharmers have kept it alive thus far in the last year or so.  Now that Sony is getting into the exploitation of its own game via selling virtual crap for real money, and WoW, CoH, and other worthy games have or are coming out, I anticipate a loss of about half the subscriber base in the next half year.  Of course, this won't be enuf to close it down.  Even 250,000 accounts is a large amount at 13 bux per subscription/month.  Bout 3.25 million eh?  That's enuf to keep it going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Almost anything above zero will keep things going.<br />
<br />
But Drinal, where I'm at, seems very dead lately.  Nothing sells, the market is totally dead.  I checked plat prices and they've dropped 2/3 in a week.</div></div><hr />
