<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I am looking for some good places for my little brother and I to duo.  We're usually both in demand as far as groups go, but lately we've had several nights where we're just not needed anywhere.  (Probably due to our odd playtime.)  <br />
<br />
In any case, could you all recommend a good place we could go to duo?  I admit we're an odd duoing pair, but it would be great if we had a few spots to duo while waiting for a group or just killing time, getting some aaxp.<br />
<br />
I have Malos/Q/Bane/BoN/Pox, but I have no BoS or BoU.  He has most of his spells.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for any advice you can give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Itstak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would reccommend Veksar. Just let your bro play Tank with Dog Dog assisting. Most of mobs are undead slowable but epic DoT about only SHM DoT that will stick reliably. Almost all mobs summon so will be good to have 2 healing classes, also the mix of IVU and Invis will help get deeper faster. Some decent drops (Kylong Darkmail Type) and have gotten some very good words/runes at the highborn/nobles camp.<br />
 I 2-box a 65 Shm/Warr combo there often and haven't had much of a problem. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">See MCasts post on shaman soloing fungi king - having the cleric there too should make it pretty easy as you can stun the healers, add DPS and throw in way more healing power than you could possibly need :)<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia would be good too, again its soloable by a shaman but with the cleric there too you can keep all the named PH spawns clear easily. I find I can't quite clear them all before repops solo, though I'm not far off.<br />
<br />
If you want xp, then any tier one pop zone would be pretty easy. I'd suggest going across the river in PoN perhaps either fight the mobs there or in the maze.<br />
<br />
BoT courtyard is another possibility. Easy pulls there especially with cleric pacify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's an excellent ring that drops in SolC, the pocket zone off of naggy's lair.  The ring has Extended Enhancement 4 and the spawn name is Spiritmaster Heli. I have duo'd him successfully with a cleric may times.  <br />
<br />
Basically, once you're in the zone from solb side (kobold side) he spawns at the end of the first hallway/tunnel to the left.  You can scout to see if he's up with Vision, and also check for see invis mobs while you're scouting.  Usually there is only one or two mobs that will see invis but I've been lucky and had none.<br />
<br />
Heli spawns at the end of the tunnel with 2 adds right next to him, and 2 more shortly before his spawn point.   You want your cleric to pacify all 4 of these mobs and fight him in the room just before you get to these.   Just kill the two mobs in the 'camp area' and pull him to there, won't take you more than 5 minutes to kill him if you concentrate on dotting and the cleric concentrates on keeping you alive. I've found its best to just let the cleric keep SE on you and dont use Q, just dot the crap out of the guy and keep your mana for dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i partner sol ro with a cleric. only problem we have is when pacify resists...adds can get a little hairy.<br />
partnered some of the easier mobs in fire, bot is cake, hoh is cake, the fully slowable stuff in pos, pov=easy.<br />
you really have a lot of options open to you in places where mobs hit for under 800s and are slowable.  with a cleric parnter someone tanks, they are no good with root rott...they get bored lol</div></div><hr />
