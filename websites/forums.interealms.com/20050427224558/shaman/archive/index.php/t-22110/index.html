<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nope, never seen the pants on him, either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seen him drop them about 3 times out of about the 10-15 times I've dropped him.  Not that this reflects the drop rate, but they do still drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen em, and wear them - but it was a long time ago now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've killed this dude a few times. The first time I was on eci, and it was before the BoT drops were increased. HE only dropped a container that time I believe. The second time was on Eci, this was back in November. He dropped the pants, and my group awarded them to me. I declined them though, because I had plans to move servers. I figured let someone else get the benefit from them instead of getting destroyed on my server move. Little did I know, that was the very same night that the character move with items went into effect. Needless to say, I was not very happy the next morning when I read about the new server transfer option. On Mith Marr, I think I killed him myself once. No, no pants that time. I know that anytime I knew someone that killed him, I asked and have never recieved a report of them dropping. I have not been to BoT since my latest server jump, so I can't say anything about Quellious. <br />

hmm, doubt that crap I wrote is much help. Maybe try your luck in SRT? MM public seems to be pretty good at hitting all the mobs needed for SRT flags. A few of the mini's there drop the chain leg pattern, which I hear is a bit better drop rate than stingy Mr. Wavecrasher. I'm not sure if MM public hits SRT mini's, but I would not be suprised if they start very soon. <br />
<br />
Good Luck sam!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, thanks. At least there's still hope. =/<br />
<br />
I'm not usually on in long enough chunks of time or lucky times to get on too many pickup raids - but I have gotten MN, AD, RD and Virgins that way; still hoping to get the rest of my flags eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sam, you got the Sol Ro flag????<br />
<br />
That is your best bet on leg drops.  That is where I got mine in a couple of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, still need... TT, Bert, Saryn, TZ, VZ, and Villagers &amp; MM.<br />
<br />
:( Wow, that makes it sound waaaaaaaaaaay far away. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got a pair off of him, and I know a few people that got their chain pants off of Oreen.  Most likely he is being stingy - my friend killed the IS boss like 30 times and no greeves.<br />
<br />
My only advice is to keep trying, and one day you are bound to get them.</div></div><hr />
