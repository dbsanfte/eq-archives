<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Naturally I'm hoping everyone agrees with me, but I'm curious if there's a strong feeling about spell distribution models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dislike the current one since I still don't have any GOD spells. With the release of OoW slated for later this month, this will be the first expansion where I will still be missing the previous expansion's spells (Luclin ancients, excepted).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">G.o.D. has new spells?<br />
<br />
 :confused:  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dislike the typical dog and pony show BS that making drops from locked zones results in. Spells are the one thing that all players should have access too. We cant get access to your loot, we cant get access to your foci, we cant get access to your exp, why the heck keep us from having spells? Yes, it causes disparity between spell casting classes and melees, and I dont have an answer for that, but spells are looked at as a necessity by all players. I cant tell you how bad it feels to be level 65 and not have anything other than single target buffs. I had one group that called in a guild shaman to buff them before an LDON before I knuckled under and started getting my 63+ spells.<br />
GoD was a poor system to start, it got a bit better, but the drops are still way too rare and that causes a bitter desparity between haves and have nots. Vxed named farming can produce some good spells, but its a long hard road and you get your arse handed to you a lot if your not in Elemental + gear. Its mindless farming that isnt needed, its an artifical timesink, and with things already problematic these days, you think that SOE would use better sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I voted Kunark style.  That was fun.  Even my mostly casual guild then would raid Juggs in Sebilis and get like 30 spell drops.  That was cool, and any guild could do it if they tried and a slight amount of skill.  People loved it, and our raids consisted of folks who would be classified as &quot;non-raiders&quot; now.  EQ was more inclusive then.  <br />
<br />
I hated the PoP rune style off bosses, because unless you were a raider, you were basically limited to BoT bosses, and that sucked for a lot of people.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, you pharm plat and do the bazaar thing.  Some merchanting is good, but too much spell distribution through this avenue highlights a design problem.  <br />
<br />
The GoD system, imho, sucks donkey balls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looking back I like most the PoP rune way. May be change it to make parchments / rune tradeable and the spells no drop (and a trun in &quot;quest&quot; ala give shm_spell_a to npc_00 and get shm_spell_b, give him shm_spell_b and you get shm_spell_c, for shm_spell_c you get shm_spell_a). Add an ancient spell (no drop) to the expansion for the raiders. But don't make a core spell ancient that got no upgrade in this expansion (ala GoD canni)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well looking back at past expansions where there has been a level increase shows that it is very likely that the spells will be dropable, i'm hoping for a PoP style system for OoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's kind of been fixed through ancient spells/foci, but i'd like to see 2x+ the number of spells available.  Where the basic level (only slightly upgraded) was availble from a vendor, or a common drop like the spells in CS, then 1-2 more tier's of upgrades for the same spells from harder mobs/rare drops.  <br />
<br />
This is basically the way melee's wpns get upgraded and i kind of like the progression /shurg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I voted Kunark but if had any say, would like to see something along the lines of a mix between pre-kunark/kunark/PoP where the &quot;lower&quot; spells are merchant purchased available for all, the &quot;middle&quot; spells can be camped solo or single-group and the &quot;high&quot; spells through the style of PoP where you raid (3-4 groups not a 72 person zerg) to get a turn-in for your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
Make all the damn things vendor purchased. :mad: <br />
Even price them high if they want.  It will just help stabilize the economy.  They can adjust the prices every month just like they do the damn tribute values to normalize things.<br />
<br />
Or hell, make them a mixture of regular pp bought spells combined with some buyable with TRIBUTE points.  Wouldn't that be nifty. :p   Would force those who skipped buying that expansion to buy 2 instead of 1 (marketing would love that idea I'm sure :D ) and it would suck up a HUGE amount of items/pp that is floating around.  Would somewhat solve the lack of item decay problem in EQ that Tribute was partially designed to fix.<br />
<br />
The uber players wouldn't be farming for items &amp; plat much, as the guild coffers (or personal vaults) of the ubers could easily afford the hits, even if each spell ran 10kpp.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The best way would be multiple paths to getting the spells.<br />
<br />
Some dropped as loot. Other places That drop research spell components.  For the spells as well. And the ability to purchase them as well with Adventure points for that specific expansion. And even Quest versions of it as well.<br />
<br />
The more paths available for all parts of the game the better. Cause it would then encompass all the playstyles. <br />
<br />
But it should be that way for basic loot advancements as well. Power should not be available to only one subset of the customer base. But through various advancment paths. <br />
<br />
Augments are a fantastic example of this line of thinking.  They are good for any group and can augment gear from a wide varity of playstyles and can be achived through a varity of quests, drops or purchased with gameplay based adventures. All they need now are tradeskill augments and a nice base system for building upon it and we would be home free. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd go with Kunark or Popish style. As a nonraider i was able to get all my pop spells eventually. Between a mixture of getting the parchments myself and paying big plat for some. I was fine with that. I went out and busted my ass so to speak one way or another and eventually got them all. <br />
<br />
Ive heard people who raid say ( not all i'm not stereo typing) if you dont raid why would you need all your spells? i say why not? I push myself with my content i'm not just playing in the sandbox. If i dont have all that fancy raid loot i'm fine with that but i probably need that increase in heal in some places more than a raider with 2k more hps than me. The raider needs it more when they raid big stuff obviously. But this whole system in GOD leaves me feeling blah. Oow will be coming out and i'll be leveling and not having a single god upgrade...just wondering how thats going to be as mobs get tougher and oow spells are double secret probation nodrop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The true upgrades should be sold or done by a moderately difficult quest (no more than a group required).  In Luclin our ancient spells weren't necessary upgrades, they were more of a status thing.  You didn't need Scourge of Nife or Feral Avatar.  The ancient canni, which I was fortunate enough to receive last week, is a definite upgrade to a spell we've had since Kunark.  Most other classes' ancient GoD spells are upgrades to something they got a month ago.<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil and Daluda's Mending should have been on a vendor or achieved through a quest like Stoicism and Blood of Nadox.  Breath of Trushar isn't a crucial upgrade, so the way it's obtained is just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The one system I don't really want to see is all vendor purchased spells.  The other system I don't want to see is all no drop spells.  I am really hoping for a system that has a combination of Vendor, Common and Rare drop spells.  I wouldnt even mind a couple quested ones.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with the multiple paths concept<br />
<br />
Vendor for the basics<br />
<br />
Dropable ranging from common to rare off mobs<br />
<br />
with a mixture of maybe Quest and peraps the PoP style of spell distrubution.<br />
<br />
I really really really dislike how GoD is setup, spells should never be no drop unless the direct result of a Quest IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think we can all agree that the GoD spells in their first incarnation were a nightmare. I can't even remember how many spells my friends and I had rot farming that @#$%#$@% Sludge-Eating Fly. I think we equipped the entire enchanter population of the server with Apathy of the Nihil. Now, the system for the 3 types of Taelosian Geomancy Stones is a lot better - but the stones should be droppable. You need to get to Abysmal Sea to do the turnin anyway, so what's the harm?<br />
<br />
In general, I would like to see spells get a lot easier to get, even compared to PoP. People claiming that spells are like gear are making a very poor comparison. The sheer variety and availability of items for each slot is nothing like that for spells. If SOE wants to make more spells like the Luclin ancients, that's one thing - those spells were nice upgrades, but they weren't class-defining. Doing stuff like making our GoD canni an ancient is just stupid. That spell is the only upgrade we've had to a spell line that's been languishing without attention since Velious.<br />
<br />
Put the &quot;core&quot; spells for each class on vendors. Make the nice-but-not-essential spells a mix of common and uncommon drops from xp mobs. Lastly, put Ancient spells in the high-end raid zones - but as I said before, these spells should be nice (say 20-30%) upgrades to existing lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I went with pop, you can farm them yourself, farm the plat to pick them up yourself, whatever. it was easy enough.<br />
<br />
kunark...do you not remember the joke that was malo/torpor? hell the joke that STILL IS malo/torpor. grats making one classes 2 defining spells insanly rare. (been playing since 99 and I have never ever seen either of these spells drop.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I voted for PoP, but I would like to have another option.  As someone stated already, make the &quot;parchments&quot; tradeable and the spells no drop.  That serves to keep the plat content in game lower, because people arent farming for plat for 13 or 14 hours at a time just to buy one spell from another player.  I know that I logged about 40 hours just farming plat for my 63-65 spells.  That was about 120K plat all told; multiply that by 2000 people in a server and you have a HUGE influx of free range plat dumped into the market.  <br />
<br />
Making the parchments tradeable but the spells no drop will help regulate that I think.  Its possible that you will get the asshats that sell the parchments for 80K each, but I dont think that would happen (I could be wrong though)<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned research and I just wanted to say that untill we have the ability to reseach our own spells, researching should NOT be the only way to achieve some spells.  Research is a great way to get some spells that are hard to get (malo, torpor) but should not be the only way.<br />
<br />
GoD model has gotten better, but still doenst mean that its any good.  I spent weeks farming sewers with friends for spells, and the only spell drops I saw were beastlord spells and berzerker tomes.  Still have no GoD spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">RNG, thats what makes the game challenging.  Weather for a spell or during an encounter.   My guild is almost in Qvic so I have yet to see a Chaos Rune drop, so no Ancient Canni.  I still need Daludas Mending.  In time it will come.  On your server a TA may be rare as heck on my server they seem to drop at least 50% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Spells are just like armor and swords etc.  Should all lvl 65 Warriors get a Darkblade of the Warlord (http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/images/power/Time/tier4/Rallos/Darkblade%20of%20the%20Warlord.jpg) just because they are 65?  No.  Do they all went it?  Yeah why not it rocks.  <br />
<br />
I feel the same way about spells.  If you have the means to get them then you have the right to use them.  If you can't get them with the help of your friends or on your own or however then you shouldn't have them.  <br />
<br />
If you want to look at it from a RP point of view.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You have quested and quested but the mystical scroll seems to evade you.  The location on the map was wrong.  You find yourself mired deep in a swamp surrounded by kobolds.  You here them closing in.  Lucky for you a Wizard ports the group of you to the Karanas where you regroup.  Later that day back in Tumpy's Tavern you get you gang back together to go over the newest clue of where this scroll could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean its not a great story by any means but it gets the point across.  You aren't getting the spells/items because you haven't learned enough/progressed far enough to really use them.<br />
<br />
Altho Breath of Trushar is an Upgraded version of Quie, it is not used for the same things by me at least.  The higher cost makes it not worth using to heal canni damage.  But it is a godsend while in a spot heal rotation or by keeping your tank up in exp groups.  After slowing a mob just keep that on them spot heal when needed with fast heal.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Kunark, but more than how it's listed above.<br />
<br />
- Bought spells.<br />
- Common dropped spells.<br />
- Common dropped spells that can be turned in for other spells.<br />
- Rare spells (although not quite Torpor/Malo rare)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't think making certain spells rare as heck in certain zones is a good example of how things are done.  Look at us before PoP came out.  Our three &quot;best&quot; spells per se were Torpor, Malo and Pox.  How many of these were easy to get.  I personally have only seen Malo drop in all the months of killing stuff (was off of one of the Dar dragons in WW when I soloed it) and I've killed a lot of them.  I paid 25k for Pox, 45k for Malo and 55k for Torpor.  Now.. I imagine that there are some that have had to pay alot more for theirs.  This was not a good solution to have at least two class defining spells be a super ultra rare drop from mobs.<br />
<br />
I personaly think that the turn in method or vendor method is the best.  Like now, I think that maybe the spell itself should have not been the ancient, but at least it's good that I know what spell i'm going to get when I get the rune to turn in (GoD method of getting spells).  I would actually rather see them on vendors though.  This way anyone can get the spell if they have the 100pp for the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am sick of farming for spells.  Really.  For once (in a couple of years now), I would like to see my new spells available to me easily.  I am still trying to farm for my GOD spells with no luck.  If OOW spells are going to drop like GOD spells, then I'll probably quit EQ.  It's just not worth the effort anymore.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Spells are just like armor and swords etc. Should all lvl 65 Warriors get a Darkblade of the Warlord just because they are 65? No. Do they all went it? Yeah why not it rocks.  <br />
<br />
<br />
But your comparing some highend weapon with an little bit of an upgrade to spells. If a warrior doesnt have that weapon he can get a billion of the others around. Again if they do a system like this for OOw and let people get to 70 should it be such a pain to get spells? Am i going to be able to heal vs exp mobs at 70 with a pop heal?<br />
<br />
I dont know maybe i am wrong i just dont see why spells need to be exclusive like content and armor. I dont think a warrior is getting screwed because i could buy spells. I have armor slots to fill too. Again i have no problem with raiders getting bigger and better numbered gear. I also dont really care if there were uber raid style version of all spells that are better than what i can get. <br />
<br />
But i like people being able to get all of their regular version of spells. I dont want spells just handed out mind you. But if people are that worried about having exclusive raid style spells than why not make higher versions of all spells and keep regular spells more available. (NOT FREE). Again in the example of the warrior weapon. No they dont deserve to just have one handed to them but they arent going to be fighting barehanded and can still get some cool weapons. (bought and quested)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd rather see back to the old pre-Kunark style. <br />
<br />
I dislike the current system.  I have no GoD spells, but that's not necessarily the reason why I dislike it.  I know many who have at least one or all spells, but at the same time, it took some of them hours and hours a day for weeks to obtain a spell.  I myself took great effort doing the infamous &quot;Sewer Method&quot; or doing Vexd rares.  For me, it was always another class spell that dropped or none at all.  Then I moved on to KT and xp'd for spells, but either wouldn't drop or I'd lose on a roll.  Raid wise (Ikkinz, etc.), my guild have been rolling when a rune drops, simply because so many people need spells and it's easier on the officers' sanity.<br />
<br />
Getting a spell is by competetive chance, and that is what I really hate about the GoD system.  It's somewhat nice that runes are generic so that disappointment doesn't come when it's another class specific spell that drops, but at the same time that brings heavier competition.  I'm just glad my spells are *as* needed as what others classes may need.<br />
<br />
You'd think NPC guild masters would keep up with the times and do research themselves, and discover new spells and share it with their fellow shamans.  I'd gladly spend several hundred plat for each new spell, than drag through countless days of disappointment of not getting a spell.<br />
<br />
*Added*<br />
<br />
They could improve the current GoD drop system by consideratbly increasing the drop rate, and by letting random mobs in the lesser zones (Natimbi, Qinimi, etc.) have a chance dropping a rune.  Maybe spread out specific runes for specific zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If nothing else, we have certainly proven that the Gates method is the WORST by far, 6 of 79 when I voted.<br />
<br />
I dont want it to be easy. but like Snoww, I want multiple paths. If I cannot get the spells to drop in the zones I hunt, then give me anotehr possibility. I dont care if thats a quest or the bazaar. I can get pp. I can do quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Tradeable runes, with a NODROP spell reward on turn-in.  Brilliant Sythrax!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Like I said a Questing system for spells/items would be great...but it would also be abused by some jerk off.  Unless the results were no drop.  <br />
<br />
I like the GoD system of spells.  You get the spells when you need them.  <br />
<br />
If you drive back and forth to work each day 10 miles round trip thru the city, a Toyota Matrix is gonna get the job done for you more efficiently then a Mustang Cobra.  You aren't going to use the Mustang to its full potential in a 5 mile one way city driving scenerio.<br />
<br />
To ask if you are going to be able to heal effectively in OoW with a PoP heal is like asking the same about Kunark vs PoP.  Not as effectively for sure.<br />
<br />
I like the progression style of spell model.  You get the spell a zone before you need it or possible the ancients in a zone where it would make it easier to do.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly some spells are to powerful for older content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Quite frankly some spells are to powerful for older content.<br />
But that doesnt stop the uber-raider from single gpring content 3 expansions old using them.<br />
<br />
I am amazed no one has addressed the new spells in context of focus gear. Its likely that many new spells will be worthless if something isnt done about the focus gear. Get a 10-20% better spell and lose 30% focus because its 66. Its still not clear how they intend to address it and I am 100% sure it wont be till after release because its a lose/lose proposition. Many will want Focus 5 items (especially some raiders who then can always be more uber than their casual &quot;competition&quot;) while others will be majorly pissed if the spells are not equal or slightly better with the same gear (count me in this grp).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't mind the GoD system all that much, if only there would be a more even distribution of the different stones.  We have the &quot;standard&quot; jekli stone rot by the dozens, but still half of us need some of the other stones.  It would be realy nice if they could get themselves to start randomizing the droped stones, not making one specific mob drop just one type of stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My biggest issue with GoD spells is that they hardly even drop in raids.  Ikkinz and Uqua give up about 1 spell per three raids and it is always the same Jelki rune.  With PoP you could count on several spells each time you knocked off a named at least.<br />
<br />
Melee using the same runes for their disc abilites was a really poor idea as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have mixed feeling about options available... but I ended up choosing pre-kunark (sold at vendors). Why?<br />
  Well lets look at kunark model... Most good spells came from names that were shared by all casting classes. This ended up being that guilds who can farm names  could get and sell these spells to less fortunates. Now the price of any kunark spell is obtained for chump change at the bazaar .... So if a shaman really needs its he can buy it ... several extensions later.<br />
   The Pop model you ended up getting random spells for the same turn in scroll or runes. As guilds drop tons of these runes and scolls, the price has dropped like a rock on the bazaar. Again most people with the PP or the guild affilations can easily get the needed spells but again the spells only start to be affordable couple extensions later.<br />
    The  God model.... gag.... Again the chances of getting the spells will depend on whether you can get into a high level group that farms names. What will probably happen?  Many of these spells will eventually be sold at vendors a few extension later since the &quot;new&quot; spells are so much &quot;better&quot;. <br />
<br />
Lastly the option that was missing was LoDN type earned pts method. This one is probably the fairest  since it rewards people willing to put in the time to get their desired spells.<br />
<br />
So based upon  the choices given ... I chose  pre kunark because a shaman without  the right spells is a dumb race with a pointy stick. If I payed x dollars for an extension, I would expect to get something reaonable in return.  Spells are part of what makes it fun to play a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think the people that chose the GoD method must be sadistic. <br />
<br />
I personally really liked the PoP method. Eths and Specs are extremely easy to get and Runes aren't exceptionally hard between bot and tactics. It was a lot better then the pure randomness of kunark drops. There was some serious issues at first like one classes' eths being another classes runes, but once they straightened those out the system worked really well. <br />
<br />
I think a few primary vendor spells, a majority dropable turn in items, with dropable spells and at most 1 minor upgrade to a 70 spell (like luclin ancients, not the friggen god ancients) is the best route to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't view Malo and Torpor as representative of the Kunark style.  <br />
<br />
I still think SOE simply blew it on the Malo drop, and mistakenly put Malosini (a vendor spell) on the Juggs table instead of Malo.  <br />
<br />
Torpor was just stupid.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, the Kunark style was a nice mix.  Vendor/quest/drop.</div></div><hr />

Well, then the next time a GoD raiding shaman is in BoT slumming, they are going to  load up Turgors and never use Nihil right?<br />
Older content not being balanced vs new spells doesnt mean anything. Raids on Velious mobs that were previously 50+ people fights are now one groupable. Does this mean that the new gear and spells are overpowered? Probably yes, but that wont change how things are going.<br />
To follow your analogy, sure a POS car can get you back and forth to work ok if your only driving 10 miles in a city, but that Mustang is going to get you there a lot more comfortably and a lot more reliably than the POS. I will take the mustang please, I pay my monthly fees just like you do, if your not going to make the spells vendor available, at least make them so that I dont have to mindlessly farm for days on end to have a small chance at them. Collect a bunch of drops, add them to LDON vendors, whatthehellever, just give me a chance for them.<br />
At least if I want a phat car all I gotta do is finance it. SOE doesnt even give us that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">To ask if you are going to be able to heal effectively in OoW with a PoP heal is like asking the same about Kunark vs PoP.  Not as effectively for sure.<br />
<br />
I like the progression style of spell model.  You get the spell a zone before you need it or possible the ancients in a zone where it would make it easier to do.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly some spells are to powerful for older content.<br />
So let me get this straight. You should be able to hunt in the higher zones to get the spells you need, but you need those spells to be effective there . . .<br />
<br />
Come on, listen to yourself. Gear and such are designed so that what you are getting prepares you for the NEXT level. That being said, we should be seeing SOME spell dropages in Pre-KT zones (more than the 1 per 1,000,000 mobs we have now) in order to better be capable on the content in the &quot;higher&quot; level zone once we get there. Personally, I wouldnt have DREAMED of going into the EPs, or even Tier 3 PoP without Quies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">No Quest option?<br />

Harder spells should be quested.  I did that ratten fratten Cann II quest and it sucked until I was done and then I felt like the coolest shaman on the planet.  Now the ratten rfatten thing is on Vendors in Abysmal Sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I 100% understand and accept the differences in gear between the raiders and me(a sub-50 AA, all non-gates spell having, blue collar shammy).  I've heard 100's of reasons from those with unbuffed hp's over 6k, why I should not have access to the same spells as them.  I play 25-30 hours a week for fun.  To me fun is not milling around with 71 other people for 6 hours.  fun is doing an Ldon with the 1st 5 people  on the LFG list, no matter what classes they are.  Fun is completing a hard Ldon with a pick-up group. My idea of fun is different than those that have chosen the way of the raid.  Therefore, I am unworthy of attaining Gates spells and beyond with any reasonable chance of success. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I didn't add questing as an option because I didn't think of it.  Really there never was an expansion with that as a basis of spell distribution, just a couple of spells here and there.  <br />
<br />
That said, I liked having a few spells which were questable, and I've done them all.  Some more than once.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think Ancients should be questable.  This is EverQUEST right?  Jesus, they really need to incorporate questing more into progression, imho.  Particularly as an alternate path to raiding.  <br />
<br />
Imho there's no such thing as &quot;a spell that's too powerful for older content.&quot;  Character growth is all about getting more powerful and going back and kicking Mob_xx's azz.</div></div><hr />

Of course they complete screwed up the drop rates on many of the quests and took months to get them straightened out. <br />
<br />
A varitey of methods would be good as long as they are all obtainable.<br />
<br />
And comparing access to spells to access to gear is really just lame. Even with a full spellbook I'm have half the ability of a shaman with a full spell book and twice the unbufed hp and mana and every focus effect available. Their spells will hit harder, heal more, and they can dish out many more of them. Keep access to spells simple, gear is another story all together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The ability of all of us to get ALL of our spells should not be related to gear at all.  That was my whole point.</div></div><hr />

Without spells, we are all pretty much just L30 warriors that can't dual wield, taunt, or kick.  Put um' back on vendors like they were after release. :)</div></div><hr />

If they keep on this GoD style at OoW, they should designed OoW zone could be playable for the players without these spells.<br />
Casual players should have a chance to get spells.(GoD is xxx, because even now someone cannot get any spells. I never think it is fair and good system. Everyone paid same, but only 10-20% can get all spells even now(6months passed). Isn't it crazy?)<br />
<br />
And at least, for me, Spells are not same as items (although Dev team or someone said so).<br />
In most situation, Spells are required but Equipments are only preferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I voted POP runes, but Ideally you'd have some dropped and tradable, some quested, and some no drop (off specific mobs, maybe make them only drop that one spell) just for a little flavor. Acquiring spells shouldn't be a horriffic endeavor though, especially ones critical to the core function of a class (heals for priests shouldn't be difficult to get, nor canni for us)... spells that allow further utility can be rare as they are more of a convenience or niceity than a necessity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes that is exactly right.  If you re read what I wrote the &quot;regular&quot; spells should drop a zone before you really need them where as the chaos runes should drop in a zone where if you get them it helps you but it still isn't needed, just makes it easier.<br />
<br />
And to the person who thinks a Toyota Matrix is a POS well...its not lol.  Yeah it is 10k less then a Mustang Cobra but it drives nice.  I could have just as easily said an Imprezza STI which costs more then that Cobra.  The point was both can get the job done in that example one may be flashier then the other but the other is gonna do more efficiently.  <br />
<br />
Take those same cars and put them in a drag race.  With equal drivers the Mustang will smoke the Matrix hands down.  Its situational just like the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">But that doesnt stop the uber-raider from single gpring content 3 expansions old using them.<br />
<br />
I am amazed no one has addressed the new spells in context of focus gear. Its likely that many new spells will be worthless if something isnt done about the focus gear. Get a 10-20% better spell and lose 30% focus because its 66. Its still not clear how they intend to address it and I am 100% sure it wont be till after release because its a lose/lose proposition. Many will want Focus 5 items (especially some raiders who then can always be more uber than their casual &quot;competition&quot;) while others will be majorly pissed if the spells are not equal or slightly better with the same gear (count me in this grp).<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
I think they mau have already addressed it with certain gear already in game.  For instance.  Burning Affliction 4 vs Timeburn.  When the lvl cap goes up how hard will it be to change those items from spells up to 65 to spells up to 70?  Just an idea.</div></div><hr />

I got Daluda's about 2 weeks ago, and it's really really nice, but I never complained about Tnarg's while doing EP or LDoN. Not once. Once I get KT+ I started thinking to myself &quot;Hmm, Tnarg's really isn't cutting it anymore&quot;. Then when I got Daluda, it was a nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
Same with the new slow, and BoT. Would you survive in BoT/LDoN without those spells? Yeah, of course, you did those before GoD was even released...you did the BoT tower bosses, you did the named there, did hard LDoNs, did it all. You want to do cutting edge group content and need those spells? Guess what those are. That's right, Ikkinz trials. That means you're KT flagged and have access to these spells! Great system it is. You want to do hard LdoN with a pick up group? I was doing those before GoD existed. Tnargs, Q...all fine, and this was before I even started to raid.

Think about it this way. If they use a PoP model, you'll have Obkin's Mending (OoW heal) MUCH much earlier than you'll have Daluda's. Will you miss it? Probably not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sure wanted a better heal long before GoD came out. Its kinda pointless to hit a pre elemental tank with tnargs and not even heal one full red. You definately don't need it to exp in BoT, but for any kind of raiding in pop it makes shaman more useful instead of slow it and try and do some dps (for mobs without curable ae's at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">One thing is clear from this poll - people hated the GoD spell distribution method.  <br />

It actually doesn't take that much to make people happy.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if the Kunark style got fewer votes because a lot of people didn't play back then.  It surprised me some.  But then the Antonica method got more votes, and obviously fewer played even back then.  <br />
<br />
It occurred to me that maybe PoP got more votes because it's what people know best, and it's clearly better than GoD.  <br />
<br />
I didn't like the PoP distribution model either, but it was better than GoDs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's hoping they catch a clue in designing drops in OOW.  Itemization has been a problem for a while, and hopefully they will pay attention to this.  Things seem so slap-dash these days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I voted POP because at least there was a chance at some point for peeps to buy their spells.  I did about 150aa's in BOT and got ummmmm exactly ZERO runes for turnin but much of that had to do with a combination of initial bad luck, and then I passed after I had store bought all my spells.<br />
<br />
In Kunark I went on more Juggs, Track and Emperior raids/kills than I can count.  Probably 1000+ spells dropped (I'm not kidding) and ZERO count um ZERO Torpor.  I watched the auction channel for a year and ZERO Torpor offered for sale.  Obviously Quellious was a bit different from other servers and the &quot;uber - hard to think of them as uber now&quot; guilds never sold their excess copies, NEVER.  I see Torpor in the bazaar now and shake my fist at Verant.<br />
<br />
I like GoD, I enjoy playing in Vxed and Tipt and I have from probably 100 hours playing there exactly ZERO shaman spells (spells or turnin item).  Much of that play was prior to the turnin quest so I watched 8 spells be handed out.  I don't know what's up since the turnin quests were implimented - again some of my bad luck but I have spent probably 20 hours farming Vxed and not one named has spawned remotely close enough to go get it.<br />
<br />
I think that #1 bosses need to spawn a bit more, #2 spell drops from named need to be beefed up a bit since I have seen less than 50% of the named drop spells.  But the primary issue with GoD is getting group going since so many people are chicken to go there and prefer mindless leveling in earth or fire.<br />

<br />
Another idea instead of the turn in option would be for SoE to implement functionality to check for memmed spells before giving the quest reward. A person would be guaranteed to get a spell they don't yet have but they wouldn't necessarily get the one they wanted the most. I have no idea how hard it would be to add that type of logic to the game.<br />
