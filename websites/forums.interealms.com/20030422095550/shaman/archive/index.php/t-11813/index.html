I have no horse at the moment and was wondering if that should be next purchase? <br />
<br />
I was also thinking of getting a solstice earring, but after that not sure what to work on. Any advice and comments would be greatly appreciated.<br />

The back slot is a little weak too, Being agnostic I'm assuming your a kitty so take the time to do your class quest.  With a little help from a guild the Dar Khura Officer's Cloak should not take too long and is AC 12 with +50hp and +50mana and some stats too.  If that's not possible a Coterie General's Cape is cheap and very nice.</div></div><hr />
