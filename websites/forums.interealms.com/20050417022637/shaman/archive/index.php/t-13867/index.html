<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, was looking for some suggestion as where I could possibly head to at my level , which is 35. Here is my magelo link if it helps with suggestoiins http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=682146 . Also the strategy I am currently using is sending in pet and at the same time hitting them with my slow. Next I usually dot with EB and Scourge and then I go in and meele some. I have been doing this is DSP and now the xp is lacking :(. I get about 1/2% per kill sometimes 1/3%. Maybe it's becuase of that bad race penalty :( So any ideas on where I may head to? Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />
