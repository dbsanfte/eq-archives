<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mishkaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone any feedback or ideas on this would be great.<br />
Last week I started Lagging very bad in every other zone I would enter, to the point I would have to camp out and come back to clear the lag. Then about 4 days ago, I started going Ld about every 20-30 minutes. Most the time It was due to my Aol booting me. Then I would have to restart my computer, due to it freezing up, and I was having problems signing onto my Aol. Then came the real kicker, I could go through the patch server for Ez, but once I got to the log on server, it would just hang, then give me the error 1001 message, Cannot connect to log on server please try later. For 3 days on Aol I couldn't connect to Eq. I went to the online Eq Tech chat, after going through 3 techs, the last one finally told me, that he had tried sending me signals, but I was blocked from getting them. and that if I didn't have a firewall, then it was my Isp blocking them. (I don't have a firewall) I contacted the Aol Tech help by phone, and they were anything but helpful, the tech made sure I was able to surf, and to play THEY'RE online games! and said if I was blocked it was coming from Eq. /Gasp<br />
Well.... I had tried updating the drivers for my modem, uninstalling and reinstalling my modem, reinstalling Eq, reinstalling Aol, updating Aol, changes the datarate transfer rate, changing the modem speed... everything I could think of nothing worked. Finally I tried to just download Earthlink.... I made an earthlink account, and tried to enter Eq.... Lo and behold, I could get past the log on server on Earthlink. Unfortunately the connection on earthlink is so slow, 21000kbs that I couldn't keep my Eq connection, I then Tried At&amp;t, and could actually play again.<br />
Although the At&amp;t connection is pretty slow also, not as slow as the Earthlink... Just for a test, after playing on At&amp;t for awhile, I logged on Aol, and tried to sign on Eq, The same thing... error 1001. Although I know Aol sucks, its my fastest connection... Does anyone have any Ideas on how to fix this Aol problem? Since the techs are Clueless?</div></div><hr />
