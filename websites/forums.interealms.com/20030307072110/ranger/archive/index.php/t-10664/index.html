<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">204 now.  hopefully i can get that magical 210 mark and then i'll take my gnomes tinkering from 75 to 100 or so and have compound darkwoods i can make for profit.  gona be a long ass time tho =/<br />
<br />
Wish halfelves could make something decent with fletching, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The discount on hiring a tinker to make your cams is not just for those who are at 210.<br />
<br />
15 plat per cam, or whatever you pay for your pet tinker to make them, is a lot better than 37.8 plat per cam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually i made a tinker who can make cams.  only at 75 skill right now but i dindt lose my mony on cams.  It was actuall mostly lost on trying to make 2cam bows.<br />
<br />
Too many failures on 2cam darkwoods at 202 -204 skill.   I got both of those skillpoints when I quit trying to make 2cam bows and started making rough darkwood recurve for the 20pp loss per success.  <br />
<br />
Gonna do what you suggested and get to 210 that way and then start with the 2cam darkwoods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Neclon,<br />
<br />
Make *one* cam darkwoods until they trivial.  Yep, it's a the same trivial as rough darkwood recurve but you won't lose plat on the sellback :)<br />
<br />
Also, find a friendly 49+ shammy to buff your DEX as high as possible.  HoS first, then Dexterity stacks and adds a boatload of dex.  I skilled up once per 15 combines at 255 DEX (vs. once per 40 combines at 192 DEX), so I'm a true believer in buffing  DEX for fletching skillups now.  (My WIS was just 95, my INT far lower still).<br />
<br />
hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duncynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is my support for Dex.  At 255 Dex I averaged one skill up per 20-25 combines from 235 to 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree on the dex.  Get that up, especially now, while you're trying for the skill aspect of it.  Once you're making money on the bows, don't worry about the dex.  Trust me on this.  I've made over 33k on the bows.  After you trivial them, there is nothing to relieve the tedium (yet another reason I recommend hiring a gnome; someone to talk to).  The first ten k is exciting; even after the triv is reached; after that its just boring.  VERY boring.  I'd have gotten a LOT of better gear, if it wasn't so boring.<br />
<br />
210 is when I started to make a profit on the compound darkwoods.  I'd gotten a geerlock by then.  If you do not have one, then you might actually need to get to 215, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Oh, get that tinker to 100+ tinkering.  the success rate increase on teh cams alone is worth the effort.  Remember, the cost of a darkwood staff and the string is fixed, as is the amount you get back from a completed compound darkwood.  The difference is both the cost of the cams and the profit you get.  Minimizing the cams maximizes the profit part of that difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crowtisst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stupid question, but how are all of you making a profit from fletching?  Selling bows in the Bazaar or to vendors for quick cash?  I haven't worked on my fletching much since getting my Tolans Bracer, (currently stuck at 170) since there didn't seem to be a payoff in the end.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is no profit until you get to about 215 skill.  And even then only profit when you use tinkered cams and make darkwood compounds.<br />
<br />
In the grand scheme overall picture you are not really making money.  The money and time you spend getting to 215 in fletching and 102 in tinkering is far more than you'll make with these bows. <br />
<br />
If you do not fail more than once in a full batch (mule carrying 8 backpacks) you make about 500-600 plat.  Full batch takes about 30 min.<br />
<br />
That's decent cash but not astounding.  This is making stuff and selling back to vendor.  The reason you make money is the price is set for a small loss if you buy the cams from the vendor.  Tinkered cams are 1/3 the price of vendor but you get full price for the compound bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Neclon, I have to disagree with you here.<br />
<br />

<br />
I spent time, true.  However, I'd spent nowhere near 33k in the skilling process.  Also, I do not believe that farming cash would have been as effective timewise.<br />
<br />
If you only need a k or two, then farming cash is faster than skilling up.  If you need 10k or 20k, then skilling this up will take less time.  The more you need, the more time you'll save in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With the fletching geerlok I actually made a bit of money going from 202 to about 212 on one-cam darkwoods.  Tinkered cams, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is definitely the easiest fastest way to make money.  On the flip side I run into the same thing I always have.<br />
<br />
I want to lvl up =P.  And this is much more time consuming than I thought it would be for making cash.  I average about 600pp per run. (got a mule for carrying 8 backpacks, 3 of which are handmaid, and my tinker is 102 tinkering).  Each run is 20-30 minutes.<br />
<br />
While that is easily more cash than I can make hunting it is not a big enough profit margin to keep me from hunting.  And if you hunt sebilis the cash you get from there can quickly equal or surpass this number (if you get a blue diamond, and there's some spots in the dungeon for getting those pretty easy).<br />
<br />
Bug given the new PoP bows I will DEFINITELY be skilling up.<br />
<br />
SOOOO .... Any suggestions for skilling from 235+?  Looking for the cheapest way, but also fairly quick (farming acryla materials not an option here, specially since I have no smithing skill, unless it's insanely fast skillup and good profit).<br />
<br />
Does the 1-cam shadewood rule apply here?  Or is that a big loss?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another big supporter for Dex here. If you don't have a shaman handy (or want to be self sufficient), invest in some dex gear. BEST investment I have ever made hands-down. Check out my post in this forum :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Silvanoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">myself, i had cha buff for prices, shammy buffs for dex, and kei for wisdom, i then went to a arena and got my primal to proc for max dex of 260, and i still only got 4 skill ups spending 20kpp!!!  Either i was extremely unlucky or verant just hates me lol.  BTW, i went from 234-238.  On another note, does anyone think i would be able to succesfully make one of those new nightmare bows from pop?  Im still at 238</div></div><hr />
