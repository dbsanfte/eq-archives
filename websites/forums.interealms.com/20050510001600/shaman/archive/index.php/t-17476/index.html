<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somethings been buggin me for a while now.<br />
<br />
I have been busting a gut to get my HP as high as I can. Currently I have approx 5500 HP buffed. ( I am allways with a Clerics and Paladin so hardly even know what my unbuffed HP is)<br />
<br />
Anyway, this much HP is serving me well, very well in fact. To the point that I can not remember the last time I was the target of a low health aggro or died due to a silly can 5 or was unable to withstand a hit from *insert POP boss here* I play with a gutsy style and fully expect to get a bashing when I slow eary, and I do...slow early when its sensible eg in exp groups. I stand right next to the MA, I suck some hits while slowing to conserve Healer mana (cause I can Q myself so I dont need a Healer, and I allways have mana) and this works well.<br />
Of course if its a boss I dont start ping pong and suck aggro off MA's or anything silly, I know how to work my shaman real well. (I've been doing it for 3 plus years and have only one alt which is 20)<br />
<br />
Now my problem is this, I am now starting to kill POP bosses for elemental flags. Some of the items has desirable Foci, which in turn require that I give up a little HP or upgrade a slot I had targetted for a high HP item with something with Foci and lesser hp.<br />
<br />
As an example I have replaced my 100hp shield (the one off Aary, Whitestone I think it was called) with the Orb from the BOT Lightning Boss (Brynui or something), this cost me for about 30hp and a few ac (allways above 1100ac, I'll never go below that) but earns me a 10% saving in mana for detrimental spells, of which I cast a hell of a lot and have noticed a big difference<br />
<br />
So I am wondering, perhaps 5500hp buffed is ok for me? perhaps I dont really need to keep busting a gut for hp, maybe I should just let HP come as it comes and worry more about the foci (healing, mana conservation etc etc)<br />
<br />
I really am interested in hearing from people flagging for Elemental or in Elemental for thier experiences, do you really find you NEED 6-7k hp? is it just the saftey of having 4-5k still on your bar after a C5 that you want or is there more to it? what am I missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its so you can tank Vindi for a lower lvl guild silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My shaman (Teesa) has approximity 5500 HP buffed (Pot9/Symbol/Brells/etc) and 1050 AC.  Last night while doing Sigismond Windwalker in I got hit a few times.  Well, let me define a few, he quaded on me and I was dead.  One round.  And he didnt do his 3.5k proc on me either.  But this was during a wipe, not on the initial slow.  I have yet to pull aggro off a BoW using warrior on a fast slow though.  When your dealing with mobs that can drop a 10k warrior in 1 round, you want it slowed as fast as possible.  Even if that means you get aggro and insta death from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">after stop solo for AA and hit 3500hp+ unbuff, I don't care much about more HP, PoP raid mob hit dumn hard. <br />
<br />
I just try focus on good effect, especial focus that effect all spell; like VT crown(15% extend to buff/dot/debuff), 18% spell haste, max FT , mana saving, extend range etc  also good clicky toy or worn effect is nice<br />
<br />
anyway, HP so cheap and don't need worry about it, because every item have good HP those day, especial the one with nice effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My shaman (Teesa) has approximity 5500 HP buffed (Pot9/Symbol/Brells/etc) and 1050 AC.

<br />
But if I get aggro on a POP boss for more than one round I would expect to die anyway - I think a lot of 7k shaman would aswell, and if you get aggor during a wipe...well...the writings on the wall.<br />
<br />
And regarding the need to slow asap for the mob that can drop a 10k warrior in on round. The same argument applies again, if you get the aggro at all you are going to die regardless of whether your hp is 5500 or 7k and regradless of whether your slow stuck or not (unless you are incredibly lucky and he misses a couple of rounds or someone sucks the aggro off you quicker than greased lightning) In either case .<br />
 I'm happy to be told I am in error as this is an exercise in understanding the shaman/hp connection (aside from C5 requirements)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You just need enough buffer to survive the usual attentions from PoP yard trash and 3.5K+ unbuffed is pretty decent for this.  You are not supposed to be taking hits in PoP anyhoo...that is what all those knights your guild recruited are there for.<br />
<br />
Focus effects are important down the road and very worth giving up a few hp for.  Most items with the nicer focus effects are anything but shy on hitpoints so you usually don't need to make trade offs.  Just browse some ele+ gear charts and you will usually see a focus effect packaged neatly in with 130+hp/mana and other crap.<br />
<br />
Don't forget those resists either.  Walking up to the Arbitor in PoE with 400+ MR sure beats getting bent over and dismissed.  Sure, some mobs in PoP have ridiculous neg mods to your resist base, but not all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The amount of HP you can get away with in POP is sort of something you learn what your limits are as you go along.<br />
I've got 6500 hp fully raid buffed.<br />
It's enough that I'm starting to be able to take a swipe from a major mob target and can still live through it.<br />
I go to PoV and I tank golems down that hit for 650ish when I'm only self buffed up to about 4500hp and have no problems.<br />
Most xp mobs in POP don't hit much more than about 700 in fact.<br />
It's mostly the raid targets that you have to worry about, but even then, when a named is hitting for up to 2k and has a 3k proc like Mith Marr for example, the difference between 5500 and 6000 and 5000 hps isn't much.<br />
If you can hover around 5500 or so, you should be fine.<br />
Go for focus effects.<br />
Focus effects mean a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6813HP raidbuffed, but I remember just a few months ago I was pretty much in your exact position.  I didn't really have any focus effects at all, expect for coldain shawl.  Now, I have pretty much every focus effect except some form of improved damage.  I have found that for the most part, the problem pretty much takes care of itself because all of the items with nice focus effects also have awesome stats.  However, if I had to choose between a focus effect and a few HP (less than 50) I would easily choose the focus effect.  Any kind of mana savings or spell haste is going to help you a lot more than enough HP to survive 1/20th of a hit from a elemental trash mob.  For example, I would rather wear a suit of ornate that a suit of something else with more HP but no focus, such as player smithed earth chain or something along those lines.  If I had to rate focus effects I'd rate them like this, in order of desirability:<br />
<br />
Detrimental Haste<br />
Beneficial Haste<br />
Beneficial Mana Pres<br />
Improved Healing<br />
Detrimental Mana Pres<br />
Flowing Thought<br />
Burning Affliction<br />
Improved Damage<br />
<br />
Note that I made this list with maximum raiding efficiency in mind.  If you solo or try to do DPS in groups often, detrimental mana pres would probably be closer to 2nd on the list.<br />
<br />
As for how much HP is &quot;enough&quot;, that is a bit harder to say.  With 5500, about to break in to elemental planes, you are doing fine.  I was right around 6k when we hit EPs, but the other shamans were pretty much where you are and everyone did fine.  If you get aggro from a boss you are going to die.  If you get aggro from a trash mob you will probably live unless your healers just suck.  More HP helps, but if you just use a little care when you are debuffing and make sure that the mob is tanked or mezzed before you try to slow, you'll be just fine.  More HP really only gives you more room for error.  Just try to make no errors to begin with and you'll be fine :)<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I find a larger mana pool and more FT to be more useful than HP, because it allows me to chain tnargs on the MT during the boss fights for longer.  I'm just sitting there, not getting hit, only using canni5 every 3 minutes and just casting tnargs nonstop.  I am not really making use of my HP in most situations.  Like I said, though, the problem solves itself because all the gear that is about to become available to you that has nice focus effects will also have nice hp and mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't kill yourself over focus effects if you guild really is going to be getting to the elementals. Things like elemental boots/sleeves, fennin ro belt, solro mini shield, and the like will give you the HP *and* the foci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i am going to have to agree and disagree at the same time.<br />
i am about 6200 buff hp, and have a fair number of focus effects with me.  once you hit eps most of the focus stuff you want will have better hp/mana/ac than what you are wearing.  who knows, you might even max your wisdom =p<br />
<br />
i solo a lot so personally getting all i can out of my hp is importaint.  i don't give up a nice effect for 40hp or less, but i can only think of one good piece of gear (statewise) that i have seen drop and had no effect.<br />
have the hp is going to help you living through slowing the trash mobs, that may agro you off the knights.  the rape spiders in poa come to mind =p  you may live though part of a round from a boss encounter if you are lucky...to be honest i started feeling a little safer at 6k hp, and i noticed the clerics actually had a chance to heal me before i dropped (tanking trash that is).  stuff in fire doesn't 1 round me to death, and i can tank stuff in sol ro without behing scared (defencive aas are clutch too).<br />
i am aiming for 7k buffed hp as my next goal so shoot me =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Boy do I feel inadequate now.  63 and about 4500HP raid buffed.  Might have pushed close to 4800HP at one point too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have about 5850 hps with raid buffs, and it's been sufficient so far, I don't really focus on acumulating hps however, but more are nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">6882hp, 1350+ac raid buffed.  I can survive agro from most mobs, even bosses, for one round at least - but having LR5 plays a big factor in this.<br />
<br />
5500hp is awesome, but you're in the elemental game now.  You need as much as you can get.  Invest in LR5 if you haven't already.  LR5 is godly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't know what AA you have but get LR5 asap.   I've taken 2 rounds of attacks and lived off a few PoF mini's that hit for around 3k.    He missed 6 times tho =)   Of course usually LR doesn't fire and you get dropped in 1 round....<br />
<br />
I have around 6250hp's buffed, and I'm wearing cog-epaulets off the poi mini over the 85hp shoulders off the pof-mini-mini strictly due to the beneficial spell haste.   3 second Q's are far more worthy than 20 hp's.   Depending on the effect, it's definitley better to go with focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Demisius is dead on there--AAs can make a huge difference in your formula.<br />
<br />
I'm now at 7069 HP with the right food, 7096 if I swap some gear around and give up some resists. AC is over 1500 now. (This is basically elemental gear in every slot it comes in except BP, which is still good old Vindi's).<br />
<br />
With LR 5 and whatever the Stability one is called (Innate Defense?), I can take a round of damage from Guardian of Doomfire and walk away around 50% damaged. If my HP were still at 5500, I suspect I'd get low-HP aggro and go ahead and die after that round of whomping.<br />
<br />
The combination of high AC and high HP that shaman get with being a chain class, plus those avoidance/mitigation AAs, really pays off at that point in the game. The only times I die on raids any more are 1) I'm the only shaman there, which means I eventually bounce slow twice on the same mob and aggro the crap out of him, 2) we TPW, or 3) I do something stupid, like target and slow a mob that isn't picked up by a tank immediately.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If your guild is cracking into the elemental planes soon don't worry about HP vs. Foci. Most of the gear that drops there has fantastic HP/mana stats and has focus effects too. As was just mentioned above concentrate on getting your defensive AA's maxed. CA3, then LR5 and CS3, then ID5.<br />
<br />
I have about 6300 HP raid buffed and can survive the occasional smacking mostly due to having the above mentioned AA's. It feels great when the named mob misses you a couple of times although I recomend not getting agro to begin with, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ND, CA, CS, LR and ID are the best AA's outside of Cann5 that i think a shaman can go for. They make a huge difference especially if you are in a mid sized guild that will NOT be hitting the Elemental Planes. With 5k+ hp and 1100 ac (raid buffed) i would get pounded by mobs if i got aggro. Now with these AA's i can stand and take the hits for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all for that. After Cann5, I got RC1, SCR3/M, MGB, QB1 for the class title mostly, then CA3/LR5.<br />
<br />
I thought I'd stop at this point and get VP or Spirit Call or something kind of fun, but after seeing the effect of LR5, I'm going to get ND3, then start in on CS3/ID5.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with what I've got so far -- RC1 has been immensely useful, and I'll highly recommend SCRM for anyone, plus if you're in a raiding guild you should have MGB.  But going for the defensive AAs right afterwards is sure looking like a good plan to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks everyone for the incredibly usefull comments, I had no idea defensive AA's were so effective.<br />
<br />
Currently I am ..<br />
C5<br />
MGB<br />
SCR3<br />
RC1<br />
VP3<br />
<br />
...and last night I got...<br />
<br />
ND3 (150hp more, I was impressed)<br />
<br />
My next target is SCRM I was wondering where to go from there.<br />
<br />
I'll be investing in defensive AA's now and I'll be a bit more confident about my hp versus foci.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">just one more thing to consider that wasn't mentioned above:<br />
<br />
dodge % mod<br />
<br />
I know the returns here are *very* minimal compared to defensive AA's or better gear, but every little bit helps. there's quite a few items out there now with this effect, even some LDoN augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Apart from Canna 5, LR5 is the best AA out there, leastways imho.<br />
<br />
Forget scrm and go straight to LR5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">@Barbacus - fill out SCRM like you're planning. Then I'd suggest QB2 (faster heals are godly, quicker buffs are just nice), followed by the defensive AAs above (CA3, LR5, then the mitigation ones). Maybe consider SC1 somewhere if you solo much pre-PoP stuff as its quick and easy, but useless for raiding.<br />
<br />
I've never seen any parses to show what difference dodge makes. I've got a tracking wolf collar (5% dodge I think) but its more for the other stats than the dodge. Is it all that effective? If so I might hang on to it a bit longer, was thinking of getting a shimmering slime one instead.<br />
<br />
AA wise, I've played around a bit (got VP, SCF, RC, SC, and even level one of gift of healing), but next on my list is definitely ND3, CA3, LR5, partly due to all the good things said here about the effect they have.</div></div><hr />
