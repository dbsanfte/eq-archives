<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the one question everyone is wondering is how much aggro does a curse counter generate. Disease counters do not generate much aggro, but poison ones create immense aggro. Slowing and tossing on a BoS in a typical exp group means being unable to sit down for the duration of the fight, assuming the tank can even keep the mob off of you while standing.<br />
<br />
If curse counters make for small aggro, these quick acting DoTs will be great in exp groups for quick damage, and even better for PvP. If they are just like poison dots I fail to see their use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like them, more dps, especially the level 44 one. It would be nice for those mobs that go down too fast for even poison dots to be effective. It's only 20 mana more than ebolt, but does a little less total damage, but you get it 5 levels earlier than ebolt. I'm thinking they will have a lot of aggro though.<br />
<br />
I checked alla's, there are also lower level versions of group resist buffs, I believe adding 40 to resist, not bad for level 34-39 group buffs.</div></div><hr />

This should be corrected I'd guess, the spell message and icon are curses, but the counter is poison, no mention of anything to do with a curse effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think this new line makes sense, if finally gives more purpose to spells like remove curse/remove greater curse...  definitley a chance of these going live imo.<br />

After malo i dont have trouble landingo n anything unless its like AoW or something.

no we do not need lure's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">so if they don't need to have a resist adjustment, are you telling me that you would devote a spell slot to one of these curses if it goes live?  because quite frankly, if it bounces, you can't cast it for another half a minute.  that seems like an awful big drawback.  if i have a spell that costs as much mana as these do, is magic based, and i can't use it immediately after i bounce it off a mob, i would toss it in the back of the book.  <br />
<br />
not to mention, when you say we can malo, what levels are shamans typically fighting mobs they need to malo?  57+.  if it doesn't have a resist adjustment, and it maintains that long recast and higher mana cost, they're a worthless spell line until you're using malo on every mob.<br />
<br />
give me a resist adjustment or do away with the long recast and greater mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well its a strong point you make, but if you know what mobs are resistant to what, then you can use the appropriate spell, i mean trying to land turg or this DoT on a Reaver and getting upset when it doesnt would be kinda silly if you ask me. Im still unconvinced that we need lure, just more knowledge of what lands on what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">These spells aren't in their final form (the level 44 spell's damage alone should be enough to tell you that).  Don't sweat yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">on the question of resist adjusts - ever fought in the east wing of BoT / forrest giants in PoS?  Those buggers bounce every cold and poison based spell I've ever thrown at them, but are quite susceptible to magic and disease.  Now, my best disease dps is somewhere around 40 (BoU and PoB), with 50% of the mana wasted since the mobs die too fast.  That magic dot (and just one) has 84 dps, stack it with the lower version and you are running 140 dps. I take that any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">assuming they don't bounce.<br />
<br />
The curse is not dealing as much damage as your comparable poison dot.  And on top of that, it costs a tad more mana.  The advantage is the shorter dot duration, and hopefully, less agro it will generate.  This is obvious and I would completely love this spell if it was just like this.<br />
<br />
But what then is the motivation behind the long recast delay?  It just seems like overkill on the cost/reward factor considering the lower damage and greater mana cost.</div></div><hr />

The curse is not dealing as much damage as your comparable poison dot<br />
[quote]<br />
what dots are you using? I might have missed one, but BoS is 320 per tick, compared to 512 per tick for the curse.  Last time I checked 512 &gt; 320.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The dots are different durations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you thick headed?   <br />
<br />
I don't care if I land slow or not on a mob, but when my brother who's 6 levels lower than me can land his magic based dots like nothing then I have a problem with it.   If a mob is resisting ALL magic based spells then fine, no big deal.  But that is not the case with a lot of mobs and a lot of druid magic based dots and some necro dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Damn wonder if you can stack 2 of those curse dots together, both landing would be very nice damage. Oh another point, At lvl 65 shamans basically have a -55 resist adjustment to all resists. If  you want to compare swarm resist, that is -100 resist adjust. Would be nice to have this as -resistadj especially because duels at the high end, an opponent with 140 in all resists and a dispell item its very hard to land anything but nuke. But then again pvp balance is messed up anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We can already stack all our DoTs. Even though they are all poison and disease we can cast every one of our DoTs in the spell book on a mob at once for some massive damage (and massive aggro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hmmm.... I am curious about what DPS could we get stacking all those DOTs ... <br />
<br />
(epic, bone of bertox, envenomed breath, venom of the snake, envenomed bolt, bane of nife, ancient: scourge of nife, blood of saryrn, scourge, plague, pox of bertox, breath of Ultor )<br />
<br />
And then if you stack the new course DOTS... I think casting times wont allow to stack that much DOTS, but it could be a nice BIG DPS if it was posible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well any mob with enough HPs to survive that kind of damage (not that you could ever get more than about 3 poision DoTs on at once) would give you such a pounding from outright agro that you would invalidate your test with a loadin screen :) <br />
<br />
I would guess if you planned carefully you could feasibly get The Bone, Ulthor, Epic(here to take advantage of no clicky recycle time), Pox, Plague, blood, bane and the new curse before something would start dropping... assuming you could survive agro or not get summond. if you add Scourge and  into the mix you would be running out of spell slots (for one) and your mana would be taking a pretty serious hit by the time you got to the second Poison DoT or the Curse... which wears off so fast you would only really get 2 maybe 3 ticks of complete damage before the Epic or the poison started to drop. Dont forget to include recycle time in the cast time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">These curse dots that seem to have unusually low damage, perhaps they're more like the epic in that damage goes up every tic ?<br />
<br />
Personally I love the new line of faster dots. Most of my xp groups even my poison dots never have a chance to do expire anyways so this is good. The recast doesn't really matter that much since it only means I'm dotting one mob at a time, which is a decent tradeoff for getting the damage in faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone else notice that the new mongoose line of sow doesn't seem to have the outdoor only restriction ? Seems appropriate for a dungeon expansion, no ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Feedbacked this enough, we NEED lure curse dots.  At least -100 to say, MR or even PR.  Make it so that they can steal mana as well... that would be truly nasty.<br />
<br />
Mana and HP stealling dots, say 512 hp for 4 ticks, and 300 mana for 4 ticks would be DIVINE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Also, for PvP servers most classes have high MR end game so... a neg modifier even at -300 lure base would make us king of the dots, or at least make us a bit more feared, though I like that hp/mana steal best.<br />
<br />
If the dot went like:<br />
<br />
512 a tick for 5 ticks<br />
300 mana a tick for 5 ticks<br />
lure base -300 mr<br />
casting time: 5 seconds<br />
<br />
would be so strong, and would really boost our powerbase and make us more then just a DoT till you are summoned class.  Chanters share our spell lines, why cannot we share more of theirs?? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">&lt;b&gt;Aren't reavers simply immune to slow?&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Nope, I've witnessed rangers landing epic slow on them in the past. I've never landed my own slow on one though. Rangers said it was pretty rare to land it, but not unheard of.<br />
<br />
As for us &lt;b&gt;needing&lt;/b&gt; lure spells, why? 2 months ago did we &lt;b&gt;need&lt;/b&gt; them then, too? Why does this new line have to be a lure? Seems ridiculous to me. That 512/tick dot sounds pretty damn badass to me. Being that it's magic based means it will innately land easier on raids (since most mobs will have Tash and Malosinia on it for a -120 to MR). Ultor will almost always last longer than the mobs HP, so that's useless on raids. Saryrn draws too much aggro coupled with slow, plus the mob often dies before Saryrn wears off. This new curse dot sounds perfect for raid situations. I don't see any possible reason that we &lt;b&gt;need&lt;/b&gt; a lure. <br />
<br />
This whole thing reminds me of that ridiculous druid thread where they said their class needs all those new spells and skills or else they are useless and no one will want them in a group or raid. Shamans are fine now, and we're getting a cool new dot and all some people can do is complain about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Absor flat out admitted a few months ago that DoT damage was horribly broken and totally underpowered compared to equivalent level melee or nuke damage.<br />
<br />
I don't see how adding say a -30 or so resist check to these spells would be too out of line. Hell, they need to upgrade the damage on all of them anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">It would be funnier then **** if these spells (and the other new group buff spells listed) were simply mob only spells. :D<br />
<br />
I know better though. SOE marketing ploy, new expansion, new no drop spells.<br />
<br />
Based on the current data, these are simply quick damage spells, with no recast value. Sounds like quick damage based aggro (think constant nukes for a few ticks), and then more then enough chance to lose the aggro. Group spells for a group based expansion. I don't see any of these being useful solo, given the overall direction in the data as they stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Curse line should be shaman only, a true hex would steal the hp and the mana from players as well as monsters.<br />
<br />
I know the majority of people never fight one another and just do monsters /boggle, it gets boring and you long for the PvP aspect one day, I know I did.  In PvP we have no kill power, no real fear other then malos/VP IF it even lands or our 65 dot even landing though 90+ pr is all thats really needed to resist it.  <br />
<br />
I can tell you our dots are way overpowered on raids/mobs, but highly underpowered in PvP.  We gain argo way to quickly on dotting raid level mobs IF they even land.  Burning affliction is too random it needs to become a set variable just like improved healing 4, needs to be a set value, not this random BS.  One tick it deals 230, another 266, another 240.  I rather see a curse dot line steal 512 mana for 4 ticks then hp for 4 ticks, and be a -200 lure base.  <br />
<br />
Why not??  Every other class 'shares' a shaman ability, whether its slow/cripple/dot etc... all but cana, and their spells have lure bases, all the way from necros, to wizards, to druids!!!    Why shaft ourselves when we can ask for something that would make us a bit more unnerfed again!!<br />
<br />
I say make the curses lure -200 to -300, steal hp and mana, low number of ticks but high cost of damage.  500 hp + 250 mana for 4 ticks is perfect with -200 lure base.  <br />
<br />
Nerf BARDS, bard rapture/mana drain  + 3 min DA refresh is way too overpowered if you want to nerf a class!!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Adding a slight lure component of say -150 to our dots, both future and existing dots, wouldn't make us unbalanced. For PvE our damage output is severely limited because of agro. Having our dots less resisted is not going to change that fact, just save us some frustration and mana. <br />
<br />
For PvP however, a -150 modifier would be highly needed. I realize less than 10% even care about this, but there is no reason to not introduce effects that make the pvpers happy if it also does not negatively influence the pve aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Instead of modifying dots across the board to accomodate PVP servers, they should instead perhaps do another resist adjustment similar to the one done a year? ago.  Average resist levels have gone up considerably since pre-VT resists and doing an across the board sweep might be in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Well root, snare, blind and arguably turgurs are gamebreakers if they land in pvp.<br />
<br />
While another revamp would perhaps fix the inflation in resists for Ssra+ loot enabled players, it will also royally screw over those who are sitting at about 90ish unbuffed resists. Unless of course the EQ coders are able to fix up and balance a resist system with lesser returns and an inherent cap in the resistability of spells, which I am very sceptic too (their ability that is).<br />
<br />
Much easier too fix the issues by boosting/nerfing spells/abilities (in a pvp setting) on a case by case basis. Dots useless in pvp? Boost them. SK deathtouch too cheesy? Already nerfed with 75% rule, but still too strong. etc...<br />
<br />
Edit: ok you were talking about pve as well? Most PoP AE's having to have a minus modifier to them just about proves how broken the resist system is and how insane player resists have become.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Just meant PVP only.  Unfortunately as resist levels rise casters with resistable spells are becoming more and more cramped.  I'm not sure what the solution is nor do I think for a second that it will be addressed - it would just be nice :P</div></div><hr />
