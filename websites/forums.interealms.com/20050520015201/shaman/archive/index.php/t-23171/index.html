<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frejadotter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw some items at the 1900 level that slipped into the last patch then removed quickly.  One friend was lucky to get an earring, had it ganked along with the points from the rollback / repatch, petitioned, and got it re-awarded by a GM.  <br />
<br />
So is the 1900 level part of OOW?  Are they adding a 66-70 level catagory for LDON worth more than the 51 regular 102 hard?  Will the 6th LDON camp ever make it to regular servers or just stay on Legends? <br />
<br />
Curious and seeking answers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe the 1900AP Gear is actually only supposed to be purchased by PvP points.  They have said a couple times now that there will not be any &quot;Elemental Quality&quot; LDoN Gear.  Though if you look at Fully Aug'd LDoN it's pretty darn close to EP Gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea. This is gonna be fun seeing people in VT/EP gear who aren't keyed/flagged for it. From what I understand they just took the VT loot table and renamed all the items. I'm unsure if any of these items will make it to the Blue servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nepith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what i saw, the gear was EXACTLY the gear from VT....just different names...and since my guild is doing VT a lot...made me wanna get all the LDoN points so i could see if the Umbracite Swarm Orb was allowed.../grin =D<br />
<br />
But, oh well....life goes on<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would much prefer to key up for VT and actually raid VT for items than farm LDON for equivalent gear.  <br />
<br />
I would never subject myself to that, and if people are willing to put in that time and effort - god bless them.  <br />
<br />
LDON is too slow as it is, and it's horribly boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">These aren't going to be purchased with LDOn points. The 1900 items are supposed to only be available on PVP servers.<br />

<br />
Sorry but that was not the case.  These are actually items intended for purchase with the new PVP point system.  Not Omens items.</div></div><hr />
