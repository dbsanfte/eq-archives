<br />
remember these mobs hit for well, ALOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedric</div><div class="date">11-18-2002, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can.  Have fun.<br />
<br />
The MoBs near the zone in PoD and PoN will be do-able and great exp.  Loot is practically non existant though.<br />
<br />
And if you wipe your corpses will appear at the graveyards in 20 mins.<br />
<br />
The Tsetian Pupas in PoD only hit for about 170, everything else I've fought hits for 250+<br />
<br />
Good luck and tell us how it goes. :)</div></div><hr />

Does that mean they can be soloed via fear kite?</div></div><hr />

Are you sure?<br />
<br />
The last time I tried them, not only did I get rat adds, I also got Templar adds. On one attempt my partner and I wound up with 5 rats, her pet died fast and we had to zone.</div></div><hr />

I know this to be true as I fearkite them and others run over me as they path.  And if you find that sweet spot, you can fearkite to your hearts content as you won't run out of rats. But since I duo with my 56 druid, I also pull the sentries and some of the other named mobs.   XP is great, even duoing, but the rats are mainly XP mobs as they don't drop loot  except for the message in a bottle, at least in the 100+ rats I have killed there.<br />
<br />
With my 56 druid and C3,  I can keep up with the heals and even dot/nuke some when I pull the sentries, and other named from the back of the halls.  They do drop items that are worth some plat and uncommonly raw or blue diamonds and I have gotten chains of the accursed once.  Not for sure what other item drops there are, as I haven't spent nearly enough time there.  I can say this though, I have spent 7 to 8 hours in PoJ, and gotten  aprox. 2.5 yellow on the 57 ranger and 3 yellow on the 56 druid.  Plat from selling the coins, knives, and other knik knacks have amounted to a listt over 1K, while not great, not bad either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulckan</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only time you will get adds on rats is;<br />
<br />
1st. You have a illusion or pet up. Rats or almost any more seems to not like this. Guild shammy was in bear form and ever rat that walked by agroed. Druid had his lil bear out, agro. Had Boon cast on me and agro.<br />
<br />
2nd We took a lower level mage into PoJ down next to the 4 wraith room, No illusions or pets where used, and all the rats that turned the corner there made a bee-line right to him. So I think any level maybe under 55 gets agro from them (not 100% sure on this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splunge</div><div class="date">11-23-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also the prisoners in the square by the zoneout are good xp. Green to 62 but blue to high 50s. Dont hit terribly hard except for the iksar prisoner, who is light blue and im unable to solo without root-dot-plinking.<br />
Pull into the hallway just by the zoneout. Pretty safe.<br />
They have 2 rare drops, a silvery spoon (no idea what for) and a glittering ring. The ring is for tradeskills for a 10ac 50hp 20wis (yes, you heard me, 20 wis) ring. You also need some rareish drops from some harder mobs further in and a 250+JCer to make it.</div></div><hr />

As long as the mobs were slowable we were fine. Xp is insane at 52, like almost a bub an hour, with the 56 druid at the ramp left of zone in also in PoI i got 2 bubs in 6 hours and a few equipment upgrades.</div></div><hr />

PoN is hellish on adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tathagata</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, well I tried PoJ tonight with 2 friends: 51 Ranger (me), 50 Druid and 48 Paladin. We were just trying for kicks.<br />
Went and camped at the zone out and I pulled a rat, all of a sudden a sentry joined in and then some named monk guy also came along for the ride.<br />
Zoned out, zoned back in, pull a rat again, same two all of a sudden join in the fray, but this time they bring a cyclops as well.<br />
<br />
Are we just too low for this place or what? why all the adds? I swear I was careful with my pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meorum</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That iksar monk (Shael Something?) adds in on me when I pull near the ZO, too.  I think it must be a level aggro thing.  At 53 he definately jumps into the fray.<br />
<br />
I have read many times here that the Sentries will add in to any fight they see, but only up to a certain level.  I think it was level 56 that they stop adding in.<br />
<br />
So perhaps your group should pull that Iksar first and kill him, then bring the rats in.  It's worth a try at any rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's dependent on your level. At 56, I was fear kiting, and would get the occasional add. Happened about once every 20-25 times I pulled a rat. I saw people lower in level than me that were getting several adds at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhuark</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, everyone, I have hunted in PoJ 3 or 4 times now and the exp is awesome.  A full group of 50-55 can hunt near the zone out and get close to 1.5 blues an hour.  With KEI and some pet classes like Beast lords, Sk's, and Necros you can increase your DPS and be pretty safe.  Even on the multi pulls with three mobs we did Ok.  We had a 56 BL, 53 BL, 54 Cleric, 50 Ranger, 51 Ranger and a 51 Shammy.  We did ok.  Neat to see new mobs and get some good exp but the first floor of mobs starts to get old after a while.  I look forward to exploring some of the tougher areas of PoJ.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input everyone.  <br />
<br />
Strength and Honor!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes but do you realy want to get banned, it seems some have been banned, im not sure if this is because they get stuck in the wall and/or if its just the lower level rats.<br />
If not id like to know if you can fear kite them from the ZO without the chance of a ban.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lemilynia</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are under 56, the sentries, prisoners and rats will all add in to the fight if they path within aggro range.   They aren't kos otherwise however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason you would get banned is if you feared them into the spot at the door that leads to the hallway that leads to the back cells, if that makes any sense, because the pathing is screwed and they get stuck there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimsonsun</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in PoJ last week, myself tanking with a guildie 57 druid and 52 chanter. We were doing fine against the sentries and rats, and even that damned iksar who always liked to seem to join in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarmaniel</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoI is pretty bad as far as experience goes. You can only get past about 6-8 MOBs from the zone in until you start running into Constructs that are immune to Harmony, immune to mez, and mitigate slow. If you can get the camp, I'd go do Ravenous Nightstalkers in PoN. Very small chance of that though, it's always &quot;camped&quot; by a 53 druid that is killing just 1 of the 12 spawns, yet does nothing but bitch at you and train you if you try to take any for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedChief</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending quite a bit of time in PoJ (4 lvls and 8aa) I figured out the aggro.  The front hall rats will add if anyone is under lvl 57.  Sentries will assist if they see you pull one.  Pulling to ZO is fine but fearkiting sub-57 may give you a problem.  The back hall rats are 1-2 lvls higher and follow the same rule.  I usually camp at the end of left hall (past the downstairs door to the enforcers).  Once I hit 60 I started pulling downstairs rats as before that they would assist.  Currently getting 1.5-2aa per kill.  All this time I am hydraing a 60 shaman ungrouped (slows/buffs/heals).</div></div><hr />
