<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All!<br />
<br />
I got a new weapon and it has a proc.<br />
<br />
I want to see it proc lots and to do some parces  :D ...<br />
<br />
Anyone know of a green NPC with lots of HP that won't kill me if I beat on them some?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
some good info should tell you what sort of damage you can expect from a proc before ever even getting it.  Not sure how having single attack vs double attack effects proc rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?  I mean it is just for fun...<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh its because GM's don't want you to go up in weapons skill on these NPCs.  *sigh... then they should have practice dumbies in the game you can beat on for fun that give no skill.<br />
<br />
=-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally id go to OS, Beat up some mushrooms and work for a fungi maybe.  The mobs there hit like practice dummies and all CH each other so you wont have them running out of hps too fast.</div></div><hr />

LOTS of Hps..you don't have to heal yourself often. When I was 60, it took an entire group of us to kill her....in over an hour. Just pull her towards to book more, so you don't accidently get agro from one of the Vah Shir under the tent. I like her best, because she's so close to the book/PoK &amp; No faction hits if you do kill her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably they just don't want the translocaters dead for when people need to cross an ocean.</div></div><hr />

Ya the bankers in Katta are great.  Don't fight back and have a ton of hit points and regen.  They are pretty low level so its hard to get a real estimate for melee dps against experience mobs but they work well nonetheless.  Only annoying part about em is every couple seconds they yell for help but you can filter that to another window and minimize it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Soulbinders are green and dont fight back....but I seriously think that they made them un-attackable, sorta like they did Shady in EC tunnel....been a long time since I attacked one heheh<br />
Anyway, if they are still attackable, they show no hit points in their life bar and are unkillable, might give them a try.</div></div><hr />
