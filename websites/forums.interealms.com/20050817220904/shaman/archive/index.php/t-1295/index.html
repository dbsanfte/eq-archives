A new version of the popular computer game EverQuest will make its debut next year, Sony Online Entertainment said Thursday.<br />
EverQuest II, which is slated to arrive in the winter of 2003, will feature a new 3D engine and will allow gamers to own real estate, ride horses, command ships, and to use new enhanced spells, quests and events.<br />
<br />
The game centers on an online fantasy world called Norrath, where players create characters, engage in online activities and gather elements such as armor and weapons. Through the Internet, players can interact with each other, fighting, talking and trading, and building up more power.<br />
<br />
EverQuest's phenomenal popularity has also earned it some critics; some mental health professionals have warned that players may become obsessed with the game. Other studies have focused on the EverQuest economy, concluding that if Norrath were a country its per-capita gross national product would be $2,266--comparable to the 77th richest country on Earth.<br />
<br />
More than 400,000 subscribers paying a subscription fee of $12.95 a month for access to the huge virtual world where the game takes place.<br />
