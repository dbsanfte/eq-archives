<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A guildie of mine just posted this on our site, looking like all us that did not in the first 2 days of Kunark, can now bind in the firepots room. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a bug. Confirmed that you can by myself, but the tactics required to get it to work leads me to believe, it'sa  bug.<br />
<br />
However, definatly worth it if your primary places of hunts is in Kunark/Old World.<br />
<br />
However; if you do nothing but fight in Velious/Luclin, binding inthe fire pots might be a waste of time. Especially if you're on a CR to one of them places.<br />
<br />
Think about bit, before changing your bind point from where ever it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">checked the link, nothing about how to bind there....<br />
Care to provide a link or info on how to do this?  I'd love to be bound there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, link just tells you what the pots do and that.  I have been told you can just flat out bind there, but will test it out tonight when I can get on.  As most of the fighting i do in Velious and Luclin is with at least one cleric am not so worried about CRs, but a very good point to bring up and remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its been confirmed, nothing special to bind, you just get a message saying 'find a city' but also a message that says you have bound to the area.<br />
<br />
It works, but definitely like a bug.<br />
<br />
Here is the original thread that someone brought up the fact its working again...<br />

May 11th's post about the Combines Returning.<br />
<br />
You have to log-out and log back in, while in TD ( bug flag one ). After that, bind yourself and you'll get the &quot;You cannot bind yourself here&quot; message ( bug flag two ). <br />
<br />
Now, /char[info] and you'll see yourself bound in TD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Timp deep was probably reverted back like ST and ToV was after the last patch VI probably doesnt think its worth bringing the servers down to fix it, enjoy it while you can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is anyone else having problems with some of the pots? I tried going to misty and it wouldn't work. ie. running up to the torch, left of the torch, right of the torch, nothing would work. Is it cause im an ogre and the halflings are scared of me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Smylee, click the damned thing.<br />
<br />
(I also cannot run over that torch, but then again, it's pretty tuff to run over the cabilis pot too.)</div></div><hr />
