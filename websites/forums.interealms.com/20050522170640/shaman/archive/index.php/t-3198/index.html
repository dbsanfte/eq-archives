<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently wearing the Iksar Chestplate, but a friend just won a gravy roll on a Thurgardin Chain BP and offered to MQ it with me. <br />
<br />
Which do you think is the better option for general wear? The stats on the Rune Crafter's are obviously superior, but having what amounts to flowing thought 2.5 from the regen bp is pretty sweet too. Would the higher AC and larger mana pool offset the increased rate of mana regen?<br />
<br />
I could imagine worse dillemas to be in.<br />
<br />
Stats on the Rune Crafter's BP are: 37 AC +3 Str +6 Sta +3 Agi +3 Dex +14 Wis +30 HP +80 Mana +9.00 Wt  <br />
<br />
Stats on the Ceremonial Iksar are: 19AC +5 hp regen/tick<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends, what level are you and how often do you canabalize?  I will wear my regen bp until I get a fungi, I canabalize way too much to wear anything else.  In some situations I do switch over to my PSC when I need the extra ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is your current gear setup and stats (AC, WIS, HP)?  <br />
<br />
What race/level?<br />
<br />
Do you tend to group or solo more?<br />
<br />
How quickly are you levelling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I would wear the Regen BP in dungeons where I canni alot and the rune crafters outside. While on a horse I do not canni very often so the regen is less important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a 54 Barbarian Shaman. I mostly duo with a monk or bard friend, but even in a larger group I find that I am cannibalizing all the time. Right now my gear is a mix of AC and wis. Self-buffed AC is 916, HP 1620 and Wis at 170 or so. My gear is as follows:<br />
<br />
Head: JB helm<br />
Earrings: Imbued ivory gold<br />
Neck: The neckpiece from Chardok<br />
Face: Polished Mithril Mask<br />
<br />
Rings: 6/65<br />
Hands: Crystal Chitin<br />
Wrists: JBB/Jarsath<br />
Arms: JB vambraces<br />
Chest: Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Meditative Blanket<br />
Back: Acrylia studded cloak<br />
Legs: Jarsath<br />
Boots: Rune Crafter's<br />
<br />
Primary: Di'zok Sceptre of Authority<br />
Secondary: Shield of Falsehood<br />
Range: Seal of Thoridain<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'll swap in nathsar sleeves and chokidai hide spaulders if I'm on a raid or in a group where I am not getting agro at all.<br />
<br />
This discussion is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If a friend has offered to MQ the thurg bp for you for free, do it!   Keep both the thurg bp and the iksar regen bp.   Free sta buff and the flexibility to swap out bps as you need.  I currently have 4 bps with me at all times (fungi, vindi, SS and jb).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">use the rune crafters, its not like your wearing a fungi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The extra 18 AC isn't going to push you over a significant AC barrier, and if you're cann'ing all the time, mana-regen is probably more important than mana-pool.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that for general purpose wear, the Iksar BP is the way to go.  If you're getting a lot of agro, it might be worth it to switch to the Rune Crafters.<br />
<br />
Ragnorokk:  True, it's not a fungi, but 3000 hp/hour is still nice if you're not getting beat on much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Id go for the Rune Crafter's.  More AC,HP,Sta = More cannabalize then 5hp a tick.  Plus the other stats to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do you have the gems?  Will you have to buy them? They're 3-5k each on my server, so 9k to 15k for that BP.<br />
<br />
And I think the iksar one is better anyway.<br />
<br />
I tried all shaman BP's on, and found that regen was always better than everything else.  The only time it's not is for when you need resists.  But even then, it's usually a borderline call.<br />
<br />
The real difference is torpor.  I had the CoV dragon quest armor BP(far superior to the thurg BP) in the bank and kept it there before I had torpor, long after I was 60.  Fungi was MUCH more useful, most everywhere, most all the time.  Occasionally would bust out the CoV BP for dragons, but not always.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, before I got my fungi, iksar BP beat all the high-wisdom/good stat/high AC chest items I tried on, and I think I used all of them.  I was wearing my iksar BP till 52 or 53, and doing VERY well with it on, soloing, grouping, raiding, etc.  <br />
<br />
To make it perfectly clear, when soloing my wisdom was down to a mere 120.  Does that illustrate how important wisdom is compared to regen -- even a little regen?  Same with AC?<br />
<br />
In groups I would jack up wisdom to 160-180, depending on what I felt worked best, though I had the equipment to get it up to about 220.  Kept the iksar BP on, though.<br />
<br />
A shaman will not go wrong by wearing nothing his whole career but iksar bp then fungi then, when he gets torpor, the quest armors or uber drops(Vindi BP and better).  Forget froggy BP, emerald dragonscale, thurg, whatever.  <br />
<br />
Until you get torpor, regen is your god.  Post torpor, kick back and look around and decide which stats you'd enjoy the best.  Most people either get dragon quest armor and keep it or get it and abandon it when they get Vindi BP, and then only rarely will they have an upgrade.  There are very few shaman BP's around, even fewer that are likely to go to a shaman first.  Doesn't matter too much, though, there are plenty of more vital spots to upgrade.<br />
<br />
For shamans, fungi, jbb, epic, torpor are the things that matter(we can leave out the obvious--slow).  After torpor, fungi no longer matters.  Malo and focus are what makes him matter to raids(chanters and even rangers can slow too).<br />
<br />
Fill in whatever blanks you are missing there.  If you're iksar, you won't be able to fill one of them, but won't need a fungi, either.</div></div><hr />
