As you can see, this started out just discussigng pure casters, in a little pre-PoP speculation.  There's several PoP threads going on in the forum I linked to.<br />
<br />
And a warrior, a WARRIOR I say, suggested rangers should get self ports.  I, a druid, do not disagree, but I can see verant making each self-port into a little quest.<br />
<br />
I think self ports are very fitting with what a ranger is, a solitary traveler.<br />

A line of self-only succor type spells that gate the ranger to various ranger outposts around Norrath. The quest originates with the ranger trainer (or NPC) at the location, and when cast, the ranger gates back to that trainer's location.<br />

ranger damage upgrades in PoP would basically have to be nil in PoP to make the addition of self-ports fair. They'd have to bring up warrior damage to overtake rangers in dps prolly to even out the port factor. <br />

This subject has been discussed a lot, but mainly on the General forums.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Rangers would not complain about getting any self ports PROVIDED it does not in any way, shape or form interefere with any spells we currently have or might gain, or any abilities we currently have or might gain.  I am pretty sure we would not be willing to give up what damage we can do and any spells we use and are slated to get, simply to be able to self port.  While I understand this helps in scouting (ie. our superior tracking abilities) for large guilds, do not dismiss the ease with which a druid / ranger team can infiltrate almost any zone and scout.  Keep in mind that every other melee class would put up such a fuss if Rangers were able to self port via spells only.  They would more than likely cry for a nerf of some of our other spells / abilities, and I am pretty sure the Ranger community does not want to lose anything to gain self ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alkaris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my opinion, Thurg gate potions are enough. The ranger class has become very powerful in our areas(understatement) and a gate spell would only throw off the balance. Thurg potions are easily made, since the components are almost always available in the bazaar. Pottery is also an extremely cheap skill to raise, guildie went from 0 to over 100 in about 40pp. As for the limited nature of where you can gate to with it, the spires are right there in GD, and its a short run from most spires to a given location to any class with SoW. Gate spells = lost balance for rangers. I'd rather keep my capabilities than have them nerfed for a self port.<br />

I am a Ranger with chain armor, a sword, a dagger and a bow!  Grrr!  And when I want to go somewhere I just cast SoW and camoflauge on myself and run to the nearest Nexus portal:)<br />
<br />
And when I want to play a swishy tree hugger with leather armor and a stick ... well that's when I play my druid who can very easily teleport from ring to ring to hug or shake hands with the Treants he finds there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tseramed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So you feel rangers should not have a magical nature?<br />
<br />
In that case, I suppose we could run around the forest as dressed-down warriors and play bows-and-arrows and sip morning dew, and all that.<br />
<br />
I don't feel a self-gate would be out-of-character at all, especially if it were termed something like &quot;Karana's Gift&quot;, or the like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Furian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Umm...NO.  I have a 51 druid alt, love the port ability and was really surprised they gave Luclin ports to druids. I don't feel any melee based class should be able to port.  I don't really think priest classes should port either, druids included, unless it's a class ability to gate to home via a timer like LOH or HT.  The porters should be wizards at the top with the other pure int casters below, with ports based more on class.  Example wizard ports to everywhere, necros port to evil/undead related places. Mages port to 4 places in line with 4 elements(lavastorm, iceclad, the hole entrance and someplace windy) and enchanters port to a few places as well.  I can understand druids porting as a ride the wind kinda thing, but true portals should be int casters from my standpoint.  I use thurg gate potions myself all the time, but don't see a need for ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tseramed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Other than just some personal ethos you've come up with, what reasoning do you have to support your statements, that **this is how things should be** ?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but many of the caster classes in EQ are thrown way out of their traditional roles already.  If you want to boil right down to it, wizards should be summoning and baning daemons and devils, not straight nuke &amp; port.  Magicians should be masters of alteration, not conjuration and pet class supreme.<br />
<br />
I can see nothing wrong with a ranger, who is already magical by nature (and we do share some spells with wizards, by the way), being able to pray to Karana for rescue in the form of a self-gate to one of the Karanas zones.  I can see it now, the rainy winds of deitical deliverance whisping us away in a flash of lightning to the sacred plains of Antonica, safe in the grassland embrace of our most holy Mother.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, too, instead of a class-related thing, this should be deitical instead.  Maybe then *every* class could have one self-gate ability to return only to the zone of their deity, maybe as some sort of deal or agreement with that deity.  Agnostics would not apply, but that would be the downfall of choosing a religion that doesn't instantly get you killed in some places.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenwort</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didn't say that I thought Rangers should not have a magical nature, just that teleporting seems out of character and just plain wierd to me.<br />
<br />
I don't know if your question regarding anyone's personal ethos was directed at me but, what other reason do I need?  After all, I've lurked and laughed at a lot of threads on this &quot;dead horse&quot; topic and if in my first actual post I chose not to side with those who continue to beat on the poor thing, well then that's a reason in itself :)<br />
<br />
But if I must any easy enough reason not to get it is ... we don't need it.  And let's do face it, if rangers get ports the other hybrid classes will be crying class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tyga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dead horse or not. I always wondered why the Circle of Surefall Glade was sold in the RANGER guild.....????</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Madai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">whaerf, first of all, ranger melee damage already rocks, given the snaring and buffing rangers can do I don't see why a ranger should be able do significantly more damage than a warrior,  let alone a monk or even rogue.  And, ranger melee damage is bound to rise a little bit with better stats/gear and whanot.  <br />
<br />
Self ports would make it much easier for rangers to get groups... they can plain show up faster.  And if they can't get a group somehow, they can go wherever they want and do whatever they want until a spot opens up for a ranger anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
Tseramed, as for my reasoning, I don't really have THAT much conviction behind them.  I'd be overjoyed if one of my many suggestions I've peppered various eq boards with, (mainly my server's) actually entered the game.<br />
<br />
It was nice to here your opinions.  It will be interesting to see what PoP does as far as travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can certainly understand your point of view.  However, tell me how Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, Rogues, Monks and Beastlords would feel if Rangers gained the spells to be able to self port and they did not?  I'm pretty sure all hell would break loose.  =)  Remember, it's never one's own class that causes &quot;nerfs&quot; to happen.  It's the perception of other classes and what they think is overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would trade all the proc spells and bind spells and port spells for a new buff like Nimble or a sub 50 shammie dex buff.</div></div><hr />

It would make life so much easier after a raid when everyone goes their own way rather than having to stand in line while the wizzies complain about transing you.  just give it a 30 min or 1 hour cycle time so melee cant abuse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Akelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How about a high-end pottery item, much like the Faithstone/Spiritstone line; zone specific and with a long cast time like the others.   Make them specific with an &quot;essence&quot; for each zone, and self-only, ranger only, to the &quot;safe point&quot; in the zone; Perhaps one for Rivervale,  one for Surefall and one for Kelethin. I might perhaps make the &quot;essence&quot; used require a component that is a ranger-only quest item at the guild/zone to which the Scoutstone would be attuned.<br />
<br />
As for ranger self-ports to any other locations; I find these a bit harder to justify.  We have Thurg gate potions, the Tolans BP, the nexus spire ports and SoW/GWF/SoE with PoP coming out, and going the long way has been the ranger's stock in trade since the game began.  <br />
<br />
The only other possibility I see as valid is to allow a ranger to bind in Ranger Outposts,  by having the guildmaster at each outpost respond to a &quot;bind my soul&quot; type of phrase and then allowing the &quot;Scoutstone&quot; to return the ranger to the Outpost where he is bound.</div></div><hr />

I fall in to the group of people that think rangers should have either Self Ports and Maybe Lessor Succor. But I also know that I don't want to recieve these spells if it is going to adversily affect my Mellee skills or the type of loot that is going into the game for rangers as a whole.

<br />
/sarcasm OFF<br />
<br />
Self ports would rock, and even &quot;fit it&quot; with the idea of Rangers melting into the Forest (for those of you concerned about it not being a &quot;Ranger thing&quot;). Who cares where the Ranger went...all you know is he faded away into the shadows...or stepped out of the brush next to you when you are standing in the forest. And if a Monk or Rogue ever said one thing against a self porting Ranger, they would be foolish and  stupid. We get tons less defense, less offense, less raid-dependance, and worse gear. All this we give up for spells. Self porting is a spell. <br />
<br />
If you think we are melee and not porter, then push hard for some pre  PoP Defense and Offensive upgrades. Given our current offensive and defensive status, we should get Evacs and  self ports just as a matter of principle.<br />
<br />
Swift...silent...can be anywhere at any time..that would be a cool Ranger theme. Floaty Ranger at level 65? No thanks...lose SoE!<br />

As far as being out of character for a ranger, I don't think half of you know half of what you're talking about.  I've been roleplaying rangers since 1979 (not EverQuest's twisted view, of course), so I think I have a pretty good feel for them.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>shadowsmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Subtitles: What are Rangers Anyway? or Why Be a Ranger? OR Will Giving Rangers Self Port Ruin EQ?<br />
<br />
Anytime changes are made to the way classes play in EQ some are happy, some indifferent, and some disappointed (and worse). Nevertheless changes continue to take place because they should. The argument that &quot;I made it without this ability so we don't need it&quot; is an interesting one and a great subject for someone's couch debate with another type of professional... just kidding. But after playing only one character class through level 59 I have to admit that I am forever wondering about the bland mix of ranger abilities. Abilities that are more embarassements than assists.... disarm comes immediately to mind as does hide and sneak (to a lessor extent as although terribly poor they do have their uses).... spells that come so late that they are essentially useless... In effect rangers can easly appear to be a hybrid of weak compromises with a hint of areas where we should shine but barely and rarely do.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that rangers have inate abilites that we must seek to exploit.... scouting, stealth, movement, range attack (archery, and certain small throwing weapons), and self preservation.<br />
<br />
So why desire Self Porting? I believe enhancement to solo, long range movement is essential (whether done with porting or special evac from zone in to zone in....) to creating the special unique ability mix that would make a ranger more of a 'ranger.'<br />
<br />
Rangers should be the scouts of EQ... when an individual, group or guild needs to know if someone or something is somewhere they 'hire' a ranger (hire is a figurative term here... mostly). Self porting or evacing throughout outdoors zones could be obtained as either a progression similar to druids getting their ability to port others or as a special category of AA enhancements. With self port/evacing rangers become more valued for certain functions... just like other classes have fill special needs.<br />
<br />
In addition ot enhancing our ability to move quickly to different zones, to further make our mark as a scout we need an improvement to our sneak, hide abilites, (up the 75 to 125 or even 150), better self healing improvements (bandaging/medicines mostly), add detect 'natural' traps/poisons, add lastely improve our tracking to add specific targeting searching abilities. Really revamp the ranger so we can better exist solo and be real scouts. And lastly fix Superior Camo!<br />
<br />
Now as you have probabaly deduced by now, I think see the self porting for ranger issue as just the tip of the iceberg. Rangers not only need to be able to get somewhere in order to scout they need to be able to survive once they get there.... and I don't mean with AC or godlike damage output, although rangers should be able to put up a nasty fight when they have to.<br />
<br />
Heavy armor with lots of AC just doesn't fit with the plan. Rangers that scout certainly don't need more than what we have. I think rangers should stay light and dangerous (but not aspire to become tanks)... and we should have the ability to blend into the surroundings much better and to excel in distance attack with bow, dagger, axe.<br />
<br />
Class balancing issues?  Our curent spell book is a mixed bag just as we are. I think our spells should be mostly limited to self (and some group) protection, fear,  confusion, observation, entrapement/hinderance to mobs (more than just animals), self mobility, stealth, short duration offense, first aid (for ourselves and others). I believe we don't need to have DOT or direct damage style spells.... just doesn't fit. On the other hand we should be able to use magically or chemically enhanced range weapons that can act as delivery devices for Necor, Mage, Wizard, Cleric (etc) enchanted ammo). Double wield, double attack yes but with slash, piercing, and range weapons. Why would a scout be good at bashing.... 2hb in particular? 2hs slashing? Heavy weapons in general? Let Warriors and monks be the masters of weaponry in general.<br />
<br />
Let us get there fast, quiet, secretly.... move about... protect ourselves.... see danger... confuse the mobs....and kill well when necessary.<br />
<br />
OK, time to Flame me. :).</div></div><hr />

Again, the same powers that be have dictated that fighters should NOT be allowed to get around quickly on their own.  Ok, the Nexus was a tremendous improvement in this regard but so far the best thing to ever happen to public transportation since then was the boats breaking and the planting of gnome TLers.  Now if they would just plant translocaters at all port and dock sites permenantly instead of this wait-based timer system then the issue becomes almost dead to me...  Because although I am fine with running across 5 zones to get to where I want to go,  I'm still fuming at the loss of an hour or more of wasted time it took me to get from IC to Nro waiting for and sitting on the stupid boat and raft, not to mention the accumulated hours of sitting at spires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gileean Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Do some research....the ORIGINAL RPG..the grand daddy that started it all...D&amp;D...Rangers have the ability to &quot;Tree walk&quot; &quot;Shadow Step&quot;...they can use the trees to move around in a port style fasion...basically a version of Succor.<br />
<br />
There is also known abilities that Rangers have over time with proper training and such gained abilities to do minor abilities of short distance teleports.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been around since release and I also own a Tolan BP...but I have always felt Rangers should get some form of port ability. Succor would be the most viable option to me. But I could see and support a ranger...based on his/her diety or something along those lines...getting a quest to obtain a self port. Although I have resigned the fact it will never happen...but one can always dream.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lemante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I've played a few games where rangers have the ability to mark a tree at any time.  Then he can port back to that tree by touching a tree near him.  Tree walking I believe it was called. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Hazzel-Zeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I didn't say that I thought Rangers should not have a magical nature, just that teleporting seems out of character and just plain wierd to me. <br />
<br />
Necromancers get a self only, short distance, intra-zone teleport spell at level 8 called Shadow Step. Guess what, Shadowknights get it at level 15 so the precedent is there for hybrids to get the teleportation spells of there parent class.<br />
<br />
Warriors are so inherently non-magical they recieve bonuses to magic resistance as the gain levels. Yet with some easily obtained items and a little pottery skill they can self gate to Thurgadin at will.<br />
<br />
I've always thought rangers should get, at the very least, self-only ports and a group lesser succor spells.<br />
<br />
But make them use an expendable item that is player made like the Thurg gates do. Something like this:<br />
<br />
Blessed Arrow of the Predator = 1 Branch of Planar Oak (plane of growth) + 1 Hunters Tannin + 1 Mithril Working Knife (fletching kit, fletching trivial 200, yield 20)<br />
<br />
Hunters Tannin = 1 Oak Bark (kithicor) + 1 Misty Acorn (misty thicket) + 1 Karana Temper + 1 Tunare Temper (brew barrel, brewing trivial 136) <br />
<br />
Karana Temper = 1 Blessed Dust of Karana + 1 Surefall Sap (qeynos hills) + 1 Celestial Essence (brew barrel, brewing trivial 136)<br />
<br />
Tunare Temper = 1 Blessed Dust of Tunare + 1 Morning Dew (all faydark) + 1 Celestial Essence (brew barrel, brewing trivial 136)<br />
<br />
Mithril Working Knife, Blessed Dust of Karana, Blessed Dust of Tunare and Celestial Essence already exist in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bedara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I would love to have self only ports, heck I want group ports to limited areas too!  I don't see how it would be THAT unbalancing.  So what if some druid loses out on 30 pp to port me or some Paly/SK has to shell out 30 pp when I don't?  <br />
<br />
Clerics lose out on pp with Palys running around rezzing people.  The rest of us still have to pay.  And they got their nifty &quot;get out of death free&quot; card known as LoH<br />
<br />
Necros lose out on pp with SKs running around summoning corpses.  They rest of us still have to pay.  And they have their nifty Harm Touch<br />
<br />
Like someone said before, what have i gotten from my parent class?  <br />
<br />
1) SoW....real handy now that everyone and his brother can essentially be sowed all the time with run 3.  Not to mention that BSTs got sow from the shammy parent but I don't see them being left out of all the neat shammy buffs, group or otherwise.<br />
<br />
2) HP/AC Buff (skin line)....Paly's get the cleric line but still get rezz.<br />
<br />
3) DoTs....SKs inherit dots from the necros yet can still summon corpses.<br />
<br />
4) DS...I haven't thought much about this one...but i am sure someone else will and add to this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that, i don't really see how we would be getting anything extra by getting ports.  What it would really being doing is fixing an age old problem where we have been DENIED an important ability of our parent class.<br />
<br />
What would I tell the palys/SKs/BST out there....well **** for starters.<br />
<br />
Then i'd tell the palys to go over pull, use LoH on himself while he is running away and leaving everyone else to die, then come back and act like the hero rezzing the group.<br />
<br />
I'd tell the SK to throw his harm touch, command his pet to attack to distract the mob while he is following the chicken paladin to the zone, then come back and summon the cleric's body who got summoned by the mob so the paly can rezz it.<br />
<br />
And i'd tell the BST to **** you spoiled rotten brat who has the easiest epic quest which yields better weapons that ours before I go tracking for more of those scouts you need to kill for my amusment.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Whew, wow, it felt good to get that out!  Sorry about the venting guys, i didn't realize how much i had bottled up till i started typing.<br />
<br />
But in all reality we will NEVER get ports.  I have seen a number of posts on various board by VI employees that admit they don't even like druids being able to port and it was a mistake to give them it.  But cheer up because supposidly with PoP everyone will be able get around much faster.  There are suppose to be teleporters up there to all the starting cities.  We might have to wait 15 mins still, but i'd rather wait than give a druid a copper.<br />

Uh, some people are on Giant faction, like me.  And I don't feel like sneaking through thurgadin to make a potion.  Gimme my self port to Gfay / SFG.</div></div><hr />
