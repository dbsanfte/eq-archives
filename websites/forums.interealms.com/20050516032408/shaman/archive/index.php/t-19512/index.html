<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is an ogre in Nektulos forest near the bridge named Blugurg.  He cons dubious to my troll shaman.  I would love nothing more than to get to indifferent with him, since he is a merchant and is located directly at the port-in spot for the spiritstone of the banished.  But, i have been completely unable to find out what faction he is on.  Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
I guess killing him might tell me, if there is a negative hit, but I'd rather not risk a large negative hit.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what faction he is on?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He disappears after you kill him.  No faction adjustment at all.  He was dubious to me as well before he died, so i don't know exactly what he is on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gundy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He is a quest NPC for ogres.  They turn in the spiritstone of the banished to get one for Oggok i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is a quest NPC for ogres.  They turn in the spiritstone of the banished to get one for Oggok i believe.<br />
<br />
Correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, i knew what quest he is for.  But I am trying to figure out what faction he is on so that I can sell to him quickly after using spiritstone and quickly gate back to what I was doing.  Has to be one of the ogre city factions I guess, but I am not really too familiar with those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">don't think he is a merchant, Reave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, he is.  Used him with sneak on, with another character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">right after Grobb was stolen, this npc was placed there for the ogre spiritstaone quest.  It was reported that he is a merchant, but my troll cannot get anything from him.  At least he is not kos!!<br />
<br />
Can anyon confirm selling to this guy without using sneak, or similar workarounds?  Maybe we can work out the faction if soem ogres can sell and some cannot, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gundy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about some of you goodie goodies go kill him and see what faction hits you take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you read above, you will see that someone did kill him, and there were no faction hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoa.  I had no idea we could do that.  *bonks his ogre head*<br />
