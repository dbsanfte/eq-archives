<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all -  A few bits of news and things I wanted to mention regarding the crucible.<br />
<br />
New Server<br />
Sunmoon recently moved the boards to another server, as you may have noticed from his posts.  If you notice any problems, please let us know... but looks like this one went pretty smoothly.<br />
<br />
Forum Changes<br />
We have modified the descriptions of the forums to make them a bit more clear, please make your posts in the correct forums.  If you haven't looked in these forums lately, check them out!  Lots of good info in there.  Notably, we tried to clear up the focus of these forums:<br />
Equipment - All gear related questions.<br />
Quests - Shaman quests, including epic, cudgels, cloaks and shaman gear quests.<br />
Spells - Shaman spell discussions, spell drop info, spell quest walk throughs.<br />
<br />
Custom Titles/Avatars<br />
There have been some questions about user titles/avatars.  The inability to edit these is a result of a using a beta version of the boards.  Sunmoon will upgrade us to another build/version when that is available and there is time.  In the meantime, if you have 1000+ posts and just can't live without a title you can PM me and I will give you a title.  I will only do this once per person, so choose wisely.<br />
<br />
serverwide.crucible<br />
I've recently received a few cross-server tells in game and PMs on this board complaining about the serverwide.crucible channel in-game.  The moderators on this forum have no moderation access to the serverwide.crucible channel, nor do they have any obligation to try to police that channel.   I never even visit the channel, myself.  I would suggest the use of the /ignore, /report or /petition features if someone is bothering you in the channel or in-game.<br />
<br />
Crucible website<br />
I am told my FTP access has been restored and so hopefully I will finally be able to start the overhaul of the main crucible site.  Sorry for the delay! <br />
<br />
New Site Moderator<br />
I would like to congratulate you all on gaining Gloriana as our latest full site moderator, joining myself and Mojo.  Now you have yet another person to complain about when your thread gets moved to The Grey!  ;)  Guard your signatures shamans, because she has much less tolerance than Mojo and I!  <br />
<br />
Signature Rules Reminder<br />
Speaking of, please remember the Shaman's Crucible signature rules are:<br />
Size: no more than 100 pixels high, approx 250 pixels wide.<br />
LESS THAN 25K in File Size.<br />
NO java, flash, shockwave, javascript, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's all for now.  Thanks everyone for your contributions and for making the Shaman's Crucible a great board and community.  :)<br />

<br />
ROTFLMAO trying to get to 1000 posts too huh? *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, he isn't going to get to 1000 posts by posting now is he?<br />
<br />
Grats to the new Sig Nazi!  Skyshrine Hottie power!</div></div><hr />

*pokes khozik*  100 pixels high, mister.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Henora, please change the EQTraders Alchemy Resources link on this page (http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/index.html) to this one (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g6&amp;menustr=040010000000).  That's for the same information now in the database format.<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, you may also wish to add a link to UgZug's Guide (http://home.attbi.com/~craigalger/Ugzugs_Guide_to_Alchemy.PDF), newly updated.  That's now a permanent link so you can safely link directly to it without needing to update the link every time it's updated.<br />
<br />
Edit #2:  UgZ also needs the subject of his post on the forums here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=259) with the link to the guide be updated to note that it's now v.4.  For some reason he can't edit it anymore.  (We've been talking via email.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the update Dandi - I noted the problem with the EQTC link this weeked.  I'll take care of it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
j00 missing the humor ( what lil was there )<br />
<br />
Take a look at hen's title under her name, it was a weak atempt at being cute and gaining moderator affection which will work into my plan to later take over the boards and move in with sunmoon.<br />
<br />
Umm ... i must kill you now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*smacks Litgruv* :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No Flash? but flash is harmless, and my sig is only 10.2k :\<br />
<br />
I can understand java, but flash is hard to do evil stuff with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No flash signatures please.<br />
<br />
The biggest complaint we had about flash was in regards to corporate firewalls.  For people who wish to browse the boards during their lunch hour, any thread that a user had a flash sig on was being blocked by their IT dept.  Since they were filtering out all pages that contained flash files.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your cooperation.  I'd like to see the boards useable by as many people as possible.  I would hate to see something as trivial as someones signature prevent them from doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nerfed my sig, such trauma &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />
