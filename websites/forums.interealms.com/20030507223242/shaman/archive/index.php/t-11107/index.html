<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’ve been concentrating on leveling and completely ignoring my character’s equipment since 19th level.  Most of his equipment is hand-me-downs from other characters.  It seemed like decent equipment at 19th level, but I think its time to start looking into upgrades.  One reason I’ve ignored his equipment is that I don’t have much money.  I’ll have to spend some time farming for cash but once I hit level 34 and get my first doggie I think I’ll do just that.  Any suggestions for some decent equipment that will hold me for a few levels?<br />

I’m created a magelo profile of Pait’s equipment.  I’ve yet to figure out how to get the program to grab the equipment off my PC, so I did it my hand.  With that in mind, his stats may not be completely accurate. I tried running the program on my PC while in game, but it just doesn’t seem to work.  *shrugs* <br />

Anyway, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO your playing your chacter with too much wis not enough HP which is fine till you start getting pets and then you'll be tanking for him (it'll be so much easier with him!). For some upgrades look at my equip cuz i'm not uber but iv'e just upgraded some stuff so i have a fair amount of HP gear now. Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finish the totemic quests and replace your rings with Velium Fire opal.  That will to you pretty well till you can get your Jaundiced Bone armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ecbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was going to ask this question and this seems to be a good place for it...<br />
<br />
I'm a 19th shammy and I'm looking to start collecting my totemic armor.  I know I'm too low level for the quests right now but I'm finding some of the pieces are priced fairly well in the Bazaar on my server (E'ci) -- the boots and vambraces at least are looking to be somewhere in the 100pp range.  I figure at those prices it's better to just buy what I can now than paying for dufrenite and waiting a few levels to do the quests.  Although dufrenite can be purchased for a good price if you look around, I'm finding...<br />
<br />
In fact last night I found the totemic bracers priced at 30pp, which of course I grabbed.  So my question -- can you wear TWO totemic bracers, one for each slot?  I noticed I was able to equip the totemic bracers and still wear one of my banded bracers.  I just want to make sure before I buy another totemic piece and then find out I can't wear it...<br />
<br />
How about one more question while I'm on a roll...  For a shield, I'm looking to get a crystal webshield.  I've seen it priced around 100-120pp, which seems decent.  Is this a good move?  I've heard some folks mention the charred guardian shield, but I'm seeing that priced out of my league (300-400pp).  I've also heard mention the sporestrand shield, but I'm thinking $ for $ the 15AC of the crystal webshield will be tough to beat at my level (19th).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Thanks much in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just buy Totemic.  It's cheaper than questing for the items.  The gems for the quest cost 110p or so not to mention the time it takes to get the dropped items.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can probably get a full suit for around 1k.  Ry'gorr is also very cheap and very nice.</div></div><hr />

Are you talking about twink equip or stuff at that lvl?<br />
<br />
How much money you got to spend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can buy the totemic, but it's much more rewarding gathering the items and doing the turn ins.  You just have to be smart on retrieving a couple of the quest items.<br />
<br />
IIRC, the totemic armor is all lore, except for the bracers so you can wear two of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depending on your Server's ecconomy (I'm on Torvon) cheap jaundiced pieces (arms, gloves, feet, head) sell for about the same as totemic.  Much better AC for about the same price.<br />
If your poor and want to level quickly to dogdog don't quest for totemic.  Buying the gems is about 100pp per piece, when the totemic gaunts go for 100 all the time on Torvon. <br />
<br />
Make a Baz mule and check in for totemic/jauncided when you log on/off.  It will be worth your time.<br />
<br />
Ry'gorr is also a good option to cheaply fill in the expensive slots (chest, legs).<br />

Get the 6AC 65HP rings<br />
