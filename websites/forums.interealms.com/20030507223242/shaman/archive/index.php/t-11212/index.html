<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My thoughts aren't terribly organized here, so bare with me, small rant inc.<br />
<br />
Why is everyone so concerned about wisdom all the time?  The only reason people care about wisdom is that it gives us mana.  Why not cut out the middle man and go straight for mana?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that wisdom isn't important at all, but it is at MOST the 3rd, and imho the 4th stat that you should worry about in an equipment upgrade.<br />
<br />
HP &gt; Mana &gt; Sta &gt; Wis<br />
<br />
With Cann5 and Quiessence(Torpor is just as good) I can only think of a few times that I've gone OOM in grinds/raids except when I've been buffing or when I get rezed in(obviously).  With a shaman's ability to regen mana, there is absolutely no reason to focus your gear around mana/wis items.<br />
<br />
Some of you are gonna say, that it's different for me cause I'm 65 with 2.7k hp and 3.9k mana with FT11, and up untill recently, I might have agreed with you.  But now, I'm slowly seeing the light.  Ditch that crappy +wis gear.  Base your gear around overall HP and Mana increases, with HP being primary of course.  Use magelo, it works great for figuring out what would be viable upgrades.  The only beef I have with magelo is that you can't incorporate buffs, which can skew some of your end results because of hard/soft caps.  <br />
<br />
Finally.... the next shaman I see using a Lodizal that isn't swimming or using it in a +resist situation, i'm gonna slap.<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear input from other shaman, high level and low level.  I'm I way off base?  Does this make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that sounds about what i've always read here at the crucible.<br />
<br />
I also agree with it 100 %<br />
I just hit 60, no torpor or canni v and with just KM and Canni 4 i rarely run out of mana.<br />
<br />
I have 170 wis without KEI (which i usually dont bother with either) and I never even tried to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree about the lodizal shell.  the resists and ac are nice but I really just don't want to give up my cloak of the wise for it cause it gives me great hps.  I'm in a shaman heavy guild and i think I'm the only one of the ten of us that prefers the cloak of the wise to the lodizal simply cause of the hps its offers.  I am wearing some few WIS strong items but only because i havn't come accross any upgrades in my playing time that warrent swapping yet.  <br />
<br />
I will say that although my tendancy is for HP gear i do like to keep somewhat balenced but if ya see any gear in my magelo that screams out to be swapped let me know and i'll keep trying to convince my fellow shammy in my guild of the hp importance :)  (i think all of them really know but just wont get rid of the lodi shield for some reason)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't eschew wisdom totally... strike a balance. If your wis is under around 160 you'll start to notice spells fizzling more. Also you need a certian size of mana pool to stay functional, but as long as you never find yourself OOM then your pool is probably big enough.<br />
<br />
My personal priorities are HP &gt; AC &gt; Wisdom ... currently running at about 2000hp, 950 AC, 190 wis unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With canni HP &gt; WIS.<br />
<br />
At 61 I have 1800hp, 163wis unbuffed and do just fine -- I rarely find myself oom. With self buffs I'm nearly at 2400 hp. If I need more WIS I have a +11wis cloak to throw on but I rarely find myself needing it.<br />
<br />
It really wouldn't be that hard to get 2000hp unbuffed if I shopped around. Would probably lose some AC and WIS but not enough to make me panic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I totally agree, HP/AC overal, i know i'm not as high level as you to say this but still.............<br />
<br />
BTW the Acrylia Studded Cloak i have in Magelo is because while in dsp i picked up enuff acrylia to make one and a guildie offered to make it so i got all the stuff that i need aswell (70pp for superd rockhopper pelt and like 2 silver for pattern)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's probably the bane of all that have ever talked in the shaman channel...how high should your wisdom be compared with your lvl.  I remember hearing someone on the shaman channel talk about how his group actually kicked him out in one of the higher lvl tiers planes when they asked him for some reason what is was and he started that it was at something like 100.  I mean, seriously, there is a point to shoot for and a point to stay above/below.<br />
<br />
I personally, was keeping myself happy at around 170 unbuffed wisdom.  Then as the equipment got better with the added hps/ac/sta my wisdom actually increased dramatically too.  I found myself getting upwards near maxed out with KEI on.  Not a big deal with me, cause Iknow that I couldn't honestly find a good upgrade at the time with the current guild that I am in.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said, it has been slowly going back down again with some good upgradeable gear.  I mean, think about it, if you are like me, I tend to buff every person that it's my group that asks for it with whatever they want (bar Avatar, and I don't happen to volunteer that I have that spell).  This will easily drain my whole mana pool, especially casting FoSoul.  So, I cast canni5, and still have a good amount of my pool gone.  Well, that's an easy fix, cause I know that I can just canni it back, but there comes a time that you are actually wasting your groups time if you are just straight hps over all mana/wis at all.  I can effectively function in the group as the only slower and only healer in say a PoV exp group.  I can do this, however, it takes a tremendous amount of effort for me to keep myself cannied and torpored and full of mana and health after each fight.  Do I do it sometimes...sure, if I want my group to keep getting exp instead of sitting there waiting for the next cleric/druid to go LFG.  Would I be more effective not doing it.  Damn straight.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, with low wisdom and low mana items, you will only be able to perform one function, and that is to slow the mob.  I enjoy being able to perform more than one function.  I like being able to say that I can tank a mob if slowed and if it's needed to enable the group to concentrate on the other mob in camp...especially if it happens to be non rootable.  I enjoy being able to hear someone tell me that &quot;Hey, you tank better than some tanks that I know&quot; or &quot;Hey, you heal better than some clerics I know&quot;.  It's all about finding the balance between what you are comfortable with and what you can get by with.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, I do wear the Lodi Shield.  I have been meaning to upgrade to the Hiero Cloak, but I've been holding off because I did not want to give up the extra AC that I gained with it.  Now that I'm at the point wheer I know that I can solo my way to that camp, and I am not worried about getting to 65 anymore, then I will go camp myself one..as soon as I'm finished camping the Tae Ew stuff that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When compared to the others that have posted here I am quite a low level. <br />
<br />
But when I talk with other shammies I know around the same level as me they haven't broken 1k hp at 35. <br />
<br />
Then I have clerics and tanks asking me how much HP I have because I just tanked three mobs at once, being less of a mana sink then the warrior in my group.<br />
<br />
Self buffed I can reach nearly 1300HP at my level and I am self twinked btw, while soloing with KEI, I have a mage friend that tells me that he hates mobs that double for more then 80, my basic response is , &quot; Only 80? Come on once slow hits I can solo three of these&quot; Oddly enough I have soloed three at once with him watching.<br />
<br />
He always asks me what my HP and AC is and after I tell him he never believes. As for AC I have yet to break the 650AC mark unbuffed, which I am quite ashamed of right now as I am still wearing some poopy armor that needs the toss.<br />
<br />
Moving onto WIS, unbuffed I only have 134, with KEI I have about 159, the amount of wis I am lacking doesn't bother me with the new HP gear I got, as before I had 170 WIS KEI buffed. Even with canni 1 I can still stay near FM at the end of fights.<br />
<br />
Well this has become a long post and I'm not sure if I even said anything worth saying here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HP is always the most important stat in an item, BUT, do not underestimate the importance of a decent sized mana pool.  There WILL be times when you run oom or nearly from having to spam high-cost heals.  +Mana and +Wis are both effective ways to raise this.<br />
<br />
For the most part though, HP is where it's at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I rarely group.  When I do, I have some form of clarity 95% of the time.  Outdoors, I have a cheap horse which was well-worth the money, although he does go through my halas meat pies and grobb liquidised meats like there's no tomorrow.  I can't recall the last time I've been oom, other than after a res.  Unbuffed i'm at about 2khp, 900ac, 123wis at 57, with not-so-good gear.  It works well for me, although if you prefer wisdom gear its not my place to tell you what to do.  My only drawback at having such low wisdom is that I'd like to start tradeskilling, which is a bad idea without max (or close to it) wis or int.  Magelo in sig.</div></div><hr />
