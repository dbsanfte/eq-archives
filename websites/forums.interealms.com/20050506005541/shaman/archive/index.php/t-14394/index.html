<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I shelled out the cash, to raise my alchemy to 178 (atm), to help with potions for friends and guildies.   I always carry 1 gate potion on me, for emergency reasons (on raids, no wizards, someone has to leave, etc).  So, me and my RL wife, run to Cobalt Scar from Thurg.  (Wanted to use my SS key, so it would get key ringed and I could destroy).  Anyways, we get there, I hand her a gate potion, start using my spiritstone, and she says wait.  I said what's up?  She tells me that the gate was unstable.<br />
<br />
Unstable gates?? On a potion??  This is just wrong, seeing the cost to make it, the cost to get to the point of making it, and it being expendable and used up, IF it does go unstable !!!<br />
<br />
I /bug'ed it.  Anyone else find this just wrong?<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO wrong! No you cant go unstable on a 400pp something potion! Usally melee carry around one just in case something happens, but if it goes unstable? thats BS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/////agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd be super pissed if I was a melee who had to use one as my only means of getting out of whatever mess i was in and it crashed. Thats just to f***ed up IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember that happened when I cast Gate (the spell) a few times way back when I was low level. Then it never happened again for over two or three years. Just recently it's happened 2 or 3 times again. Must be the RNG being a dick lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It happened to me yesterday 3 times in a row lol.  Luckily I was just roaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happened to me 2 times in a row, in Plane of Tranq.<br />
Not really a big deal, I just wait for the icon to pop up again. But with a gate potion I'd be super PO'ed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had my first unstable gate back in late 1999 when I was a newb, I don't remember hardly any unstable gates once I got over level 16... until about a year ago when it became a very common occurance for gates to start collapsing.  You can not tell me that all the people in guild that started complaining about it all of a sudden just happened to have the same messed up RNG.<br />
<br />
Hell every single time we kill Agnarr we have numerous people that have collapsed gates cast on them by Karana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very bad luck, and it shouldn't happen with potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Utterly wrong.  That deserves a constant feedback.  Store bought ones are no fail and our gate potions should be the same considering the time and money to get those trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I'm glad someone posted this because I have some input that I wouldn't have thought to post otherwise.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that whenever I cast gate, then tab out to another window to read forums or watch pr0n or whatever, my gate collapses.  Doesn't happen ALL the time but enough that I noticed.  3-4 times so far, only when I'm tabbed out to another window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It could be just coincidence, but my gates seem to have a greater chance to be unstable if I'm levitating. Well, I've had them go unstable more often in that state, but it's hard to say as it happens so infrequently. It's just plain stupid that it was unstable from a POTION!!! Potions should be like clickies. Clickies don't fizzle, so potions should not fail either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Store bought ones are no fail and our gate potions should be the same considering the time and money to get those trivial.<br />
Storebought instant gates can collapse.  I have a guildmate that got stuck in ToV once because his potion collapsed.  We all laughed at him.<br />
<br />
Potions just cast the gate spell.  It's the same gate spell that the rest of us all cast.  It collapses just the same.  I'd rather see the levitate and enduring breath potions fixed to not need reagents, than the bother with gate potions.  Get a 10 charge gate potion.<br />
<br />
ps  I think I have had the worst luck with collapsed gates, with getting 4 of them IN A ROW one day.  I wish i had a screenshot of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Maybe it has to do with internal conection issues between servers. I mean, as i read above, it usually happens some times in a row or never... It looks like the server had a temporary problem to transfer the info to your new location (internal lag or something) and the implementation is a gate collapsing. Just a thought. (¿Does it happen with wiz-dru ports?)<br />
P.S. Forgive my typos please. I am spanish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think it's tied into lag issues more than it is RNG myself.  I get a lot more collapses if I'm on dialup than I do on cable.  Same thing if I'm in a busy zone compared to an old world empty zone.</div></div><hr />

I don't think thats the case. If the zone is down. It tells you that and ports you to the safe spot in the zone (succor point).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That is horsemanure. Collapsing on a potion? Lame, lame lame. Hogwash. Horsefeathers. Poppycock. Fiddlesticks. <br />
<br />
(recieved a warning for swearing recently, sorry, but you get the point) :D</div></div><hr />

Fixed? What do you mean? You mean Everlasting breath and levitation still need reagents?</div></div><hr />
