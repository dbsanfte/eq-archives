<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I was heading to the hoppers cave in DS for some hides (damn tailoring addiction :p ).<br />
<br />
Well, the Sambatas were up and no hopper. Camped the Tribal Leader to repop the hoppers.<br />
<br />
Funny thing when was I saw the tribal advisor, an Erudit male with some nice looking hammer.<br />
<br />
Cast Turgur, resisted, back to spot, recast slow, resisted...<br />
<br />
Strange ...<br />
<br />
Then he started to whack me baaaaad, 177 177 177 177 <br />
<br />
*** ???<br />
<br />
I let puppy aggro a bit, move back, torpor, casted malo, then slow who landed this time.<br />
<br />
Time to cons the mob (a bit late :p)...  WHITE, he was a damn lvl 60 mob .<br />
<br />
I managed to kill him, but it was really close.<br />
<br />
Thx Verant, what's the point to drop a so high level mob in this zone when the others are max 50 ????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're actually blaming VI for your failure to con a mob before attacking it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And actually blamin VI for him not connin a lv60 MoB he was able to solo ????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Of course.  There should be a pop up box giving the mob's level and asking for confirmation every time you try to cast/auto attack/bash a mob.<br />
<br />
Damn VI!  Damn them to hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The real question is:  what'd it drop? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The real question is: what'd it drop? <br />
<br />
Sounds like almost fenril if he hadnt had the pup up lol?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not blaming Verant for my own stupidity ;).<br />
<br />
But in a zone where every mobs is green/light blue (at least in the hoppers cave), this mob is way too high for the average player who is around.<br />
<br />
Even the Leader Garn, the sambata boss, is lvl 50 max (blue but no summoning).<br />
<br />
I don't see any lvl 50- group killing the advisor and that is stupid from Verant ;).<br />
<br />
Well, just my opinion.<br />
<br />
The loot ? Intel's Hammer (del 25, dam 13 wis 4, clr dru shm bst).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and the big question is<br />
- any bad faction hits against Erud factions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this with a 55 SK, 55 Enc, me (56 at time)... and a 41 BST.    We were there for the guildmate BST who was looking for the drop off Hoppers.   First time around it didn't drop ... so we were going to work through the Sambata's to try again.    <br />
<br />
The Advisor conned yellow to me ... so he was 57/58 on that spawn.    Tash first ... then Slow ... which hit first cast ... and he was a normal fight ... high HP but didn't summon but we were close anyway.   <br />
<br />
So ... killed couple more waiting on chief ... Advisor spawns again but this time Red (either 59 or 60).    <br />
<br />
No faction hit with Eru ... only with Sambata's.     But it did seem weird to get a 57-60 spawn at this location instead of the Chief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It isn't out of character to have a higher level mob in a lower level zone.  The Chancellor in LOIO, Dvinn in Crushbone, the roaming guard in OT, Mino Hero in Steamfont, Cazel in Oasis, and basically every other zone in the game.  It's normal.</div></div><hr />
