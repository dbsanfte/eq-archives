<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of you know I run Shaman of Justice (http://www.planeteq.com/shaman). I'm considering some changes to it but need your opinions to see in what direction I take the website now.<br />
<br />
For one, I'm considering a rename of it, from Shaman of Justice to EverShaman. I am tempted due to the fact I started SoJ as a Barb Shammy site only, but then extended it into all races of Shaman. However the other five races are reluctant to visit the site due to the Justice aspect of the name. Is EverShaman a good name? can you think of a better name?<br />
<br />
I'm also considering getting an actual web address for the website. GameSpy is a nice host, but the website gets ignored because of it's subdirectory address. This is also a reason for me to change the name, since www.shamanofjustice.com is very longwinded. What is your opinions on web addresses? Another thing to consider would be the cost to me. I could have advertising and a paypal link like so many other sites, but in the end the burden for the address would fall on me.<br />
<br />
Another thing would be any comments on the site you have. It would be nice to hear them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all Thank you for the site :) it is great  and to answer your question I would say evershaman (poll is closed so could not vote) shaman of justice is good also but for any evil roleplaying shamans point of view would not settle well, and again i am bookmarking your site friend it is Great 2 thumbs up !!!!  *edit* DOh i guess it would help if i was logged in LOL ok voted now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out <br />

They have very competitive rates for webspace. 7 bucks a month isn't very high at all considering all the features you get. And if your site is a smaller website email aaron on the site I'm sure he can work out a smaller plan with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't mind visiting something which was originally a 'barb-only' website, just means I get to tease you about the skirts and makeup :D  We're all shamans after all, its not like a *twitch* druid *twitch* website....  I type like a bat out of hell and have no problems with long URLs, but I imagine hunt &amp; peck typers might like something shorter.  In short, I think its cool as-is, but then my opinion usually doesn't fall into majority categories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about &quot;Shaman of Norrath&quot;.  &quot;Evershaman&quot; just doesn't do it for me, dunno about anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like Weissblau's suggestion - Shaman of Norrath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally like Witchdoctor's Hut...but that's just me....<br />
<br />
witchdoctors.com is an available domain name:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heya,<br />
First off, I just wanna say that I really, really like your site.  The set up is clean; its easy to navigate around, and it has good info.  I personally like the title Shammans of Justice, but that has more to do with my style of play, and MY OWN percieved role in the over all EQ universe.  I reaize that there are people out there who really get into playing the evil side of the shamman, and that is very cool too.  It gives a good ammount of variety, when peeps bring some attitude into thier characters. <br />
&quot;May the Tribuneral Defend the Rightious!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Domain names are cheap enough anyway - the hosting is the larger expense...  If you want to keep it hosted where it's at for the time being, I could set up a redirect for you from a domain name to your existing site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the problem with the hosting is if I got a domain name It'd have to be hosted elsewhere since Gamespy dont allow their hosted sites to be linked to with a url other than the one they give</div></div><hr />
