<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The footage was fimed over the course of about a week in Dec 2001. Though, I just recently got done with the final cut. Normally it wouldn't take that long, but I had some trouble finding someone with a TV-In connector on their video card.<br />
<br />
The quality at the beginning kinda sucks cause i had a friend convert that part of it to MPG for me. The quality improves after the Aaryonar footage cause thats the stuff I did myself.<br />
<br />
I used Ulead Videostudio 5 to do my video editing.<br />
<br />
<br />
How I did it:<br />
Used my TV-Out connector from my video card to my TV with an RCA cable and used a VCR to record it. After the footage was on a VCR tape, I used my TV-In connector on my video card and the same RCA cable to send it back to my computer. This is actually alot easier than you'd think.<br />
<br />
<br />
The song on the video is called &quot;One Armed Man (Play On)&quot; by Project 86.<br />
<br />
Hope you like it! I enjoyed making it. I'm thinking about doing the same thing for some luclin mobs and stuff too.<br />
<br />
Here's where I need your help. Is the movie too big? Too small? Too blurry? Would you trade off bigger file size for a better image quality? Would you trade off bigger file size for better sound quality? etc.<br />
<br />
You need to download Divx if you havent already got it. http://www.divx.com <br />
<br />
The movie is around 16MB big. I suggest right clicking the link and selecting &quot;Save Target As...&quot; and saving it to your hard drive rather than trying to stream it.<br />
<br />
If anyone would like to host a mirror of the movie, that would be great. Just post a link to it and I'll get the mirror link back up here in the main post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG thats awesome, best real life raid footage ive seen yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fifner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't believe that more people haven't replied to this posting.  This is the first eq movie footage I have ever seen.  It rocked, especially with the music. <br />
<br />
If you want to do another one, well then go for it!  I would love to see more.<br />
<br />
One question though.  Can you get better resolution?<br />
<br />
Good video!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awesome movie Gres...keep em comin :)<br />
<br />
Like the previous poster suggested, better resolution maybe next time.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how to make something like this so I'm not sure if you could do it in a better resolution or how big the file would be if you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice job!<br />
<br />
File size isn't a problem for me, so a longer video would be OK too.<br />
<br />
<br />
A couple of suggestions:<br />
Turn up game res higher, minimize transparent windows. It could be harder to play, but last time I recorded game footage, I didn't play and just focused on characters and mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That was really well done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I liked the footage. Nice work. Quite entertaining to watch!<br />
<br />
I would trade off a bigger download for better quality if given the option - I'm on cable.<br />
<br />
Only thing I didn't care for was the music ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Link broken fix please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That was awesome!  Make more please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice job! =)<br />
<br />
Yeah, the reso was a little bit bad, but you could still see what mattered pretty clearly (mobs, people, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It was cool until it crashed my computer<br />
<br />
=-x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Very nice! Maybe you can move into the gap left now that Parallax  is gone. Their movies were great as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zerglin Rush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">very very well done, congrats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ultigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That was neat. Especially liked the background music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Very cool stuff.<br />
<br />
Wonder if there are any movies of Sleeper awakening...<br />
<br />
...there is a really good Sleepers Tomb movie floating around that has a 'Wumpscut' soundtrack. <br />
<br />
Very badass movie... Yours was GREAT! but I gotta give the 'best movie' to the Sleepers Tomb one.<br />
<br />
Keep workin at it! AMAZING first try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm, my Windows Media Player seems to only play the sound</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Durnitol:  Go here (http://www.divx.com/divx/) - download the Free one and install it.  Then you should be fine.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gresgoth, great job for your first attempt.  Since you are looking for feedback, I'll provide some.  I don't know all that much about this stuff, but I have been making movies for a bit, so take the advice that I give you with that in mind.<br />
<br />
It appears that you could be exporting at low quality from your initial capture device.  So if you are porting to VCR from your Game PC, you might want to bring it into your capture card at like 720X480.  Then use this to edit, that way when you are ready to clip down to 320X240 you will have less degradation.<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed a black boarder around your film, you might want to edit this out.  You can use Adobe Premiere and export the 720X480 movie that you have already captured and cut/trim the black border out.  This is another reason to do your initial export in 720X480, so when you start tuning your film, you won't loose as much quality.<br />
<br />
Also, I prefer full screen mode when shooting film.  I think it looks so much cleaner /shrugs.  To each his own I guess.<br />
<br />
I do what I mentioned above to my guild's films.  While they are not all that great (they are way too big), they might give you additional insight into what I am trying to explain.  Here are 2 of films, just click on the images below:<br />

Shoot me an email, Gresgoth, if you have any questions about what I have done.  Also, if you have any suggestions for what I have done please lemme know......sour_milk@excite.com<br />
<br />
In all, I am very inpressed for your first shot at it, Gresgoth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I didn't download that Divx software, due to the download site having several warnings about spyware / adware etc. Wouldn't it be possible to make these movies in a standard, non-proprietary format like MPEG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Format issues notwithstanding - I just downloaded a couple of Bini's movies, which played ok on standard Windows media player.<br />
<br />
Bini - I'm impressed :) Those movies rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>CauldronBourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have quite a few EQ movies that I have downloaded and put up on my website if anyone is interested in takign a look at them.<br />
<br />
I have the CQ SLeepers video, some paralax movies and a few others.<br />
<br />
I also have some done by Vision of Ayonae Ro.  www.guildvision.org<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Awesome movie! Thanks for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Instead of recording to a vcr then back into the computer, u could send the video out directly into a second computer for better quality and higher resolution... that is if u have a second computer spare to do recording.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">More resoloution please!<br />
<br />
Would have been interesting to see what class the filmmaker was..names, spells, chatwindow stuff.<br />
<br />
Seems like a fantastic way to show non-eq'ers why we spend so much time in Norrath..:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">other than the god awful music to Bini's vids. All three were excellent.  I love em! More!  <br />

Now I have to go buy a tv card :P</div></div><hr />
