VI made all slows disease based.  I like this for these reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Disease based spells are less resisted than magic (right?).  I was able to land the plague of insects on Giants in the Kael Arena much easier than reg slows mabye now it will be just as easy and not as much a mana burner.<br />
<br />
2.  If your tank gets slowed by a froggie you can dis aura him to get it off and not risk taking off beneficial buffs.<br />
<br />
On a side not verant knows about the extra aggro and is going to fix it.<br />
<br />
Seems verant is really tring these days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All slows are not disease based. All slows have disease counters added so they can be cured but not dispelled but everything besides PoI is still a magic resist.</div></div><hr />
