<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone had much experience duoing in PoP with a Beastlord? I have not yet had the chance since the BLs in my guild are not currently high enough, and I have not run into to many BL's in tier 1 PoP for some reason.  :confused: <br />
<br />
I have done a large chunk of my exp'ing 55+ with mages of my level, and it works great. Mage pulls to pet with mala~ and I slow, or I pull with slow and root, sick pets. Great for doing any of the easier tier 1 areas and with a pair of mages, even places like the poi junkyards are are easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Their pets are just as good as mages except they lack a DS to slap on them. At 60 they have a 50% slow to back you up in case you get in trouble and a 65% slow at 65. Their mana and hp regen combo line helps a lot with cutting back downtime. They can melee or play pet cleric with their effecient pet heals. They have weak nukes and don't get a good dot till 61 so most of their damage is melee oriented.<br />
<br />
Downsides are that they can't debuff resists like a mage, can't root nor bind anywhere like we can which can be inconvenient. For instance if you are duoing in some faraway place and you get some bad luck adds and both have to gate the best he can do is have a thurg gate potion or the talisman thingy which gates him back to PoK making for a lenghty trip back whereas a mage and you can bind somewhere nearby. Beasties also can't summon muzzles and 150pt procing weaps for your pet like a mage :)<br />
<br />
Overall they are good partners but share a lot of the shaman spells so they don't complement us as well as a mage, enchanter or necro do, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yick, who wants to keep a bst healed?  Either you'd have to dot enough to keep the mobs in teh face at all times, or play cleric to someone in leather.  Ew.<br />
<br />
As of the 57 mage pet, our critters can keep the mob more than happy in the face of bane and epic.  Mage always nabs a c3 before we head out to partner, so the bst regen spell is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Lot of overlap in shm/bst ... would be about as good a combo as druid/ranger, I'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug*<br />
<br />
In my experience, SHM/BST works well - but then, SHM/anything works well. (as does BST/anything)  Due to spell line overlap, I wouldn't say they're the ideal duo, I suspect a Mage makes a better partner for either one in PoP zones.</div></div><hr />
