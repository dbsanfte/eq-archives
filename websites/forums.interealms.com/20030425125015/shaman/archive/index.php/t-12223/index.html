<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now I was very supprised the other day to actualy sell some Great Mystical Infusion Potions. I asked the person what use he was going to put them too and he told me that they where used as a sorce of emergancy mana regain. Now The effect is supposed to be 100 to the mana pool. which i always took to mean it upped you total mana limit by 100. NOT it gave you 100 mana per click. can anyone conferm this ? Does it heal 100 mana on each drinking or just add 100 you your total pool ?.<br />
<br />
Example : 1000 mana pool you drink one you have 1100 But you will need to med upto that new limit.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
Example: 1000 mana pool you drink one your pool goes upto 1100 AND it gives you the 100 as well. you use 500 mana and drink another potion your pool stays at 1100 but you mana goes from 600 to 700.<br />
<br />
If it is working like a mana heal then maybe i can sel lsome more ,hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, good question.<br />
<br />
Infusion (self)<br />
1: Increase Mana by 1000 (L55)<br />
Classes: Nec (L55)<br />
<br />
Covetous Subversion (any target)<br />
2: Increase Mana by 100 (L44)<br />
Classes: Nec (L44)<br />
<br />
Greater Mystical Infusion<br />
4: Increase Total Mana by 100 (L1)<br />
Classes: None<br />
<br />
Looking simply at the description, I'd say so.  Have to do some testing on it to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clickable items that boost your mana are in the game in other places, for example the beasties in Fungus Grove drop a fungus pod that has 1 charge of a mana boost. So it wouldn't be unprecedented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From Lucy:<br />
<br />
Fungal Infusion  (no rent clicky from FG)<br />
1:  Increase Mana by 250 <br />
 <br />
Infusion  (55 necro spell) <br />
1:  Increase Mana by 1000 <br />
 <br />
Mystical Infusion  (potion)<br />
4:  Increase Mana Pool by 50 <br />
 <br />
<br />
From what I understand this tells me that the potion only increases the mana pool total, not give any actual mana.  The other two Infusion spell examples just say Increase Mana, not the Mana Pool.  And unlike HP buffs, if you already have the buff on, I don't believe using another potion would give you 50 mana.  Here's why:<br />
<br />
Aegolism  <br />
2:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 1100 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 1100<br />
<br />
HP buffs include a line that says to increase HP in addition to increase the Max HP.  The mana potion does not.<br />
<br />
No, I haven't tested this.  This is all based on info from Lucy and how I understand how spells to work.</div></div><hr />
