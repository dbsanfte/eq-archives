<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the upcoming patch, some new Raid functionality was added to Test:<br />
<br />
<br />
[New Raid Functionality]<br />
<br />
- The raid window contains a new row of buttons which the raid leader can use to organize the raid members into groups.<br />
<br />
- Lock/Unlock:  The raid must be locked before the raid leader may use any of the new buttons.<br />
<br />
- RemLeader:  Removes the 'Group Leader' flag from the selected player from the 'Players Not in a Group' list.  (Only 12 players may be Group Leaders, so this may be necessary to allow creation of a new group with a new leader).<br />
<br />
- NoGroup:  Removes the selected player from their current group and put them into the 'Players Not in a Group' list.<br />
<br />
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12:  Moves the selected player into the numbered group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Woot very nice! I know our raid leader will be happy about those. People always seem to be afk when he wants them switched around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What a happy day for raid coordinators!  Being able to move folks around easily is just great.  Course, you can weed out the non-listeners and frequently AFK folks the old way.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd even go so far as to say this will be of even more help in pickup raids than guild raids.<br />
<br />
Sure, it helps each, but pickup raids are by far harder to organize and this will make that job a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, this will be very nice, as long as i don't get demoted from raid LAA theif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Will also make it a lot easier for the raid leader to shuffle us around for shrinks if needed.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hahaha - ns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: Moves the selected player into the numbered group.<br />
<br />
lol I wonder how that's gonna work.  You're just chillin in LFG land...and suddenly BAM you're sitting in a group with 5 people? Or 5 NEW people? No warning? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only if you are already in the raid.  You can't just be yanked out of nowhere into the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, happy day for guild raid leaders!! WOO!! :cool:<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A wonderful, wonderful change! Now frustrated raid organizers no longer have to port AFK melees to PoHate and leave them there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">man,this is a great idea,its a shame it wasnt able to be implemented earlier...or was it? 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I used to lead large raids I would have sacraficed entire gnome villages to any god that would grant me this. <br />
<br />
Now it'll be nice when I lead the occasional pickup raid. Huge huge time saver and don't need to worry about group leaders afk'n right when you sent them a list of people to invite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What a great idea.  As someone stated, its most usefull application will probably be pick up raids.  Most guilds that raid together often can form groups in minutes from habit and long association; pick ups, especially those with 50+ people, take a long time to set up.<br />
<br />
I did a pick up for TT last night.  72 people going from 5 guilds...and it took over 2 hours to get groups set up.  PITA..seriously.  I got a group early because I was one of 2 shaman there;  I went AFK to eat and played Civilization on the laptop for about 90 minutes and came back and they still werent done yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm glad to see this finally happen. I know that as others have said, our raid leaders get very grouchy when they are trying to move people around in groups and 50% of the people are AFK. Although this is going to lead to some confusion without the leaders saying something before they move them, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I musta missed the part about raid leaders being able to toggle slow mitigation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This will give the raid leader the ability to weed out all the dead weight for the raid.  Bye bye Shaman 3, 4, 5 on a raid, we don't need you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So they spend time adding more features to something that already works yet almost all of our 10 points on the bug-/wishlist cant be handled now because it would require &quot;coding&quot;???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nothing of the sort was ever said about our Top 10 list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This improvement is substantially better than about 8 items on the shaman wishlist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">now they just should add a command where you can add raidlooters without the raidwindow (like /addlooter name or so) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Useful change. Hmm have they sorted that when a raid zones and gets bugged bug?</div></div><hr />

Ummm ya lets see <br />
<br />
Fixed:<br />
Raid issues that make life easier but dont alter game play - Check<br />
<br />
In the stack under &quot;reply to moms nagging Emails&quot;:<br />
Look at Shaman functionality to alter thier game play and bring them back in line with other progression - wait for it..... wait for it..... keep waiting for it.... check bank deposits..... wait for it.... (see a pattern here?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Tell me, show me where it was said that issues on our list could not be handled because they required coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sorry Sudedor I was wrong. I thought Brenlo had actually said something about our shaman concerns but it was more general issues he dismissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Wow, this patch almost....ALMOST....makes some of the people at SoE seem....smart :p .  <br />
<br />
Anyway~ YAY...hopefull that will cut down on set up time significantly.  And for those who ninja AFK during set up..you dont have to wait for their butts to come back to move them :)</div></div><hr />
