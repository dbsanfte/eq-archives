<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ack msg board bug was supposed to be in response to new iksar shaman one..<br />
<br />
In response to below ;)<br />
<br />
I am not gonna get into the whole JBB debate...ok I will<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 with 65hp per tick regen...if you need a JBB or feel it makes a difference power to you...<br />
<br />
I can convert enough hp to mana during a fight without skipping a beat on dots and Icestrike (675dmg) that waiting 8 seconds for 275dmg is a waste.<br />
<br />
Also when doing basic xping (Root/rot) JBB would constantly break root..id rather Epic/Pox/Bane and canna mana back for next fight. Time spent casting JBB is time I could be doing Canna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am a Shammy noobie, but a great read and very informational nonetheless. <br />
<br />
I see your an Iksar shammy...lol...nothing about jbb tactics?<br />
<br />
Actually (joke aside) I have a 9 Ikky Shammy and am almost tempted to stop now and re-roll a troll.  It would seem they are the best Shamans, though I know I should just play what I want :)<br />
<br />
As a very casual player, I know I am just being a worry-wort....</div></div><hr />
