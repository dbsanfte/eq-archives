<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i'm level 39 atm and i was looknig for a new place to hunt after getting canni 2 (whoop!). My guildie told me to do specs near PoF ent in Feerott, they were a bit hard and only 1 single pull so a bit slow. Then i decided to hit EW and do ulthorks. BLAM! These things are an uncamped gold mine. They are better exp then DSP imo and theres loads of em to pull plus they drop 4pp average and ulthork drops and the ulthork tusk quest(look it up in allakzham and someone did a post about it so trying searching for it) which will give you a random gem for every 4 tusks handed in. I am doing this right now with C3 and its non-stop pulling, pullnig 2 sometimes jsut to see my mana bar at 70 at the end of the fight and HP at full(ikky BP). They are found on the north coastline in Eastern Wastes near the giant fort thing(marked on www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastesmap.html). Basically pull with slow and slap on Scourge(venom of Snake seems to fizzle a lot cuz its a new spell). Tank for dogdog and keep youself hasted and SoWed aswell as the dog. Also keep bearform and chloplast on for canni(or canni2). I think this place will be good till 44. BEtter than DL and DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">intresting , ive heard this place tossed around ebfore , i think i might try with my 41 SK , kaesora is getting boring.<br />
<br />
thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a great camp if you can get it but I found that all to often one quad-kiting druid was there ruining it.  It's almost perfect for them so it is camped a lot.  I hope you get lucky and keep it away from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunted Ulthorks quite a bit in my low 40's and with my druid from 31 to 44 (tried to be a considerate quadder, hehe).<br />
<br />
Some tips -<br />
<br />
The cliff by the Coldain camp to the east is free of roamers, as is the cliff/beach to the west.  Pull the ulthork out of its habitat into these areas to avoid any chance of adds.  Quadders who know what they are doing will pull into these areas, but they are pretty big and there should be room for 3-5 people.<br />
<br />
Ulthorks drop tusks, rarely.  Keep them.  When you get four sets of tusks, go to Cobalt Scar and find the otter chief.  Give him all four sets and get back a gem or sellable item worth, on average, 125-175 plat.  You will often see people offering you 10-15-20 plat per set of tusks, don't take them up on it unless you really need the cash right now.<br />
<br />
Make room in your bags and reduce your weight.  These guys drop lots of Ulthork hide armor and coin loot, as well as Walrus Tooth piercers.  Just selling the armor to vendors will net you 3-5pp per piece.  You WILL be overburdened quickly and will have to run sell.  Thurg is pretty close if you have good Coldain faction, Kael if you have good Giant faction.  You'll be making that run every hour or so, so I'd advise binding in Thurg/Kael so you only have to run it one way.  Just selling the dropped loot to vendors and pocketing coins netted me 100-150 plat per hour, IN ADDITION TO the loot from the Ulthork tusk quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in EW right now, soloing the Ulthork hunters and the seals here. All are even or yellow to me at 30, and I get 3% per kill.<br />
<br />
Strange thing is I decided to try a red con Ulthork Warrior--pulled with slow, rooted, smacked on some Dots, nuked until root broke, then tanked until it was time to re-apply slow, to get defense up--and they only give 2% exp per kill. Less than their yellow-con brethren  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another suggestion would be pok since the book is close to EW zone, will try this out later, sounds good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Codybear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My hubby has a druid that I took here at 40. She leveled to 52 off the warriors (quad kiting tho). Exp and money are great. Thinking of taking my hubies warrior here when we can finally duo together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oggokk bouncers drop 10-20pp (vendor + plat) and are 2-3% exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oggokk bouncers drop 10-20pp (vendor + plat) and are 2-3% exp<br />
<br />
they have long respawns and are generally more difficult than non-guard mobs.<br />
<br />
One zone i had fun in at this level was stonebrunt mountains..mobs drop up to opal bracelets as the most valuable loot (pandas and gorillas mainly drop the good stuff) and there is no end to mobs, and with SOW you can outrun aggro if you get in over your head so NO chance of death.  Best pull spot is around the waterfall in north end of zone as nothing paths around it--just be wary of the beastlord epic mob..it aggros everyone if a raiding party for some reason wipes to it and it will kill you; although you shouldnt be anywhere near it so would be of minor concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Might be harder, but very good education on how to handle CC and such.<br />
Also no chance of death and vendors very close (you will become KOS only to the bouncers)<br />
<br />
They have a long spawn rate (20min) but there are 10 of them to pull.<br />
<br />
Extremely good loot and xp combo.<br />
<br />
At 44 I made 500pp and 60% xp in 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is not true on AB, so if you play on this server be aware that the bouncers are level 80 mobs that drop no loot and gives no xp whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">are you talking about inside ogguk or around ogguk in feerott?  Inside the city i've never messed around and tried so they might not be so bad, but outside there definitely arent 10 of them milling around :/<br />
<br />
At 44 you could make better exp and loot in jaggedpine forest killing the griffawns/griffons and willowisps and also the bears and wolves..although only the griffs and wisps drop any real loot (panthers sometimes do drop something nice, but are considerably harder, and anacondas probably arent worth the time at 44).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Inside.<br />
Tried the guards inside at 41. I noticed a few things:<br />
1. They don't stay rooted<br />
2. They add like flies on dookie<br />
3. They don't hit all that hard, but when you're fighting three or more they tend to beat the crap out of you, and Todo too.<br />
<br />
I may try again, I know I can kill one or two at a time, but my first pull brought three.  I could have delt with three if they didn't have teflon feet, but it was just too chaotic having three Ogres alternating beatings between me and my doggie and I was forced to zone out.<br />
<br />
I was pulling from the tower near the entrance of the zone. Is there a better spot to find guards?<br />
<br />
Also, if you're hunting guards here, DO NOT TRY TO FIGHT THE EXTERMINATOR.  He doesn't hit too hard, but I think he has about 1 kajillion hitpoints. He's blue at 42. I landed slow, Venom, and nuked several times, almost all my spells landed, but he never got below 99% health.  Best I can figure is he's a quest NPC that SOE doesn't want people killing.</div></div><hr />
