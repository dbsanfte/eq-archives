<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay every other pet out there has hands.  Our of course has paws!  So, with that said can our pets use weapons and if so are they better with or without them?  Always wondered that.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance <br />
bored man at work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, they can.<br />
<br />
Level 55 pet can dual wield for sure, that allows for an extra hit occasionally.  I'm not sure about 49 pet<br />
<br />
Seeing something like:<br />
<br />
Slash<br />
Slash<br />
Crush<br />
Kick<br />
<br />
Isn't uncommon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, Zukl.  Need to give them a weap for primary and 2ndary hand, this seems to kick dual wield into gear 99% of the time. <br />
<br />
There's some disagreement about what they can wield, but it's safe with 1h weaps that are warrior/all usable.  I have yet to see Goner wield a 2h weap of any type.<br />
<br />
I've found that a velium weap and a gnoll hide lariat make for an excellent combination, especially with Goner's dex buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It makes a great differnce.  Dogdog hits harder... kills faster...  Hits more often...<br />
<br />
For best results use GHL...<br />
<br />
Nothing to see here.... move along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Won't wield 2handers (Mmmm, weighted axe + pet delay...)<br />
<br />
Haven't tried any class-specific weapons. They tend to be a tad pricey to hand to a pet.<br />
<br />
Dex doesn't seem to affect procs. Hate, of course, does =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah 49 pet uses 2 weapons, I often see him peirce and slash when I give him a FS dagger and LS (seem very common drops in KC :p)))  (yes I know that place sucks)<br />
<br />
I'm considering giving him a windruned dagger (2/20 rog/ranger proc 99pt DD.. got it for like 10p in bazaar.. not sure if he can proc it though, oh well :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you could give dog weapons.<br />
<br />
You could give him any classes weapons.<br />
<br />
The proccing one should be given first.<br />
<br />
then watch dog dog hit and IF he could wield them, you would see slashes, crushes, etc.<br />
<br />
If he could use weapons, you would see him hit more often and for max more often.<br />
<br />
Theoretically since dog dog delay cannot be lowered..you could hive him a high dmg/ high delay weapon and he could hit for greater than his normal max.<br />
<br />
Rumored that you can give 2 handed weapons too but of course thats hogwash. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">now if you would be able to influence the dog by giving him high damage weapons - would you see any hits above 53, and if so, what dmg would be needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Others can answer best...<br />
<br />
I 'Think' Dog-dog is 20/30<br />
<br />
so over 20 dmg weapon should show improvement.<br />
<br />
But i may be wrong.</div></div><hr />

I may have to kill you all now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tarthug, Konarg couldn't have answered your question better.  I've tried all of those weapons and they are completly useless.  It seems we will never be able to have a pet that can actually dish out damage or take advantage of any uber procs.  It would be really nice if we could though, can you imagine how often he would proc when fully dex buffed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually I dreamed the other day that I gave dogdog a 1hs, and in my dream I noticed he was biting and slashing.<br />

It was a nice dream, seemed so real also :)<br />

Maybe you should try it, I dont know about damage and delay of the pet without a weapon, but it was definitely getting the proc from the weapon to go off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanks Konarg ;)<br />

I'll take all that info into account, now, if only our pets could weild these weapons I'd be set ;)<br />

    Yes, the shaman pet can use weapons and the proc’s off the weapons do work.<br />
    I am using the 44th level pet. DEX buffed the pet. Handed him a velium mace. Pet proceeds to hit the targeted mob.<br />
    The message 'Pet crushes so-and-so for so-many-pod.' appears.  Next got the message, 'So-and-so is shredded by velium shards.'  <br />
<br />
    And no..... there was no one else around using a similar weapon.<br />
<br />
    I am not saying that it makes any kind of sense. However, I am saying it does work. For those who don't believe this, try it. It will cost you little or nothing.  <br />
