<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakalwec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about 2 boxing and was wondering what would<br />
be a good setup.  I was going to buy a Linksys 4 port router <br />
to connect both computers to the dsl line.  Anyone have any<br />
experience with the router playing EQ?  Also, will I have to<br />
buy a separate copy of EQ/Velious/Luclin for the 2nd computer?<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

    i dont know much about routers..as i just picked the cheapest first thing i saw and have been lucky it still works ;).<br />
<br />
    Only piece of advice i can give you is to keep your comps close enough where you dont have to strain to move both characters..it will get old quick if you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You need two account keys, so if you already have multiple accounts (with keys) you can install EQ on both machines (I think) and be ok.  If you only have one account now, you will need to buy a second copy of EQ for the account key.<br />
<br />
I use a Linksys 8 port router and it works fine.<br />
<br />
If you are going to be plugging all of this stuff into a power strip, you may want to go the extra expense and get a UPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">one warning you may have an LD problem with the linksys router but do not fear there is a fix.  http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/027525.html <br />
<br />
just thought i would throw that out cause i use this router and used to have terrible LD problems till i fixed it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure if they are still doing it but you can get free copies of Everquest trilogy from here (http://pc.ign.com/articles/364/364866p1.html) You will still need to buy Luclin though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't use a router, I run ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) on one of my PCs. This works fine for me, but a friend had problems with it, so YMMV.<br />
<br />
To use ICS like this, you need 2 ethernet cards in the PC, one connected to your cable modem (assuming you have one) and one connected to the hub for your local network. Hubs are much cheaper than routers, and ICS comes bundled with Windows from version 98SE onwards. The performance hit on the machine is negligible.</div></div><hr />

Alt+Tab between them, much easier than running 2 boxes, and i've done it on a dial-up connection without a problem.</div></div><hr />
