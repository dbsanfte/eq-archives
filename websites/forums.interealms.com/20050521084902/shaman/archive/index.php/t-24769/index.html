<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Gemdiver from Castersrealm sent me a tell last night. He is interested in asking representatives from each class to write a &quot;state of the class&quot; report. He has already asked the mages, you can read that report here (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=6493).<br />
<br />
Because Gemdiver asked a mage in his guild for the report, he got a little flack that he didn't consult the mage forums for a representative, that's why he sent me a tell asking for my input.<br />
<br />
I don't feel comfortable just nominating someone, so here's what I was thinking:<br />
<br />
1. I would ask for volunteers. Volunteers could PM me or post here.<br />
2. The moderators would limit the pool of volunteers to 10 (if there were more than 10 volunteers).<br />
3. We would put the names up to a vote and Crucible posters could vote for the best candidate to write a &quot;State of the Shaman&quot; report (vote would last for a week).<br />
<br />
As far as limiting volunteers to 10, I would specifically be looking for people who are passionate about the shaman class and have a proven track record of being articulate. I am the most uncomfortable with the thought of having to limit volunteers, but I can't figure out a better way.<br />
<br />
Additional details:<br />
<br />
Gemdiver says the writer can be happy or not happy with the class, they can critique SOE but not flame (no threats to kick anybody in the junk, for example).<br />
<br />
I am definitely interested in your thoughts and suggestions. If there are no major problems or concerns with this plan, I will accept volunteers until end of day MONDAY NOV 8  .<br />
<br />
Additional Suggestion <br />
<br />
Volunteers, would you mind submitting a sample of proposed report (or the entire report) to be included in the poll? It would really help people make up their mind. I will set the timeline for starting the poll for next Wednesday, if that helps you plan your time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - Monday - volunteer recruiting over<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I Volenteer.<br />
<br />
But If I write it. It would be told from Snoww's point of view. And would detail from the beginnings of the class onward. I would probably lift some material from some of my older writings though since the memory is starting to fade on specifics from almost 6 years ago in beta.<br />
<br />
Snoww</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well...that's one way to make the final 10. Hey Snoww, you better ask Gem if he has any sort of word count limit.../flee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am going to volunteer because I really know jack **** about the class and just spend most of my day looking at porn while I raid.<br />
<br />
It's a perspective one shouldn't underestimate, and I can be incredibly articulate about porn, so I might be ok at the shaman side of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why not just write it yourself, Gloriana?  You have a pretty good grasp of all things Shamanly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think a lot of other people would do a better job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I nominate Chutoi lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Question?  What is this &quot;state of the class&quot; going to be used for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can read the mage example that I linked above. This is something that Gemdiver is interested in doing for his website, Castersrealm.

Gem says:<br />
<br />
One of the new features I plan to bring to Caster's Realm is regular updates from respected members of the playing community on aspects of the game they're experts on.<br />
<br />
He also said this in his forums:<br />
<br />
The main purpose is to have a single place where people can go to read about classes other than their own. The idea behind the articles is to provide information about the current state of the class to players who are NOT playing that class. <br />
<br />
I for one wouldnt want to visit 16 different class sites a week to stay in touch with the nuances of every particular class. By having them post updates on the same site, readers who come here often will be able to get a large amount of knowledge about different classes and aspects of the game without travelling to a dozen different sites on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
He approached me for a shaman write up along the lines of the mage write up, and I said I would bring it up here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice to see castersrealm thinking of sorting themselves out at last :D<br />
first thing on their agenda should be banner/ad wiping <br />
<br />
as far as respectable shaman reps .. here goes ( excuse name typo's , am a tad drunk ) hope i dont offend anyone by putting them on list <br />
<br />
not in any particular order and i cant count either! not after 4 hours in pub anyway !<br />
<br />
chotoi<br />
giac<br />
samanna<br />
glorianna (btw very cute :p) eeeek shouldnt say that but a lil tipsy !!<br />
SnowwSilverhammer <br />
Tordail <br />
Wulfbane<br />
Faern (if u still playing)<br />
jzak <br />
Aruman<br />
Ungkor<br />
<br />
I think that gives a broad spectrum of opinions and all have solid experinece of in game issues from lvl 1 - 70 ( think everyone in list has gone from 1 -70 without having help of ebay )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm not volunteering since I'm not well versed in the high level game and probably never will be.<br />
<br />
My vote would depend on what we as shaman want to bring to this communication.<br />
<br />
If we want a heartwarming, motivating look of what shaman should and could be then my vote goes for Snoww.<br />
<br />
If we want a firey, articulate, disection of our class then my vote goes for Chutoi.<br />
<br />
I think either one could do a fabulous job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is good that he is getting it from the class boards then. I used to frequent castersrealm before it really really started to suck. Most of the posters on the message boards were extremely clueless about their own class better yet someone elses. <br />
<br />
I think any of the suggestions made so far would make really write-ups personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If there was going o be a vote, Id like to see a short draft of the document that the respondants are planning on writing.  I have read many posts by those that have volunteered already, and would agree that all so far are capable.  However, if an effort to provide the best possible write up I'd like to see samples of what will be submitted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I hate to ask people to do something, spend their time and then they don't get picked. Maybe just a paragraph (or a couple of sentences) about what they wanted to write about in the vote thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've read Gemdiver's summary, and while I'm not very picky about my group makeups (I had a 63 Beastlord in my NC group yesterday, who got two AAs while I went from 67.70 to 67.80), that summary is concise and well-written. I think we can come up with something similar.<br />
<br />
Why me? Let me post here an updated version of what I sent as a PM to Kytherea before I withdrew my application as the Class Correspondant:<br />
Character: Samanna, L67 Shaman, 250+ AAs, 200 Alchemy, Epic 1.0 and working on 1.5. All expansions owned, and over 10k LDoN points accrued.<br />
<br />
Server: Mithaneil Marr since around March of this year; Terris-Thule before then.<br />
<br />
Guild: Currently in The Gryphons (http://thegryphons.com is our new website), an attendance-voluntary guild with twice weekly scheduled raids, fielding 4-6 groups against Luclin (XTC) and TierI PoP (Terris Thule). Before this I was in a family guild (SoulBound of MithMarr) for just over half a year. Prior to that, I was the Shaman Class Officer (and forum moderator) for Unbroken Promise on Terris-Thule, a high-playtime raiding guild, hitting content like AoW, NToV, Luclin (Grieg, IV), and PoP (Grummus, AD). UP broke up when guild leader and raid leader and primary target scout each took a leave of absence (at the same time). I've never been on the bleeding edge, although I can almost see it at times, and I like reading others' accounts of it.<br />
<br />
I post as Samanna on the Sony boards and on the Shaman's Crucible, where I have a generally good reputation. I also host http://samanna.net, an online resource for the Everquest Shaman.<br />
<br />
I feel that I am a middle-ground Shaman; most of my playtime is spent grouping; I often raid (pickups for flagging and guild for lower-level mobs) and occasionally solo, but probably 70+% of my active playtime is spent grouped. I have had a Rogue to the low 20s and a Shadowknight to the low 30s, but Samanna is the character that I really connect with and enjoy playing. Once a week I group with four or five real-life friends (we used to play pen &amp; paper RPGs before EQ); the rest of the time it's guild or pickup action.<br />
<br />
I hope that I can present the issues of all Shaman, covering the whole spectrum of players, from 5 hr/wk to 50+ hr/wk players, and from soloers to groupers to raiders.<br />
<br />
Which begs the question, why did I withdraw? Because I'd rather spend my time concentrating on what's right with our class than what's wrong with it.<br />
<br />
voiceover: This is Samanna, and I endorse this message.<br />
<br />
ps, some of you may remember my ballsy intro here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15699) (actually my third post) - was that a mere 14 months ago? It seems like forever and a half...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I dont mind who writes it, as long as its not packed full of &quot;half-empty&quot; bullcrap. Our current status is a LOT brighter than it has been in the recent past, and while we certainly still have issues that could use addressing, EVERY SINGLE CLASS in this game has issues that could use addressing. <br />
<br />
Lets try to be a BIT on a &quot;half-full&quot; side, while making a solid case for the stuff that still needs fixing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Glory I was going to suggest Writing it up before hand. and posting all of it. then voting Via Poll on what one gets placed. Then everyone gets a little of thier opinions known. Can we have a poll based off of 10 or so choices?<br />

<br />
Maybe a 1 week voting period and Have all drafts in by Sunday Midnight?<br />

<br />
Maybe they could do 5 Class Correspondants that find things wroung with the shamn class and 5 Class Correspondants that think of the good points of the shaman class. <br />
<br />
But I am just a unknown shaman so I am still learning the finer points of being the shaman that I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">To be sure, the mage write-up is negative on nearly all points. Does the shaman write-up have to be that way? Certainly not. We have our problems as a class, that's a given. But we've also gotten a leg up in some areas thanks to OOW. Whether I am selected to help write the document or not, I think it needs to show that balance in a frankly honest, non-biased manner. To do anything less would be an insult to the class.<br />

<br />
I do.  The writeups are only a few paragraphs - most of the proposed authors have posts longer than this here.  It would be better to vote on the writeups than the authors.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god, make sure the shaman writeup is not as whiny and negative as the magician one.  We have strengths as well as problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I vote for Chutoi because he's on my server.<br />
<br />
But, really, I would love to see the thoughts from each of the people listed above.  And there is a reason for this:<br />
<br />
I have noticed, over the years, that people that started playing a shaman in Beta or early game, have a much different opinion of the class than people who started playing after Kunark or Velious.  There is also a general disagreement between uberguild players and small guild players about the strengths/weaknesses of the class.<br />
<br />
So, please, let everyone who is intersted write something up, however long or short.  But they must also include the following:<br />
<br />
1) Born on date<br />
2) Days played<br />
3) Current HPs/AAs<br />
4) Current guild and it's status (uber/family/in between)<br />
5) Their current raiding content, and how often they raid <br />
6) Why they started a shaman<br />
<br />
Once this is done, somebody *cough* Glori *cough* needs to sit down and put the final &quot;draft&quot; in order (just like you did before), and submit it to Castersrealm.  <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Thanks for the nomination, but I respectfully decline.  I'm probably more in line with the dude who raids and scans Pr0n.<br />
<br />
There are some eloquent folks here, and in addition to the names being tossed around I'd like to nominate Blargx as well.<br />
<br />
Glori has enough on her plate acting as zookeeper to the animals on this site (and jetsetting to New Orleans!  Hey Glori - here's some cheap, plastic beads - You know the drill!! )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well lets see....<br />
<br />
Passionate: Check (Clicks Rabid Bear)<br />
<br />
Articulate: Hrmm I tend to ramble some most of my posts are an hour+ in construction and tend to be detailed and lengthy. Not sure I would call myself articulate.<br />
<br />
Since somebody asked....<br />
<br />
1) Born on date<br />
Nov 18, 2000<br />
<br />
2) Days played<br />
266days with no Bazaar time ;) (have 5 accounts dont use Mac for bazaar)<br />
<br />
3) Current HPs/AAs<br />
7035hp unbuffed<br />
759aa<br />
<br />
4) Current guild and it's status (uber/family/in between)<br />
http://www.ciguild.com/<br />
in between would be the best way to describe CI we are an uber guild I guess but we are still family. There is many entire RL families in guild including my son.<br />
<br />
5) Their current raiding content, and how often they raid <br />
Raiding would be frequent. Qvic, Time, OoW<br />
Can read my raid attendance if you want ;)<br />
http://www.ciguild.com/raids/viewmember.php?name=Maccuul<br />
<br />
6) Why they started a shaman<br />
Heh well my first character was a Necro. He is still level 22.<br />
Frankly I got tired of dying and wanted to try out other characters.<br />
I died 22 times in one day on my Necro and made Mac after death 22.<br />
I have always been a fan of Celtic type things so had already picked out the race and since I wanted a char that had spells and could heal some Shaman was a very logical choice :)<br />
<br />
I am outspoken but likely not very well known by many though.<br />
Another thing is Gemdiver is from my server.<br />
Not sure how many folks you are going to want from Fennin (or he will especially due to the flack he got about the Mage stuffs) :)<br />
<br />
You can view some examples of my writting:<br />

http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19808<br />
<br />
A bit about my current views:<br />
I think Putrid Decay needs help I have outlined details on the stacking issues with the Necro Scent line, its tyops, and its other obvious quirks both on the Sony boards and in a PM to Grimbear.<br />
I am still of the opinion Shaman healing is not where it should be again expressed on the Sony boards and in a PM to Grimbear especially with wide spread mitigation and immunity.<br />
I do not think the price we continue to pay in higher cast times, higher mana costs and shorter durations for our better mana regen with the Can line is valid for us anymore since out mana regen has not even kept pace with other classes passive regen. I believe firmly that the entire Can line needs review to make both more levels of it and it to be less active at all levels.<br />
Lots of other small things like the last level of single and group cha being reversed and not the same effect, acumen and group acumen not overwritting each other but stacking, single and group Diaku not having the same effect, group haste not being 60%, usefulness of FA and RB...<br />
<br />
Other major/minor issues I could continue for hours really but that should give folks a rough idea ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
However since it looks like Gemdiver is really looking for just one person and I would rather Chutoi get it....<br />
<br />
I will just gladly volunteer my knowledge, opinions and time to anybody chosen to write the report if they wish it and not run myself.<br />
Yeah all that and I am not running go figure :p</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to be overly negative.  I salute gemdiver's enthusiasm (he is a true veteran is there ever was one), and I thank you for your efforts, Glori.  However, I find it incredibly hard to believe that anything useful will ultimately come from this exercise.<br />
<br />
As with virtually every class, Shaman issues have been beat to death on this board and others.  We have had a class liason in contact with SoE for some time now.  We had a summit meeting of various class representatives.  There have been countless hours spent on identifying specific issues and presenting solutions.<br />
<br />
To to the best of my knowledge, the most significant result of all this was a couple of VERY minor heal upgrades.  Hell, SoE can't even trouble themselves to be bothered with fixing our damn dog. <br />

i agree.  i use to use this site exclusivley for &quot;quick&quot; info on spells and such.  sure there is lucy, but Caster's Realm had its own nitch.  i haven't bother checking this site since PoP came out due to the poor conditions the spells lists have now slid into (4 expansions ago?)...<br />

well if they actually have people hitting the site, which i seriously doubt since the spell section has sucked for some time (with wrong, missing and incompleate information,)  then as Samanna has already stated, <br />

&quot;The point is to have an article that other classes can read to get an overview of our class, without wading through all the BS^H^H intelligent discussion here.&quot;  <br />

The only thing i would like to add to that statement is:<br />
If the artical is well put together, articulate, factual, represents the majority of the shaman community, and is understandable by virtualy everyone that has played EQ out of their n00ber faze (haveing the artical a tad bit persuasive wouldn't hurt either, hell the united states news organizations do it and most people dont' even relize it...), then &quot;(t)he point is to have an article that other classes can read to get an overview of our class, without wading through all the BS^H^H intelligent discussion (on any single class site).&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">If you still need another volunteer... /raise!<br />
<br />
1) Born on date: Middle of 2000, had a 54 Shammie on SolRo, then restarted on Bertoxx a little over a year later after some RL friends convinced me to do so with much talking and booze :)<br />
2) Days played: 380<br />
3) Current HPs/AAs: 6673 HPs, 669 AAs.<br />
4) Current guild and it's status (uber/family/in between): Order of the Scattered Winds (http://www.oswguild.com), more uber than family, but we try to keep the friendly atmosphere and have a lot of fun no matter what.  #3/4 on the server, depending who you ask hehe.<br />
5) Their current raiding content, and how often they raid: Qvic, Inktu, OoW (MPG trials, Epics, RS soon), Time a bit still.  Raid every night, maybe one exp night a week.<br />
6) Why they started a shaman: My friend recommended I start one and after reading a bit on them they seemed to have some good variety and I certainly fell in love with the class right away, especially after hitting 24 &lt;3.  My only real alt has been my monk I started maybe 2'ish years ago for some 2-box duo'ing action, but I don't duo with him a ton these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">1) Born on date - January something, 2002. Luclin was about a month old, I think. I can check in game.<br />
<br />
2) Days played - I'll check this out when I log in tomorrow, if I remember.<br />
<br />
3) Current HPs/AAs - see magelo in sig; my (remembered) high is 6900 even with buffs and my group leader abilities (I even took a screenshot).<br />
<br />
4) Current guild and it's status (uber/family/in between) The Gryphons (http://thegryphons.com) Family, for sure.<br />
<br />
5) Their current raiding content, and how often they raid - Scheduled raids on Tue and Thu; impromptu stuff at other dimes, targets/firepower permitting. Some targets we took out last month include Terris Thule and XTC. <br />
<br />
6) Why they started a shaman - The group of four RL (and one in-game) peeps that I played with decided to change servers from TP after some in-game stalking incident on one of us (/boggle). We all had mid-teens human toons, mostly Rangers and Druids. We branched out a little on TT, and I tried a Wizard (teens) and a Rogue (twenties), but didn't like them much. A buddy suggested that I try a Shaman, and that it would be a good addition since the others were playing Cleric, Warrior, Enchanter, Bard and Monk. I've loved it ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Guess I will throw my name into the hat:<br />
<br />
1) Born on date: October, 1999, originally a twink, became a Main in early Kunark.<br />
<br />
2) Days played: Over 200, very very little AFK.<br />
<br />
3) Current HPs/AAs: I buff out at 9K with all tribute, leadership, and OoW buffs. Unbuffed I am 6Kish with just my own tribute. I am at approx 320 AA, and could easily find a way to spend an additional 100. heh. <br />
<br />
4) Current guild and it's status: Raid oriented Family style guild, currently farming Time and Ikky (no Ikky 4 yet, OoW put the kiabosh on our advancement). My guild has no raid requirements, and a &quot;One No Vote&quot; recruitment policy. RL Family and good friends are generally &quot;legacy&quot; regardless of their play habits. We use a silent-bid DKP system for loot, with a few items &quot;limited&quot; to certain classes/requirements. <br />
<br />
5) Their current raiding content, and how often they raid: We try to have some form of raid nightly, but lately we have been focusing on getting Epics for members. We have 2 scheduled Time raids a week, and 2 otehr nights a week we try to focus on &quot;progression&quot; (Ikky, OoW, back-flag Gods, etc).<br />
<br />
6) Why they started a shaman: I originally started a Shaman because I was playing a Paladin main and wanted to try a Caster. I tried Mage, Necro and Wizard, and hated them. Shaman appealed to the &quot;battle priest&quot; in me. I loved getting up into the melee aspect of the fights. I had been farming good Shaman items on my main for guildies like Rubi BP, Manastone, etc, and finally tried Shaman and never looked back. It was the only real &quot;twink&quot; I played (other than 3 or 4 feeble attempts at cleric and warrior), and early in Kunark, I left the &quot;Uber&quot; guild I had help create and made the Shaman my main. I formed another guild, one more family oriented, and have tried to maintain that &quot;family&quot; feel ever since. In Omani I finally found the combination of high-end content + family orientation I was looking for. <br />
<br />
I think I have a firm grasp on the playing balance of our class because my schedule affords me the oppertunity to play the game many different ways. Being partially disabled, I have a lot of time during the &quot;off peak&quot; hours during the day after I get my kids on the bus and before they get home from school. I use those times to do the &quot;casual&quot; type stuff, grouping, farming pp/items, questing, tradeskilling (did Aid Grimel), trials, etc. Evenings, after I have cooked dinner for the family and helped the kids with their homework as needed, I like to raid. I actually avoid grouping in the evenings in general, due to the overpopulation of most of the better zones in todays EQ (I think one of SOEs biggest drawbacks to their approach is &quot;funneling&quot; people into specific areas en-masse, because those areas offer the BEST oppertunities for advancement, be it XP, spells, items, etc). <br />
<br />
Its my personal opinion that the Shaman class was HUGELY ignored from Luclin to Gates, and with the intrioduction of Gates we reached our true &quot;bottom&quot; as a class, having very little to offer groups or raids as a package. I feel very strongly that OoW has reversed this to such a degree that the Shaman class is once again a powerhouse in the game. I have no desire to be a &quot;Main Healer&quot; in most situations, but I want my healing to be adequate to &quot;jump in and make it happen&quot; when the shizz hits the fan. I personally think we are there. While I agree that we have a few issues that require attention and modification, I feel we are basically in the same &quot;boat&quot; as many other classes in EQ. Everyone has an issue, and since OoW's release, my personal issues with the game have all but disappeared. I feel VERY strongly that we were FINALLY given some of the utility we had lost as we watched expansion after expansion pass us by. <br />
<br />
I am known here as a person who will fight for what I believe in, and I think my record has shown I am not one to back down from an arguement if I think I am right. On the flip side of that, I also think I am the type of person to readily admit when I make a mistake, and give props where props are due. I tend to avoid wishy-washy issues, instead focusing on thing that matter most to me. Character Injustice is one of my personal pet-peeves (note: see my threads on Racial Penalties, example) and I tend to side with the underdog in many situations. I am primarly a &quot;raid style&quot; player, but I have NOTICEABLY defended the non-raiders point of view in many instances. However, I am FIRMLY against making EQ any eaiser than it already is, especially from a loot standpoint. Regardless of the overall attitude the non-raider tends to display toward raiders, I worked my ASS off for my gear. All I  can say to anyone who disagrees is &quot;Bring it&quot;. <br />
<br />
My personal idea for this whole &quot;State of the Class&quot; thing is to do a conglomoration (sp?). Have a lot of people write up a couple sentances, issues that matter to them personally. Get a lot of different ideas into the pot, and pick a couple people to &quot;bring it all together&quot; in essay form. Shaman is probably THE single most diverse class in this game. We have many many abilities and utilities, which create many many varying playstyles. There are Shamans who want to be healer, Shamans who want to be DPSers, Shamans who want to be a Pet class, Shamans who like buffs, Shamans who hate them. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, if I had to pick one thing I like being about a Shaman its for those times when the shizz hits that fan, and after 5 minutes of total chaos and frenzy, and the smoke finally clears, I am usually standing there, 80% mana, surrounded by a pile of corpses that I have slowed, DOTed, bounced, parked, beat down, nuked, standing there with at least 1 or 2 group members that I have saved with quick heals, HoTs, etc. I think that is why I consider OoW the best expansion EVER for Shamans, since Kunark gave us Turgurs and Torpor. Because OoWs spells and AA have given me the ability to be even MORE of &quot;The Troll&quot; than ever before. Now I can Call the cleric back, and use Channeling and end up FULL mana, and instantly restore my group to its previous power level with my buffs. <br />
<br />
There is not many better feelings in this game than saying:<br />
<br />
Blazz tells the group: &quot;All dead, Call of Wild on the cleric, Wunshi, Fort, Regen and Haste ready after rezzes&quot;. <br />
<br />
Thats where I think we stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It might be good to take the top (or randomly selected) 3-5 nominated representatives and have them post up their submission and let people vote on which one they think best reflects the state of the class.  Whichever submission wins a majority (or plurality) will be sent the Castersrealm.  The vote is simply a vote; no discussion or editing (other than spelling and grammar).  Why limit yourself to one person and one opinion?  This would also reduce the inevitable disagreements that will arise from a single representative's summary.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Born on date: Dec. 15, 1999.<br />
<br />
Days played: Somewhere around 215, very little AFK time, though Tordail has been used as a bazaar trader recently to help clean out the bank.<br />
<br />
Current HPs/AAs: Exactly 4900 HP unbuffed, nearly 6k mana unbuffed. Tordail has 265 total AA.<br />
<br />
Current guild and it's status: Souls of the Arcane (http://www.soulsofthearcane.net), Karana server. I have been an officer there since August 2003 and serve as Shaman class leader and a raid leader. SOTA is a family guild.<br />
<br />
Their current raiding content, and how often they raid: SOTA is a family guild that raids 3-4 times per week on a non-mandatory basis. We use a loot council for our loot distribution. Most of our raids lately have been epic 1.5 raids, though we have been pursuing various POP targets.<br />
<br />
Why they started a shaman: I started a shaman to complement my twin brother's warrior. We left Karana and started alts on another server to be with some RL friends ... that's where the Ranger came in. By the time I had the ranger to 50, I was certain he didn't suit me as well as the Shaman did (who was retired at 35) so I moved back to Karana when my friends left the game and made him my main. By the time I had Tordail to 40 it was clear the shaman was for me ... I loved melee, I loved soloing, I loved all the utility at my fingertips, I loved being the glue holding groups together. Tordail was brought out of a three-month retirement again (RL can suck) at 53 and I haven't left him alone since ... Heh, I'm addicted to playing him. He joined SOTA at 53 and has been a proud member there ever since. I've earned him his elemental flags, earned him a flag to Kod'Taz, taken him to levels I never dreamed possible back in Everfrost trying to keep my brother from dying to gnolls. To think there is still room for improvement is amazing to me ... amazing and exciting. I was one of the first four people in my guild to zone into KodTaz after going through the sewer trials, and until last night we were the only four flagged for the zone. I was among the first 20 people to zone into an elemental plane.<br />
<br />
Even now, when I can take Tordail to Riftseeker's or Yxtta, I am the glue of the group. I make everyone else shine while I stand in the background gnawing my arm. I can't tell you the number of times my monk friend has tried to put together groups and been told to get &quot;that one shaman&quot; over others -- in both GOD and OOW. I put 110% into everything I do, and the people who've grouped and raided with me know it and like my &quot;bring it on&quot; attitude. To do anything less is an insult to Tordail and my guild. To play a shaman is to be flexible. The class is one that has FINALLY gotten back on its own two feet with the release of OOW. I'm not as much of a pessimist about the shaman's place in GOD as some folks are, but it is very clear that OOW has allowed us to shine again. <br />
<br />
The state of the Shaman class? Strong again, and getting better.<br />

I think you're missing the point.  Gemdiver elected to do this to help players gain insight about classes other than their own.  If SOE somehow takes this information and uses it to make each class better, then I would certainly welcome that.  This isn't some SOE venture to secretly obtain each class's opinion about itself.  They already have an avenue of discourse to each class through its chosen representative that communicates over the EQLive site message boards.</div></div><hr />

The most prominent is that my view is not the one of the average Shaman. <br />
More often than not I am finding myself disagreeing with 90% of the posters(not saying I am always right, even though I obviously like to think that) who express their point of view and the ones I agree with are probably long gone or not as vocal.<br />

<br />
I run counter to the majority opinion often, but that doesn't mean my opinion is less valid than anyone else's.  I've played my shaman from level 1 to 70 plus almost 800 AA.  I've been in every position along the way from beginner to advanced, so I've stood in many pairs of shoes in the past 2.5 years.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see multiple write-ups and have the board members choose the one they like best.  Shamans who have played longer and experienced all levels of play in group, solo and raid are most qualified to give a fair summary of the class.  That's not to say lifetime soloers or non-raiders can't give a good assessment, but those who have done more in the game should have a broader collection of experiences to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I am more than willing to state my point of view.

<br />
I have really experienced everything in this game in the last 6 years. Soloing, grouping, raiding and everything I have done with my very first toon which happened to be the Shaman I still play every day. I play to push my limits, nothing else.<br />
<br />
I try to avoid talking about stats, guilds etc.(my own mostly) as people usually only use them to make other people feel inferior or to toot their own horn(there are a couple of exceptions posting here on the Crucible, however), but I won't deny that I have a lot of experience regarding Shamans and this game and therefor I feel like I have got a good view of things. <br />

<br />
As difficult as it may be to picture here on our bastion of shaman interest and self-interest, I believe the point is to let other players considerating starting a shaman evaluate the class - the good points as well as the problems.<br />
<br />
I don't think the point is to present yet another shaman bitch - there are plenty of those already.  SOE knows our issues and is addressing them as they choose to.  The fact that they choose to do nothing is not germaine to the request from Caster's Realm.</div></div><hr />

I most certaily respect your opinion Giac. You have changed my opinion on a number of issues over the past year. I will agree that your personal point of view may not represent the MAJORITY of Shaman in this game, but I think you and a couple others set the bar that many of us &quot;aim&quot; toward. My guild is not as advanced as yours, and although I have been offered membership to &quot;higher&quot; progressed guilds, I stay where I am because I like the people I am guilded with. However, I definitely have a vested interest in the status of the &quot;12K/10K&quot; shamans state-of-affairs. Speaking for myself, I will probably never be on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of the game (did VT during the first year of PoP, didnt kill Quarm til after OoW was released, still have not seen Uqua or Qvic, much less even more advanced Gates zones) but ultimately, my goal is to play this game in its entirety. <br />
<br />
As far as the whole Casters Realm thing goes, I think its important to get our own, personal view of our classes state of affairs into a more public forum so that people can possibly gain some insight to our class. Not a lot of non-shaman come here, and SOEs message boards are kind of a joke. Maybe putting some information regarding our strengths, weaknesses, power, and shortcomings will help other players get a more informed opinion about us. I know there is a TON of misinformation and misjudgement out there about the Shaman class in general. Its definitely one of the most complicated classes in the game overall. Putting something like this on a highly visible, but very general, non-specific site might dispell some of those illusions.  <br />
If it was something SoE asked for, I'd still do it, but since it's just going to be read by Shamans, who do not play the same game I do, I feel there are other, better suited, people for this.<br />
I dont think this will just be read by shamans, myself. Even if it is, at least it will find its way into the minds of those people who havent managed to discover the wonders of The Crucible yet. Remember one thing, for every person who regularly reads boards like this, there are probably 2 or 3 who dont. The more exposure we can get, the higher potential there is to make a difference. Have to agree, more than one PoV should be represented.  I'd say have Blazz and Chotoi both post, represent the polarized view points present in the community.<br />
Chu and I agree more than we disagree on most things. It is only recently that we have begun to have divergant opinions on a few topics, and honestly, a lot of that could be attributed to the same thing that Giaxc is talking about. Chu is pretty &quot;super high end&quot;, much like Giac, while I am more &quot;Upper middle class&quot;.</div></div><hr />

While this point is SEMI valid, I disagree that what Gem is doing is a mistake, and I also disagree that we would be &quot;doing SOEs work&quot;. Every successful game has a STRONG player-community that adds a ton of input to the game overall. Look back at some of the blockbusters. Where would Doom and Quake have been without the players? What would Half-Life do without their insane community support? Tribes, Starcraft, even farther back to games like Civilization, etc, the list of games that have been made better by player input is endless. Doing the work? I am trying to make the game better for purely selfish reasons, I LIKE TO PLAY IT. If any changes I help initiate, or any ideas I might have get implemented help SOE or other players is completely parallel to my ultimate goal, which is making the game better for ME.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6)  Why a Shaman?  My first character was a Monk, and after the AC nerf, I found that I could not handle a lot of encounters that I could previously solo.  Since I soloed a lot back then ( I was pretty new to EQ ), I wanted a class that had a lot of versatility, can work well in either a group or solo setting, and was fun to play.  <br />
<br />
As I looked at all the classes, the last two on my list were: Nerco and Shaman.  In the end, I chose Shaman.  I felt it captured the essence of who I am better than a Necro.  Next was race, and I could not see myself playing an &quot;evil&quot; race. While I do not RP as much as I would have liked, Korelen was born on the frosty slopes of Everfrost.  In my search to understand the class better, I stumbled across www.eqshaman.com, and from there, I landed to the Crucible.<br />
<br />
I quickly became an AC junkie for I preferred to tank my mobs.  All my friends laughed that I had huge AC for my level, but when they saw me in action, tanking mobs, they quickly hushed.  :D  I pretty much solo'ed my way to 60 with sprinkles of groups here and there.<br />
<br />
Things changed when PoP was released.  I saw myself grouping more, and I found myself taking the position of HP rather than AC because of Canni V.  Also, it was difficult, at the time, for me to solo tank PoP content.  I was pretty much stuck grouping.  I ended up making a lot of new friends and utimately lead me to a guild I will always remember.</div></div><hr />
