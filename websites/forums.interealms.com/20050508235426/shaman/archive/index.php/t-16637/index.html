<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chubbleton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I quit my 56 rogue, sold his gear, and bought some somewhat decent gear for a shaman; mainly an iksar regeneration breastplate and a 12/19 spear for low lvls melee damage. I created an iksar shaman and leveled to 25 without much knowledge of how iksars cant wear plate (JBB) and their massive xp penalty. So now I am rethinking rerolling my shaman... although I dont know which race to choose! <br />
<br />
I plan on getting to 65 as fast as i possibly can. So I am wondering, during the &quot;endgame&quot;, is the iksars AC and regen outweighed by ogre's non frontal stun? Should I go frog or barbie for no xp penalty? I dont really care about starting stats at all. I have alot more to say, but I think you guys will understand what I mean.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I currently have a lvl 50 ikky shaman and i can tell you the xp penalty is already a drag let alone how bad it will be post 50.<br />
<br />
The regain bonus is nice, but since i have got Stoicism at 44, it has been less of an advantage.  Added to this that if i am fighting outdoors (and therefore on my lizzy mount) i only get standing hp regen and its not much of an advantage at all.<br />
<br />
I dont miss having the JBB because i have never had one, but I do believe the XP penalty is too much considering what bonuses Iksars get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you intend to power yourself to 65 then stay with Ikky. Because when you do AAs you dont incur exp penalty and 20% penalty isnt that bad..<br />
but ac bonus and regen will stay with you forever.. at 65 you get double the regen of other classes save for Trols who got Regen also but they have similar exp penalty.. Ogres have 15% penalty.. only Barbarians/frogs have almost no penalty but have no class defining ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you get to the 60+ levels I doubt the jbb will be of much use.  Sure it will be useful before then, but it is no means a tool required to survive the 50's, it just helps.<br />
<br />
Also, wouldn't you get sitting hp regen on a mount being that you get sitting mana regen?<br />
<br />
As for the experience penalty, I wouldn't worry about it too much, experience is so much easier to get these days and aa's don't even have the penalty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 65 JBB isn't a bonus it's a bank slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Use my JBB at 65 probably once a week now. I'm an ogre and would highly recommend them to anyone, frontal stun immunity and high natural sta is very nice. From 45 to even 60ish the JBB is quite nice though, especially with a horse you can click the JBB and med at the same time.<br />
<br />
I also have a 50 barbarian shaman which I remade as the Ogre, haven't regretted it and never will - well worth the extra time investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Svarten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There is only one real shaman choice!<br />
<br />
Froglok, color armor purple and skip the epic, and you wont get asked for buffs (that you have), I get asked for resses constantly though so guess it isn't that much of a boon...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, there realy isn't any big differance to what race you chose, when you reach 65 you will not regret the choice you did whatever it might be.<br />
<br />
When it comes to JBB, don't bother remaking for this item, I have never found the need for this item, I perfere to use DOTs and cannibilize instead of constant clicking JBB, not only do I regen mana faster, I do more damage aswell.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

You will get a lot of in your face multiple pulls = Fun Fun FUN<br />

When the crap hits the fan, and you have 2 mobs in your face pounding on you, and your not stunned, but casting root...<br />
<br />
Trust me, you'll never regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At one time I thought the whole Ogre unstunability was overrated but not anymore. All 3 of my deaths in PoTa soloing Diaku have been from being stunned while trying to root and not just once but up to 3 times in a row. Partially mitigated mobs make the stun issue a valid one.<br />
<br />
Of course there's no way I'm starting over. I'm very happy with my barby but there is that 1-2 days a week where I get my assed stunned repeatedly and wish I was an Ogre :)</div></div><hr />

god damn i am tired of seeing this why dont u people who are tired of hearing the same question just not read the damn thread and not post at all?? i dunno maybe u just do it to up ur post count but damn that is annoying. <br />
<br />
<br />
as for the race im a 60 about to ding 61 iksar shaman and i wouldnt change at all. the exp penalty is nuthing. but when i was soloing up to 58 it did annoy the hell out of me but once i started grouping in tier 2 the penalty is like non existant(sp?) jbb is great for lower lvls though granted but as u get higher lvl it is just a waste of money. i even rerolled a barb shaman to be an iksar and as for ogres stun imunity i never have a prob being stunned even in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chubbleton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I decided to stick with the Iksar. Got to lvl 27 tonight, still going strong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a JBB, used to use it a fair bit, but can't recall the last time I dug it from my bags. If you aim to level fast JBB really won't make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">JBB is a very very solid XP tool from 45 to 60. There is no question about this. Once you get 50ish and get Epic, you can practically kill any mob with very little mana. <br />
<br />
Personally, if 65 and Plane of Time is your unltimate goal, then re-roll a class with no XP penalty. The 50s were brutal to me as a troll. Go for Barb, so you have slam, and get a JBB for those sucky 50's. Especially if you are going to be leveling mostly solo or in LDoN. <br />
<br />
If you are being PLed by lvl 65's, then anything you choose is fine. JBB becomes a non-issue as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 2 races that can play shaman have no exp penalty.  Frogs and Vah shir.  Barbs have a 5% exp hit.  Its good to see that you decided to keep the Iksar.  Post Kunark armors dont differentiate between races, so the only problem you run into is going to be Hate armor and Jaundiced Bone items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dunno, I have an Ogre, and I'm happy with it, but I think the bonuses of a Troll or Iksar really are tangible enough to make it a completely legitimate choice.<br />
<br />
If you're 27 now, and you're good with it, stay with it.  JBB is a handy tool in leveling 45-60ish but not manditory, especially if you're going to group most of the way, which is probably more efficient now anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh, I rerolled a L53 iksar shaman to start over as a troll just so I could get the snare necklace and use JBB + kunark plate armor.  Now I'm a L65 troll and the JBB is bagged and I haven't used clicky snare in ages because I duo w/ a L65 sk.  Bleh.  <br />
<br />
In hindsight I should have just stuck w/ the iksar (tails &gt; all), but even at L65 I love having the high stamina and regen of the troll, so I guess it's still not a bad decision.  I also had gotten through the sixth cudgel on the iksar before rerolling, something I won't even bother w/ on the troll because I hate timesinks (e.g. factioning, tradeskills, etc...) so freaking much.  Whee....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Both Iksars and Ogres make bad ass shamans. But honestly, if youre going to power to 65 it doesnt really matter what race you pick; Just play whatever one you like best for the looks.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry about JBB; at 65 there is a little use for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sure, you could reroll your shaman but you would get only a worthless softskin or even worse food (sometimes it can be more fun to lick the frogs and not to eat them). Any other race would miss the sexy tail and the wonderfull tail. Ask any broodling and they will tell you that a REAL shaman needs scales and a tail. Nod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not worth rerolling - sure you cant wear JBB, but it's a hell of alot easier for you to do the cudgel quests which result in one of the nicest range items I've seen (good weapon also)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">click search you idiot.<br />
<br />
Only idiot I see is you.  Why do people like you keep hope that nobody will ever post a thread that has been posted before?  If you're that bitter make a shaman website without a message board on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Are you going to be mostly solo'ing your way to 65 or grouping? If you're grouping, I think there is a huge advantage for the races with no exp penalty. Whether you have frontal stun immunity, or higher AC, or even regeneration, is going to have very little effect on how fast your GROUP earns exp - which will determine how fast you gain exp. Your regeneration or stun immunity - or JBB for that matter - won't give your group the ability to kill 20% more mobs and earn you 20% more exp. You will take longer to make L 65 due to your exp penalty. <br />
<br />
Now, solo'ing, that's a different question. Will your racial advantages make up for the 20% experience penalty? As an iksar, I'd say the answer is definitely no. Or, at least, you'll level slower than the troll. A JBB at L 45 is HUGE. It remains huge at least to the mid 50's. My shaman is 58 now, and it's definitely not what it was any more. Still useful, but not godlike any more. I do far more DOT damage than I do nuke damage now, when solo'ing.  But from 45-52, solo'ing with most of the damage coming from the JBB was the fastest thing possible. So an iksar has no real advantage over the troll. JBB &gt;&gt; some extra AC for your overall leveling. <br />
<br />
But that still doesn't answer the question - is the extra regeneration a troll gets worth the 20% exp penalty over a frog or a vah'shir? I discount the ogre entirely, as frontal stun immunity will NOT get you exp 15% faster. I'm not sure if the regeneration is worth the penalty when solo'ing or not. But I'm sure it's not if you're going to group a lot. <br />
<br />
Now, having said all that: that's what you want to consider if your goal is to get to 65 as fast as possible. That's an entirely DIFFERENT question from &quot;what race makes the best shaman?&quot; The races are balanced enough, especially considering the exp penalties, that a different race is best for different circumstances. <br />
<br />
Do you want the most powerful shaman when you're L 65 and uber, no matter how long it takes? I'd say ogre, for the stun immunity. Do you want the shaman who'll be L 65 first? I'd say Vah'shir or frog, due to no exp penalty. Do you want the shaman who'll have the most mana regen and least downtime? Then do Iksar or troll. If you're a twink and know you'll have a JBB young, go troll. If you're going to have to earn your JBB by L 45 to have one at L 45, then go iksar, as you won't have one ANYWAY, unless you spend several levels worth of exp time farming plat to buy one. And in that case you could be L 49 in the same playtime you would need to get 45 and the JBB, and be at least as far ahead in the game.  <br />
<br />
But you've already decided to keep the iksar, so go for it. The real key is to pick the race you like the most, so you won't regret it later on, when you're looking at that ugly assed troll you picked cause he was &quot;best&quot;. No offense to those who love their trolls. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Glad at least one person mentioned Kitties. They are the only no exp penalty race that actually has good racial skills. &lt;3 Sneak, Safefall is nice, and they have good vision. The only draw back to kitties is that you need the special level limited fungi. <br />
<br />
If you're happy with the iksar though thats great. Most of my alts are iksars just because I like the race. I personally don't think the regen means anything with our HoT's, definately not worth 20% exp, but they are definately fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think you need to delete the iksar and start a froglok shaman. Just make sure you put all your points into charisma and dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Delete the iksar, roll an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Im a 65 iksar shaman and i never regreted it. I wouldn't reroll if i were you. Iksar regen helps a lot at low levels and you already have good faction if you want to do hammer quest. Plus iksar are by far the kewlest looking shaman (others dont deny it!). Also the extra AC is really nice. But if you really want to reroll, do it. Imo whatever one looks the best is the one for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">JBB never had one never missed it, has for XP you want to lv fast go back to a rog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">JBB mind-blowingly amazing from 45-55<br />
<br />
JBB very useful 55-59<br />
<br />
JBB somewhat useful 60-64<br />
<br />
JBB irrelevant at 65<br />
<br />
Pretty much from 60-64 I just used it on fleeing mobs when soloing and to add a bit of damage when grouping.  At 65 my mana regen is good enough that I can use a bigger nuke and cann back the mana more efficiently than using JBB.</div></div><hr />
