<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was on Allakhazam's and saw Plane of Mischief armor for shamans!<br />
<br />
Shamanistic Shenannigan armor!<br />
<br />
Not only is this the best named Shaman armor in the game it also has some of the best stats and AC I have seen.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what drops this armor in PoM and approximately how many people would be needed to take down the MOB(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be more worried about GETTING to PoM. It is located on the far side of NTOV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whoa thats one long, hard quest.  You'd have to have a LOT of time on yoyur hands to do a quest like that hehe.  Oh well it was a good dream while it lasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, PoM is due for an update soon. Doubt it will make getting any of the phat loot out of there any easier (or even if the loot will still be the same), but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have the BP, workin on the boots. The quests to get that armor is rediculous. Thrones (one of the cards required) are the rarest of them all, and most of the good combos require 2 of them of a specific color. <br />
<br />
Personally i think you would be better off getting other armor. On my server, to buy the cards needed for a pom bp would prolly be close to 150-200k and thats IF you could find the cards for sale.<br />
<br />
Edit: i should note that i had the cards for the BP before their drop rate was nerfed into oblivion. I have been up there prolly 5 months since, and seen 1 throne drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So long as they move the entrance..it's good..I been wanting ot exp there for ages, but its too hard to get to:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">compared to pop, pom exp isnt that great anymore.</div></div><hr />
