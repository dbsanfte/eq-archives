<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay so I need to spend six more points in class to become an elder.  Though it actually makes no difference, I just don't care for venerable and am eager to be an elder.  So my class options that remain are: I could spend 3 on quickbuff 1 then six on quickbuff 2(leaving me 9 points from elder instead of six).  I'm not going to do alchemy mastery, so my other two  options are /pet hold (it takes the six points I need) or mass group buff(also takes 9)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I&quot;m leaning toward getting mgb next, just mostly for the fun of buffing tons of strangers at once.  But I'm wondering what the range is on it. (aren't you sorry you read all this?)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MGB suxorz unless you are heavy into raiding.  I have it and I haven't got nearly the satisfaction of having it that I feel I deserve for having spent NINE points on it.  <br />
Then again, I want the duration on Rabid Bear increased before I will spend points there either.  Right now I'm working on Spell Casting Mastery for reduced fizzles and mana costs on spells.  Seemed like a good general skill to have, something quite useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The range is pretty large. I can't really quantify it but it is larger than I had thought it would be. I personally have felt MGB is a great way to have spent the points I did on it, mainly because I am in a raid guild hehe. So far my two major uses for it are MGB focus and MGB talisman of epuration. Anyhow hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bump. i wanna know too.<br />
<br />
while it's great that this has turned into a discussion about if MGB is worth it or not, the original question deserves to be answered.<br />
<br />
what's the range on MGB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">range is FAR, I've had cleric run down a hallway to avoid it and still got em. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not quite sure, since i obviously havent tested it, but i think that its dependant on the spell. (info from eqcaster)<br />

And Mass group buff rocks, even if you only raid a little bit - nothing really beats buffing 40 people with 1 spell, or the whole EC tunnel for that matter - though, there probably is some more interesting AAs out there to get first :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the replies everyone.  Although I almost never raid, I think I&quot;m gonna go for mgb next just for satisfaction of buffing huge groups of unsuspecting strangers.  After all, in the end helping strangers is the most fun thing in all of eq.  This is why I love the Shaman class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I cant justify spending 9 points on massive either, and I do raid alot. I'd like the 3rd title but it just seems to me that the archtype choices are better so I keep dumping points into those. I used to want to max quick buff but now that isnt as big of a priority with focus items.<br />
<br />
Maybe planes of power will have more and better alt abilities to choose from. Anyone heard anything concrete yet on whether or not they are going with higher level cap or AA or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone ever been in Velks ledge camp and cast off a MGB FoS?   Probably get a lot of cheering from people under you.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always thought that MGB had a range of twice the normal area of effect range of the spell.  IE for the example of Khura's Focussing given above, the normal spell's area is 100 feet, so the MGB version would be 200 feet.<br />
<br />
Can't remember where I heard this though, so it may be total nonsense :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wish....<br />
<br />
MGB recast time was faster.  FoS an entire TOV raid all at once.  Uba. o_0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not gaining a lot of wisdom from my post as I have no figures for you. I do know just from experience when i cast MGB I seem to always catch all the raiders, and I'm not always careful to be in the middle of the hord, yes even the fleeing clerics. =) I never seem to get tells saying i was here and missed it, only receive tells from those poky late comers...grrr =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've always wondered about the area of MGB... whether the area was elliptical or a sphere.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, sometimes it nice to help the server community with this nice buff.  I know when I'm in a regular experience group, I'll shout AE focus in necro/zone in (seb).  And watch the entire zone run and screaming &quot;wait for me&quot;... lol</div></div><hr />
