<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fighting in Storms at the dillo camp.  Paladin decides to use the blind spell for aggro right before the mob gets near him.  My slow had just landed, making me Prime.  Mob takes off towards the cliffs across from where dillo groups normally camp.<br />
<br />
If you've ever hunted in Storms, you may have noticed that mobs tend to slowly disappear over time.  The wandering mobs become more and more sparse.  There's a pathing bug that locks them up, and we found them.<br />
<br />
The pally chases the dillo.  The dillo makes it to the cliffs, disappears, and every mob in the zone it seems comes flooding out of the cliff.  I have never seen so many mobs onscreen at once.  It looked like a raid and we were the targets.  Pally went down instantly - he didn't understand what we were talking about because he only saw one or two mobs.  The rest started heading over to see me.  I wish I could have gotten a screenshot.  Luckily, the group saw it coming and everyone got out.<br />
<br />
Anyone else ever get to experience this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not in POS, but I created a mega train in Chardok one time.<br />
<br />
Before the revamp, I was in a group fighting at the old Korucust camp. We got a bad pull and we decided to make a run for it. I took off for the zone via the tunnel where that monk epic guy spawns. I made it out (go go run speed 3) but the resulting train pathed back through the castle, wiping out an AE group.<br />
<br />
Most...embarassing...Everquest...moment...ever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got a cleric in my guild who can beat that gloriana. This was right after SoL came out and decided to play with her new turn undead aa. Went down to the basement and cast it. Needless to say the mother of all trains was created. I beleive she spent something like an hour ressing the entire zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Blind and fear are the perfect train spells. I once trained myself and some friends with Tormax's guards, 6 giants around him (Kykenka, Yetarr and 4 sentinels) and the entire Dlammaz cubby ... it was a quick but very painful death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Speaking of Fear/Train spells. <br />
These are also great powerlvling technics if used correctly.<br />
I was lvling my warrior up, along with various other friends that had chars around the same lvl.<br />
We decided that we would head to Lower Guk and hange out there for a while.<br />
Granted we were all lvl 20's or so. But we all had about 2 or 3k in Hps, this is before the groupbuff nerf/fix.<br />
Anyway, after a while I got tired of pulling mobs so I have th echanter mez a mob until we cleared out his friends and then we instruct the chanter to fear the mob. Needless to say I didn't need to pull any more. We also foudn new and interesting ways of pulling with AE spells, while in the Tower there as well...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is second hand, but apparently in U Guk a Cleric cast an &quot;earthquake&quot; ? Spell. The resulting line of frogs all croaking FROOAK! was quite the sight to behold.<br />
<br />
I have had a couple in Hate where after feigning I stood up only to see ALL the Clerics of Inny + every roamer AND Maestro. Even the other raiders were like &quot;Holy {feces}!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol, old hate trains.  We still tease one of our monks... whenever he pulls a big train, anywhere... we ask &quot;hey was Maestro in that??&quot;<br />
<br />
Those were spectacular.<br />
<br />
The best train I ever saw was pre-revamp greigs.  My guildleader had our key up to greig and got decessed to front of zone to help one last person join our raid.  The person catching up was a rogue who had SOS, so np.<br />
<br />
The plan would be the guildleader, a bard, would just train to the click up, then fade off agro and click up with the rogue.<br />
<br />
Something went wrong, or he should have faded more than once, apparently, because 50 mobs followed him up the room where the other 12 of us where at.  I've never seen anything like it heh, it was the king of all trains.   Coffin CR included.<br />
<br />
On the subject though, pathing sucks.  Once I killed everyone in Bastion of Thunder when I slowed a mob in South wing on inc and it turned around and pathed around the whole loop.   This was early early in POP, like January or something, long before BOT was open to the public, so fortunately there was only like 18 people... but I killed everyone except me.  I ran away!  :D<br />
<br />
Whoops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>iamashaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well i was just a littlle shammy about a year ago maybe lvl 10 or so and i had jsut gotten my frost rift spell, thought i was soo ubah:p anyways i found a 60shaman that was PLing his twink 14 war(had swiftblade of zeks which was a huge twink item a year or so ago) anyways he told me to nuke the thron room or whatever it is that u can see from the top looking down at the water so i did what he said and saw the little gnoll run away. after a min or 2 or waiting i was getting a little antsy so i decided to go check it out i run through the door to get to the second floor and BAM theres well over 50gnols running straight at me luckily i had some higher lvl cleric buff and HoS or id have died 100times over. so i ran back to camp with the shammy and his war so i could get a heal... this made them all jump on the other shaman and let me and the war pick off a few gnolls at a time. nedless to say i lvled twice during this single pull =p although i was never able to recreate the train:/<br />
<br />
just my 2cp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Storms pathing sucks.  <br />
<br />
All the pathers like to get stuck on the top of the buttes, and won't come down unless you try to pull something, and have it path over/thru one.  <br />
<br />
The last month or so, they've changed pathing of some mobs, so they'll go off on tangents from what SHOULD be the logical, shortest path to you. <br />
<br />
Almost as frustrating as trying to get the last diaku emblem to drop.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So, I was leading a royals raid in Chardok.<br />
<br />
And they'd just fixed the lull line of spells so I was having a bard pull.<br />
<br />
And I'm used to having the puller in the MT group.  So the bard was in with me.<br />
<br />
We move through Chardok with no real issues, we get to the library.  I'm getting ready for my &quot;you all need levitate here, do not walk over near the door without levitate or you fall in the pit and die&quot; speech.<br />
<br />
My DMF had apparently been dispelled at some point.<br />
<br />
I fell in the pit.<br />
<br />
Bard song pulsed.  At least, I think that's what happened.<br />
<br />
I didn't make it very far, so I didn't get to see the end result, but it was apparently King + Queen + every other sarnak they could find, all at once.<br />
<br />
I killed everyone - even the feigners, Escapers, and Fading Memory types.  One of my proudest moments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a friend that used to specializr in geting me killed with trains.  I remember once in CC when we were both in our early 30's.  We were walking toward the pit and killing what we saw.  Friend mezzed one (did I mention that he was an enchanter?) that we forgot about before we invised up and leved down the pit.  At the bottom we were killing the 5 spawns there when all of a sudden about 80 orcs erupt from one of the side passages.  The mezzed one had woken up and ran to the bottom of the pit where we were and agroed every orc along the way.  I laughed myself to death..litterally.<br />
<br />
Then of course there was the Fear trains that wiped my guild for about 2 hours before we finally got them under control.  I lost 2 levels that night.  I dont like to talk about it, but just thought that I would mention Fear trains to anyone that might remember those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Much lower level, but quite nearly as fun and as funny.<br />
<br />
Helping a friend level an alt in PC.  We run up to shroom named and take a quick AFK.  The mobs we've cleared repop while we're away (he's invis, I'm too high to KoS), so when we get back he says he has to go.  No sweat, I tell him, just run out and I'll follow.<br />
<br />
Invis drops almost as soon as he gets started and he aggros shiknars.  He stops and we kill the 3, then he laughs and wonders aloud how many we can train.<br />
<br />
So...it's a challenge.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, we had almost every mob in PC not near the bandit camps by the time it was done.  It started at the named shroom and ended at the Shadeweaver zone border.  I think we had absolutely every Shiknar, phlarg, digger/tunneler/delver, and shroom in the entire zone on him by the time it ended (he was a bard, using DoT song).  He made sure to every last mob he could, and his SoW meant he sometimes had the ability to outrun mobs, keeping him from getting mass attacked when a recently aggrod mob stunned him as he went by.<br />
<br />
After he zoned out, I waited outside the small lake chamber near Shadeweaver zone border and started counting...or at least I tried.  There were just too many.<br />
<br />
By my estimation, I think he had well over a hundred mobs on him when he zoned out.<br />
<br />
The record train i've seen that wasn't intentional was in Dulak.  67 mobs, instigated off the hard boat and picking up virtually every mob between it and the Gunthak zone border.  It took the mobs nearly 7 minutes to file by the pirate shacks after the locomotive of that particular train managed to zone...or what was left of them.  Someone actually counted them as they walked back.  ;)<br />
<br />
The worst training incident I've seen was in BoT, when some ^#$%$&amp; monk intentionally trained everything from Deep Earth (Upper Earth, whichever it's called on your server) all the way down into the safe room.  It included 4 nameds.  The people in the safe room who survived the initial onslaught ran for the zone out but were killed just steps from the stone, and that put a large number of mobs in the zone in with nobody on the other side to warn them.<br />
<br />
Usually this isn't much of an issue, but for some reason a large number of people were zoning in at that time, and they were getting annihilated the instant they appeared.  Nobody was even surviving long enough to zone back out.<br />
<br />
By the time I got invis up and managed to zone out and stop people from zoning in, the train had managed to kill about 15 people zoning in.<br />
<br />
Afterward, the monk was bragging about in say to a friend of his who had been invis in the safe room...who happened to have been killed and was getting rezzed by a cleric with a clicker.  Monkboy pulled Thangbrand too...who sees invis.  Woops.<br />
<br />
Bragging in front of about 10 people his train had killed, including members of his own guild.  Woops again.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm complaining.  Wolfie went for monk's friend first, giving me time to get my butt out of the safe room before the invis I had JUST cast on myself drew wolfie's attention.  He went after someone else first though, and since I was invis, I ran up the stairs instead of running to zone to track the nameds as they walked back to their places.  When they didn't come up, I went back down to see them in zone-in room killing people zoning in.  My invis dropped on me (I have rotten luck with invis), so I re-invised and ran to zone-out to keep people from zoning in.<br />
<br />
The offending monk was kicked out of his guild for that stunt, and I haven't seen him since.  Word from his ex-guild is that he transferred his character to a different server, as he'd been blacklisted on ours.<br />
<br />
Woops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was helping doing black dire in mistmoore for a friend, and black dire isnt up, so i figured i would go into castle and whack them trigger mob.<br />
<br />
I most likely took half castle with me out. The mobs were not very hard hitting, but even a score of puppies can nibble a bear like myself to death. We actually survived the mayhem and she got her furryboots. Not thanks to me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think you're ever going to top that crazy-ass bard that was kiting every single non-summoning mob in HoH all at once before they made the changes to the zone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zymar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I experienced this in storms trying to get the raiders to spawn for tactics key access with my bard.

50 mobs of aggro laterish.. id fade it off and cry as they returned back to the cliff =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My favorite train of all time was during Kunark. There were two guilds on our server who could kill Trakanon at the time... and both of them were in the set up room before the bridge, squabbling about who should get first crack at ol' rotting and scaley. <br />
<br />
Clearly, there's only one way to solve this problem, right? Train Trak's lair to the the room! Yup, Trak shoved his ugly snout on in and ate both the top guilds on the server in one fell swoop. I think he's pretty much the only mob that can lay claim to that on the Nameless (thanks Glubgawd! :D)<br />
<br />
Definitely one of the funniest moments in EQ for me, and I think for most of the other folks there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about every mob in Sebilis trained to the zone in?  Yes... including Trakanon.   Apparently mobs don't like when you /kill another guide.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My favorite train is still the one on my first &quot;raid&quot;, Mistmore Castle.  Ranger pulls, says, one inc, and it was one. One &quot;mob&quot; the hole length of the bridge, the gypsy ambassador leading the way for every mob in the castle. 40 newbies mushed at the castle gates, and everyone else in the zone when a bard made a beeline for the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cazic thule after the revamp.... was fighting to the top of the 4 corners peyramid, when the monk brought the entire amygdalan force, and the thulian high ritualist... we had 2 groupsthere, and teh chanters were attempting to mez some, but in the chaos, someone unleashed a swarm pet, and knocked a mob OVER the side. Whcih promptly trained the ENTIRE courtyard and pyramid full of very very angry chain raining lizards. I saw them all racing up the pyramid towards us.... breathtaking.<br />
<br />
Another great moment in training...<br />
<br />
I'm level 45 or so in mistmoor, looking to see if black dire is up, and a paladin comes crawling up, at about 20% health. I see him stagger, get snared, and slow to a crawl, with the entire castle behind him.... he has enough time to /say &quot;woops!&quot; do a /shrug emote befere both of us were obliterated. If yer gonna go out, may as well do it in style, so I couldnt hold it against him   :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">while numbers make a good train, a memorable train is made by what happens afterward.<br />
<br />
i was going for the deranged underbulk in The Deep.  a 4 man group at the zoneline pulling shrooms.  i invis and go around.  invis drops right before spawn point and i get two.<br />
<br />
rooted and moved back to cast gate but then i had moved into the agro range of the shrooms.  can't get gate off, and look down to see i don't have a /shout train hotkeyed on this account.<br />
<br />
i run to them, tell them to run and stop right at the zoneline to see what they do.  i get stunned while turning and die to a nice sized train 2 steps away from zone.<br />
<br />
i am not sure why they didn't run, thought maybe they had an evac, so i buffed a sec and ran back.  but found out as the mobs moved back they got wiped.<br />
<br />
well, here is what makes it memorable.  the sec i zone in the 53 mage starts cussing me in /ooc, emoting some pretty disgusting stuff, and i am trying to apologize.  there is a cleric with a clickstick there that has already done their rezes and i volunteer in /tells with him to run back to bank pick up 200plat so they can split it and get new KEI as they are all casters.<br />
<br />
i still have this mage in /ooc and emote starting to get on my nerves.<br />
<br />
i loot most of my body but leave an item on and gate back to bank.<br />
<br />
while i am picking up 200 plat, i get all my resist gear on.  as the cleric is apologizing for the mage, i say &quot;np, but when i get back i am going to offer duel&quot;.  i start to get my buffs in line, cha, ultravision, see invis, agi sta, then the resists.  i pay for KEI and Virtue.  then i load up quick root, long root, blind, malo, pet and dots.  i have pet weapons on me.<br />
<br />
the second i zone in the mage /ooc He's back.  and the mage gates out.<br />
<br />
i give the cleric 150 to split with group, buff them all up with everything i have, get a 96rez from the cleric (sure i lost the KEI and Virtue i had just paid for, but worth it) and then get a tell wanting to know if i wanted to join the now group of three.<br />
<br />
i actually was just to embarrassed to join.  i had just accidently trained them, paid for new buffs, ran off a member of their group, and now i was getting an invite.  i mumbled something about a guild event and gated the second i had enough mana to get it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My most memorable are from Mistmoore as well, similar to the earlier poster's first raid. We had two groups in the 'entry hall' and were doing quite well, when the paladin we had pulling came back with one, that turned into two, that turned into the entire castle. The druid in my group was about .5 secs from finishing her evac when the train turned on her (back before the original change to 4 mobs max/player), the druid in the other group got theirs off and made it out with a ranger who was unconcious and no one else...nasty.<br />
<br />
Then there was the time we leapfrogged a friend of mines group who was down in the valley...and came running back by about 5 minutes later screaming like school girls to the zone (although in fairness I had died, it was the bard doing the running and the screaming as usual). He still reminds me of that when I talk to him. =p</div></div><hr />
