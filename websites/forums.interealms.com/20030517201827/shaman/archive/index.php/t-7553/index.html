<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redeemed Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello first post for me so I will get down to it. I have a guild that can not take the Hole raid. And to me it seems quite pointless to try if I can max my ally faction out solo. (Via CoM report turnins) Well I am Ally faction I have been since I turned in my second report.  That was ten reports ago 1 black Dire turn in and 1 Grosik turn in.  I still have yet to see the Your faction with True Spirit cannot get any greater message.  I have made enough mage friends that it will be easy to get at least 3 or 4 of them to come to the CoM for a pretty easy fight but I don't see them showing up for a Hole raid. I am wondering if I need to do my turn in for the Tear (got it from fear by pure luck) Take down Lord Rak.....I don't want to lose my tear but my faction has been holding at ally for I don't know how long..... Should I chance it or do I need to keep trying to Max it.....  Any advice on this would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I say max it, or you'll regret it. Better to keep doing this boring stuff than to waste your only tear.<br />
<br />
I'd try doing woe/envy/marr's promise, I hear that still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buffy_Toon_Slayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the Planes of Power expansion and using Plane of Knowlede as a port point. Getting from Rathe Mountains to Wkarana takes about 5 or so minutes.  This makes the envy woe marrs promise part the easiest way to build faction.  I camped it for the past couple days on and off.  Did 8 or so turnins to get max ally.  I only did this because a shaman in my guild said they would MQ the tear for me.  I was all ready up to getting the reports.  Had 4 of 6 already. Then started working on faction.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Buffy_Toon_Slayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OH, use oggok port from PoK and run striaght west to get to the mtns zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redeemed Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done the report turn in at least 13 times the diarys turn in and the entire quest up to the reports. Still no max faction.  I will truge on till I see it you all will be the first to know.</div></div><hr />
