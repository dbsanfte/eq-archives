<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A ghastly aura filled the nostrils of the oracle’s nose. Glydor Wintirglaze, shaman from the north lands of Halas crept along the cool brick pavement in the desolate City of Mist. Looming before the mystic was the castle, towering into a foggy abyss way above the reaches of mortal life. As if to peer condescendingly down into the eyes of Glydor, the monolithic structure stood, sturdy, yet crumbling from age atop its ancient foundation. Allowing himself to gather his thoughts, Glydor paused for a moment in a meditative trance. Closing his eyes, Glydor stood digging the hide of his boots into the decaying brick. The presence was becoming stronger and closer by the second, and the mystic could feel it. Suddenly without warning Lord Rak’Ashir hovered before Glydor, a ghostly blur of the long since deceased royal iksar. Swinging with lightning precision and alacrity, the specter lashed out at the fleshy man, emitting a deafening screech that reverberated off the vine covered walls. “Justice shall be swift and sure...” proclaimed Glydor, grappling against the mighty strength of the iksar. Only his steel spear stood between him and certain death. “Fool! The iksar legion shall consume all who stand to oppose them, begging with your worthless hide!” Again clawing relentlessly clawing at the mystic, a hastened block of the shield bearing the mark of Halas spared Glydor’s life once again. Before the spiteful demon could get any closer it stopped by the unrelenting manacles of nature’s magic. Bertoxxoulous’ scourge swelled within Glydor’s muscles as he prepared a cloud of disease, its magic pulsing through his fingers. Reeling from the intense pain the iksar lord heaved a sickened breath of bile, realizing his own fate imminent. Glydor seized the opportunity and charged spear in hand, thrusting the point into the blackened heart of his adversary. Slinking back to witch the shadows it came, Lord Rak’Ashir returned to his eternal sleep, leaving behind only a scale. Grasping it in his calloused hands, Glydor stood tall, knowing his path to becoming a Heyokah was finally complete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pretty good ... but solo on Lord Rak?  That Oracle din't need no SoF apparently!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe thanks, I thought that it would have been a little too hard to describe a raid force, and its cooler this way. I tried to make it as close to a real fight rather than a typical solo in eq. Any other comments or suggestions? I usually am writing alot and specialize in literature Id like some critisizm<br />
