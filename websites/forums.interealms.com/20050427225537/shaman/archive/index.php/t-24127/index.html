<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wynn Pendragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, all.  I've decided to make my debut post here at the Crucible with a little piece of fiction I've had laying around for a while.  Please, post any comments, compliments, or criticisms you may have; I live for feedback.<br />
<br />
     This story is based off of the in-game lore dealing with Dar Khura, the greatest shaman of Shar Vahl and the advisor to King Vah Kerrath.  While the lore does strongly hint towards Dar's fate, I took it into my own hands to imagine how it actually came to be.  This short story, one of several I have worked on concerning the Vah Shir heroes, is the result.<br />
<br />
     Please, enjoy my tale.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Tragedy of Dar Khura <br />
<br />
<br />
     “The spirits are restless here, elder.  Could this place by the source of the disturbances we have felt?”<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura took a deep breath before responding to the question of his fellow shaman.  The cold, crisp, unfamiliar air burned his lungs, but he forced himself to breath deeper, struggling to adjust to the thin atmosphere of the mysterious plains he and his men stood upon.  He gazed out at the flatlands for a moment, his still-keen eyes piercing the gloom of the eternal twilight that shrouded the land, searching for animals, for life, for anything besides the sparse trees and thin grass that draped the ground as far as the eye could see.  He found nothing; the land here seemed draped in eternal silence and stillness.<br />
<br />
     “Restless, you say?” Dar smiled sadly, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
     The younger shaman paused, his eyes closed as he reached out into the spirit realm.  Finally, he shook his head, his face twisted in confusion.  “Restless isn’t the word, I guess.  It just feels…strange here.  Quiet, somehow.”<br />
<br />
     “I had noticed it as well.  The spirits here are timid, afraid to show themselves.  It is like the silence of a forest, when the animals sense the presence of a great predator.  They all fear they may become its next prey.”<br />
<br />
     The shaman standing next to Dar Khura looked at him sharply, eyes widening.  He had obviously heard the rumors that had been cascading through the ranks of the Vah Shir shamans.  That was good; perhaps it would prepare him for whatever it was they had come to face.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura nodded wearily to the young Vah Shir.  It could do the shaman little harm now to confirm his fears.  His dreams had shown him that the rumors being passed amongst the Vah Shir spirittalkers were true; something, though he knew not what, was destroying the spirits themselves.  He had heard the silence left by their passing, had pleaded with the reluctant spirits to help him, and had finally discovered where the travesty was taking place: in the mountains just beyond this plain, underneath the massive stormcloud they could now see, despite the miles and miles that separated them from it.<br />
<br />
     And now, he and his men had come to put a stop to it.  They had left their homes in Shar Vahl many, many days prior, and had forged their way through the mountains to reach this place, this desolate, silent plain.  Still, he had no idea what awaited them beyond these fields, and could not view the mountains ahead with any anything but dread.  Anything powerful enough to slay the spirits themselves…<br />
<br />
     “Spiritist Khura!  Sir, there’s been trouble!”<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura turned away from his musings on the distant mountains and regarded the soldier that had addressed him.  The young Vah Shir was a warrior, his black-striped orange fur covered by thick plate armor.  He wore a curved sword at his side, and a round shield embossed with the royal emblem of Shar Vahl on his left arm.  He nodded absently to the other shaman, staring at Dar and standing rigidly at attention, his green eyes blazing with urgency.<br />
<br />
     “Yes?  What is it, sergeant?” Dar Khura murmured, his eyebrow lifting.<br />
<br />
     “Sir, one of our scouts encountered a creature nearby while he was patrolling.  Commander Prialin thinks you should have a look at it.  It doesn’t seem…” He paused, glancing downward in though. “…natural.”<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura nodded slowly, beckoning the soldier back the way he had come. “Lead the way, then, sergeant.  And go slow; I’m not as young as the rest of you kittens.” He hesitated, glancing to the shaman he had been speaking to. “You should come as well.  A second set of eyes will be handy…and a second set of wits would be more so.”<br />
<br />
     The trio of Vah Shir made their way from the place where Dar had gone to seek silence to gather his thoughts, back toward the camp.  As they walked Dar could see the thin plume of smoke rising from the small camp where the rest of the Vah Shir soldiers waited.  Dar could barely see the sentries patrolling not far from the tents, watching for intruders.  The sentries would be even more alert tonight, Dar mused, since life had been found on the plains.<br />
<br />
     Only a single fire had been built in the camp, and this was kept as small as possible; out in these open plains, smoke could draw unwanted attention from miles away.  Two Vah Shir crouched near the fire, seeing to the night’s dinner.  Others sat close to their small tents, cleaning weapons or talking quietly amongst themselves.  Dar could see the worry etched on their faces; whatever had been found, the rumors would make it a thousand times worse than the reality.<br />
<br />
     As they came up to the camp, two of the soldiers met them, nodding in greeting.  One of them wore chain armor over his speckled black fur, as well as a stained bandage over his upper right arm.  One of his hands rested on one of the black-handled dirks riding at his waist, but he seemed at ease, almost relaxed; a definite contrast to the rest of the camp.<br />
<br />
     The other Vah Shir was much more familiar to Dar Khura.  He was an old friend, one that had fought beside him more times than the aged shaman could count.  His skill with a sword and his talent for command had earned him the position as one of Khala Dun’s most trusted lieutenants, and the approval of Shar Vahl’s battled-hardened general did not come easily.  His small smile of greeting shifted the lines of scars on his face, scars that he had earned through his service to Shar Vahl on this unfamiliar world.<br />
<br />
     “Hail, Dar Khura,” the commander spoke warmly, his gruff voice breaking the nervous silence.  He raised one gauntleted hand in greeting.<br />
<br />
     Dar returned it with a nod. “Hail, Commander Prialin.  I believe you wanted to see me?”<br />
<br />
     “Yes…I suppose the sergeant briefed you?”  Prialin glanced at the soldier, who nodded briskly.<br />
<br />
     “Aye, that he did.  So, where is this creature that has you all so worried?”<br />
<br />
     The smile slipped from Prialin’s face. “Right over here.  We decided to keep it under one of the tents, so it wouldn’t distract the men.<br />
<br />
     As if it hadn’t already, Dar mused darkly.  He said nothing as he, the scout, the sergeant, and his fellow shaman followed the commander to a larger tent at the edge of the campsite.  Prialin held the flap open for the shaman, quietly ordering the sergeant to stand watch just outside.<br />
<br />
     Inside, they took positions around a small bier, where the creature, only half as tall as a Vah Shir, lay in death.  The being was humanoid, though its head and eyes were oversized.  It wore no clothes or armor, and its nakedness proved it to be androgynous.  Blue veins run under the creature’s black skin, especially in the head, which was rippled in the texture of the brain.  The gangly arms ended in three-fingered hands, which sported sharpened nails.  Blue-violet blood caked the creature’s chest, and a dribble had dried after it had oozed out of the gaping mouth.<br />
<br />
     “Hmm.  It appears to be a tegi, only larger, if just slightly.” Dar Khura shook his head as he considered the creature.  Shortly after their arrival on Luclin, the Vah Shir had encountered the odd, if less than harmless, aliens.  They inhabited the Shadeweaver’s Thicket, the woods not far from Shar Vahl, and the Vah Shir explorers and scouts had found them elsewhere, far from the city.  Studies on the corpses of the ones that had challenged the Vah Shir had revealed the aliens had elemental natures, their skin color and behavior differing according to which elemental tribe they belonged to.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura frowned as he considered the corpse lying before him.  He reached out to lift the creature’s arm, looking at the elongated nails at the tips of the creature’s grimy fingers.  Never before, from his own experience and from the scout reports he had read, had the Vah Shir encountered a black-skinned tegi.  And the musculature was developed far beyond any tegi he had even seen; this creature had to have been unnaturally strong.  And the unusual pale lines arcing across the body…scars?  But what could have-<br />
<br />
     pain. death.  fear.  the dark ones, the mighty ones, the four arms of shadow.  they die, they feast, we die.  the screams of battle, the death never-ending.  they consume us.  they destroy us.<br />
<br />
     she smiles.<br />
<br />
     “Are you all right, elder?  Elder Dar Khura!  Commander, fetch another shaman.  I’ll try healing him, and-”<br />
<br />
     “No, no,” Dar murmured weakly, “I’m fine.”  He tried to push himself off the ground, but his trembling arms held no force.  Commander Prialin leaned over, slipping an arm behind his neck and helping him to sit up.  A wave of dizziness overcame the aged shaman, and he slipped to lean against the tegi’s deathbed, but caught himself desperately, forcing himself away from the corpse.<br />
<br />
     “What overcame you?” the younger shaman asked, his wide eyes terrified.<br />
<br />
     “I swear to you, commander, when I fought it, nothing like that happened!  I even dragged the thing back to camp, and-”<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura thrust out a hand, halting the scout’s frantic babbling. “Worry not; this was no poison or attack, but a warning from the spirits.”<br />
<br />
     The other mystic stared at Dar, astonished. “But elder, the spirits have been-” He cut himself off, glancing warily at the scout and the commander.<br />
<br />
     “Quiet, yes.  But I believe this creature’s death has summoned them to us.”<br />
<br />
     “But…why?”<br />
<br />
     “Out of fear.  Out of anger, perhaps.” His gaze shifted up to the hand hanging over the edge of the bier. “Out of hope.<br />
<br />
     The three other Vah Shir in the tent glanced amongst themselves, wary and uncertain.  Dar pushed himself to his feet, grunting loudly, and placed a hand on the other shaman’s shoulder for support.  He motioned vaguely to Prialin and the scout, “Burn this body.  Worry not; I doubt the spirits will brave another contact, so the body should be safe to handle.  And double the watch tonight; who knows what else we will find the these plains, and better that we find them than they find us.”<br />
<br />
     With these words, the four split up, each going their own ways.  Dar Khura’s path found him very shortly in his own tent, where he struggled with his still-shaky muscles and racing mind, trying to find sleep.  As he finally drifted off, mere hours before morning, it was with the knowledge that he, at least, now had an idea of what they would find on these plains.  As sleep took him, he could still here the screams of the spirits’ warning, and he shivered as if he could almost feel the four-armed shadow hanging over the Vah Shir camp.<br />
<br />
****** <br />
<br />
     “They should have returned by now.  They’ve been told to check in routinely, especially if they run across anything.  If they’ve hared off and gone sticking their whiskers into places where they don’t belong, I’ll-”<br />
<br />
     “A little quieter, if you please, commander,” Dar Khura murmured calmly, ending the soldier’s ranting.  The commander hadn’t been yelling, but still the sound of his voice echoed off the foothills ahead of the Vah Shir.  Dar glanced back at the line of soldiers that were climbing the hill behind him and the irate warrior.  All of them were alert, on edge, and the sounds of their passage were nearly inaudible; a far cry from their commander’s loud displeasure.<br />
<br />
     Behind the soldiers Dar Khura saw nothing but the miles and miles of plains that they had crossed.  They had all come a long way from Shar Vahl, and he knew they may have even more distance to cross before they could return.  Dar glanced up into the near-dawn sky, and the clouds that lurked not too far away.  If they returned at all, that was. <br />
<br />
     “Sir, if you wish, I can send a couple of our men to look for the scouts.  We still have a few men skilled in stealth with us, and maybe they can find the others.”<br />
<br />
     “I’ll mot risk any more men on a few over-ambitious snoops,” Prialin snapped at the sergeant, although in a much quieter voice.  He nervously stroked the pommel of his sword, watching the hill lines as if expecting to see the scouts appear at any moment.<br />
<br />
     “Well, if we don’t know where they are, maybe we should post someone else to be our foreguard,” suggested a quiet voice from just beside Prialin.  The commander jumped, hissing in surprise.  Dar Khura gave the scout a nod, recognizing him as the one that had slain the tegi days before.<br />
<br />
     “I hate it when you people do that!  Make at least a little noise, will you?” Prialin roared, keeping his voice as quiet as his temper would allow.<br />
<br />
     The scout hid a wry, pleased smile with a slight bow. “I’ll try to do that in the future, sir.”<br />
<br />
     “The scout’s suggestion is a good one, Commander.  If something has indeed delayed our scouts, then it would be best for us to be prepared.”<br />
<br />
     Prialin sighed, still trying to calm his flustered nerves.  He nodded briskly, motioning the scout forward. “But stay close, and I mean that.  If something is out there, then we need to know about it, and for that you need to be able to make it back to us.”<br />
<br />
     “Aye, sir, I’ll-”<br />
<br />
     “What’s that?”<br />
<br />
     Prialin and Dar Khura turned to face the sergeant.  The sergeant held a gauntleted hand over his eyes, looking slightly downhill of the Vah Shir.  Dar Khura followed his gaze, noticing a pile of boulders lying at the base of the hill.<br />
<br />
     “I could have sworn I saw the glint of metal down there,” the sergeant said softly.  He squinted, trying to find whatever had attracted his attention.<br />
<br />
     “Sergeant, your eyes must be playing tricks on you.  I just see a bunch of boulders, and not particularly shiny ones, either.”<br />
<br />
     “I see it, too, commander,” the scout said.  He smiled unabashedly at his superior’s glare.<br />
<br />
     “Perhaps it is worth a look, commander,” Dar Khura said softly.  He couldn’t quell the unease he was feeling.  It was as if an unseen shadow had just fallen on the back of his neck.  While the other were distracted by the boulders, he had chanted a call to the spirits under his breath; a spell to strengthen his eyesight.  Not to his surprise, the spirits had refused to answer.  Whatever was causing the disturbance in the spirit world had to be the cause…it had to be close.<br />
<br />
     “Yes, yes, you’re right.  Sergeant, take six men with you and check it out.  But, I don’t want you out of my sight, so the rest of us are going to take a rest right up here until you get back.  If it is trouble, we’ll be close enough to help.”<br />
<br />
     “Aye, sir!” The sergeant snapped a salute, and trotted off, gesturing to the men that would accompany him down the hill.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura raised a hand, beginning the chant of a spell that would bless the soldier with spiritual protection, but let the chant drop in futility.  This was out of his hands now, whatever happened.<br />
<br />
     The Vah Shir watched the sergeant and his six soldiers carefully make their way down the hill, their eyes scanning the area for danger and their weapons at the ready.  The only one distracted was Dar Khura; his gaze had wandered to the mountains just beyond the foothills they were climbing, and the storm cloud that raged above them.  What was the cause of such a dark, unrelenting storm?  Surely, this was no natural weather, but-<br />
<br />
     “By Kejaan’s claws, what is that?” Prialin exclaimed, pointing to the base of the hill.  Dar Khura’s attention came back to the soldiers, and he gasped in astonishment.  Finally, trouble had found them.<br />
<br />
     The pile of boulders had somehow risen, forming a vaguely humanoid form.  The seven soldiers all stood around it, weapons at the ready, as it rumbled toward them in a rolling gait.  In the place where the boulders had lain, Dar could see the crumbled, battered corpse of one of the Vah Shir scouts; it had been the reflection of light off the fallen scout’s dagger that had probably drawn the sergeant’s attention.<br />
<br />
     The man-shaped boulder creature loomed over the Vah Shir, who glanced to their leader, unsure whether to attack, retreat, or try to reason with the stones.  The monster made the decision for them, lunging forward with terrifying speed.  One of the stonebeast’s arms, a massive boulder longer than the Vah Shir were tall and easily weighing more than the seven men facing it, swung around in an arc, catching one of the soldiers and lifting him up into the air.  His body landed limply a good distance away.<br />
<br />
     “Men, draw weapons and move down the hill!  Flank that rock, <br />
attack it from all sides!  It has to have a weak spot somewhere!” Prialin bellowed, motioning his command forward with his gleaming scimitar.<br />
<br />
     “Sir, we’re under attack!” cried one of the men behind the commander and the aged mystic.  They whirled, coming to face the three tegi dashing towards them.  As Prialin lunged forward, slashing one of the black-skinned tegi from left hip to right shoulder, Dar Khura began to chant furiously, summoning the spirits of the frozen south to strike their enemies.<br />
<br />
     His eyes widened when the spell died out without result.  He had forgotten his magic was useless here.  He watched, dazed, as one of the tegi ran towards him, murder in its eyes and claws held back, ready to tear into the defenseless shaman.<br />
<br />
     The shadow tegi’s eyes dimmed as it slumped forward to the ground, dark blue blood gushing from the crater in the back of its head.  The shaman that had saved Dar gave him a brief nod, his cudgel coming down one more time on the prone tegi before he rushed off, towards the soldiers still battling the aliens.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura took the moment to survey the battle  Prialin and the scout were still fighting the last tegi to charge them, and the other soldiers were adding to the scattered corpses of tegi that had fallen to the Vah Shir.  A few soldiers lay wounded, but none appeared to have been slain.  The same could not be said of the battle below; a pile of now-shattered boulders lay in the middle of the bodies of the seven Vah Shir, the sergeant slumped atop it.  The soldiers were all either dead or mortally wounded, Dar knew, even with the distance between them.  Only a few tegi remained now…but there, on the hill!  Another wave of short, black bodies, and two taller forms-<br />
<br />
     death and shadows; they come.<br />
<br />
     they come for you.<br />
<br />
     “Regroup, men!  Face the enemy!” Prialin bellowed, waving his blood-splattered sword. “Don’t let them have your backs!” <br />
<br />
     Now, Dar could see the two forms coming down the hill behind the tegi, driving them on.  They were humanoid, although they had four arms instead of two; both carried a greatsword for each pair of arms.  They were far taller than the tegi, taller than the Vah Shir.  The faces were pale and smooth, and small horns curled out of their dark hair.  They wore voluminous robes, of what appeared to be fine silk, with long-nailed hands coming out of the wide sleeves.<br />
<br />
    These, Dar knew, were the creatures that were affecting the spirit world.  They were the shadows, the darkness the spirits feared so greatly.  The Vah Shir had found what they were looking for, or it had found them.<br />
<br />
     So be it.  Dar Khura raised his hand to point at one of the creatures, his voice ringing out strongly as he call to the spirits to aid him against the creatures that had caused them such anguish.  These monsters would pay for their desecration of the spirits!<br />
<br />
     “Weia, datoreus!  Tekar ans sivuelaeum!” One of the monsters cried, its high, melodic voice mocking the screams and clashing as the Vah Shir soldiers met the tegi.<br />
<br />
     The creature that had spoken noticed Dar pointing at it.  It laughed maliciously, ignoring the greater battle and making its way toward Dar Khura and his guardians.  Its fellow, however, waded into the Vah Shir formation, its swords flashing and spraying the air with Vah Shir blood.<br />
<br />
     Prialin stepped before the creature, shield held high. “Get back, you four-armed freak, or taste Shar Vahl steel!” he growled, drawing his sword back.<br />
<br />
     The creature smiled down at the commander. “Vyanemis,” it purred, one sword coming around in a lethal arc.  Prialin caught the blow on his shield, but it was still not enough; the blow sent him and the misshapen shield sailing into the air.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura chanted furiously as the monster came on, its smile eager.  The spirits would not come to his call, but he would not give up fighting; these abominations would be destroyed, or he would give his life trying! He watched one of the swords rise into the air, his words never faltering.<br />
<br />
     The creature shuddered, its face twisting in pain. “Like ambushes, do you?” snarled the scout, driving his dagger again into the monster’s thigh and twisting.  His daggers danced lower as he tried to hamstring his massive foe.<br />
<br />
     A sword came around, but he nimbly dodged, ducking below the swing.  He nearly didn’t avoid the second strike as the creature turned to face him, and the third came closer yet.<br />
<br />
     The fourth swing paused as the humanoid’s elegant face twisting again in pain and indignation.  It glanced behind it, eyes widening in anger.<br />
<br />
     Prialin smiled viciously up at it.  His left arm hung uselessly at his side, dripping blood onto the ground, but the creature’s blood now coated his sword. “Not…dead…yet!” He promised, and the sword dove forward again.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura coughed weakly, his chant dying away.  This battle was on the verge of being a complete rout.  The tegi all lay slain, but besides himself, Prialin, and the scout, all the other Vah Shir were piled in a heap surrounding the other monster.  Still, as Dar watched, the creature wavered, falling to the ground as it dropped its weapons.<br />
<br />
     One of the Vah Shir stood weakly, facing the fallen monster.  She clutched her stomach, trying to stop the flowing blood that covered her side, and she stumbled as she stepped up to the creature, but her scimitar rose smoothly behind her.  The creature looked up to her, its arms pinned under its body, the reflection of the sword in its wide, confused eyes.<br />
<br />
     The sword burst through the creature’s head at eye level.  Dripping with blood and gore, both hers and the creature’s, the Vah Shir sank to one knee.  Her shoulders shook as she laughed, and the sword tumbled from her fingers.<br />
<br />
     their death is our death.  their death is your death.<br />
<br />
     The Vah Shir soldier gasped as a massive shadow arose from the corpse of the slain monster.  The thing appeared to be a cowled robe, all darkest black, as tall as the creature that had spawned it had been.  No face, nothing but darkness, was inside the cowl, and one arm of the robe, no hand visible inside, rose up to settle over the soldier’s face.<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura screamed along with the wordless shriek in his head.  He clawed at his forehead, unable to bear the pain he was feeling as the diminished spirits wailed.  He could feel the darkness that had emerged the second the creature had died, the shadow that had birthed itself from the spirits it had consumed.  These…these were parasites, feeding off the spirits to live after their death!<br />
<br />
     The shadow turned at the sound of his scream, dropping the limp body of the soldier, just dead flesh now.  It drifted toward Dar, coming for him, coming to devour him….<br />
<br />
     No.  This would not happen.  This corruption would not be abided.  No, this stopped now.  He would stop this.  They would not do this again, never again.  NO!<br />
<br />
     Dar Khura lunged to his feet.  He threw out a hand as he chanted words he did not know, casting a spell he had not known existed.  He felt the spirits fill him, their rage his rage, as the shade came closer, its arms rising.  His voice rising into a crescendo, he stared into the blackness inside the cowl.<br />
<br />
     No more.<br />
<br />
     The wave of spiritual energy burst out of Dar Khura, slamming into the shade.  The dark form trembled, crumpling forward as it held itself.  The cowl looked forward, meeting Dar Khura’s furious eyes.<br />
<br />
     This ended now!<br />
<br />
     The shade shook silently, flailing as the spirits Dar Khura had unleashed ripped it apart.  It stilled, slumping, the cowl shaking in denial.  Then it exploded, fine dust and fading shadows.<br />
<br />
     “Attaumis…” a melodic voice murmured, fear and disbelief obvious despite Dar’s incomprehension of the language.  The shaman turned, looking up at the other creature.  It looked back at him with a mixture of awe and fear, which turned to rage.  Just behind it, Dar could see the motionless forms of the commander and the scout.  They had given it their best, too.<br />
<br />
     “Ura ial tavual, sivuela.  Ura anir xar rulour Vex Thall!”<br />
<br />
     Dar smiled faintly.  The spirits would not aid him again.  He had failed, but at least one of these monsters would not defile the spirit world again.  Dar Khura watched death come for him, smiling in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
     “Not yet!” roared Commander Prialin, raising up from the ground at the creature’s feet, just enough to drive his twisted sword into the monster’s calf muscle.<br />
<br />
     The creature shrieked in pain, pulling one of its swords back. “Teka!” it cried in frustration, the blade coming down on the Vah Shir commander.<br />
<br />
     The spirits of this place would not come to Dar Khura’s call…but there were spirits here still willing to fight.  Dar Khura smiled viciously, once again raising his arm, the palm of his hand facing the blood-covered monster.  The spirits of the fallen Vah Shir welled within him, their rage, their determination, their power enhancing his own.<br />
<br />
     “This ends now!” Dar Khura screamed, feeling the spell cascade through him.  He chanted no words, but still his hands and eyes glowed with the spiritual magic he was channeling.<br />

     The creature lunged, but it was too late.  A brilliant wave of energy slammed into it, sending the swords spiraling away.  It gasped as the magic seared through it, consuming it, breaking its ties to the mortal world. “Att…attaumis?” it shrieked, its eyes and mouth shooting forth beams of the light it had absorbed. “Xar!” The word became a scream as the light destroyed it completely, leaving no trace.<br />
<br />
     The hillside was quiet, except for the sound of the old shaman’s body hitting the ground.  He wore a slight smile, but his eyes were dull.  The wind blew gently over the battlefield, but he did not feel it.<br />
<br />
     The creature had been destroyed utterly by the force of the spirits of the Vah Shir soldiers…all of them.<br />
<br />
     they know light now.  the shadows will flee at that which they cannot face.  one day, one of us will bring the light to them, and end this forever.<br />
<br />
   and I shall be here for that day. <br />
<br />
<br />
The End <br />
<br />
<br />
     I hope all have enjoyed my humble story, and urge you to let me know how you feel about it. <br />
