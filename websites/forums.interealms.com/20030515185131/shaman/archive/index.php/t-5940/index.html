<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The undead slaves looks like good solo xp at 49, but is there a way to pull them single without adding the TM? I tried once, and the first one was ok, but the second one brought the TM who I assume is a bit too much for me.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do them single and if so how.<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As usual I can't answer your question completely but have some experience in the area. <br />
<br />
First, the skeles: I believe I was able to fight them without adds by going to their spawn point rather than trying to pull them. This was with my monk 6 - 8 months ago but I believe they flee along the walls. If I remember correctly, I went clockwise around the TM but for some reason I stopped at the 4th or 5th one (near a 'corner' of the room). Load gate up, lol, my memory of doing them isn't too clear and with a monk, I always had the option of fd'ing if things went bad. <br />
<br />
Second, the TM might be doable at 49 if you're able to get dot's to land. I (43 shaman) did him with a 42 warrior the other day and was able to slow him 4 out 5 times on the first try (no malaise) and then on the 2nd try the one time I got a resist. The problem was I couldn't land a dot to save my soul. Our first attempt was almost a disaster because I tried to dot. Ended up canni'ing like mad to get enough mana to heal the warrior. If lvl's mean anything on our dot's resists, you should have a chance. The TM is lvl 42 btw (always an even con to the warrior).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little. If you're on Tribunal, shoot me a tell. I can bring a monk (Zlite) or a cleric (Doqtir) over on your first attempt to make sure all goes well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have JBB I'd bet the taskmaster is soloable.  Hell he is probably soloable at 49 with EB as long as you can keep him rooted.  I had trouble at 48 but didn't try once I dinged 49.<br />
<br />
(edit:  I forgot that I could never land a poison dot on him, you might be able to land disease if you debuff first)<br />
<br />
You can single pull them at 54,  the skellies will be light blue to you by then but the TM will be dk blue.  If you have a friend or an alt that is that level maybe they can help you pull singles.<br />
<br />
I dinged 48 and 49 on saturday just pulling the skellies, TM and the surrounding room with my 54 chanter and killing with my shaman.  So sweet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For anyone curious if TM is soloable by a 49 shammy, the answer is YES.  I just dinged 49 and have killed him 4 times.  Naala 4 , TM 0.  I was amazed how well the 49 pet was able to tank him.  With Hos, Regen and haste on pet , dog-dog rocked.  Every slow landed on first try (Tagars without a Malosi).  However, after a Malosi I still couldnt get e-bolt or plague to land, so the TM must have a huge PR/DR resist.  Makes sense considering he's a snake. Therefore, I resorted to my cold based DD blizzard blast which always landed for full damage, while pet tanked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I got to room at full spawn, pulled TM with slow and no skellies assisted.  After killin TM, pullin skellies with slow I would sometimes get 2 and have to root park one.  Best way to pull them is to just run up and smack em while staying as far away from other skels as possible.<br />
<br />
Please note that during this camp I had KEI which allowed me to chain cast BB. No JBB :( Highly recommend KEI before fight.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 49, you're fully able to take on the Taskmaster. How?<br />
<br />
Your pet. You will NOT be able to land any poison / disease on him (he even resists our supposedly unresistable disease debuff... totally immune). What you do is bring up your pet, slap HoS, guardian, chloro, and alacrity on him. If you have them, toss on some spiny weapons or such. Pull with Malaise, slap on Togor's, and send the pet in. You'll have to play cleric to your pet, and probably tank a bit for him, as well. If you have a JBB, zap the hell out of him, he has nothing for Cold resist. Average magic resist rate. It might be a bit close depending on your mana pool, but the 49 pet can take him, given heals.<br />
<br />
He's on a half-hour spawn table, drops normal shissar loot, plus the phosphorescent fiber (~50pp with cha to a merchant), and a shissar revenant skull, which I haven't figured out yet. The drop you really want are the Shissar Organs for the enduring breath necklace.<br />
<br />
The skeletons around him are non-aggro, and also easily killed by your pet. However, they have crap resists and surprisingly low hit points. They drop a mining pick that sells for about ~6pp, but is lore.<br />
<br />
Around you are underbulks, Stonegrabbers, and fungus things. The stonegrabbers are very nice loot for luclin, dropping up to 10pp. The underbulks are worthless, as are the fungusbeasts... but it's still experience. Fireclaw (named underbulk) is immune to root and has some nice HP, but drops Fireclaw (decent h2h weapon) and fireclaw's carapace (so-so melee back item). There's a named fungus, Trilcor, who is a badass. He's like a harder-hitting taskmaster with less hitpoints and a disease-based stun that lasts way too long.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns has a massive exp bonus. At 52, killing a light blue skeleton was the same as killing a dark blue on Kunark or something. The taskmaster was a very nice bump to my exp, and Trilcor... well, He's a total waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forochel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, two thumbs up in agreement with Naala and Gandwer. He is <br />
easily soloable at 49 but, don't bother with any DOT's. The <br />
Taskmaster will resist them all even when you get to level 50.<br />
<br />
I usually don't hunt with any sort of mana regen and I don't have <br />
a JBB. I have two gift items (shadel bandit's ring and chokadai <br />
hide spaulders) but, everything I wear I pretty much earned <br />
though blood, sweat, tears and death.<br />
<br />
I first did this camp solo at 48 which was a very tough and I <br />
couldn't keep the pace. I abandoned it and killed lower TM until <br />
I hit 49 and two blues and then came back with new spells. :) <br />
(Buhahha!)<br />
<br />
I too cast HoS and Alacrity on my pet. I open with Slow and then <br />
Incapacitate shortly there after. I cast one Greater Heal (pet) <br />
and two Blizzard Blasts and the Taskmaster is pretty much toast.<br />
<br />
During the fight while pet has agro, I've got Chloroplast and <br />
Form of the Bear going so I canni-dance to keep mana up. <br />
<br />
I sit the doggie to make him heal faster between pulls and when <br />
I'm low on mana I only use Slow and Listless Power on the Undead <br />
Slaves and let the pet tank while I canni. Doing this I was able <br />
to clean out the Taskmaster camp and take all of the dark blues I <br />
wanted from lower TM. <br />
<br />
I too found that when I pulled with slow and just ran sometimes I <br />
would get two Undead Slaves when I pulled from the right hand <br />
side of the camp. This wasn't too much of a worry; as Naala says, <br />
they are easily rooted and separated. What worked for me to <br />
prevent the rare add was to move a bit into the mob's path so <br />
that when agroed it would come directly to me before I brought it <br />
the rest of the way down the tunnel. Also I would usually pull <br />
from one side (usually right) and then the other alternating. <br />
Once having cleared a bit, pull from the middle/center separating <br />
the circle of mobs. Additionally you may find that you can just <br />
pull the Task Master himself with a Cancel Magic.<br />
<br />
I have a MP II item and an EA II item so for me, Venom of the <br />
Snake is pretty efficient and gets the job done fairly quickly. <br />
If I needed to speed things up I would use Envenomed Bolt <br />
however, EBolt was a bit more than my poor wimpy soul could take <br />
using repeatedly at 49.<br />
<br />
With respect to Trilcor, I didn't have too much trouble with him. <br />
Slow, send in pet, stack the disease DOTs (never had a resist) <br />
maybe nuke once maybe heal once. Just make sure pet keeps agro -- <br />
he seems to be pretty much unaffected (except from damage) by <br />
Trilcor's annoying disease/stun DOT. As for the underbulks they <br />
aren't 100% worthless. Just think of the fame you'll have while <br />
drink Undebulk Bile! Yum! (Blech!!). That and they have stackable <br />
claws that sell for 3 pp each. Nothing to get rich on but, better <br />
than those durn Fungoids! <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a side note spawn on TM is about 30min on Fennin Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Been soloing TM since lvl44.  It's not hard.  Just gotta know how to do it.<br />
<br />
1)  Summon pet, and buff up.  I normally just haste pet and give him two FS weapons.  Or if I was just in the bazaar - Muzzle of Mardu (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1348), a Girdle of Magi'Kot (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28598)  and two Fists of Ixiblat (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28596).  Total cost about 45-55pp, Girdle was the most expensive at 20pp. <br />
<br />
2)  When you arrive at the TM room, clear the two mobs on either side of the tunnel up to the TM room.  I've had only one bad experience camping the TM, and it was when these two mobs added as I was doign my thing.<br />
<br />
3)  After clearing enough room to work with, I mem Instill, Togor's, Malisement, Blizzard Blast and Incapacitate or Winter's Roar (I always have Alacrity, Chroloplast and Canni II mem'ed).  <br />
<br />
4)  Walk up to top of tunnel, target TM and cast Togor's (he's only resisted once).  And back down the tunnel, while telling dogdog to attack.  The TM will come as well as the first Undead Slave to the right (to the right facing the TM).<br />
<br />
5)  Both mobs will stop to try and put a hurt on dogdog.  Target the Undead Slave and root and slow.  Switch back to TM (as he could have dogdog down near 50-60% by this time), cast Maslisement, then nuke until TM comes after me.<br />
<br />
6)  After that it's &quot;tank in teh face&quot; while dogdog does his thing.  I always nnuke too.  One Blizzard Blast is about 10% of the TM's health, and I can usually get them in between blows.<br />
<br />
7)  After TM is dead, then kill Undead Slave.<br />
<br />
Doing this I made all of Lvl44, and so far all of lvl45 (I'll ding lvl46 there too, need one more organ for my Amulet of the Grey Wastes, then it's to LoY for Stoicism).  Not too hard with a KEI.  And besides, I love walking up and soloing the TM room in front of the duo clearing the lower TM room but are too afraid to attempt the TM and his room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wincemaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, for all you iksar shaman out there, the skeletons inside like you.  I can't remember if they con aimiable or higher, but they will NOT aggro if you pull the taskmaster.  At lvl 44 I was fully able to single pull the taskmaster, but the skeletons are another story as people have posted.<br />
<br />
I've never pulled more than two skeletons while pulling them, and root parking works fine.  While although soloing is a very viable option, in my experience you're better off tagging a nice melee or hybrid class if you can.  The extra damage they do plus allowing you to meditate and use your hps for cannibalizing rather than tanking really makes kills come faster and net less down time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, as a Barbarian Shaman the skeletons are Apprehensive to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pleh1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I soloed the TM at 45th no JBB.  Just pull TM with slow, him and skele come.<br />
<br />
Root Skele, Slow Skele.<br />
<br />
Go hth with TM... Nuke some (mana does get low though).<br />
<br />
Reroot Skele after  1 - 2 min.<br />
<br />
Finished off the TM.<br />
<br />
Root Skele.<br />
<br />
Med...<br />
<br />
Go kill skele.<br />
<br />
Was tuff. was at 50% hp after all the fight. but still was fun.</div></div><hr />
