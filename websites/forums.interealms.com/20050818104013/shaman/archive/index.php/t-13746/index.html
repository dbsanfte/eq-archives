I'm sure a lot of people got this thing linked to them tonight.  I saw it, and haven't stopped crying since then.  Somewhere.... there is a very happy shaman.<br />

No need for comments, just admire it.</div></div><hr />

but seriously, If you got all the way to the plane of time, does this item matter? They can give you anything they want, its never going to unbalance the game. Although it is a sweet item.</div></div><hr />

No, actually a lot of Time loot that was linked in game to me last night had that :confused:<br />
<br />
Dunno what it is, but it's real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm just happy its shaman only, and not all melee classes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nearly every new weapon that I've seen recently that has AC on it, has this weird: AC: AC: # thing. I think it's a mistake and the template that they use for weapons is screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/drool ill take two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WOW. If damage were 0 people would still spend quite a bit of time to quest for this. Almost what, 200 mana/life? 170/175. +20 wis, 20 stam, 15 agil, 15 ac. This gives better ac/life than most peices of armor :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah you'd need all those HP and AC for when this thing proc's three times in a row :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That's not a proc.  It's a clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah the ac thing seems to be some sort of bug. There are numerous items that are showing up like that now. I beleive that the PoE bow is showing up like that and I know it exsists since I made one for my room mate =)<br />
<br />
That is definitely one killer weapon. Finnaly something that actually looks worth all the pain people have had to go threw to get into time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm just happy its shaman only, and not all melee classes...<br />
<br />
if it was anything but shaman only, many would get extremely pissed... nobody should ever get the slowing power of a shaman - weather from an item or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Best Shaman item in the game without a doubt. Would be nice if it came with a focus effect, but clicky slow on top of those kind of stats? unbeatable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When you gotten as far as that I would probably go for the bp instead with the same effect and go for a weap that procced smoe insane dmg :P<br />
<br />
Except BP's have yet to be found, and are going to be seriously contended for by Rogues and Rangers who so far have yet to get any very nice BP's, many are still wearing Kael quest or similar since Luclin screwed them for the most part.<br />
<br />
I personally got a Mail of Storms for the stats and focus (click on my Magelo below for stats), and I'm glad I did because now I can get this weapon without worrying about having double clicks of the same thing.  I've been hoping Time would have some good primary weapons, I've been passing on items I could put in main hand (or switch my Orb to main hand and put another item in range) in hopes of this.  Glad to see that my wait is going to pay off, last time I upgraded my Primary was a year ago almost.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'd loot the damn thing just for the looks alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That is the sweetest looking shaman weapon around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think I just messed my pants.<br />
<br />
Could you imagine being a shaman on the raid when that got linked? I would have a seizure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Except BP's have yet to be found, and are going to be seriously contended for by Rogues and Rangers who so far have yet to get any very nice BP's, many are still wearing Kael quest or similar since Luclin screwed them for the most part.<br />
<br />
Your kidding right? There are good bp's with vengeance in water (Algae Covered Chainmail) for rogues/rangers that drops from mininameds and can be done by 1 group. Or maybe a vengeful mail of the void from cursed? And if none of those works, go look for Stanos Wicked Breastplate, Im sure someone in the guild can do em. The best bp for shammies before ep is what? judgement? a truly common bp (yes, sarcastic. Sorry). I have vindi bp still. Tell me some rogue/ranger that use vindi bp who are in a highend guild in Time? But ofcourse they will be contested, like all chain been in EP.. But I agree that the weap is uber anyway, otherwise I would be lying my ass of :p<br />
<br />
edit: Mail of Storms are good but I pass on that to let the rogue/rangers get Vengeance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Look at the stats in Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24699) -- there's the gremlin. A damage bonus modifier should appear where the double AC is showing.<br />
<br />
DMG: 28 Dmg Bonus: 13 AC: 15<br />
<br />
And it's not just clicky slow. It's instant-recast clicky slow :D</div></div><hr />
