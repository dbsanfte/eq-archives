Killing a MoB from a cycle in SE makes one spawn in SW, killing that one makes one spawn in NW, killing the NW one makes one spawn in SE. (thus the cycle  <br />
<br />
All giants and brutes and sarnaks are rumored to have rare drops. I have just listed drops if I have personally looted them. <br />
<br />
SE corner - a 30 to 40 group or even a 30 to 35 group if well balanced. Tracker is a MUST. Position this group near the Dreadlands tunnel and have the tracker SOWed, lev'd and pulling to you. Rangers preferred as tracker here but druid or bard will work. <br />
<br />
SW corner - higher end group - camp on the south wall near -3300, +2000 or -3300, +1500. On the wall near those spots you can find a place where not much will aggro your group. Make this group the higher group, consisting preferably of level 35 to 45 or even higher people. A couple of the SW corner spawns are blue into the low 50s and can have a ton of HP so higher is better here. Tracker here can be any of the tracking classes. <br />
<br />
NW corner - ranger is a must for this corner. All that you need here is a ranger and one other, say an SK. Higher levels are better. If you get one of the nasties, just yell in guildchat that you are bringing Bloodscale (or whoever) down to the SW corner group and pull him in for the kill. <br />
<br />
Each group leader is responsible for telling, in guildchat (or via tells if not in same guild), when their group has complete a mob and what mob it is. That way, when the SW group kills a particular giant, the NW group knows which list is about to pop and that they need to look right then for the new mob. <br />
<br />
If your trackers are good and you don't get distracted killing non-cycle mobs, you can run a cycle in about 5 minutes tops. Figure a dozen cyles per hour, go for 3 hours, and you can haul some nice items out of Frontier Mountains. <br />
Cycle 1 is easy to get started. Just kill the rare in the SE corner or ANY &quot;a gorging brute&quot;, then run to the SW corner. Chances are that the SW corner will have popped a rare...then onward to the NW etc. I got my sleeves the second time I ran the cycle. Varithyx is very easy, Claxiss is a tough one. I killed him but only after he got to about 20% from gobbies. <br />
<br />
Biggest problem I keep having is getting aggroed by random mobs...tons of monsters in the mountains there. If you get aggroed, you can root and easily run out of their aggro range usually. Keep SOW up always and Levitate if possible, very helpful in the mountains.  <br />
<br />
Can't remember who originally posted the guide but I had a copy of it on my hard drive :)</div></div><hr />

If you follow the river from the SoNH zone you come to a lake just where the river joins the lake is the best place I have found ot set up and pull to as there are no wanderers that path through, and you are in an ideal postition to track all the spawn points apart from the one near Seb. Set your tracking to normal and start pulling the Hunters and Foragers, I generally ignore the Hunter cycle as the rewards are minimal. Once you kill a Hunter or Forager check track imediately and at the top of the list will either be a named or another Hunter/Forager, if there is no new named follow the lake side down towards the Seb Aqueduct till you find the next mob. Then rinse and repeat till you have all you want or till you get tired :)<br />

Copied the list off a previous thread on the glade but wrote the text myself as a guide for a friend :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to kite them to around one bub of health then melee them down. Takes many arrows and DoTs. <br />
<br />
Some of the Named on this cycle are higher/harder than the hunter/forager. Doom comes to mind, hehe. You'd definately need a group at your level.</div></div><hr />

What are the chances of a level 42 ranger soloing any of those named mobs in Trak? <br />
<br />
i know mathematically you ll alwais have a probability &gt;0 but i gess in verant world you cant ;)... so in other words there is no chance in the world a level 42  can do them ...</div></div><hr />

I really want that regen bp but I am not willing to spend 6k on it. <br />
For some reason I can't get Magelo to work, so here are my stats. Self-buffed I have 2798 hp, about 1115ac, and 1311 attack, with 159 wisdom(meaning i have a decent amount of mana). For weapons I use a Tox axe and swiftwind with a light velium bow. I also have a swarmcaller for slows and an fbss for haste when slowing.</div></div><hr />

I have soloed this cycle at 58.  The hunter/forager are pretty easy.  I usually try to have KEI and plenty of arrows.  I use summoned arrows.  Just keep them rooted, dotted and full of arrows.  If no KEI, don't worry about dots.  I have had to summon more arrows in the middle of a kill before though.  Your stats are better than mine, so you should have no problem.<br />
<br />
I have soloed the named below as well.  Trak and Silvermane are panicable.  Have yet to see Zoglic while soloing.<br />
<br />
Champion Arlek (Knobbed Warclub 8/24 3 wis) <br />
Champion Thenrin (Ghostly Robes ac10 6int, 8fr, 8cr) <br />
Dreadlord Fanrik (Grim Pauldrons ac13, 10str) <br />
Silvermane (Sabertooth Amulet) <br />
Trakanasaurus Rex (Trak Tooth 10/20 rog only) <br />
<br />
Hyew - 59 Wood Elf Outrider (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22035)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xequecal</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot solo Zoglic. I doubt a level 60 could, and level 65s probably can't either. He is a level 50 SK. HT will take a large chunk of your life, and then he will Fear you and kill you. He is also a ghost, which means he will be constantly lifetapping you and making it even harder. He hits for double 140s, and has around 8000 HP.<br />
<br />
Also, don't try to solo Harbinger Dronik. Level 50 Wizard = Ice Comet = Dead Ranger.</div></div><hr />

Quick correction for this one.  It should be &quot;a Burynai miner&quot;.  Note the capital B.  There are a ton of &quot;a burynai miner&quot;s up in that neck of the woods, but only the one with a capital B.<br />

40 ranger (me); 41 warrior; 45 warrior; 41 shaman (bot); 45 cleric (bot); and either a 45 wizard or a 38 beastlord.  (we can have both of the latter 2 if we use /raid).</div></div><hr />
