<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to get some input from shamans that have been in this zone about where a good place for soloing can be found. I have solo'd at the zone in but it's crowded there and I'd like a little more space to work in. I've tried moving a bit into the zone but the damn arcaics seem to see through invis. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Also, anyone know where a map of the zone is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have an enchanter friend who can illusion you, have them cast illusion IMP on ya ~ not sure if they changed this but last time I was there with my enchanter nothing aggroed on me in Imp form.<br />
<br />
There is a good spot if you follow the path to the left from zone in. A ways in there is a sort of crossroads (the first one you come to), where there is a path to the left, a path straight ahead, and a door to your right.  Open the door to the right and there is a room with about 5 or 6 static spawns. Pretty sure there werent any roamers and this was a good spot for my group, we were all at and around 55th level and I didn't see anything other than blue cons so it might be a good spot for you to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i managed to solo a mob here at 55.  had epic aego and c3. Mob hit for 250 and was resistant.  One of the hardest fights i can recall.  pet died and i was down to 30% health, but i killed it.<br />
<br />
i left to find somewhere easier!<br />
<br />
fun zone this tho,  worth goin with grp just to see the graphics!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Imp form was nerfed last time I checked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Imp form is nerfed.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Part of the problem with PoI is you can never be out of the path of a train. So if someone ahead of you gets in trouble, you're right in their way.<br />
<br />
Also, you have to fight your way in, so that takes time... the loot isn't that spectacular... I think PoI is the worst of the four tier 1 zones to play in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For soloing, yes PoI sucks.<br />
<br />
Get a good group on the other hand....... WOW.<br />
<br />
I blazed thru 2 levels and 3 AApoints here in seeming no time flat. <br />
A good team I have noticed is Cleric 55, Shaman(me now 57), Monk 57, Pally 60, Wizzy 55, Beastlord 58 and &lt; insert random damage dealing class here&gt;.<br />
<br />
We generally just work ZO alley area. The last time we were flat chain pulling and exp was awesome.<br />
<br />
But yes beware the trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I stay away from PoI and every month or so, someone convinces me to head back.  About every time, it goes like this...<br />
<br />
Zone in just as some numnuts is running back with a train of 2-6 mobs.  Numnuts zones, I start slowing things and eventually hit the unslowable one, which pounds me to paste nearly instantly.  SOMEday I'll remember the name of this critter and just zone out when I see it.<br />
<br />
Soloing exp is VERY good in PoN and PoI.  Probably PoJ also, pre-61, but I didn't try it till 61 and the early stuff is about all lt. blue now.<br />
<br />
I can't see this zone being worth it for soloing, not for a shaman at least.  It's built for trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Traans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the archanic model is unslowable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Archaic mobs are unslowable, Tin Soldiers are slowable, but you can't root/snare them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">POI is built for one or two good groups following the 'roads' and killing on the walk.  Unfortunately, a bad group, a group that wants to camp, or a ton of people in the zone seriously hampers the experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, since I am forced to level here, figured I might as well toss some information out there for you all.<br />
<br />
Non-factory groups:<br />
Best group of any here is the all pet group.  Mages, beastlords, shamans.  Slow is necessary in this zone, as well as a high sustainable dps.  Hence, the all pet group.<br />
<br />
Archaic models - immune to slow, snare, root, etc.  They can be stunned.<br />
<br />
Best route is to head left from the zone in, not right.  Mobs on the left do not add when pulled, ones on right do add when pulled.  Harmony will work on certain models, but not others, so that is a valid option most of the time.  The room that was mentioned above on the left side is very good experience, but the best experience grouping is in the factory.<br />
<br />
Factory groups:<br />
Must have a slower!  Mobs hit hard and furious.  Have a class that can single pull these, whether that be a monk or an adept harmonizer.  After slow cheal and a competent tank, it's all about dps.  Concentrate your group in the left hand corner, furthest from the entrance.  Have your puller pull to that empty hallways.  Either stay away from the doors once you're inside, or clear the tins.  Tin adds destroy more groups than anything else.  More than two models pulled in the factory will destroy your group most everytime.<br />
<br />
To get flagged for the factory, spawn the gnome to do his thing and take down xanamech - info can be found elsewhere.<br />
<br />
For chanters, this is a fantastic tier one zone.  Charm kiting at the entrance with these hard hitting mobs is just absolutely astounding - dangerous too.<br />
<br />
Zone is easily trainable...that's an understatement.</div></div><hr />
