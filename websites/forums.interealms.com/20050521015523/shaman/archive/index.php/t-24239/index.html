<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I noticed 'Heyokah' in my title selection. I have started epic1.5 and was wondering if this is new, or has it always been on our list. Im currently at lvl 67 with epic1.0, and I just started part 2 of epic1.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe that stems from completing epic 1.0. If i remember right one of the spirits from epic turn in call us a Heyokah upon completing the orginal epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It comes from having Epic 1.0 on your character.  IIRC you can't choose Heyokah unless you are actually carrying SOF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And the annoying think about the epic titles (Heyokah for 1.0 and Fateseer for 1.5) is that everytime you die you have to reset it since the epic &quot;isn't on you.&quot; I hope they change this because I like Fateseer but it gets old having to put it back up numerous times a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I completed epic 1.5 I do not have epic 1.0 and still have Heyokah on my title selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My epic 1.0 is banked and I can turn title on and off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fateseer?  What's an Eseer?  Doesn't really matter, though, I don't want &quot;Fat&quot; in my title regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You probably gain the Heyokah title when you do the prequel steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says, 'Very well then. First you must do what you can to prove yourself to our kind. There are some tests you must perform in order to gain our trust. At the end of this path, we may consider you one of the Heyokah -- the most trusted of those align themselves with shaman everywhere. You will be required to take on the tests of Patience, Wisdom, and Might. Bring me the Black fur Boots you receive to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Give: Black Fur Boots to Spirit Sentinel.<br />
<br />
Spirit Sentinel says 'You can now be called a heyokah, but there is much you may still do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  I'm epic-less still Khallin... and did the prequel quest, and half of 1.5 already and no Heyokah title. it's for those with their epic 1.0 and them exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Epic 1 OR 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After the 1st weeks patch after the release of OOW, you have to own OOW to have the title now too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IIRC you can't choose Heyokah unless you are actually carrying SOF.<br />
<br />
Nope, I was using the Heyokah title without having the SoF equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">speaking of titles, what did one do to get the titles 'Seer' and 'Ancient'?</div></div><hr />
