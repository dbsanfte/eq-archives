 &quot;Heh. That banner is absolutely NOT &quot;uninvasive&quot; ..  &quot;<br />
<br />
I first wondered 'what banner' - I hadn't even noticed it - so I don't understand your problem.<br />
<br />
Is the real problem that the banner irritates you, or is it that Yantis is now involved?<br />
Sunmoon tried to avoid Yantis (after many users of this forum had asked him to). No way Sunmoon could know that IGE and Yantis would team up.<br />
<br />
If that banner is all it takes to finance this extremely good shaman forum, then I can't see the problem.<br />

Or what?  You'll stop taking advantage of this free service?  Somebody's gotta pay for it and I'd rather it not be me.  If IGE wants to pay for a 468 x 60 image in the upperhand corner of the page, more power to em.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing since beta 4 (off and on) and I never heard of these people/companies till about 8 months ago (give or take). How is it you people come to know them well enough to actually HATE them? Seems odd to me.<br />
<br />
I have never noticed anything related to Yantis or IGE in game. If they are doing something then it is going right over my head.<br />
<br />
Basically I just do not give a crap. I log on and play because it is fun. Maybe if they were not doing this plat selling thing the game would be different. Might be better, might be worse. The bottom line for me is that the game is fun and I am not going to get myself all worked up over things I never noticed.<br />
<br />
And if they are involved with keeping the site up and running then god bless'em. I like this site.<br />

As long as he doesn't give up control of the site to IGE, and the only presence IGE has on the site is that miniscule banner, big deal. Get over it, move on. There are more important things to focus on.</div></div><hr />

These guys have taken advantage of plat dupes to flood the economy with plat, devaluing the plat of the rest of us.  Their plat farmers take up camps that could be used by real players, as discussed in the threads by Gardeltron.  More importantly, they have helped increase mistrust among players by encouraging the sale of characters.  The more times people run into level 65 players who do not know very basic things about their class, the more people begin to refuse grouping with strangers.  <br />
<br />
Yantis and IGE didn't create these problems, but they did find more efficient ways of taking advantage of them.  That is speeding up the process at which these problems make a noticeable difference to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">OMG how could they do this too us?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br />
   The banner is no longer visable once you read past the first post.  Find something else to complain about.  You have ruined your own lands you will not ruin mine...wait you have, someone who would complain about something as insignificant as a small banner is the type of person who drops hot coffee on their lap and then sues because they were burnt, whats worse is they win those cases!!!  does the banner really bug you that much?  Then get a piece of friggin tape and put it on your monitor and stop crying you pansies!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, I despise IGE and Yantis Enterprises.  As someone else here so eloquently noted, they've done much to wreck the Norath economy.  They maybe didn't invent plat duping; they maybe didn't invent  character selling; they maybe didn't invent  24x7 bazaar bots who corner the market on rare items and resell them for real $; they've just perfected the technique.  I would pay extra money per month for my EQ subscription if it meant they could be put out of business by SOE.  Sadly, I doubt that will happen.<br />

I don't see how you can miss something that obnoxious and glaring.  I don't like it but I will get used to it.  Since Yantis and IGE almost single-handedly destroyed the high-end economy on most servers, I've started to hate them.  Before, I didn't care, but now they have done something to make my EQ experience less enjoyable.  However, they are paying for the message board, so I am willing to look past all their glaring faults and just continue to read and post as normal.  It's just business.  Sunmoon and the readers of this site don't have to like them to acknowledge that they are indeed paying very handsomely for a small (Albeit annoying) banner.</div></div><hr />
