<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me start off by saying OMG HP.  Ok now that being said, here is the map I am using of Veksar (http://www.pbfirst.com/VeksarMap.jpg).  I went there last night with the idea of see how far I could get before I needed to rest.  I summoned Fifi(yes I summon the only female dog in the EQ Universe), buffed her up, and gave her some hammers(She seems to stun and push mobs more using them).  So the first thing I con is green, so I say to Fifi &quot;Go get it!&quot;  next thing I know her life is dropping like no tomorrow.  I slow the mob and it decides to pay me a visit.  First 2 times it hit me were in the 120's.  I say to myself &quot;Self this might be a bit different then you expected.&quot;  So I finish the mob off with a few blasts from the JBB, Delightful Orb, and a Velium strike.  It only takes about 30 Secs or so to kill that greenie bloodgill shaman.  This process continues with almost ALL light blue and green mobs. I go up the skinny ramp into the building and find myself face to face with a FUGLY looking beasty named a crusader.  Wow good thing I was at 90% life because now all of the sudden my HP drop by 671.  Nice to know a crusader is a SK.  Well 1 Quiessence later and me and Fifi are doing fine.  Very resistant , sat down and mem'd Malo.  Well this fight takes a bit longer then the others not much maybe a minute or 2.  Poisen and Disease = CRAP in this zone.  So on I go to the first of what could be Named Mobs, marked #3 on the map.  It is the PH.  He is dark blue to me.  I dispatch him and move on.  Get to #4 again a PH.  Kill and move a bit more.  Get down to to the room right before #5, PH again.  This is where I had to sit and rest a few seconds, that and my pork chops were done cooking!!  So after a quick eating break in a safe corner top left corner of the room above #5 I went back to work.  Cleared the single mob in this room known as the Bath.  Here is where it gets tricky, 5 Mobs in this room.  Spawn points are kind of like the points of a star with the PH the top right point.  I can pull the bottom 2 points of the star single pull no problem.  A rotting peasent and an commoner.  The bath is where all mobs became dark blue to a 65.  Next pull is PH#5, oh yeah spawn time seems to be about 18-20 minutes, remember if you look at the map the last 3 mobs would be where #5 is, the opposite corner and in the doorway in between them.  All of them spread out just as much as the first 2 I killed.  Some how all 3 came  :eek:  !!!  So after the nice Necro summoned my corpse and the nice cleric, who by the way were there to do that for a friend, rez'd me I decided to log on my Mage alt and help my wife level her baby cleric to 17.  So ended the Veksar Experiment.  Next time I go I will take the wife and her 58 Monk with me for faster killing/better splitting.  Although I died from a weird pull it was a fun adventure in a new zone.  I would say probably one of the more fun zones in the game.  Kinda reminded me of CoM.  Oh on a side note this is the gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139165) that I use currently.  Have a good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe sorry to hear ya had a screwy time,but i Really like the map,havent seen it before.<br />
<br />
there a site with a whole bunch like that? i dont mind the black and white,its greatly detailed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why the ODS at 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is possible to single pull that room - from memory, shrinking yourself to the max (or, more accurately, the min) will help. Pull anti-clockwise around the room to the animist - it is not necessary to clear all before pulling the PH. Personally, I don't think that it is worth doing the animist - clearing 3 or 4 mobs for a single named.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind using plenty of IVU potions, and either don't mind wasting pets/man or have AA suspended Minion level 2, you can do a cycle of 5 PH/named without needing to kill any other mobs (Mobs are 23, 24, 28, 17, 16).<br />
<br />
Probably best item that drops is the haste belt from the rotting shopkeeper, but I haven't found a way to single pull that room yet.....bah (but I am gimp)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wanted to say great map.  I wish I could find more maps like that.  I haven't soloed much in Veskar, but now I really want to take a closer look not that I can see things is such great deatil.  If you know of a place that has more of those maps please link it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, you need WAY more hp gear.  Get rid of the CC gaunts for gods sakes and the ODS that isn't doing much for you.  Get some ornate chain if you can to fill in some weaker gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, shaman are great to DUO with in veksar.  They lack good, low mana dps.  Necros do well in veksar because they can slow the undead 70% and their pets/damage spells are much better.  Best for me is when I 2box my 65 shammy/65 enchanter who has dire charm.  DC a crusader, haste and buff him with shammy dogs also and mobs drip MUCH MUCH faster.  Add in mezz/stun/c5 from the chanter and it is a cake walk.  <br />
<br />
Solo, you will have a problem keeping up with dps and you need more hps and canni 5.  You should shoot for about 3k unbuffed at 65, which is obtainable from bazaar gear or raiding NToV level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd replace both bracers and hands. You'll lose a good amount of wisdom but you have a decent sized mana pool to begin with and ya really need more hps to solo effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check the gear now, many, many upgrades later I am sitting at just under 2700 HP unbuffed.  Magelo is reporting it lower then it is in game.  I am still looking for a better cloak, shoulders and helm.  Plat isn't much of a problem.  But for another 100k or so what would you say would be the bang  for my buck?  I was thinking drape of the proud or weatherbeaten shoulderpad for my shoulders.  For back emblazoned cloak of solesk ro , and for helm a slime covered rubicite helm.  I am unguilded so a NToV raid is not really an option for me.  I hunt in BoT and got lucky on the Ornate chain pants the other night.  Killed 3 Named got ornate silk sleaves, plate guants and the chain pants patterns in the group which was NBG friends group.  I am slowly but surely upgrading as I can.  I hope to get an ornate Wrist and Helm so I may wait to buy those upgrades later.  Oh btw I do have cani 5 ; ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gear looks much better now Blud! Gratz on the legs (is jealous!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, after reading this post I decided that I needed to FINALLY visit this zone.  I'd peeked inside before but hadn't really explored -- didn't have the confidence without a cleric buddy tagging along.  Well yesterday was different : tired of raiding I decided I'd head on in a solo as deep as I could  :) .  First of all I was overjoyed at how empty the zone was for the entire evening.  A few people came and went but the zone is large enough and separated enough to not worry about someone walking over you.  I could see some train possibilities in and around the entrance -- but that's the same with any zone I suppose.<br />
     I had a simple time getting to the rooms outside of the Pool/ Hottub with just some dog-dog action and Anathema ( still don't have Bane <br />
 :( ) -- the Poison and Disease line really was pretty useless against these mobs.<br />
     The first time that I got more than a single was in the room where the Feral Lord (#5) spawns.  He wasn't up -- but I guess the mobs were just too close together for a single.  Called up some Spirt Call pets to offtank while I took down the other.  The mobs in the Pool looked to close together to single -- and it was just enough mana drain for me to think twice about doing it agian.  So I moved my way into the Golem Yard over by the Shops.  The golems were a breath of fresh air -- easier to root and they succumbed to my Poison and Disease DoTs  :cool: <br />
     I then moved into the Shops and took out the first shopkeeper -- by this time I noticed that the first golem had respawned in the golem yard so the pop time seems to be pretty quick down here ~17 mins?  So I took a lil` Shammy Med break and ploughed forward.<br />
     I quickly killed my way forward to the PHer for the Rotting Shopkeeper (#13) -- again in this room there were three mobs and I got the two nearest on my pull; luckily not the Named/PHer.  Again, dog-dogs, tanking in teh face and Anathema were my tactics.  I then moved back out killed Golems in the Yard ( and had the named pop there woot! ) and then moved my way back over to the Ballroom.<br />
     The mobs here were much more of the caster variety -- not just casting fear and the occasional boil blood -- but malosi and some dots.  Once again the aggro range was very small and it was possible to single pull everything with a little patience ( due to the wanderer ).  <br />
     I set up home-base for the rest of the night in the Ballroom and made my way back to the Stores(#13)  and through the Gollem Yard to keep killing off the PHers.  By the end of the evening (~4 hours ) I had seen (1) Rotting Shopkeeper (Kunzar Deathguard Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21544)), (2) Iksar Bohemoth (Bracelet of Lost Souls (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21574) &amp; Kunzar Ceremonial Death Shroud (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21442)), (1) Warlok Dirloz (Soulscream Bracer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21633) ), (1) Lord Sasil(Ring of the Lost Soul (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20860)), and (1) Champion Karmak (Blood Infused Stone Necklace (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21434)).<br />
     I had quite a lot of fun there and expect that I'll be back with some friends to explore a bit deeper and hopefully walk off with some nice loots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kind of funny that Bludletters' map comes from the Pine Bluff First Assembly of God web site :)<br />
<br />
.. and that is a damn nice map if I may say so</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not been able to single pull the shop, but it is easy enough to break, and i've done it several times solo and I'm not exactly the worlds most uber shaman. (3100hp self buffed, 80 aa's spent on worthless, but fun stuff like SM2)<br />
<br />
<br />
You go in the corner by the stairs, summon doggy, alpha, buff him senseless get FM etc (I have suspended minion 2 so I generally do this at the zone in) basic set up :P<br />
<br />
target mob on far side of room, cast root on him, the middle mob will charge you. slow/tank that mob.<br />
<br />
slow your rooted mob.<br />
<br />
From this point I'll epic dot the one my dogs fighting - no bane yet :-(<br />
<br />
I will then just run out into the room, agro the revanent and root him in a corner. <br />
<br />
Just slow the mobs and keep two rooted off to the side.<br />
<br />
Pet discipline did help me A LOT in making sure my pet wasn't beating up the wrong mob, but it doesn't matter really, I typically nuke the first mob down once I have everything under control then work with two mobs because I don't like having 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Edited to remove a line that added some confusion</div></div><hr />

slow your rooted mob.<br />
<br />
I can never seem to get just two of the mobs on me, so from this point I'll epic dot the one my dogs fighting - no bane yet :-(<br />

Are you saying that when you root the first mob, you get both the other 2 aggroed onto you? Ouchies!<br />
<br />
I have to say that in terms of risk versus reward and reward versus effort, for me at least, the shops are not worth it. Given the number of mobs to be killed to get the room clear, I just head elsewhere - plenty of single pullable spots to do instead. I have a semi regular duoing partner (necro) and if we get together we have a circuit taking in Golem, shops (2), highborn, duke, chef, slave, monks (2) - now that is some fun shnitz</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope :-)<br />
<br />
i root the mob on the far side of the room and only one mob rushes me, but my pet tends to push it away from me and agro the Revenant. I found that its easy enough to keep two mobs rooted, so rather than getting revenant agro when it may not be good, I just agro him and root him off to the side. <br />
<br />
If I positioned my pet before the pull this wouldn't happen, but i'm to lazy :-)</div></div><hr />
