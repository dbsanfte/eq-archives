<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple people in my guild are wanting to go do kedge and started thinking bout how our charm animal was pre-kunark, so just asking the question of all you shamans out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you had the choice between summoning an oom druid in wolfform who's lightblue to you vs. haveing charm animal back to how it was or better which would you choose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um.. Do you really have to ask?<br />
<br />
A faithful dogdog, need to cast once, and will never betray you<br />
<br />
Or Backstabbing strays, need to cast multiple times, usually bring back friends</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn it, change my vote.  I misread.<br />
<br />
Before they nerfed charm it was AWESOME.<br />
<br />
I could charm even con mobs and tear the place up.<br />
<br />
I got my spear from there (the name escapes me) by charming that rare mob that pops up front, killed all the fish at the zone in, and then ganked him for the spear.<br />
<br />
But they nerfed it, and it isn't coming back.  Oh well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am lvl 60 and I cant remember that charm animal was ever usefull for me.<br />
<br />
In the low levels I didnt have the CHA to make it usefull and now I can charm any animal in the areas where i hunt.<br />
<br />
Another useless spell in the Shaman spell book in my oppinion unless they make it work at least on light blue animals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i used it plenty till nerfed :/<br />
was great in kedge for when i was bored and soloing :)<br />
havent cast it once since nerf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;In the low levels I didnt have the CHA to make it usefull and now I can charm any animal in the areas where i hunt. &quot;<br />
<br />
I used befriend animal extensively prior to getting my dogdog. Even with my pathetic troll charisma, I could get charms that lasted for several fights. I would malise then charm greyhoppers in Marus Seru. Those little buggers hit for close to 50. <br />
<br />
Charm hopper, pull stonegrabber with affliction and med with one finger on the root button whiel the two fight it out. If you get lucky you get exp for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dunno why Charm Animal is still in my spellbook.  Since the nerf everything that is remotely as effective as my pet is too high to be charmed. <br />
<br />
I charm bunnies in EW..does that count?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">summoning an oom druid in wolfform who's lightblue to you<br />

Calling my dog a druid?  That's insulting....to my dog!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or druid in wolf form summons a pet :)<br />
<br />
Want to really confuse newbies?  Both do that, then duel.  Have a rumble with two bears and two wolves, all respond to hails as pets :)<br />
<br />
Forgot to add something relevant to the topic.  Considering that the charm line was nerfed pretty bad and wont be changing back, it doesnt really matter which is better.  I cant even charm or befriend low greens now.<br />
<br />
When charm was nerfed though our pets were significantly upgraded and are pretty dang nice now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll stick with my Wolf, even if he is the cute and fluffy kind and not the cool Scaled kind or the Evil looking pre-SoL Dire wolf kind.<br />
<br />
Wish they would go back to the solid looking wolf and not the 'ghost' wolf we have now.  Was fun parking my dog outside the LOIO WM and watch people ask it for Sow or a Port. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dunno, I like to go to WC, bearform and charm the big old kodiaks.  I like bear pets.<br />
<br />
Then I buff him up good and sick him on the druid NPCs... ahh bear invasion!<br />
<br />
But seriously I used befriend animal or whatever it was called before I got my regular pet.  It's tempting to charm some big hitting pets where you are hunting but always remember that charm will break at the worst possible moment.  Stick with puppy if you can.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jannia - A long time ago (2 and a half years?) there were no restrictions on the level of animals using any charm animal spell.  As such, people would use befriend animal and charm high level animals, like Sonic bats in Sol b, or fish in Kedge keep, and tear up the place.  <br />
<br />
Now, the level of animals are restricted, and I think befriend/charm animal only charms animals up to level 20/25, or something like that.<br />
<br />
They 'corrected' the problem, and the spell lost most of it's power, except for the levels 29-34, before you get your dog.<br />
<br />
I too, only use it to charm bunnies and bears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been known to charm kodiaks near the dervish camp in WC, then give them hos regrowth and haste.  Then, just wait patiently for someone to come up and ask me for sow.  I then go invis and the bear is turned loose on some poor sowless schmuck :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There were level restrictions on the old charm.  For example, some of the sharks in KK were charmable, but attempting to charm others would give the message &quot;this target is too high level&quot; or something. <br />
<br />
 Was still situationally useful, though, and I was bummed when they nerfed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">that's evil Jinheim! ;) Sounds like a barrel of laughs though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pre-nerf our animal charm spell DID come in handy. I never really used it in Kedge, but I used to solo in Sol B sometimes with it, even after I was able to summon a pet. I would charm a sonic bat and speed him. Made an awesome pet. Occasionally your pet would chase you out of the zone if you were lucky, or kill you if you were unlucky, but the rate at which you could solo using a charmed, speeded sonic bat made it worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cazic Thule throne room. I'd charm a gorilla and sick him on the<br />
other one. Two mobs tied up so we could clear the room. Loved<br />
it. Of course it broke at unfortunate times, but it was still cool. <br />
Sometimes I'd charm a gorilla then run around the courtyeard<br />
screaming &quot;Get it off me!&quot;. This was back in the day when <br />
people ran from a train from the throne room. <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be great to be able to charm adds today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bout the only time I use charm anymore is for RP purposes.  It is fun to charm a mammoth and take it all the way back to the tunnel to Halas and let the n00bs pet it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Charming is kinda cool as a last resort.<br />
<br />
in OT one day, my group was about to be wrecked, but i charmed one of the mobs, even though befreidn animal is pretty crap, it miraculously held and we were able to kill the 4-5 mobs on uss w/out taking any deaths.<br />
<br />
As 'standard operating procedure' its risky at best..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sitseation:<br />
<br />
Running through Oasis: See 2 or 3 groups of true newbs, rest of it is taken over by fungi tunic twinks, or plvlers..<br />
<br />
Tell the 2 or 3 groups don't attack any crocodiles or caimen with deepwater in front of it for 10 min. Charm and buff the snot out of all the DW things...<br />
<br />
Twinks and plvlers decided perhaps there were better places to power lvl that day..<br />
<br />
I actually ran a 52 cleric oom, who was trying to keep a group alive vs one of my DW crocs.. hahahah</div></div><hr />
