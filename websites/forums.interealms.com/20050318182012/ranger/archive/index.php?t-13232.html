I tried to root/shoot a larvae but uhh that didnt go too well since it was immune to changes in run speed.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

The only mobs that are rootable are the gollems and bugs upstairs, but they hit for 500 + easily and have a buttload of HP.<br />
<br />
So don't plan on soloing here unless you have a bazillion HP or you can crank some serious DPS.</div></div><hr />

Named are also unsnarable.  I just get a group though.  pretty easy xp by the castle with a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziguld</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">while PoV is better exp per mob ratio solo, HoH is garunteed solo pulls with plenty of kite room and nothing has been flagged snare/root immune.  yet.<br />
<br />
Typical 61st mob in PoV has 15000 hp typical 61st mob in HoH has 25000.  You'll get more exp per kill in PoV but you run the risk of seeing 'your target is immune to movement speed changes'.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find a golem tagged snare/root immune, but finding a good spot to kite is tricky when PoV is in primetime, mobs that are trained to zone in 'bug' when wanderering back to the glassfeilds.  You'll find yourself getting hit for triple 588 by a mob thats under the world every now and then =x</div></div><hr />

<br />
In PoV you mostly only have to worry about crystal spiders, crawlers and larvae that are immune to snare/root.</div></div><hr />
