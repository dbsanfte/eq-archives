<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kolohe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bah tried posting first time didnt work...here goes again..<br />
<br />
I found a good spot in Marus Seru(sp)...I went in to detail of what happened last time but ill be short and sweet here......unsure on lvls but 20ish-30 should work...<br />
<br />
First off shrink up times 2.<br />
<br />
Run out into zone and pull hoppers and stones...as guards will kill the light crawlers and Lion/Horse lookin things...Light crawlers have sow so be careful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depending if u have C3 or not pull 3 or 4 mobs back to zone....As ur runnin through hall where guards are... U will see two more guards, guarding stairs.. Off to the left and right there is a mini ledge that is just big enuff for u to fit on. Run and get on that ledge.  The mobs will stop dead in their tracks when u step on that ledge. You may have to step off and get back on a few times to get em positioned just right..But hell this is to easy xp to fly through 20's.<br />
<br />
The ledge u step on is all the way against the far right and left wall.. So u can use either....Then just dot away..I helped a 20ish shaman for bout 30 min explaining him the procedure i had just found out, and he lvled two lvls in that time period..Some of the mobs were yellow to him he said while others were DB..<br />
<br />
Never the less I hope this helps u guys out some ...if u have any questions about the procedure post here. I will try and explain more...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a word of caution - pulling to places where you can damage mobs and they can't get to you is considered an exploit, you can get warned or banned for using pathing bugs that way.   Hadn't heard of the spot you describe before, so you'd probably have a low chance of getting caught, but if a GM happens to notice what you're doing you could be banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xolem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have read through this post a few times already, and have even tried to apply it in Marus. I am just confused as to which gaurd housing you are talking about. I went to the one from Netherbian Lair, and the one on the south wall. Neither seemed to work. So if you could tell me which zone it is by and a little more info on the ledge I would greatly appreciate it. = )<br />
