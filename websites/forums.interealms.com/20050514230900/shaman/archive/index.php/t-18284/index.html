<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some have said our community lacks cohesion and I got to thinking why that might be. I suggest it is caused by the varied nature of our class.<br />
<br />
In your opinion, what is a shaman?<br />
<br />
I think I am going to take some heat for my opinion but here goes.<br />
<br />
Simply put I am a support class. <br />
I like being a jack-of-all-trades. <br />
I like buffing people.<br />
I like taking care of my group however they need.<br />
I like keeping a cool head and &quot;fixing&quot; problems when they occur using the many tools I am given.<br />
I slow.<br />
I malos.<br />
I don't add much damage to a grind. I dot or nuke on occasion.<br />
I aid with backup heals but rarely main heal.<br />
I don't raid much.<br />
<br />
I feel I represent the average player. Not in skill but in style. I bring it up because I hear some vocal people here talking about how they don't want a new buff because they fear being a &quot;buff bitch&quot;. In your eyes I AM that buff bitch but I don't think you represent what most of us are. I checked his Magelo (sorry I forgot your name) and he is an uber among ubers. You represent such a small minority IMHO yet I feel it is the Time capable player that SoE is always trying to please. I think I should be their target. Trouble is that you often never hear from us. Admitting you like to buff or act strictly in a support role is not cool here. I have often kept my opinion to myself for that exact reason. It's too bad too because I may have advice of value to the &quot;average shaman&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway I think this is me saying I am out of the closet. I am not uber and that is OK. I am a really good player and I enjoy this game. Most people are happy to have me around. I am starting to sound like Stuart Smalley now so I better stop :)<br />
<br />
Please tell me how you play. If you like to buff and like to support others quietly, say it. And if you hate this aspect of our class tell me why you stayed. What was it that kept you leveling this class while enduring the hell of buff requests?<br />
<br />
I am not trying to start a fight. I really want to talk about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I save the day more than any other player in my group. I can save it in so many different ways that I sometimes forget them. The shaman is the swiss army knife of EQ and will save a groups ass more than anyone else. That is why I would never play another as my main.<br />
We rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm our shaman is our monk's buff bitch :)<br />
<br />
Oh and she slows...  and back-up heals...  and back-up hastes...  and Dot's when she can...  and chain JBBs when mob almost dead...  and summons her little pet...  and back-up crowd controls, and shrinks all the party members cause they like it.<br />
<br />
I think she likes the versatility, and the fact that she does most of them rather well.  <br />
<br />
Having played a druid to 44, and seen a shaman to 55, both are versatile, but the shaman is more interesting/powerful/versatile of the two :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot count the times when things were getting bad and then when it all settles down there I am sitting in the corner with three things rooted, rotting, and THATS when the group realizes thier ass was just saved by the shaman.<br />
<br />
OR, when your watching the main tanks health dropping like a rock and in group you see the words &quot;____ is SLOWED!&quot; and you know that the group is safe for at least one more fight.<br />
<br />
OR, ...<br />
<br />
OR, ...<br />
<br />
OR, ...<br />
<br />
No other class with the exception of the enchanter has the potential of saving a groups collective ass.... To me I love being a shaman, we don't do but one thing better then everyone else but we can do almost ALL things ok.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play a shaman because my permagroup started playing again, and we already had a cleric, chanter, bard, and SK. So, my options were basically:<br />
<br />
Necro/Wiz/Mage: I'm not fond of playing robe wearers, too much ass to concrete time for me, or at least very noticeable atc time.<br />
<br />
Rogue/Monk: I've played both to decent levels, and the one-dimensionalness wore on me, although I've since started a rogue to two box with.<br />
<br />
Beastlord: Blech.<br />
<br />
Shaman: I've played several to the low teens - mid twenties, I like the class, and wanted to see what happened after the late twenties to late thirties blahs. In hindsight given the group make-up a beastlord probably would've been a better choice for the added DPS, which tends to be our shortcoming.<br />
<br />
I don't mind buffing, we usually do LDON so I just buff while we're getting the adventure, and then rebuff the 'important' ones near the end depending on how we're doing on time/mana. I don't have to haste since we have a chanter, so the most annoying buff we have duration wise I only cast while soloing.<br />
<br />
While hunting I slow, malx if needed, nuke if I have some extra mana, toss regen around, cure as soon as I see a 'soandso looks sick/is poisoned/hears barking/looks drowsy' message, heal when the fecal matter hits the spinning bladed machine or the cleric gets a little low on mana and needs some quality atc time. I like being a swiss army knife type and being able to save the day if something really really goes wrong. Its the main thing I missed when playing a class that can't heal or root (rogue/monk) coming from a paladin background - little or no way to affect the outcome of a bad situation besides keep pounding on the current target. Shaman have bucu ways to affect the outcome, I like that.<br />
<br />
I'll never raid with this character, and probably will never raid again, raiding was probably the single most boring and frustrating thing I've ever done in EQ, ranking right up there with making metal bits. Have some great memories of raids from pre-Kunark, all the raids I did after coming back mid-Luclin were not pleasant at all. 40-48 people was one thing, 72? No thanks. If we do manage to get to 60+ before a true EQ replacement comes out I doubt we'll set foot inside any of the 'planes' (PoP planes that is). So my shaman experience and point of view is pretty closely aligned with the original posters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i play a shaman because we can slow time itself.<br />
<br />
ok, i got that out of the way.  but my real response won't make much more sense.<br />
<br />
i play the 'tank em in da face', wear a haste item (living for the day i get a Cord of Ben'wa haste augment), mashing the canni key non stop, less than full group, where i get to set the pulling pace (which is not to shabby), looking for constant gear upgrades, using the equiped pet as a buff timer, making other classes think i am god and indispensable.  (i lie a lot in guild chat too)<br />
<br />
it deeply upsets me that when i started (pre-kunak) a shaman was expected to add to DPS, and now some sit in the back with the healing druids after they have done their job of slow.<br />
<br />
i want a melee upgrade.  i know the only item in the game that gives us a + modifier to 1blunt is already on a 1blunt weapon, and it pisses me off.  i already have the only item that i can find, that gives us a + modifier to piercing, and it is not worth much.  i have my 2b, 1b and pierce all at 200.  i saved for the delightfull orb of forgotten magic just for the proc.<br />
<br />
i actually am dumb enough to think that a bit of a melee upgrade would make us a bit more useful in LDoN.<br />
<br />
if i have to get in melee range to land a spell, you can bet i am going to have the attack on.<br />
<br />
i got natural durability 3, before saving for mental clarity.<br />
<br />
i hate horses, i hate monks, and i hate people that have not played a shaman post 50 telling me how to play.  (i just dislike those at 65 who tell me how to play)  a horse won't let me melee, a monk wants to set the pace by chain pulling, and people telling me how i should play don't realize i play a game for fun.  but i love bear form.<br />
<br />
i buy pet weapons.  i buy gear.  i buy KEI, but normally skip virtue.<br />
<br />
i read.  i read this board, i read Allakhazams, Castersrealm, Everlore (waste), Gaffes, sometimes the safe house, Lucy.  i don't read Fires of Heaven, because i am just not uber enough.  i know what gear i want next, and i more than volunteer to help my buddies get theirs.<br />
<br />
i think plat dupers should be killed IRL; that people running scripts for plat should be banned by IP address, credit card number and genetic code.<br />
<br />
I don't have my eqic because my guild is not strong or large enough for Hate.  and even tho i MQ'ed the bark, i think my happiest moment in EQ was when i got the totemic BP well over 2 years ago on Vallon Zek.  (ok, the Regal Band of Bathezid i got yesterday on Prexus comes close)<br />
<br />
i hate alchemy.  why should i have a skill when i can normally buy the potions in the bazaar from someone who is trying to skill up, and sells them for prices at or below cost? (and after playing a shaman on Vallon, Sullon and now Prexus, working on it again would require more medication than i usually like to take)<br />
<br />
i hate druids.  ok, mostly i just hate quad kiters in general; but i hate druids more.  aside from ports and succor across Siren's Grotto i have found no use for them.  usually they just track down the mob i have been looking for for over an hour and /ooc about the great item they just found.<br />
<br />
i guess that about covers how i play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like being a shaman to have choices of how to fight and play this game.<br />
<br />
If I want to group... I can.<br />
<br />
If I want to solo... I can.<br />
<br />
If I want to root and rot... I can<br />
<br />
If I want to tank something IN DAH FACE!... i can<br />
<br />
If I want to sit back and let my pet chew up a mob.. I can. <br />
<br />
If my group doesn't have a healer... I can.<br />
<br />
If my group doesn't have a utility class... I can.<br />
<br />
If I want to Nuke-a-Duke.... I can.<br />
<br />
I am not the little engine that thinks it can... <br />
<br />
I know I can.<br />
<br />
<br />
For that choice I pay the price of not being nearly the best at many of the above, but it does allow me to dictate my own time. Thats why shaman are &quot;the win&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

I tryed douing my shaman and ranger together, and with my druid at 57 he couldn't kill half the stuff dou that my shaman at 51 could kill solo. I can kill anything I can slow and heal faster than it hits for. I can handle bad pulls because I can take a beating, and i can get mana when I need it, without attaching my ass to the floor. I can buff well enough that i don't need virtue, can canni fast enough that I don't need kei, and do enough dps to make the grunt work seem trivial.<br />
 I'm independent and to me that makes all the difference in the world. I don't need support, I am the support. Me and dog dog make my own group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is my view on the Shaman.<br />
<br />
We are not the best at anything (Slowing semantics aside), but we are very good at a lot of things.  However, though we can perform many different things, we can't do them ALL at the same time, so it seems we get out-shined by the specialists.<br />
<br />
This is a common error, and one thankfully many people see through.<br />
<br />
The Shaman is not the hero.  We do not swing the sword that fells the dragon.  We do not throw the spell that takes down a legion.  We do not cast the heal that saves the lives. <br />
<br />
No, Shaman are not heroes.  We are more then that.  Shaman make everyone ELSE into heroes.<br />
<br />
While everyone else shines in the spotlight, we are in the back, keeping everything together.  It is not just the warriors strength that wins the battle, it is our strength with the warrior.  It is not the wisdom of the cleric that saves the day.  It is our wisdom with the clerics.  And it is not the magic of the wizard that turns the tides of battles - It is our magic, with the wizards.<br />
<br />
I, for one, am proud to be a Shaman.   We may not be the best at any one thing, but we are the keystones which hold everyone together and strengthen, be it a partner, a group, or an army.<br />
<br />
Once again.  We are not heroes, and we never will be.  We are better then heroes.  We are Shaman.<br />

I think that says it all. When a grp gets 2 or 3 adds and your the one spinning around rooting, slowing, healing, dotting it is great. Sometimes it's like time is stopped and you're in total control. You have control over the group and all the mobs. It stinks though when it's all over and no one realizes you saved the day. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

I have played almost all classes, many of them past 55, and the one that I always want to play is da shammy. I can turn a wizard into a somewhat adequate tank with buffs and slows if absolutely necessary. I can turn a melee into a blender.

<br />
On normal missions at 65 you should be ripping thru mobs not treating them as a camp pull.  ;)   Last group I was in the Bard got pissed because we told him to back off on single pulls, screw the mezzes and get fighting.  He went into  a pout and stayed there till I ripped him a new one for being a ********.   When you have high end beast, wizard, cleric, necro, bard and shaman...adds mean just reduced time in dungeon.  ;)   If you are in a group that cannot handle 3 at once you should perhaps go back to crushbone to learn about multi pulls..<br />
<br />
In hard, Pacify is nice and I will not argue its use there but not normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The need for slow is integral to the design of EQ encounters, and Shaman are the rulers of slow. Slow lowers a melee mob's offensive capabilites by a factor of god knows how many levels. Just about anyone who's played this game for 50 levels with any class can /ass target and mash the slow button. <br />
<br />
A great shammie on the other hand allows the group to ramp up the overall difficulty of a given encounter to what it would have been without slow in the first place.  In other words the party will be able to pull enough incoming mob DPS to greatly surpass that of the original &quot;shamanless&quot; group which translated means WAY more xp/ time.<br />
<br />
In LDoN:<br />
<br />
- played as mindless slow bots they allow a group to play casually with little to no fear. Or- to play &quot;normally&quot; without a dedicated healer.<br />
<br />
- played really well (in combination with other classes played well) shaman facilitate massive ownage of adventures.<br />
<br />
- And then there's hard missions which aren't even practically feasible without a shammie and a bard. (sure it's doable but certainly not in a standard pickup group)  Even a great shammie isn't gonna allow a group to defeat 6 &quot;900's hitting&quot; mobs at once without a _damn good_ group.<br />

Speaking as a non-shaman (65 clr is my main) I can honestly say I've met very few bad players who are shaman. I don't know if the class demands skill (weeds out the bad players) or molds good players by virtue of it's role in the group. I'm always asking myself as I two box my monk and cleric why I don't just level a shammy and save myself some agony. Anyway just wanted to chime in, and no there is no point to my rambling.</div></div><hr />

I usually scream NO! It's usually someone I've not grouped with before who does it. On the otherhand if I scream EVAC then you know we are in a world of pain.</div></div><hr />

Bonestompers &quot;in da face!&quot; post is classic :)<br />

I originally chose a shaman because I thought it would be a melee caster. And it was at the early levels. Mind you this was about 4 years ago and it was all new at the time. I do get &quot;in da face&quot; when soloing I spose.<br />

I think the comments about being the glue or maybe the grease to the machine really nail us. The comment about our delusions of grandeur existing simply because it is the class we play is a little off in the sense that I have been saved less by the classes mentioned than I have a shaman.</div></div><hr />
