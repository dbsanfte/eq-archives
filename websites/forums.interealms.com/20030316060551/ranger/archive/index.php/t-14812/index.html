<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yendor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 12 ranger with 2 days played, I have been playing since October and know how to play my class and I know everything there is about rangers and the high end game and the low end game and all the game in between and even some Half-Life Counterstrike which is not this game but I need to establish my uberness because uberness translates into credability!<br />
<br />
My opinion is that ranger do too much melee damage.  I can outdamage a level 3 rogue equipped with fine steel daggers.  This is unbalancing and a slap in the face to warriors!  Dual wield is a broken skill and needs to be fixed because two weapons are obviously twice as good as one weapon.  I propose that Verant fix this by taking dual wield away from rangers and giving us a new line of Fire/Cold resist spells.  Or they could maybe balance out the damage we do with dual wield by giving our offhand an innate snare proc, because we don't have enough things that proc snare anyway and that spell is uber I just got it 3 levels ago.<br />
<br />
Also, archery damage is too much and we can shoot arrows way too far.  This gives us manaless, aggroless damage.  Plus, in like 39 levels I will get to do double damage on non-rooted non-moving mobs with my Hunting Bow.  This is clearly unbalancing, because we outdamage rogues and wizards and the skill is broken and rangers are broken and we need to be fixed, so Verant should make it so archery is only useful from behind the mob and you have to type in &quot;fire an arrow&quot; every time you want to shoot an arrow and your bow should have a 15% chance of breaking every shot.<br />
<br />
Rangers can track too much too... I can see like every mob around me, and that is a slap in the face to radar installations everywhere.  Ranger track should be fixed by only showing green con mobs that begin with the letter Q.  Either that, or ranger track should cause mass amounts of aggro and every mob on your track list should start attacking you because that would be fair and I'm level 12 and I know what I'm talking about.  Druid track and bard track should not be worse than ranger track because it's all the same thing and we get AA points way too easily.<br />
<br />
It's also unbalancing that rangers can solo with Panic Animal, it's a slap in the face to animals and a horribly broken skill.  We should not be able to fearkite as well as necros or shadowknights.  Verant should fix this by removing Panic Animal and lowering our defense cap by 100, because we gave up plate armor, defensive capabilities, and pride to be able to cast spells and wear phallic helmets.<br />
<br />
I also feel we have way too many hit points compared to wizards because wizards are the masters of magical damage and we can absorb too much of their damage and we should die instantly from their spells so I propose that Verant fix this unbalancing, broken attribute by reducing our hit points by 50% and taking away Archery Mastery 1, 2, and 3 and giving us a &quot;Double Kick&quot; AA ability.  And self-ports and pets.<br />

I understand that you are being sarcastic, but it's not funny because I've actualy met people who think rangers need to be nerfed for those reasons mentioned above (well, using more realistic values anyways.)</div></div><hr />

So true<br />

Vic, there will always be people ignorant to our class as we are ignorant of other classes.  I say to everyone just relax and play the game.  Have fun, remember IT'S A GAME.  Oh and did I mention IT'S A GAME.</div></div><hr />

Erlanthir - Perhaps you should have read the whole thing and the point he was trying to make before you immediately clicked on the respond button, no?<br />
<br />
Yendor makes an excellent point.  The current number of whines and rants makes me not even want to visit here anymore.  And it is not worth posting on 90% of the threads I do read.</div></div><hr />
