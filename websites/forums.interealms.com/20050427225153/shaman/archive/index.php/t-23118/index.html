<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm PL'ing a necro future 2boxer. I see that Kaesora is a new hotspot does anyone know if the exp here is that great? I am not a fan of indoor zones to pl, outside my necro can sit on a horse and so can I. If the exp is right though I can deal with it.<br />
I'll probably try it out tonight and report back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kaesora was great exp even before becoming a hotspot.  Just no one ever went there even with the added exp, but now that it's been named a hotspot, you COULD see more then 1 person in the zone now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PL a Necro?!?!  They pretty much PL themselves right? :D<br />
<br />
Ado</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked it out, if you invis pass the spiders and kill the undead stuff it isn't too bad. The adds weren't too bad... but they would pile up if you aren't carefull. The exp is good, I didn't think it was omg check this out! I would rather exp in a outside zone were I can sit on the mount all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Went there last night. It was a ghost town. Only other person there was a 55 necro.<br />
<br />
I swear, I wish people would step off the beaten &quot;fast track&quot; path once in a while. There is a ton of great content out there that most don't even go looking for anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good zone.<br />
<br />
Spent many hours here getting a shield years ago. Experience was good then and if its a hot-spot it should be very nice for ppl of the right level.<br />
<br />
2 things: 1) will eventually ruin Overthere faction (not a big hit but it can add up) 2) think of how you are getting out before you leap in :)</div></div><hr />
