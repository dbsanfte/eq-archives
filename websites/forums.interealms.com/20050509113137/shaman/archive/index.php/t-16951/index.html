<br />
I just made my first Shammy a few days ago and love playing this Character. I was wandering what would be my bet bet as far as gear goes. iam currently lvl 8 and was lucky enough to score a chill spine spear or something like that but thats basiclly all the good gear i got . Any suggestions on what to keep an eye out for or maybe where i can hunt for maximum $ and exp?<br />
Any info will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

ANYTHING with +'s to hit points.  If it doesnt have that..dont use it.  If you're on sullon zek like it seems..you also want as much for resists as you can get (magic being the most important i think--snare, root, mez, druid DOTs, chanter spells in general, cleric spells in general, paladin spells in general).<br />
<br />
Also, DONT use purely wisdom gear...EVER.  If you start to think to yourself &quot;wow i have a lot of wisdom, i'd make a good druid&quot;...yeah, that means you need to ditch the druman gear.<br />
<br />
Finally, up to the lower 50s you'll want a decent amount of AC as things you're fighting will hit you much less, and you're more likely to be tanking what you fight (49+ pets make nice tanks really).</div></div><hr />
