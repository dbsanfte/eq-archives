<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pronigious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been seeing a lot of post about what Alchemy needs... I think they are all steps in the right direction... but the problem is they are still kinda based on a few problems... a lot of these problems are seen in many of the tradeskills.  Cost vs. utility, skill ups reducing prices of the potions, availability of components, or stuff that is generally better used more easily obtained.  Alchemy would be fun to use to make money...   but honestly, sow potions make enough money, I'd rather it just be more useful.<br />
<br />
My idea is truly a complete overhaul.<br />
<br />
First, lower the level at which you can begin alchemy to level 19.  Keep it level capped, this is important... because we REALLY don't want people making Shaman mules just to flood the market with potions.  Make sell backs to vendors very bad buy back price.  It's far better that we gain skill while we USE the potions.  It should be a money making vendor.  Make a total of 8 herbs.  starting in price at 5sp, and going up to 15pp.  For the purposes of this concept, I'll call them Herbs A - H.  In addition to these vendor bought components, there will be some dropped, foraged (with possibly a new skill, I like that idea), ground spawn ONLY herbs.<br />
<br />
The other big idea with this is that the trivials for this skill should work like Rogues lockpick skill.  That is, you can only gain skill from trivial potions, and you can only sucessfully make trivial potions.  This coupled with the relevtive cost of the potions as you level will make them supplement your spell book rather than replace it.  Basically, the skill will grow with you.  Instead of 40 some herbs you need to buy when you want to use them, only needing 8, and carrying them with you at all times, allows you (albeit at a cost to some bag space) you create them as need while xping, raiding... on the fly.  This skill would be trainable at your guild up to level 20 (by level 22) and after that would have to be skilled manually.  Some potions, for balance reasons wouldn't be able to be made into 10-doses, and some potions would be lore.  I've taken a few ideas from many of the posts I read, so, please don't be offended. I didn't name any of these, and assume cost of potion goes up as trivial increases, a la Jewlery Craft.  Utility potions and potions that heal would have higher cost associated. <br />

This is just a starting place really... I didn't think that the skill should start any lower than 19th level, maybe a cap of 6(level -18)  would work better, you'd max out earlier though... dunno how that would balance some of the effects.  My target was for the most expensive potion (75% rez) to cost ~45plat, teleport potions to cost ~20plat, ect.  That's at cost... so that way we COULD make money.  the stat potions ect wouldn't cost as much money to make, they would be cheap, we'd skill up on them cause we would give em out to our group members to compliment our buffs.<br />

What do you think?<br />
