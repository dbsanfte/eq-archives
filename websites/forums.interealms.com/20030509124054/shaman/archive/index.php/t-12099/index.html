<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering how do you raise your specialization to 200 at level 65. I started my specialization at 65 and when I put 1 point into each, it goes to skill 65 and not 1. And since they're all at 65 it won't raise. Any solutions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have more than one specialization skill at &gt; 50 you should log a /bug.  <br />
<br />
If you train a skill such a specialization, dodge, parry, etc for the first time from a guild trainer, you get it at the level you trained it at as sort of a head start.  Most people train their specs upon dinging 30 and hence have all the skills at 30.  First one to raise above 50 then can go to 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tyenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok i started my specialization late, which is like now at level 65. I trained 1 point to each and all the specialization is at skill 65 cause of my level. How can I get them to start at 1 if I'm level 65? Now that they're all above 65, they won't rise. Any help?</div></div><hr />

That's like the druid who never put a point into Channeling until lvl 50.  Cuz he didn't know about it . .<br />
<br />
Wow, I am not too surprised there's a bug with this since I'm sure Sony never believed anyone would make that mistake . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've actually had this happen to me also. Didn't go to train the specialization til later in the game. Honestly, didn't know Wis casters even got the skill *enjoys another slice of crow*<br />
<br />
Right now, Alteration is 51 for me, but all the other skills are at 60...Not sure if just resetting them and retraining them will help. As noted above, the person just trained them, and they all came out at 65. Wondering if just training one skill, and letting it max out, then training the remaining skills will work. /shrug It's worth the plat and a ruby for me to find out atleast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Had this happen to a friend of mine who wanted to change his spec at 56...he ended up /petitioning and they reset em all to 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi gang, long time lurker, first time poster. I felt compelled to reply in this thread as I am the freind to whom Fenora was referring.<br />
<br />
   Heres what happened, I had originally trained spec alt and spec conj at lvl 30, figuring as a solo type shaman I would be Dotting lots,and wanted to save mana on the dmg output. I figured my play style would decide whitch would reach 51+ first and promptly forgot about the whole specialization thing and went about leveling myself. <br />
<br />
   Fast forward to level 56 and I beging to look into my aa skills. SCM looks very appealing, so on a whim  I look at my specialized casting skills only to see they are both tied at 50. Certainly explains the fizzle rate on my canna dance. I promptly hie my happpy ass to the Temple of Solusek Ro , turn in the ruby and 50 gp to Ostorm and reset my specs to 49. (spec conj / spec alt ) Spend 5 rl hours chain casting canna /stoicism/ regrow and get no improvements. A freind suggested i see my guildmaster and spend some points. I go to halas and drop 35 points training, when I log off that night I am spec alt 81 (go me) and spec conj 49, rest of the specializations say 30. <br />
<br />
     All is right in my world at this point, so I camp. Log on the next day to go enjoy the fruits of my labors and imagine my horror when I see all specs are at 56!! except spec alt, spec conj, those are both 49.again. I petitioned , and Emailed the server GM to see what could be done, a few hours later a GM arrives, informs me the only option available is to have him reset all my specs to 49, and for me to sit and chain spamm alteration school spells. All I could think was  &quot; Great 5 more hours of spamm to hit 51 to lock my specialization &quot;.  It was a very pleasant surprise indeed to see it rise by leaps and bounds after  the GM reset me. In 2 hours I had hit spec alt 101, moved much better this time than the last. Currently its still not maxxed out, but it is 192, and a noticeable difference in my fizzle rate.<br />
<br />
  Hope it works out for you Tyenn. <br />

Sort of like how they did it for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />
