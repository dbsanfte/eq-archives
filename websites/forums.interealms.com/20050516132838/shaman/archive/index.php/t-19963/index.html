I have seen a necro soloing in HoH. I cannot.<br />
<br />
I have seen a magician soloing in BoT. I cannot.<br />
<br />
I have seen a chanter soloing in BoT. I cannot.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if I waste a zillion points in LDoN equipment upgrades I would solo yard trash in a Tier 3 PoP zone. I have all my PoP spells but my equipment suxx because I am in a very small guild.<br />
<br />
Edited: The awful truth is that I can solo mobs in HoH. Yes! I can solo wrulon younglins. Yes! I can solo a light blue mob that cannot summon me or cannot mitigate my slows.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm come on..<br />
With malos and root you can dot down the armours in HoH easy.. You just need a fast horsie or the AA ability VP...<br />
<br />
Pull the guards with malos.. You always get 2 of them.. root one.. zone out to clear aggro.. The rooted one should still be rooted and stand there solo when you zone back in.<br />
<br />
Reapply root.. Malicous Decay it if you using VP to be sure VP lands if root breaks..<br />
<br />
Dot away and keep it rooted..<br />
<br />
5% aa per kill..<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What are you doing, trying to TANK IN TEH FACE !@!! ?<br />
<br />
This is a example of the argument i make all the time which is that while we do need upgrades, i think some people just dont know how to use the tools available to them. Its nothing to be ashamed of, im not dogging anyone about it, but i think its a very real fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
In BoT i solo storm riders like they are little girls. Horse helps alot with KEI, but neither are required for this task. I can solo giants downstairs too, my only problem is pulling singles and you really have to be good and know when to cast VP so they dont gate and also be lucky.<br />
<br />
HoH. I dont know what to tell you. There is a zone right there. Worst case scenario, mallos 1 and pull to GY then root it, run to zone, invis and come back in, it will be single. You can split almost the whole zone in area in that manner if needed.<br />
<br />
Plane of tactics. The entrance area to the area and around the arena can all be soloed. Down in the arena we can solo also. Beyond the arena in the pig pen area we can solo. No horse needed, no horse usable.<br />
<br />
Plane of Fire. I havent done this yea, but from what im hear around here its not impossible to make nice EXP there.<br />
<br />
So really, i know its easy to get frustrated and ive been there, for other things. But your eally need to bring yourself to another level and sprinkle a dash a danger and try some things before you resign yourself to not being able to do it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plane of Fire mobs I can solo in 15 minutes each, at the tables, so it's not really worth it to me at all.  People with LDON dots, though, can cut that down to 5 minutes, they say, so get first off, get your LDON dots if you don't have them(I don't).  They don't break root, which is pretty critical.<br />
<br />
Soloing without those DOTs is just going to be hard, period.<br />
<br />
Litgruv mentioned tactics.  I used to pretty much live in the pigpen area.  Diaku oracles will own you.  They can debuff you, are hard to debuff and slow themselves, even with malosinia on, can debuff the slows and roots off themselves, root you, attack you with spells from a seemingly unlimited mana pool as well as melee...they're just a nightmare.  The problem is these guys can resist so much on the one hand, and then debuff you and un-debuff themselves.  You get the worst of it both ways, in a confined space.  Plus, in the pigpen area there is a roamer that walks through.  Kill him and he will with pretty reasonable frequency spawn an oracle.  You can also get the wraiths as roamers or room pops, and they can snare you and debuff you and resist slow too.  Pretty hard to fight when you're snared and dotted and debuffed.  <br />
<br />
They also changed the aggro there.  Now, the mob near the pigpen corner will usually add in to your arena pulls.  Never did that for the huge amount of time I used to spend there; does it like crazy now.  <br />
<br />
If everything works out perfectly there, you can, say, solo the piggies and some other mobs down there.  But it's not really worth the hassle  as a solo artist.  Not unless you're purely loot camping the piglet event.  It's very nice experience and lots of fast, fun action with a group though, and you have a good chance of spawning some nameds and getting multiple piglet drops over the course of a few hours.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping solo experience is really worthwhile again myself once I get my LDON dots.  It's pretty much worthless for me now.  Group experience is just much better these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The lower crypts are really simple to solo in HoH as well, all single pulls. Just watch for see-invis on the way down. The hero shrine areas are also fairly easy to get single pulls. Not sure if your problem is getting singles, but that mught help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What your point ? it's not a solo mmorpg......cleric can't solo etheir in bot....but we can . BOT can be annoying for multiple reason but HOH is pretty easy. In fact hoh is probably the easiest plane to solo in pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can't solo in HoH then you have a problem, and it isn't that you are a shaman.  I can solo there just fine.  I can also solo just fine in BoT, although it does take decent gear to kill the summoning mobs (I was doing it before I was even EP flagged, so you don't need great) gear.  Tactics you can solo easy, and ditto PoFire.  As for it taking 15 minutes to solo one mob in PoFire... that's too long.  Before ldon came out, it took me 9 minutes to kill a doomfire.  After Bane, I can do it in 4-5 minutes each with 1 minute of med time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Never tried soloing BOT, due to the fact that I hate the crowds in that zone with a passion, but I have no problem in HOH or Tactics soloing non-summoning mobs.  Soloing summoners is more iffy but hardly impossible.<br />
<br />
OTOH I get better XP soloing in PoV just because I can kill faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ulfwall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a perfect spot in HoH for root rotting solo. On the way to Rydda trial you pass 4 small temples (2 on each side of the path), 3 of which are guarded by a pair of wrulons and the 4th by a pair of black armor suits. These can all be single pulled. To get started, standi in the middle of the path, just root one in place, debuff and dot. Move in closer so you don't aggro any wanderers. Once the first cat is dead you are golden and can proceed killing the 8 spawns in a circular manner.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure if you know this either, Shaman are one of the only classes where you can keep the mob rooted when you solo(necros maybe, but they wouldnt be as efficient as us).   Which mean you can solo just about anywhere and no agro other mobs.  Although in BoT, each direction has the mobs with different resist checks to either disease, or poison, so you dont see too many shaman solo there.  I have soloed many times, and the only thing that slows me down, is that it can get VERY boring after a while.   And best place , i think, is in PoV.  you gain 6% aa each kill, and its not heavily camped anymore.</div></div><hr />

End-game mages are one of the worst soloing classes in the game.  This is the one zone in PoP with summoned mobs that level 65 mages can charm.  Mages simply can't solo - they lack the defensive tools of slow, snare, heal, or root.  They have almost no defense at all - only their pet, which lasts about 15 seconds against an unslowed PoP mob.  Their pet heals aren't effective or fast enough to keep up with even yard-tash DPS.<br />
<br />
Prior to PoP big-hitting mobs, and prior to the pet canni nerf, they were fair soloers.  Now they're inept.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've had lots of success soloing tactics recently. You'll want the following at a minimum:<br />
<br />
BoS<br />
BoU<br />
VP3<br />
Malo/Malos<br />
Torpor/Quissence<br />
<br />
Added bonus:<br />
Epic, clicky root (e.g. ornate pants), BA IV, EA IV, AE IV, Bane<br />
<br />
I don't have the foci effects or bane, but typically will get BA IV from the tribute system. Epic just adds a bit more mana-free dps, and clicky root is great if you get an add so can't use VP, or for the wraiths &amp; oracles that like to dispell VP, but if you don't have it then just mem your favourite root spell instead.<br />
<br />
Litgruv mentioned tactics. I used to pretty much live in the pigpen area. Diaku oracles will own you.<br />
<br />
I've never had major problems with oracles. Sure they cast, debuff themselves and so forth, but its not a massive deal. Root and slow, reapply as necessary. Chances of em debuffing both at once is fairly low it seems (never happened to me), at worst I get hit a couple of rounds or so.<br />
<br />
You can also get the wraiths as roamers or room pops, and they can snare you and debuff you and resist slow too. Pretty hard to fight when you're snared and dotted and debuffed. <br />
<br />
These guys are a bit of a pain, but so long as I keep the good buffs protected its not that bad. Worst case is it roots you and starts beating at ya. For that reason, I tend to use normal root on these and save VP just in case I get rooted and don't have radiant cure up. On the plus side they like casting spells at you, which is generally better than getting thumped for 500/hit, and they're not all that common.<br />
<br />
They also changed the aggro there. Now, the mob near the pigpen corner will usually add in to your arena pulls. Never did that for the huge amount of time I used to spend there; does it like crazy now.<br />
<br />
If you pull to the near-right corner as you enter the room before the pig pens, you won't aggro anything else there except the roamer mob, which is easily timed. I've found I can just leave the 2 corner spawns and the roamer that comes right to the pig-pen entrance, although generally I prefer to kill them anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm not uber by any means - not flagged for anything beyond Tactics, about 2k6 unbuffed hp, no focus items - but I do have clicky pants which helps. I generally died a few times each evening the first few couple times but I think I got it sussed now and its normally ok to run to zoneout (unless you get snared/rooted or zone is busy so you can't train - in which case chances are a cleric is nearby anyway)<br />
<br />
Give it a try, its good fun! XP is ok (not great, they take a while to kill and net about 5% AA so group xp is better) but the loot makes up for it. I've yet to get some ornate drops, but living in hope of some soon, and piglet has given me a couple drops that sell quite nicely, plus you're guaranteed to see some SPs if you stay there long.</div></div><hr />
