<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started up EQ about 20 minutes ago (8:30 AM EST) and had to run the patcher. It started with 1hour 15 min time remaining. I was very shocked by the size so I looked at the EQ site and other and can't find anything on a patch today. Has anyone else had this today? <br />
<br />
I tried my other computer with a different account and it didn't get it but then it doesn't have LoY or LDoN. So far all the files are either .s3d files. I'm not sure what those are. I imagine they are graphics.</div></div><hr />

You weren't messing around on Test Server were you?  Every time I go from regular EQ to Test and then back, it reinstalls files.  Other than that I'm sure it would have been announced if they were doing something....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If there is a patch it is a stealth one - my bazaar mule has been up since I went to bed last night (saving for torpor - 25k on my server :( ) and was never knocked off.  Who knows, perhaps we can zone again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there was a patch download for VT files and a lot of Kunark zones.  No message in the download though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe they were re-patching the seb gems.<br />
<br />
Lol, maybe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, the download finished and there was no patch message. In game for a few minutes and I didn't notice anything. I hadn't been on the test server or messed with any files so who knows. Maybe it was just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's possible to log into this game and not get a few files to patch?<br />
<br />
When did that **** start?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only 2 files I downloaded were EQgame.exe_delta and testeqgame.exe_delta.  Hopefully this fixes that damned bug that I've been getting lately that causes crash and reboot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, my patcher says ive got 2.5 hours of downloads to do. Fudge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sethrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, something is up.  I just clicked on the patcher here at work to see what was going on and it started with a download and is still in process.  So far, in addition to .txt and .dll files some files on Fear have been downloaded.  My pathcer only shows it as a 4 minute patch.</div></div><hr />

I got completely different files when I patched today, so far the only thing I have seen is that my previous working target indicator thingy doesnt work now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sethrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, it didn't even last that long.  It downloaded new .txt files for all the LDON zones and then that was it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ever since I came back to EQ (in August 03) Ive needed to get the updated Velious graphics files...but everytime it says &quot;download exceeds allowable amount&quot; or something like that.  <br />

Anyways, today it downloaded all of those files.  weird</div></div><hr />

Odd... maybe it is just me on those files but I did run EQ yesterday afternoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">snap, i have identical problems but with the kunark files. I reinstalled EQ a number of times to stop the damn dragons in SS and WW being human models, and i managed it eventually. Im currently downloading ALL zone files from Originial Everquest (so far). Hope this fixes all my zone problems with broken models :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Main &amp; Test patchers, eqtext.txt, credits.txt, eqmain.dll, eqfeart.15.pak here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">lastnight when I went to log in it started patching for me too. it was about a 1h 45min patch, it was patching old kunark and velious zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I patched same files as Wodon... took me less than 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I think my thing was what Snapdragon said here. I had forgotten about that message everytime. I do wonder though why all of the sudden something changed that we now get all that info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I patched computer last night.  Downloaded a ton of files.  One computer I didnt patch last night, I did this morning.  Way different, hardly any files patched at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Supposedly they are updating old world s3d files and allowing us to download them a few at a time to no upset people with slow connections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Word in my guild was they also patched the vendor in Thurg who sells the velium tempers, so that he'll quit giving them away for free. I haven't gone and tested, personally, though.<br />

<br />
The news with regards to these 30 hour (plus) downloads for some of you is found here:  Everquest Tech Forum Thread (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/048298.html) <br />
<br />
Apparently by checking all the expansions (owned or not) under Advanced Options in your patcher, you will download all the files without the &quot;cap&quot; that existed in the past.<br />
<br />
Cancel your patcher and uncheck the boxes if you Do Not wish to download all these files.<br />
<br />
On an interesting side note, you can now copy the EverQuest.exe by itself into an empty folder, run the patcher and download ALL the files for all expansions... a nice emergency tool if your disks are ruined or lost.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wonder if you guys can help me out on a (vaguely) related topic...<br />
<br />
Every time my patcher needs to download files, it crashes once finished, and i have to restart the application to actually get into game... Annoying, certainly, but not terminal. Any thoughts? I certainly don't want to have to do a full re-install, so if that's the only cure, I'll have to live with it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks for the info Tehya.</div></div><hr />
