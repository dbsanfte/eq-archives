<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been looking for a comparison about the 4 races being and shaman.<br />
<br />
Can we open a discussion here or is there a website that has already done this comparison ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Theres not really much in the way of difference, other then looks.  The meager stat difference is... well, meager, and largely meaningless.<br />
<br />
And only 3 races can be shaman - Tauren, Troll, and Orc. <br />
<br />
But, like I said, no real difference other then appearance.  <br />
<br />
Tauren have slightly more str and stamina, trolls have higher int and agility, orcs are fairly average.  But it's only a 3-4 point difference.<br />
<br />
~Detton/Gryphon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But, like I said, no real difference other then appearance.  <br />
~Detton/Gryphon<br />
<br />
Well there is 1 major difference. Tauren get plainsrunning while orc and troll shamans can own a mount</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Race is almost utterly irrelevant with regards to the difference that it makes for starting stats, as well as progression of stats from levelling.  The only 2 points are, as mentioned Tauren have plainsrunning and Orcs and Trolls can get mounts (specifically regarding Shaman races).  The other is racial abilities which have not even been fully implemented yet.  IMO you will want to wait to see what those are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea racial abilities will hopefully be implemented soon, Ive read posts that they are being worked on slowly so when they are implemented stuff doesnt go out of balance.<br />
<br />
Trolls will most likely get regen :) hopefully!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Other racial abilities are for the undead:  They cannot be feared and can stay under water indefinitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Arent Night Elves resistant to nature magic and also have a shadowmeld(?) ability (sorry I cant remember the exact name)</div></div><hr />
