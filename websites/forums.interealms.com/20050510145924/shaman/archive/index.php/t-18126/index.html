<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Robby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi my friends :-)<br />
<br />
i have a question about the 12 Rathe Conzil Members:<br />
<br />
6 of them are mezzed all the time......that is mostly no Problem.<br />
<br />
but the other 6 tank Moppels can not hold at 1-2% HP :-(<br />
<br />
we pull them solo and tank them some minutes, but then somme get a HP rush up to 15% in one or two ticks, why ?.......whats happen ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm, can't remember that the TM mobs regen that fast. Only if no one is on the mobs agro list then they regen that fast. As long as they are tank mezzed the problem should be NOT to kill them and to keep agro on tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you have aggro, just punch and and taunt them. We do that all the time when tankmezzing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mez has a built in mem-blur component.  If you're talking about the mezzed mobs then they can and will regen.<br />
<br />
But looks like you're talking about the tanked mobs?  In that case no clue at all, other to say that on lowbie twinks I've had mobs eventually deaggro if I do nothing but let them beat on me (for &gt; 15 mins).  Maybe something similar is happening here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Robby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hi,<br />
<br />
thks for ur replays :-)<br />
<br />
i am talking about tankmops.....the Mezzmopps worked fine all times.<br />
<br />
some we can hold fine......but mostly one or two will have this HP rush and i dont see what happens :-( .....will they take HPs from the water ? because one we pushed into water for one minute <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">maybe someone is mem blurring them?<br />
no clue, they shouldn't be getting hp from the mud though <br />
never happened to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never seen that sudden surge of hps on the tank mez'd council members either.  Normally, our tanks will have to de-equip their weapons for periods of time to keep their targets at 1% until we're set to slaughter all 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive no idea why the tanked mobs would do that, the mezzed mobs do a bit thou.  The memblur component from Mez has to work which it doesnt alot of times and a tick has to go by b4 the mob is reagroed, its rare but over the time involved and number of mobs it happens.  There are some tricks thou that u can use to further minimize the probablity of this happening after that shouldnt have much to any problem of Hp regen on the mezzed ones.  No clue about why the tanked ones would thou sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your tanks are screwing up.  Basically, if summons were still announced zone wide, everyone's chat box would be spammed with summon's.  Somehow, the tankables ones are having their aggro list wiped which is when they regen as fast as the national deficit increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe they regen 3% a tic when not agro'd.  Grimrod is correct.  Somehow your tanks are screwing up.  I'd inspect them and find out if they are using some ass tank weapon with some kind of deagro proc.  Also, tell the tanks to keep them the heck out of the water!  :p<br />
