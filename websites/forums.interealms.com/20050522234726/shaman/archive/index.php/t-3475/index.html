Tankies in advance,<br />

<br />
You might notice that the people claiming it's gone are the same people selling the components.  Just like the people selling their fungi for 100k claim that they're no longer dropping on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think there would have to be some warning if there was gonna be a nerf to it.  I have spent ****ing ages getting the bits for it and am getting close now - I would be v v hacked off if they nerfed it just as I was about to complete it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of my guild mates told me it was getting nerfed, so I hurried up and finished it tonight, spent 9k on it and took 1 hour to find materials, very nice earring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Last NIght on Morell Thule the &quot;Curved Blade Mold&quot; vendor in both Shadowhaven and cabilis was not up.<br />
<br />
This is a component of the Sickle, of which I have smithed hundreds.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is related at all, but take it for what it's worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe someone killed it?  People have been known to do strange things . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, and check it.  VI not only made the quest with painstaking detail, taking the time to add dozens of new recipes and items, but they MODIFIED the end result into an earring for the masses!  <br />
<br />
So I really think that this isn't something that will get messed with.  FT1 is simply not that powerful.  It's just a very nice earring is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On Cazic thule the same vendors where missing in Freeport, Shadowhavem, Halas and Kaladim. They where up around 7pm pst when I first made a set of sickles but by about 10 or 11pm pst when i was going to make another they where gone.<br />
<br />
As for the nurf rebecca cabbage leaf was gone on the test server for a while but is back now and doing just fine. May have been the same wierd npc issue's we've been seeing on the live servers or they may have fixed something, not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not POTC related ...<br />
<br />
I saw some hints that a smithed product that required a weapon mold could be made for around 30 PP and sold back for around 130 PP.<br />
<br />
Some folks were exploiting and making 10k PP per RL hour on it, they took the vendors down to stop it.<br />
<br />
So not a POTC nerf-hint.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rumor. <br />
<br />
The quest is still active.<br />
<br />
The reason for some perma-poofed merchants however, is that someone discovered a new tradeskill sellback exploit-of-the month.  They will be up after the next patch, when the item's purchase price has been fixed, I am sure.<br />
<br />
Edit: Gah! too slow!  /em shakes his fist at Isazo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Definitely a rumor, she was up on test as of this morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mucho tanx fer da confirmation peeps.  Me likes seein rumours squished. :)</div></div><hr />
