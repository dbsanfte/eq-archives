<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if Velks is still good at 50? or are there better places to PL? <br />
Thanks, <br />

<br />
velks mobs seem to have more hit points than kunark equivalent, also the zem there isnt too special.<br />
<br />
id probably recomend poj over velks, but i have to admit that sometimes eq can be an emotional thing.....u either like a zone or u dont.  I have died there too many times to like the place!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at 50, your time would be better invested in the planes, or OoW, unless you are trying for specific items and gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 50, maybe you can solo rats at PoJ exit, or duo there, or get a group in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The higher in your 50's you get, the better Velks becomes for exp.  Early 50's group near the entrance for best results. However, you will catch a few trains there.  Left wall is safer once you can break the spawn. Better yet, if you run up the platform to the safe hall, you'll never get trained. Those spiders can be kinda tough in the early 50's though.<br />
<br />
At 55 you can solo pretty much any of the non-named spiders. I like the upper ledge camp the best. Just don't try to solo Crystal fang until you get up to 58 or 59. He's not that tough, be he always comes with four adds that make things kinda hectic. <br />
<br />
At 58 I like to duo with a 56 Ranger on the ledge.  Ranger Damage shields stack with Kilva's skin of flame potion for a 45 point damage shield.  You can do this solo as well, but having a partner keeps you from getting pushed around and interupted.<br />
<br />
Spiders don't run in velks, so what we do is pull 3 or four at a time. Ranger will flamelick each of them, then focus on the first. All the others beat themselves to death on his damage shield.  If he starts taking damage too fast I Tirgirs the lot of 'em, cast stoicism on the ranger, then start dropping rains on the spiders.<br />
<br />
Note, I only do this when a better hunting spot isn't available.  Optimum spot I found for the early 50's was Dulak Harbor on the Stormwave, Lady Dirulia, or Dandolak.</div></div><hr />
