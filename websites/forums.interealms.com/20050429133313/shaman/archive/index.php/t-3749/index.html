<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took a Player Window Mod I found and furthur modded it myself.  Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
http://users.erols.com/daftagious/pwindow.jpg[/img]<br />
<br />
The green bar is Pet HP, the Pinkish bar is Casting Time.  The orange hp number is your current hp, and the green is your max hp.  Everything else should be self-explanitory.<br />
<br />
You can download the file, Here (http://users.erols.com/daftagious/EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml). [i]Right-click and Save As.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to use this but don't know how:<br />
<br />
1) Must have Luclin installed with the new interface stuff downloaded AND enabled.<br />
<br />
2) Goto your &quot;EverQuest&quot; folder.  Go into the &quot;uifiles&quot; folder.  Make a new folder and call it whatever you want (I named mine &quot;mod&quot;).  Go into the &quot;default&quot; folder.  Copy the contents of that folder into your newly created folder (&quot;mod&quot; for me).<br />
<br />
3) Download my &quot;EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml&quot; file and place it into the &quot;mod&quot; folder (Click yes when asked if you want to overwrite the existing file).<br />
<br />
4) Go into your &quot;EverQuest&quot; folder again.  Find the file named &quot;UI_YourPlayerName_YourServerNumber.ini&quot;.  Replace &quot;YourPlayerName&quot; with your characters name and &quot;YourServerNumber&quot; with your server number (duh!).  For instance, I'd just find the file named &quot;UI_Jilariz_31.ini&quot;.<br />
<br />
5) Open it up and find the line &quot;UISkin=default&quot; and change the part after the = sign to the name of the folder you created.  Mine would look like this &quot;UISkin=mod&quot;.<br />
<br />
6) That's it, just run EverQuest as you normally would.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It probably can.  I'm still kinda new to messing around with it all, but it should be doable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only thing that kinda freaked me out was when I went to press &quot;i&quot; for inventory and saw all my vital stats had been zeroed out.  It's like they basically got cut and pasted onto the overlay box.<br />
Not a big deal of course but still just a matter of getting used to it :)</div></div><hr />

Seems to be a little something wrong with that 70% one... looks like 30% or so... mixed up type?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's the way it is.  /shrug.  It's a bug or Verant is just assbackwards sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">IRC The STA bar shows how fatigued you are.  Therefore at full STA you are at 0% and as you get more fatigued it will go up.  In the example you are 70% fatigued.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling boo boo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have one question, and as a shaman, I think it's important to all of us: <br />
<br />
Would it be possible to, in any box, anywhere on any screen, put a 'tic' timer? Something that counts down to the end of the current tic and the start of a new one. Whether in the form of a 6 5 4 3 2 1 countdown, a percentage left in the current tic or some kind of graphical bar. I'd just like to see this available.</div></div><hr />

I like it except for the inventory space.  its set for 3 wide, so nothing is where I expect it to be. the layout I go with is as follows.<br />
<br />
hoykeys in bottom left corner. chat 1 next to it, then my health and group health in middle, then chat 2 for raid stuff/loot commitee.<br />
target goes above my health, double length bar. Upper left is character info with spell gems on left edge middle. buff window goes in upper right corner, slightly off screen to increase viewing area.</div></div><hr />

Geddine's site has this player window mod that shows basically all stats as well as resists on the player window.  I've been looking at the files and it doesn't seem to be that hard to muss with the files to get exactly what you want.  It doesn't take a programmer to logically look at the code they use and modify some settings or remove parts that you don't want.<br />
<br />
Just remember to make a backup before you start mussing ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple to do...<br />
<br />
It's not all that hard to move things around.<br />
<br />
I'm expanding on what I had done previously... I am seriously liking this new UI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting how you had the Text of the Buffs you have on displayed in that window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kagbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Wow nice one on the Screenshot'd one Jilariz, anyway we could coerce you to post the files for that one? :D<br />
<br />
I'd love to use it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">yep.. would also be interested with the one with the tiny spell icons and the buff listing.<br />
<br />
nice job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">.Zip (http://users.erols.com/daftagious/mod2.zip) for the whole shebang.<br />
<br />
If you just want the Player Window (that whole thing on the right-hand side is the Player Window, from the top HP bar down to the bottom of the textual buff listing) and the tiny Buff Icon Window, just use these files:<br />
<br />
EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br />
EQUI_BuffWindow.xml<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to use the whole thing and you run a 1280x1024 resolution, I've included my UI_Jilariz_31.ini (change my name to your name and my server# to your server#).  If you don't run 1280x1024, you probably want to leave out the EQUI_ChatWindow.xml unless you know how to edit it and turn the borders back on (I have them turned off, but unfortunately to get rid of the queer look also renders the windows unsizeable).<br />
<br />
The orange mini bar on top of the Sta bar is the Pet HP bar.  The Percentage label next to it is for the Pet HP% (I figured there's not much use in knowing how much Stamina % you've used up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kagbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hurray!  Thanks Jilariz :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Excellent job.  However, am I the only one that noticed that (or had a problem with) when you move the mouse all the way over to the right of the screen, it disappears about a quarter of the way to the end?  You cannot physically click on anything over there, 'cause you seem to have no mouse.  Is this just with me, or is anyone else having the problem?<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, using this mod, according to my Inventory Screen ( I ), I am a level 6000 Shadowknight, named 12345, worshipping Mithaniel Marr.</div></div><hr />

whatever resolution you are using in eq make it one or 2 bigger or smaller that will fix the mouse thing.. has nothing to do with the mod. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Actually, just logging out and logging back in allowed me to move to the right, and move the player window (which I was previously unable to do)...everything's cool now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what is the blue bar that is directly underneath your Mana bar?  Casting time?<br />
<br />
And does pet health appear under your own health (like normal)?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

He made a compact melee player window with everything from the inv on it so I got him to make a mana/pet version.<br />

It is my favorite Player Mod thats my UI right now though (I didn't make it) can link you to the file if you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. Don't start yellin at me because of my low ac, I am an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Winsome, that's the mod I ended up using.  It's far and away the best, most comprehensive mod that I've seen.  The only thing I added to it was a window with smaller buff icons, showing the names of the buffs...there's nothing more aggravting than saying, &quot;I lost some buff...I don't know what it was, but it's gone now...&quot;  If I'm looking at the names all the time, they're bound to stick.<br />
<br />
Also Winsome, what resolution are you using in that pic?  I think I'm running at greater than 1024x768 (I don't remember offhand), and the only real problem I notice is a small main chat window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Winsome Where did you get that mod that is very nice I would like to use it hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Valrik, I use 1280x768, yes the small main chat window is annoying, bottom one is for melee. I might change my desktop settings and make it bigger later on. I got around to using those new icons when he made them in the one .zip<br />
<br />
Fieryfist its quartz.zip download it here http://webpages.charter.net/trelyrien/quartz.zip , once you open it I suggest you read the read me it can come with custom settings (already in the design poisition) and shows you how to change to caster/non caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Yep just found it after i read your post thanks for the link, cant wait to try it at home</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Yeah my guildmate spent a few days making that one.  It is very very nice.  He also didn't sleep for those few days hehe.  I see someone moved the pet stuff out of the bottom right-hand portion.  Don't see the point in that unless you don't know how to use the keyboard.  :p<br />
<br />
I changed it around a bit, got rid of the spell bar and am using the standard one (I switch spells out often and didn't like having to move the mouse that far from my Spellbook).  Also switched the Mana and Sta bars, and put the Casting bar at the bottom of the Mana bar.  Finally I stretched the main chat window up more.  Gonna give this UI a whirl tonight.</div></div><hr />
